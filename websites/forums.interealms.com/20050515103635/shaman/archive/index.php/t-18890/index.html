<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Malleable</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, i know.  You guys might be a bit biased.  But Ive asked at the necro forum, and its split about 50/50.<br />
<br />
Shaman get pet later, and its weaker.  Shamans get spells earlier and stronger.  BL has mana regen.  Both can tank I guess.  BL should be putting out more damage with melee.  Shaman is probably better at tanking.  Shaman is the better healer and buffer.<br />
<br />
Any comments from Shamen?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">BL are better at tanking, they get block and higher caps on other skills. <br />
<br />
The way things are going they are near the same level or supieror to shaman in just about everyway. The healing shouldn't matter much with necro lift taps. Personally I wouldn't see any reason to take a shaman over a BL with 2 necros.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Malleable</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Darkpaw,<br />
Thanks much for the reply.  I do like the fact that the Shaman gets spells much sooner, as they mean alot more.  But the BL has a very strong pet, and the ability to tank and throw out a decent amount of melee damage.<br />
Good hunting to u,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">beastlord, and don't look back, im being serious, as this new expansion goes, they own us, hands ...errr paws down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Takes a more levels to get really powerful, but I would say beastlord.  Get him a tash stick and he can slow just fine.  His heals won't be too great, but good enough with necro's around to lifetap and necro heal stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I haven't had the opportunity to group with many Necros, but I would think that tanking them wouldn't be as much of an issue with their pets &amp; our slow.<br />
<br />
Even though the Shaman might not contribute as much DPS as the Beastlord, I really think that the Beastlord wouldn't be able to get you out of a bad situation. A Shaman would be your get out of jail free card. Even though the Necros can heal themselves with Lifetaps, Shaman healing would be more beneficial when things go wrong - especially for healing pets. Also, even though a Beastlord can agro park mobs with their pet, it's certainly not as reliable as rooting them in place. We can also help decrease resists on most necro spells with Malo and the ID line, something a Beastlord can't do. Also keep in mind we can buff HP a lot better than a Beastlords. I'm sure a good Necro can appreciate having extra HP just as much as a good Shaman can. Beastlords are, IMO, a DPS class first and foremost. With 2 Necros, you've got DPS covered. What you want is someone that can keep things from getting unmanagable. A Shaman does an excellent job of doing this.<br />
<br />
There's a lot of jealousy around here for Beastlords at the moment, I try to ignore it. Shaman offer entirely too many tools to be ignored and brushed aside so easily.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Necro's can mez, FD, and they heal pretty well.  They don't really need any of those services aside from slow and dps stacking.  A cleric might be the best addition for stuns, pacify pulling and healing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tallanas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well, I have often duo'd highly successfully with a necro (level 65 on both). <br />
<br />
A BL could not have done what I did, but maybe they would make an equally effective pair.<br />
<br />
But a necro covers a shaman's weakness and vice versa. Damage and snare versus heals and buffs.<br />
<br />
At low levels a shaman can tank just fine. At high levels a necro pet can do the same. Once you are at 65 anything in the planes that's worth it generally needs a proper plate tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Some of the best exp groups I've ever been in were tactics or BoT groups with a BL as the tank.<br />
<br />
I get fairly beat up tanking in PoV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Fozy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I dunno, if your planning on playing your trio in the planes and mainly your trio I would go with shaman.  Your BL won't do you a lot of good when you don't have the healing power to keep him alive for tanking.  Not to mention shamans have decent dots for kiting and root dotting.   Having duoed with a good necro friend I would say I can do more with a necro and feel I would be more beneficial(if you can really be beneficial to a necro) than a beastlord would be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>kenton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Shaman. Beastlords are a great class but the shaman here often overinflate the beastlord classes power in their bitterness about something. A beastlord and necro heals won't cut it, unless you want to greatly limit your hunting options, or are going to aggro kite everything. <br />
<br />
Now for pure fun, beastlords are great, they get to play with weapons a lot and have utility, but in no way are they better than shamans. I solo both classes in droga or other places. I am in much more control of my surroundings or group as a shaman, in bad situations there isn't much a beastlords gonna do when the sheet hits the fan but cast flash of light or heal his pet and try to camp out, hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Malleable</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Darn.  I thought I had everything figured out.  I'm getting the same kind of split I did at the necro site.  You guys are no help at all! :)<br />
<br />
Since Im three boxing, I want them to be easily controllable.<br />
<br />
If I go BL, he will lead the other two.  Basically BL and necros pull with spells.  Pets engage.  BL engages.  Necros drop DOTS/Darkness/Fear.  Three pets and BL melee down or follow fear kiting.  Everyone stays together, unless we in a relatively safe area and the necros then med.<br />
<br />
<br />
If I go Shaman.  He will again lead.  We send in pets.  Cast Darkness, Malo, Fear, and a couple DOTs, and med.  I could drop up to 10 DOTs on a MOB, and with Malo, I would hope theyd stick.  So the Mob would drop fast with all that and pets melee.  If I cant fear kite, then I guess Shaman could tank a bit, which would probably be good for keeping up defense and melee anyways.<br />
<br />
On one hand I really want the Shaman, since he gets his spells MUCH earlier.  He can actually heal, which I dont see the BL being able to do if my guy is getting wailed on.  But having an intelligent tank also sounds nice.  AND the BL warder should really be able to lay out some damage.  <br />
<br />
With shaman.  I probably dont have to engage as much.  I can hang back with the necros, and cast/heal.  With the BL, I would think I need to be up there, and then Im leaving the necros back further which makes me leary.  <br />
<br />
Since Im more of a caster than tank, think Ill change back to Shaman.<br />
<br />
Thanks much guys.<br />
Further comments appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">nuke your necros and do ranger/paladin/shaman. There is nothing that trio cannot do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Malleable</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Since Im three boxing, I need no more than one melee.  No way to keep all of them on target.  Probably nice for a normal threesome.<br />
Send in pets.  Malo, DOT, Fear, med, collect loot, repeat.  The more I think about it, the Shaman is probably the better bet when three boxing.  For a duo, I would go BL/Necro and fear kite around.  But as a trio, with the pets, its probably better to just stick to casting at a distance.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If you are 3 boxing, you probably can't Canni too often. A Shaman that can't Canni much, is inferior to a Beastlord even in that setup.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">It isn't going to be efficient to have the BL tank with necro healing if you get to places worth good xp at 65.  You will want to aggro kite.  It would be damn hard to aggro kite with a necro on one box while controlling a beastlord chasing the mob around beating its backside on another.  If you lose the beasties melee, you lose too much.<br />
<br />
I'd go necro-necro-shaman.  Malos/inia makes everything much easier for the necro, and quiesc/tnargs help out in tight spots where pets need to tank or one of the necros needs to ToM tank for a while to get things under control.  <br />
<br />
Malos also makes necro charming more feasible, if you are into that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">beastlord, why??<br />
Because we like pudding more!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>csivils</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">This may hurt more than it helps, but I think you should reconsider the double necro thing.<br />
<br />
The second necro adds so much less than the first one does.<br />
<br />
I only have 2 accounts, but if I had 3... here are the things I would look for.<br />
<br />
1.  You want classes that add well to each other<br />
2.  You want classes that are easy to play, max of one meele <br />
3.  You want to have as many options open as possible<br />
<br />
Using a necro as a starting point, here are some possible group arrangements.  I'd recommend you look at each one and see what sounds interesting to you.<br />
<br />
Since your torn between Shaman/BL, its obvious you want a slower.  The  4 possibilities for slower are bard, BL, shaman and enchanter.<br />
<br />
Bards are very difficult to 2box, I can't imagine trying to 3box.  Great class, but probabbly not suited for this.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enchanters are a strong class, but it would mean that the third slot would need to be some type of healing.  There is a large overlap with shaman, so your necro/chanter/? choices would be down to cleric, paladin and druid.  The necro/chanter/cleric combo is strong, but more so in the later stages.  I'm not sure its a strong startup combo.  The other two combo's don't grab my attention, but they might be something you want to play.<br />
<br />
<br />
With a shaman slower, you have a slower and healer but chances are that the last choice should help with the shamans lack of dps.  Wiz is a possibility, but I'm not crazy about that since it doesn't add much to the other classes.  Warrior/Monk goes well with the shaman, but since you have a necro to FD pull its again not a lot.  IMO the best 3rd choice with a shaman would be a mage.  They have a strong pet and all kinds of summoned utility items.<br />
<br />
<br />
To be honest, even though I'm a shaman player I think the two beastlord combos are actually the funnest (to me) looking.  With beastlord as the slower, there are 3 factors to consider.<br />
* You don't have a &quot;player&quot; healer (you have plenty of pet heals)<br />
* You don't have magic debuff capabilities<br />
* You would have your single meele class and need a caster for the third slot<br />
<br />
Necro/BL/Mage<br />
This can be a pet centric group, with the BL slowing.  The mage can debuff magic resistance which helps with landing slows and for necro undead charming.  The main drawback is the lack of a big heal to take on heavy hitters.<br />
<br />
Necro/BL/Druid<br />
Until the druid gets direcharm, this is less pet intensive than the other groups.  The BL/Druid is a great combo and the necro adds a lot of dps on top of that.  This combo isn't has high a dps as the necro/mage/bl, but it has ITU, fd, track, ports, big heals, good mana regen, all kinds of utility along with dps.  <br />
<br />
If I was going to 3box from scratch, the last combo (necro/bl/druid) is the one I think I'd go with.  <br />

If all is going good IMO BL is superior but when the **** hits the fan then the shaman will be better he can heal a lot better, he can debuff (for charming and hard to slow mobs)..</div></div><hr />
