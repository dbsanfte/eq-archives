<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Decreasing effective casting level...does that just factor into fizzle/channel rates, or would it prevent you from casting any spell above level 14 (Assuming you were 65)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Makes your spell casting skill as if u were 50 levels lower so pretty much all the high level spells will fizzle like nuts making your mana go down faster.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>bakkal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Rabid Wrulon in HOH cast this on our group.  red at 65 if I remember right.  Had group of 5. Sham/Clr/War/mage/wiz. Wasn't all that difficult of a fight. Easily slowed, most things landed.   GRC cured the curse.<br />
<br />
Just as you zone in is a place some stuff can get stuck. This one appeared to get stuck from somewhere in the zone (probably HOH Trial).  <br />
<br />
After he died 2 dark blue to 64 mini dogs popped. Easily SLowed easily killed.<br />

Actually thats not what the rabid wrulon are casting, I forget the exact name but its merely a castling level debuff, it has no DOT associated with it.</div></div><hr />

When I get an Ice icon in my buff window and I put my cursor over it, and it says &quot;Grip of Mental Reality&quot; And I watch my mana bar go away until I cast GRC, that's not what they're doing?<br />

Odd, thats absolutely NOT what they were casting last time I had to put up with the annoyances known as rabid wrulons. I'll have to go fart around in HoH later and see if I can't find one to cast on me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Heimdall Azureguardian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yeah, I know its a priority on my list of things to do today to find some mob to cast THAT on me :p</div></div><hr />

Call it deadly curiosity, I'm 100% certain that is not the spell they were casting last time I ran into one, I made a point of checking Lucy when the spell (I've forgotten the name I'm afraid) was cast because I hadn't seen it previously. If they're casting the 'grip of mental reality' its either a bug (which seems likely, thats a rather harsh spell for something as pathetic as a rabid wrulon) or they're a hell of a lot tougher than I recall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>bakkal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">We thought it was screwed up too. Figured something would drop off of him even if quest related. Hit in the 700+ range, easily slowed.<br />
<br />
I forget the other AE we encountered. Recuso Degenerate cast it? It dropped AC by 300 and atk by 300 I _think_ <br />
<br />
Positive on the wrulon though. Bug or not, it's the only dose of that spell I've gotten so far :0<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jargas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The Rabid Wrulan cast Feeblemind I think, same as THO AE. <br />
Maybe it's been changed to this spell now though.</div></div><hr />
