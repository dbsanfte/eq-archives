<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone hunted the Shimmering Geonids for the 8th shawl?<br />
<br />
I got my 7th on Saturday, and am nearly ready to do the combines for the 8th. I lack the no-drop gems that drop off of the Shimmering Geonids.<br />
<br />
I have been told they have insane FR/CR/PR/DR, but ok MR. So they can be slowed, and epic'd.... but not much else.<br />
<br />
Did anyone try maloing them? Does that help enough? Or Malo + Insidious Decay? Soloing them without pox/bane sounds like a boring long fight.<br />
<br />
Any words of advice?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Forty-SoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's been a while since I did this but, based on what I remember, JBB will land but not very well.  Epic will land as well as Slow.  Most damage will be from dogdog unless you want to melee.  I don't recall ever getting a poison or disease dot on them.  Again, it's been a while and it is possible they were changed, I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>jador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">WL Geonid had patched, they have mad Fire, Cold, Poison, Disease resists, JBB nuke for half, or less dmg, even they are Malosinied, they keep resist my poison and disease dot like The Grey Shissar and Skeletons.  <br />
All you can do is Slow, Epic dot, Doggy and Melee it down.  <br />
Bring a Melee friend will be a good idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Celestin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">An alternate suggestion...<br />
<br />
&quot;Introduce&quot; the goo's to the Goenids - and stay the H**L back.<br />
<br />
Keep the goo to Goenid ratio around 4-5 to 1 if you can.<br />
<br />
Kill the Shimmerings that dain to grace you with their presence.  No exp for the regular goenids - but they're basically shaman immune to they are no good to us anyway.<br />
<br />
Your other best strategy is to bring as many high level necro friends as you can find... :)<br />
