Sweatin' in the sun <br />
Felt like a million <br />
Felt like number one <br />

I'd never felt that strong <br />
Like a rock <br />
  <br />
I was eighteen <br />
Didn't have a care <br />
Working for peanuts <br />
Not a dime to spare <br />
But I was lean and <br />
Solid everywhere <br />
Like a rock <br />
  <br />
My hands were steady <br />
My eyes were clear and bright <br />
My walk had purpose <br />
My steps were quick and light <br />
And I held firmly <br />
To what I felt was right <br />
Like a rock <br />
  <br />
Like a rock, I was strong as I could be <br />
Like a rock, nothin' ever got to me <br />
Like a rock, I was something to see <br />
Like a rock <br />
  <br />
And I stood arrow straight <br />
Unencumbered by the weight <br />
Of all these hustlers and their schemes <br />
I stood proud, I stood tall <br />
High above it all <br />

Twenty years now <br />
Where'd they go? <br />
twenty years <br />
I don't know <br />
sit and I wonder sometimes <br />
Where they've gone <br />

And sometimes late at night <br />
When I'm bathed in the firelight <br />
The moon comes callin' a ghostly white <br />
And I recall <br />
recall <br />
  <br />
Like a rock. standin' arrow straight <br />
Like a rock, chargin' from the gate <br />
Like a rock, carryin' the weight <br />
Like a rock <br />
  <br />
Lihe a rock, the sun upon my skin <br />
Like a rock, hard against the wind <br />
Like a rock, I see myself again <br />

And what's on the other side?<br />
Rainbows are visions, but only illusions,<br />
And rainbows have nothing to hide.<br />
So we've been told and some choose to believe it<br />
I know they're wrong, wait and see.<br />
<br />
Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection,<br />
The lovers, the dreamers and me.<br />

Who said that every wish would be heard and answered<br />
When wished on the morning star?<br />
Somebody thought of that, and someone believed it,<br />
And look what it's done so far.<br />
What's so amazing that keeps us stargazing<br />
And what do we think we might see?<br />
<br />
Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection,<br />
The lovers, the dreamers, and me.<br />
<br />
All of us under its spell,<br />
We know that it's probably magic...<br />
<br />
Have you been half asleep? And have you heard voices?<br />
I've heard them calling my name.<br />
Is this the sweet sound that calls the young sailors?<br />
The voice might be one and the same<br />
I've heard it too many times to ignore it<br />
It's something that I'm s'posed to be...<br />

Great show.  :D<br />

Sittin' on the beach<br />
The island king of love<br />
Deep in fijian seas<br />
Deep in some blissful dream<br />
Where the goddess finally sleeps<br />
In the lap of her lover<br />
Subdued in all her rage<br />
And I am aglow with the taste<br />
Of the demons driven out<br />
And happily replaced <br />
With the presence of real love<br />

I wanna dance with you<br />
I see a world where people live and die with grace<br />
The karmic ocean dried up and leave no trace<br />

I see a sky full of the stars that change our minds<br />
And lead us back to a world we would not face<br />

The stillness in your eyes<br />
Convinces me that I <br />
I don't know a thing <br />
And I been around the world and I've<br />
Tasted all the wines<br />
A half a billion times<br />
Came sickened to your shores <br />
You show me what this life is for<br />

Full of so much pain and rage<br />
You know we got to find a way to let it go<br />
<br />
Sittin' on the beach<br />
The island king of love<br />
Deep in fijian seas<br />
Deep in the heart of it all<br />
Where the goddess finally sleeps<br />
After eons of war and lifetimes<br />
She smilin' and free, nothin' left<br />
But a cracking voice and a song, oh lord<br />
<br />
I wanna dance with you<br />
I see a world where people live and die with grace<br />
The karmic ocean dried up and leave no trace<br />
I wanna dance with you<br />
I see a sky full of the stars that change our minds<br />
And lead us back to a world we would not face<br />

<br />
Hands on a window pane<br />
Watching some children laugh and play<br />
They're running in circles<br />
With candy canes and French braids<br />
Inspired to question<br />
What makes us grown-ups anyway?<br />
Let's search for the moment<br />
When youth betrayed itself to age<br />
So let the children play Inside your heart always<br />
And death you will defy<br />
'Cause your youth will never die<br />
In searching for substance<br />
We're clouded by struggle's haze<br />
Remember the meaning<br />
Of playing out in the rain<br />
We swim in the fountain<br />
Of youth's timeless maze<br />
If you drink the water<br />
Your youth will never fade<br />
Never die I won't let go of that youthful soul<br />
Despite body and mind my youth will never die<br />

Oh, I don't know.<br />
Well, rumor around town says you think you might be heading down to the shore.<br />
Uh, yeah, I think I'm goin' down to the shore.<br />
Whatcha gonna do down there?<br />
Uh, I don't know, play some video games, buy some Def Leppard t-shirts.<br />
Hey, don't forget to get your Motley Crue t-shirt, y'know, all proceeds go to get their lead singer out of jail.<br />
Uh huh.<br />
Hey, you gonna check out the Sandbar while you're there?<br />
Uh, what's the Sandbar?<br />
Oh, it's this place that lets sixteen year-old kids drink.<br />
Oh, cool.<br />
Y'know who's gonna be there?<br />
Uh, who?<br />
My favorite cover band, Crystal ****.<br />
Oh.<br />
Yeah, they do a Doors show, you'd be really impressed, in fact, it goes a little like this: <br />
<br />
Love me two times baby<br />
Love me twice today<br />
Love me two times girl<br />
Cause I got AIDS<br />
Love me two times baby, once for tomorrow, once cause I got AIDS <br />
<br />
Wow, Pretty good Jim Morrison impersonation there.<br />
Yeah, I hope those guys have a good sense of humor and don't take us to court.<br />
Uh, what's the court?<br />
Never mind that,<br />
Oh, you mean like the People's Court?<br />
Well, that's another story; the important thing here is you gotta ask me how I'm gonna get down to the shore.<br />
Uh, how you gonna get down to the shore?<br />
Funny you should ask, I've got a car now.<br />
Oh wow, how'd you get a car?<br />
Oh my parents drove it up here from the Bahamas.<br />
You're kidding!<br />
I must be, the Bahamas are islands, okay, the important thing now, is that you ask me what kind of car I have.<br />
Uh, what kinda car do ya' got?<br />

I like debating opinions with this group of people, so leaving is not an option I'd consider. I highly doubt Sunmoon would give us one and wisely so, because when you throw religion in, it would get pretty brutal, but it's an idea I'm tossing out there.<br />
<br />
Hmmmm, maybe a unmoderated religion board?</div></div><hr />

<br />
when you hear the way the others talk it makes you wonder what they bothered for <br />
when you see the way opinion swings <br />
it makes you strive strive strive for greater things <br />
I wasn't born to be good enough for you <br />
I am here to be nobody's fool <br />
when you see the way that loose lips talk<br />
it makes you cry cry cry for it all to stop <br />
I would like to invite you to my mother's house <br />
to my bedroom <br />
to play those old records we know all the words to <br />
and I would like you <br />
to kiss me to crush me to lick me <br />
till I beg you to stop till you drive me crazy <br />

<br />
Fire in the Glen<br />
-Traditional, performed by Andy M Stewart<br />
<br />
The old days have gone that had use for a man,<br />
Who supported his lairdship, protecting his land.<br />
Who in times of unrest, he would have died for his lord,<br />
Now the soldiers of England have taken his broad sword.<br />
<br />
And there's fire in the glen, fire in the glen,<br />
But no fire in the eyes of our Highland men<br />
<br />
And the laird has a smile for the makers of graves,<br />
For the builders of empires and the keepers of slaves.<br />
For he kept his great home losing nothing but pride,<br />
Though his kinsmen lay huddled along the shoreside.<br />
<br />
And there's fire in the glen, fire in the glen,<br />
But no fire in the eyes of our Highland men.<br />
<br />
So beware of their banners and the general's lies,<br />
There's no glory for the poor man, no glittering prize.<br />
For we gave all we had, now our homes they fall down,<br />
And I cry out &quot;Republic&quot; and allegiance to no crown.<br />
<br />
And there's fire in the glen, fire in the glen,<br />
But no fire in the eyes of our Highland men.<br />
<br />
The old days have gone that had use for a man<br />
Who supported his lairdship, protecting his land<br />
Who in times of unrest, he would have died for his lord,<br />
Now the soldiers of England have taken his broad sword.<br />
<br />
And there's fire in the glen, fire in the glen,<br />
But no fire in the eyes of our Highland men.<br />
<br />
And there's fire in the glen, fire in the glen,<br />
But no fire in the eyes of our Highland men.<br />

No Man's Land<br />
Eric Bogle (Scots singer/songwriter living in Australia)<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, how'd you do, Private Willie McBride,<br />
D'you mind if I sit down down here by your graveside?<br />
I'll rest for awhile in the warm summer sun,<br />
Been walking all day, Lord, and I'm nearly done.<br />
I see by your gravestone you were only nineteen<br />
When you joined the glorious fallen in 1916,<br />
I hope you died quick and I hope you died &quot;clean,&quot;<br />
Or, Willie McBride, was it slow and obscene? <br />
<br />
  Did they beat the drum slowly, did they sound the fife lowly?<br />
  Did the rifles fire o'er ye as they lowered ye down?<br />
  Did the bugles sing &quot;The Last Post&quot; in chorus?<br />
  Did the pipes play the &quot;Floors O' The Forest&quot;?<br />
<br />
And did you leave a wife or a sweetheart behind<br />
In some faithful heart is your memory enshrined?<br />
And, though you died back in 1916,<br />
To that loyal heart are you forever nineteen?<br />
Or are you a stranger, without even a name,<br />
Forever enshrined behind some glass pane,<br />
In an old photograph, torn and tattered and stained,<br />
And fading to yellow in a brown leather frame?<br />
<br />
  Did they beat the drum slowly, did they sound the fife lowly?<br />
  Did the rifles fire o'er ye as they lowered ye down?<br />
  Did the bugles sing &quot;The Last Post&quot; in chorus?<br />
  Did the pipes play the &quot;Floors O' The Forest&quot;?<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, the sun's shining down on these green fields of France;<br />
The warm wind blows gently, the red poppies dance.<br />
The trenches have vanished long under the plow;<br />
No gas and no barbed wire, no guns firing now.<br />
But here in this graveyard it's still No Man's Land;<br />
The countless white crosses in mute witness stand<br />
To man's blind indifference to his fellow man.<br />
And a whole generation who were butchered and damned.<br />
<br />
  Did they beat the drum slowly, did they sound the fife lowly?<br />
  Did the rifles fire o'er ye as they lowered ye down?<br />
  Did the bugles sing &quot;The Last Post&quot; in chorus?<br />
  Did the pipes play the &quot;Floors O' The Forest&quot;?<br />
<br />
And I can't help but wonder now, Willie McBride,<br />
Do all those who lie here know why they died?<br />
Did you really believe them when they told you &quot;the cause?&quot;<br />
Did you really believe that this war would end wars?<br />
Well the suffering, the sorrow, the glory, the shame,<br />
The killing, the dying, it was all done in vain,<br />
For Willie McBride, it's all happened again,<br />
And again, and again, and again, and again.<br />
<br />
  Did they beat the drum slowly, did they sound the fife lowly?<br />
  Did the rifles fire o'er ye as they lowered ye down?<br />
  Did the bugles sing &quot;The Last Post&quot; in chorus?<br />
  Did the pipes play the &quot;Floors O' The Forest&quot;?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nitefox</div><div class="date">04-29-2002, 06:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Midnight Cry - Best sung by an artist name of Micheal English.  He sang it with the Brooklyn Tabernachle(sp?) Choir and I get goosebumps everytime I hear it.  You can just hear the conviction in this guys voice as he sings it.  I'll have to post a link to the MP3 if I can figure out how.  <br />
<br />
Gold City is another group that sings it.  They are a more traditional gospel quaretet.  <br />
<br />
Powerful song.<br />
<br />
MIDNIGHT CRY<br />
<br />
VERSE 1:<br />
<br />
I HEAR  THE SOUND <br />
<br />
OF A MIGHTY  RUSHING WIND <br />
<br />
AND  IT’S CLOSER  NOW <br />
<br />
THAN IT’S EVER  BEEN <br />
<br />
I CAN  ALMOST  HEAR  THE TRUMPET <br />
<br />
AND GRABIEL SOUND THE CHORD <br />
<br />
AT THE MIDNIGHT  CRY  WE’LL BR GOING HOME.<br />
<br />
CHORUS :<br />
<br />
WHEN JESUS  STEPS OUT <br />
<br />
ON A CLOUD  TO CALL  HIS CHILDREN <br />
<br />
THE DEAD  IN CHRIST  SHALL RISE <br />
<br />
TO MEET HIM  IN THE AIR <br />
<br />
AND THEN  THOSE  THAT REMAIN <br />
<br />
WILL BE QUICKLY  CHANGED <br />
<br />
AT THE MIDNIGHT  CRY <br />
<br />
WHEN JESUS  COMES  AGAIN.<br />
<br />
VERSE 2:<br />
<br />
I  LOOK AROUND ME <br />
<br />
I SEE  PROPHECIES FULL FILLING <br />
<br />
AND SIGNS  OF THE TIMES <br />
<br />
THEY’RE APPEARING  EVERYWHERE <br />
<br />
I CAN ALMOST  HEAR  THE FATHER <br />
<br />
AS HE SAYS <br />
<br />
“SON  GO GET  YOUR CHILDREN.” <br />
<br />
AT THE MIDNIGHT  CRY <br />
<br />
THE BRIDE  OF CHRIST  WILL RISE.<br />

Blasphemous Rumours<br />
<br />
&quot;Girl of sixteen, whole life ahead of her<br />
Slashed her wrists, bored with life<br />
Didn't succeed, thank the Lord<br />
For small mercies<br />
<br />
Fighting back the tears, mother reads the note again<br />
Sixteen candles burn in her mind<br />
She takes the blame, it's always the same<br />
She goes down on her knees and prays<br />
<br />
I don't want to start any blasphemous rumours<br />
But I think that God's got a sick sense of humor<br />
And when I die I expect to find Him laughing<br />
<br />
Girl of eighteen, fell in love with everything<br />
Found new life in Jesus Christ<br />
Hit by a car, ended up<br />
On a life support machine<br />
<br />
Summer's day, as she passed away<br />
Birds were singing in the summer sky<br />
Then came the rain, and once again<br />
A tear fell from her mother's eye<br />
<br />
I don't want to start any blasphemous rumours<br />
But I think that God's got a sick sense of humor<br />
And when I die I expect to find Him laughing&quot;<br />

 Just about the entire song &quot;If&quot; by Janet Jackson <br />
<br />
Janet Jackson can't take credit for the meaning of the song.  She sings it someone else wrote.  Sorry for being anal but I have this serious hangup with musicians that don't write their own music.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Imagine there's no heaven<br />
It's easy if you try<br />
No hell below us<br />
Above us only sky<br />
Imagine all the people<br />
Living for today... <br />
<br />
Imagine there's no countries<br />
It isn't hard to do<br />
Nothing to kill or die for<br />
And no religion too<br />
Imagine all the people<br />
Living life in peace... <br />
<br />
You may say I'm a dreamer<br />
But I'm not the only one<br />
I hope someday you'll join us<br />
And the world will be as one <br />

Imagine no possessions<br />
I wonder if you can<br />
No need for greed or hunger<br />
A brotherhood of man<br />
Imagine all the people<br />
Sharing all the world... <br />
<br />
You may say I'm a dreamer<br />
But I'm not the only one<br />
I hope someday you'll join us<br />

I, you know I never go out<br />

I Can Only Imagine<br />
Words and Music by Bart Millard<br />
<br />
Verse:<br />
I can only imagine, What it will be like<br />
When I walk, By your side<br />
I can only imagine, What my eyes will see<br />
When your face, Is before me<br />
I can only imagine<br />
<br />
Chorus:<br />
Surrounded by Your glory, what will my heart feel<br />
Will I dance for you Jesus or in awe of you be still<br />
Will I stand in your presence or to my knees will I fall<br />
Will I sing hallelujah, will I be able to speak at all<br />
I can only imagine<br />
<br />
Verse:<br />
I can only imagine, When that day comes<br />
And I find myself, Standing in the Son<br />
I can only imagine, When all I will do<br />
Is forever, Forever worship You<br />

If thats true then I stand corrected.  However if you go to CDNow this is the song info.<br />
<br />
6. If Harris/J/L 4:31<br />
 <br />
Maybe the J is for Jackson but you would think that the writer of the lyrics would put their full name there.  To me it doesn't make a difference if they wrote just the lyrics or not.  If you didn't write the song (Music, Lyrics) and play the instruments on it you should get the hell off the stage.  (Just my personal Opinion)<br />
<br />
And to stay on topic from an album that I just listened to that I haven't in a long time.<br />
