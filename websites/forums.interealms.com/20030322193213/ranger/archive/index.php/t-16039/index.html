<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Morgani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok did bandits in JP till 51 and they are starting to get L.blue. <br />
<br />
I do fine at the rockhoppers but seems people keep kililng the main RH and the tribe is always up.<br />
<br />
Im looking for a place I can solo non-stop with out looking for mobs.  Hopefully a outdoor zone (snare/fear).   I have considered going to Sol B but as I said i like outdoors. <br />
<br />
Gnolls in JP hit to hard and cant be fear kited.  Griffions are to far between (unless there is a spot where they spawn, is there?)<br />
<br />
Im just looking for a place with static spawns to i can level to 55 asap.  I do have swarmcaller for slow but perfer not depend on it.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions are welcomed, and thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Medain Valacirca</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Fear-Kiting dries up rapidly in the 50+ levels.Icefang hut in EW will get you to 52 killing rhino's,mammoths,and walrus's.Grind it out on lt. blues there and you can get to 53.There are animals in Western Wastes but you would have to be 55+ and have decent CoV faction to attempt that with any success.<br />
<br />
If its Fearkiting you want to do its Jaggedpine,Dawnshroud,or Scarlet Desert.May want to check track in Mons Letalis too now that I think about it.<br />
<br />
I hesitate to mention it but Karnors is still a strong lfg zone for low 50s.Never hurts to keep the grouping skills fresh and up to date.And at 53 you could start going to  Maidens Eye or other mid 50s lfg zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Blythar Jones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You did not mention all the other blue animals in JP.  While Griffons are sometimes hard to come buy you will have no problem finding panthers and annacondas.  You take a very small faction hit which if you want to you can fix doing a few more poachers or gnolls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Naurek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The Anacondas in Jagged Pine actually don't have a faction hit. They seem to be higher than the griffons and are all db at 55 (some griffons are lb now). At 51 the griffons are easier since they have less hit points, and I slowly switched from them to anacondas. Boring? Yes. Crowded? Yes. But hey, 'tis easy and pretty safe with wolf form up, unless you walk right into the river or bandit camp.<br />
Filtering out the lb's and greens on track also helps, as does fighting at some ungodly hour where there's less competition for MoBs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Morgani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">So far doing bandits when they are blue, Griffons when the bandits are not.  Slow going not used to taking this long, just wish the rockhoppers where up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If JP is too crowded for your tastes, try soloing in the Hole, at the entrance.  There's a bit of downtime, but you should be able to do it.  With KEI at 53 I was able to keep the first 5 elementals down; without it only the first three.<br />
<br />
You're 51 but you've got better gear than I did when I started that.  Just keep your buffs on (especially FoN; the regen on it is more valuable than hte AC and 1 extra DS point from CoE) and use your mana for healing and snaring instead of nuking.<br />
<br />
Not as efficient as fear kiting, but it does give a break from staring at animal butts and there's always a slight chance you could get an IGS (I never did, but I understand that those elemental warriors can drop it).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Chadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Raptors in Timerous Deep are fearable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Morgani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Damn forgot about raptors.  Thanks for the reminder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Morgani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks Astroshak,  Maybe I will try the hole.   And yes FoN is better then SoE.  Atk+regen is better current at my level I have found.  <br />
<br />
Did rockhoppers till I hit 52 but you guys are really helping me out,  Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Damaged</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">What level can you single pull in the Hole?  This would be a nice place to park my ranger and pet druid I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tyrolene</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The faction hits from panthers in JP are slight.  I've been amiable forever and did about 4 lvls 65% panthers, 20% anacondas, 10% lt blue griffons when they crossed my path and I was bored and 5% gnolls 'cause, well, they needed killin'<br />
<br />
The panthers are almost never contested.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sithereand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">How social are the panthers?<br />
I've been killing griffawns / griffons while grouping with my lower level chanter (to PL her up a little) Ranger went from 70% into 51 to 82% while chanter went from lvl 38 to 39.  Now the chanter is 39 and has Spirit Wolf illusion we can both run around safely in JP and chanter can also slow mobs. Wondering if there is a better zone to duo the 2 chars other than continuing the same as the last few levels?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Aanlail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I did the Raptors yesterday in TD at 54.  They were dark blue but the XP was horrible.  Killed about 10 or so for one tick of blue on the xp bar.</div></div><hr />
