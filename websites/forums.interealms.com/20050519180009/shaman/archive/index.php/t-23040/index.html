<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So, Im having a bad week for insomnia (7 days..14 hours.  Im this |..| close to going insane now) and was reading over the changes to the PVP system that go live in the Patch fir the 11th.  In case you've missed them, heres a link:<br />

<br />
Before I go any further I should point out that Im not a PVP'er, I dont duel much, and have really no interest in the pvp servers.  But, since its something to do instead of stare at the walls, Ive been thinking about it lately.<br />
<br />
These seem to be some pretty sweeping changes.  From cursory inspection, it looks like casters are going to be hit hard this time.  Max damamge from 1 spell reducedto 40% isnt a bad change; SK's, necros and wizards were a bit too powerfull, I think, and this helps reduce some of the imbalance.  However, the 20% reduction in mitigation for ALL players hurts the lightest armored most, and thats anyone that wears a dress.  It seems to me that lowering armor class by 20% is tantamount to increasing weapon effectiveness by 20% (only in PVP).   Also, the increased melee range (another 50%) is a big change, as it means that if a caster can cast on you, a melee can smack you.  Further bad news for the silk sheets.  <br />
<br />
Bind camping is gone.  All pvp deaths except arena deaths now spawn the deceased in Shadowrest.  Not only do they get a free trip out of it, but they get to keep all their gear on, just like newbs do up to level 10.  This removes the item loot from Rallos.  Im wondering how many are upset by this; probably not the ones that tend to replace lots of gear, Im guessing.  <br />
<br />
The whole Point and Score bit is, at this point (sleep addled that I am) a bit too confusing to spend brain energy on except to say that it exists.  Maybe someone can read it and explain it better than Brenlo did.  Vitality bonus, inffamy penalties; Its all greek to me right now.<br />
<br />
So, maybe some PVP'ers can step in and shed a bit more light.  How do PVP'ers think these changes are going to affect the lifespan of pure casters?  Did it swing the pendulum too far the other way and overpower melee/hybrids/anyone that uses weapons?<br />
<br />
7 hour patch....bastards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">As for overpowering certain classes, that we can only wait and see.<br />
<br />
I think shamans will be a little better off along with every class that has spells.<br />
<br />
I also think that paladins will be even less fun to face if they can begin to land stuns...<br />
<br />
Removing safe zones from PoK and PoTranq is something i havent made up my mind about. Some people are furious about it, but im willing to wait to see how this turns out before passing my judgement.<br />
<br />
All in all i think its exciting that something happens. Now maybe, just maybe, the changes might be worth something for once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">guildwar in PoK would rule ;P</div></div><hr />

<br />
isnt the ONLY thing that makes RZ unique the fact that you can loot items? i think its bull that theyre taking this out.. but whatever, i dont play pvp /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Huge changes in this patch.  So many aspects of this patch have been needed for years, but of all of them, this whole respawning in Shadowrest is quite possibly the worst idea ever.  We could sit here all day and yell back and forth about whether camping is right or not, but I really see this change impacting the game in a negative way.<br />
<br />
Scenario: Bard runs through a zone to train a competing guild/team who is about to kill a mob needed for the next level of progression.  Though he might not die, the mission is essentially a suicidal one, wherein he's risking the time it takes to get back his gear to stop that guild.  On servers where you can't train, it becomes a guild war over that spawn where the ganking guild has the same type of risks.  But whereas before you would find people in your guild not willing to risk their necks, because they knew they probably wouldn't get their gear until the next morning, now it won't matter.  The gankers have absolutely nothing to lose now but 15 minutes of their time, spent in Shadowhaven with rez effects.  Before, the system penalized the ganking guild for pvp'ing, now it penalizes the guild set up at the spawn point.<br />
<br />
If you thought this patch was intended to solve griefing at the lower levels, I think you're in for a rude awakening when you find out it just became worse at the high end.  In pvp, the consequences that come with death (recovering your gear, losing your spawn, loss of time, etc) create the fear of death.  The fear of death is represented in so many implicit and explicit actions taken by zekers.  It encompasses the things you do without thinking (hitting / to see who is in the zone) to the zone routes you take to get to a spawn/raid to the way you are so anal about buff order.  You begin chipping away at those consequences, making them less meaningful, and you're going to turn griefing, especially at the higher levels, into the norm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Warren Maguson Emarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">People in RZ didn't get to loot anything.  At most, they got coin.   Bags were immune to being looted and everyone tended to bag their best droppable items if they were going to die.   With the sheer volume of no drop armor/equipment, PK'ers got nothing but the joy of griefing which was pretty much the thing to PVP.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Okay, so, my Necromancer's spells do 40% less damage, and he gets hit for max 20% MORE, at double the range.<br />
<br />
Oh boy! Do I get a free jump to a blue server so i can play without getting my ass kicked by naked monks holding fire beetle eyes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It's not that your spells do 40% less damage, it's that they now can't do 40% of your target's hp in one blow.<br />
<br />
IE, if you can nuke for 3000 pvp damage, but the person you're trying to kill only has 1000 hp, your nuke will do only 400 damage to him.  If the guy had 10,000 hp, your nuke would land for full damage.<br />
<br />
I'm curious how this affects dots though.  Does it work on a per tick basis or as a whole?  Haven't played on a zek for a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Erny makes an interesting point.  <br />
<br />
As for the whole point system; Zekers play to kill (or have the ability to kill) other players.  Im going to seriously doubt that introducing this point system is going to change any of that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>vincenzovs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The problem of ganking and training and so on will still exist, as Howler states.<br />
<br />
I think the change they made was specifically to stop bind/corpse camping (a good idea) but I can see how it will make the training bard more happy.<br />
<br />
TBH seeing the power of a &quot;same team&quot; (either played by a malicious player or the alt of someone on another team) bard training a zone for 4 hours solid was what caused me to quit PvP life full-time on SZ.<br />
<br />
I welcome the changes of the insta-cast nerf (down to 40%) , although I am not sure about the resist changes, especially since with gear and AAs people can just get better resists to compensate, making it even more frustrating for new players.<br />
<br />
Cleric still seems very weak to me in PvP though. The nukes were all that they had, and now those have just been nerfed. I think they need to start (and by the sound of it they might) specifically nerfing/tweaking particular classes and abilities if they want to get PvP anywhere near baalnced in EQ.<br />
<br />
The points system I am really not sure about. Looks very open to exploits if you get some alts or friends out to sacrifice in PvP daily...<br />
<br />
It's  a hard job what they are trying to do. I'd like to hear all your comments too.<br />
<br />
On the subject of shamans it sounds to me like our Root will get more resisted (first thing i am doing is testing VP3) and we will have a harder time landing debuffs and dots. However since melee damage is buffed up and nukes nerfed, our swarm of dogdogs might work better, while our dots continue to be strong.<br />
--<br />
the &quot;1.5 second cast and 12 second cast&quot;  -- I assume this is a typo and should read &quot;1.5 second cast and 12 second recast&quot; of pumice stones?<br />
<br />
--<br />
All in all having read the details of the changes it sounds to me that necros will have the best of all worlds, since they rely heavily on dots and have a very good dps pet. I could be wrong though since their melee mitigation is awful...<br />
<br />
They think they got rid of hill bugging? can't wait to see that!<br />
<br />
Excuse the stream-of-consciousness nature of this post, I just had to put it down ....<br />

<br />
I sure hope its per tick because my last pvp fight I ended dead OOM and I did 50-60% of the oppositions health with one ebolt.<br />
<br />
I am not sure about the resist changes, especially since with gear and AAs people can just get better resists to compensate, making it even more frustrating for new players. <br />
<br />
I have this same concern - I would like to see significant spell specific minimum resist rates.<br />
<br />
As to the removal of item loot on Rallos the loss of the excitement of PvPing with gear on is lamentable, but it was always rediculous how much people could skew the risk in their favor by wearing ND gear/bagging, or more recently by augging instead of wearing droppables. Atleast before LDON someone in ND that wasn't a raider meant sub par gear.<br />
<br />
Do any of you think you have a good understanding of the Pvpresistbase,  Pvpresistcap, and Pvpresistcalc fields in lucy?<br />

Made a new post with a bit of information in it.  Maybe you'll be able to add what you can to it.</div></div><hr />

He's in an anti-PK guild for the moment (why the heck not, right?). In a span of time of about three hours I died seven times, four of them from people wearing fungi and cof's and the like.<br />

Thanks for removing item loot on Rallos, now it's just an ever-so-fun festival where it's impossible to level unless you Ebay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Nakukak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">A few months ago when they said they were giving every single spell a specific resist mod, I understood it as they would go through every single spell and individually determine what needed what resist modifiers. Sadly, I was naive. All they did was fix the broken things (DT, oh wait... bard mana drain is still shittily annoying) then slap a blanket resist modification based on level and type of spell. Being a shaman, this doesn't do much when I'm trying to PVP someone in Time+ gear. -147 or whatever doesn't do jack when someone has 400 in a resist, even after Malos.<br />
<br />
In my opinion what they should have done for the DoTs is give them a very random resist rate. Such as -50 to -300 randomly. Thus giving gear an advantage, but not making someone immune. Oh well, I guess I'll heal and Malos in PVP still  :( .<br />

<br />
I don't mean to be a pain, but your logic doesn't hold up to tightly here.  If the pvpresistcap value of -147, which you refer to as the blanket resist mod which Sony devs put on all dots, was truly as you describe it, shamans wouldn't have nearly as many resists as they do.<br />
<br />
If you delve a bit deeper, nukes have a similar blanket pvpresistcap value based on level, but rather than it being -147 at level 65, it's -94.  Under your logic, dots should be harder to resist than nukes.  If this was the case, I'm pretty sure we'd see more shamans out there on the red servers near the top of the leaderboard.  Certainly, if this was the case, necros would have seen their power jump tremendously, since their dots have inherent resist mods on them.<br />
<br />
No, I'm quite sure that the -147 you refer to is not a blanket resist mod placed on dots.  I'm willing to bet that it's a factor in some type of equation used for figuring out resist rates.  Whether a -147 is better than a -94, I'm still not sure, but if current resist rates are an indication, it doesn't seem to be too great a thing.</div></div><hr />

They just nerfed the living dayligts out of Harmtouch. So, id say 'yes' to your question. Theyre still a big pain in the behind with their lure-drain.</div></div><hr />
