<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Medican</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering if I should change my weapon from REIF to a Club of the Ice Ocean. I mean considering I can haste myself that would bring me to hit every one second like the REIF, right? NOt to mention the proc does more damage as well. So is the Club of the Ice Ocean a good upgrade to the REIF?</div></div><hr />

12/19 is going to outdamage a 14/27 in it's sleep, haste, no haste, procs or no procs IMHO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What about a soulstripper?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Medican</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well what I am seeing is mainly this:<br />
<br />
REIF: 12/19 without haste with a proc around the 80s<br />
Club of the Ice Ocean: 14/27 without haste with a proc around the 140s and with haste around 30%( quickness)  then it would become a 14/19 weapon.<br />
Soulstripper:15/23 wihtout haste with a proc for 75DD/75 lifegain and with haste around 30% ( quickness) then it woudl become a 15/17 weapon.<br />
<br />
Now if I rember correctly a weapon usually rounds down so if the delay is 19 then it hits for 1 seconds and not 1.9. So  basically any weapon from 11 - 19 delay is a 1 second hitting weapon ( If i'm wrong please do correct). So basically all these weapons seem sweet!! So what should I get? I am leaning in the way of a Club of the Ice Ocean and the Soulstripper, more to the soulstripper because a 75 lifetap when I solo, and I am mainly a soloing type of person unless I want some company. So what do you guys think? What should I get?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">you're not remembering correctly. It will swing once every 1.9 seconds. The rounding happens on hundreths of a second, not tenths- and it always goes up and not down.<br />
<br />
It's just silly to worry about these weapons for procs, since they don't do it until such a high level. At 51 when the club starts to proc you are already well past the point where you want to be depending on weapon procs for damage You are better off canni/medding and casting, or better yet just do your epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I use both a Club of the Ice Ocean and a REIF on a regular basis.  <br />
<br />
If I can hit it I tend to use the REIF due to the better ratio.  If it has a high AC I use the Club and depend on the proc for my damage.  I haven't parsed anything but I find the REIF procs more often but not enough more often to make up for the 81-149 difference in damage.<br />
<br />
I hardly ever melee anymore though. Lizard+JBB&gt;melee</div></div><hr />
