<p><b> Anyone ever hunt in Neriek-3rd Gate?</b></p>

<p>There's a long thread on the necro boards about hunting some of the NPCs in Neriak-3rd Gate. They seem to think it's the best exp in the game to get through 51-55. I'm curious if any rangers have tried this zone, I'm fairly familiar with city (have a DE necro alt), but the CR could be nasty, to say the least.<br />

<p>Hunting in 3rd Gate is a very good way to get yourself killed and have a long, nasty CR.  The number and power of the gaurds and merchants there is overwhelming, and getting your body out would not be fun.  Unless there's a safe spot, I cannot see it bieng worth the risk.<p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2">__________________<br>

<p>hehe...I've always wanted to get together some people and swoop down on a city full bad guys -  I think it would be a hoot <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""> Anyone ever gather forces and storm Neriak to kill those nasty dark elves?<p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2">__________________<br>

<p>I know a mage who solo'ed 54 there in a few days. Neriak 3rd gate is definitely a doable spot by the right classes, but rangers may not be one of those "right" classes.<br />
<br />
Note: she often duked it out with cleric and wizard NPCs there and simply outgunned them, with some help from her pet.<p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2">__________________<br>

<p>Yup, I hunted there with a buddy when 54 got old. Too bad it greens out at 55. It's really not too dangerous, at least if you stay near the wizards. Never died there, and I had to run in and out both. Sometimes camo dropped on my runs, but I was always able to get away from the silly inkies, even encumbered.<p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2">__________________<br>

<p>I have an alt cleric I play on a second computer, if there was a place I could park her safely, that might make it easier. Unfortunately, my DE necro is only 17, so he can't really con to see where the nasty mobs are.<br />
<br />
I've heard mages can park their pet between the 2 wizards and go to bed, LOL, easy exp.<br />
<br />
Here's the thread if anyone is interested.  If anyone on CT wants to try it sometime, send me a tell. <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><br />

<p>As soon as you zone into Neriak from Nektulos, enter zone a little and go to the right. From there, you shimmy up the wall (there is plenty of room to do this), and from there you have a good view of 3 light blue guards, and 3 casters. You can single pull them with a bow and arrow from there. All have an extremley high MR, but aren't too tough. I wouldnt suggest this solo, either. Its a good camp for a war/cler/ranger. After those 6 mobs are killed, you can pull the two front guards. You'll probably have respawns by this point, but if you're fast enough, you can pull the dark blue dark elf just inside the gates. He's a SK that's quite a bit tougher than the others, but nothing you shouldnt be able to handle at 51 or so. Loot is ok, plenty of fine steel, couple pp each kill, and all three casters drop Robes of Enshroudment (necro robe). Robe is lore, so no farming )  Anyway, it is easy, and yes, exp here is pretty nice, although it can get a little boring....<p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2">__________________<br>

<p>The easiest way to get into Neriak safely is to go to the firepot room in the Timorous Deep, and tp there.  Lands you in a relatively safe spot, near the Foreign Quarter/Neriak Commons zone line.  No guards go there unless pulled.  Still superior camoflauge is a good thing.<br />
<br />
The safest way to get out is with a gate potion, cheapest of course being the Thurg gate potion.  The leatherfoot cap is a close second.<br />
<br />
I've been encouraged to do it, told a 51 ranger can solo the necro guild guards easily and safely once they know the right spot.  I don't yet.<br />
<br />
Yes, I'm considering it.  Going to explore it a bit further for proper hiding spots and pathing with a baby DE alt before I go in.<p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2">__________________<br>

<p>I remember fighting something there once, think it was for a quest of some kind.  <br />
<br />
I've also done Neriak Foreign Quarter a couple times with a small group before, that's fun.  I think most people were 46-55 for Foreign Quarter; may not have gone as high as 55, it's been a while.  We stayed near the arena<p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2">__________________<br>

<p>Hunted at the ent for exp one time, and the only time I've hunted in 3rd gate was for the guy for the enc epic.  But, I did run around quite a bit while I was there, and nothing sees invis that I ran into.   This means, it's easy to get there, easy to get out, and CR is not too bad.  The guards hit kinda hard, not sure about the wizzies though.  You should try to set up a guild group there sometime if it's good exp Ron. <br />

<p>Actually CR would be too bad, just have at least two ppl in the group make alt DE's to pull the corpses to a safe spot, then rez.<br />
<br />
Just want to check pathing and learn your way around there first. It can get a little confusing if you aren't aware of the twist and turns.<br />
<br />
Neriak is tough place, built like a fortress. And we all know how tough inkies are to their con value. Just be careful.<p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2">__________________<br>

<p>Okay, so here is a lil spoiler info on Neriak.  If your hearing about xping in 3rd gate to lvl 55 its gonna be on the DE mages at the area across the water that is kinda near the necro/sk guild more then likely.  This is kinda slow xp but not bad if your just topping off to ding 55.  The reason you hear about that spot being good to lvl 55 is because its got 3 mages that give xp until you ding 55.  You do NOT need to be non-kos to fight there and cr is easy with invis.  I never heard of a ranger soloing there but I have heard of necros/mages/druids soloing there.  Prolly a good spot for a beastlord as well.<br />
If you want xp in Neriak to say lvl 58, although the mobs I am about to talk about are still blue to me at 60, try the SK/Necro faction ogres and trolls in Neriak A in the building over near the arena.  These can easily be fear kited if you fix your faction with the Neriak guards by doing the wine quest in NeriakC.  With a high enough cleric you can get decent xp on these because you can easily split them and they respawn quickly enough to make for constant killing.  If your faction is fixed the Neriak guards will ignore the fighting and leave you to your bidness.  BTW, fixing your faction will not fix your necro/sk, mage, cleric, rogue, etc faction.  So watch your step even though you can now bank and buy/sell from most vendors.<p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2">__________________<br>

<p><b> Too cool!</b></p>

<p>I am sick to death of fighting over the Hole entrance for exp, and I did CoM for 3 levels and I'm sick of it. *grin*<br />
<br />
This may be a fun place to hang for a bit, I'll give it a try.<br />

<p>I have started to hunt here at level 51 for fun when passing the time, and I always thought it would be great in infiltrate the DE city and hunt them.<br />
<br />
I have not gone to far in with my Ranger, but I have found a great spot to hunt near the main wall.<br />
<br />
Zone in and Inv up.<br />
<br />
Run through the main gate and go left toward the Oger / troll side, up the path but do not go into the tunnel to there instead hop on top of the rocks along the side wall.<br />
<br />
From here I have pulled guards from off the top wall where they will run down [thankfully not agroing anything along the way it seems] and up to the rock where I am, work them over and have a good snare on them and root ready when they walk away.<br />
<br />
easy kills so far but I have not taken on the casters on top of the wall .... yet...<br />
<br />
If things go bad while you are up on the rocks you can run to the wall where you are near level to it and jump over to the far side giving you time to zone before they DE's come around the wall to try and get you.<br />
<br />
Side notes:<br />
Its a good idea I think to get a DE character and take a look around to get comfortable with the area... in teh heat of it you want to be comfortable running around.<br />
<br />
What’s up with the Halfling dude in the water in the middle city zone??? first time I had seen him was the other day.<p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2">__________________<br>
