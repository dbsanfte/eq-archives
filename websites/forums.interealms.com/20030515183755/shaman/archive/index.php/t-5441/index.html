<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sordia Winetrsbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay Mages are saying the pets are not immune.  Anyone able to confirm that the mage pet tactic still works after the Resist Changes of last patch?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bahss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This is TRUE - Fire pets are now hit by the dot. <br />
<br />
Looks like I need to go to fear again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Which fire pets? All of them? Or just Dyzil's Deafening Decoy?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bahss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">One of the mages was using the 49 fire pet, and the other mage was using the one that is one bigger than that (not sure on level)<br />
<br />
The mages were level 55 and 56</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Demisius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I participated in Rak fight this weekend and saw<br />
a 49 and 55 ( I think, was a epic mage) fire pet<br />
drop like flies to the AE.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think were 2 different changes that were made.<br />
<br />
1)  Pets use resistances of there masters<br />
2)  Resistance changes to make higher resists<br />
more valuable.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think the messed up pet resistances with 1 and<br />
made it worse with 2. <br />
<br />
The 60 mage had 50 or 70 fr, so it was not the<br />
case of the mage having such a high fire resist<br />
that it was prefered over the pets resists... It's just<br />
flat out broken.....<br />
<br />
<br />
I had a FR of around 200 and resisted 3/5 AE's.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking that the best way to win this fight now<br />
is a mage w/ cadeu of flame, bard with his FR <br />
song and a cleric with Group CE.  Then add a few<br />
classes for damage with resist gear....<br />
<br />
Rak is a puss if it wasn't for his AE =)  he only<br />
hit for 120 tops and was slowable.<br />
<br />
Have to do my tear hand in soon, Will see how it <br />
goes.</div></div><hr />
