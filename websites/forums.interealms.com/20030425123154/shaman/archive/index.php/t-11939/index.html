<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dyrk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Should be able to.  We had a group of low-mid 50's doing entrance and CY mobs last night, and did ok.  I didn't have any problem at 54 getting slow to stick.  For a while I would malosi, but then I just started slowing only.  The casters are the only ones that would resist occasionally.<br />
<br />
I was thinking that I could probably duo the entrance mobs with a good tank at this level, so at 59 I imagine you'd be ok.  We were there about 2 hours and had 5 blood drops.</div></div><hr />
