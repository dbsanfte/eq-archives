<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Filoranae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone here hunted any of the guards back behind the shaman trainer building?  (I think souldbinder is near here).  I run thru here every now and then and see several high lvl's just kinda hanging around, sometimes buffing or healing with the look of &quot;we are camping this spot&quot;.  Usually I'm in to big a hurry to stop and see what's going on; finally sent a tell last time out of curiosity and it was ignored (could have been afk, nothing personal I'm sure).<br />
<br />
Anyway! Are these guys a good camp?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ajgala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have never seen a group fighting the guards.  Often, I see a lot of recently deceased 60's hanging out by the Soul Binder waiting for their Rezzes.<br />
<br />
Occasionally I see a corpse in the area, but not many.<br />
<br />
I suspect that Shadow Haven is such a pivotal area for travel (or at least is was until PoK) and so neutral for selling that most folks don't wish to ruin their faction.<br />
<br />
Now those shorties down south of the soul binder... they tempt me.:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gudin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">if i remember correctly, one of the &quot;uber&quot; guilds did aoe on SH guards and got a ****load of aa exp.  or this could all just be in my head...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>iamagator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Gudin is right, they did.  But then VI did something to nerf it.  Not sure what it was though.</div></div><hr />
