<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sodami</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am getting back into EQ and am trying to decide on a class to make. I have always liked shamans, and I am just curious if it is wise to make one now or if there is a better class? I will not be starting from scratch, I have 200k or so in the bank and a 45 druid to PL with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dekurgen Heyokah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Check out the thread here on general titled. 'coming back to eq, wut class to pick? '. It may give you some ideas. If I were just coming back, I would consider the berzerker class, make a name for yourself while the class is still young and have some fun seeing what they can do later on once you level. GL with whatever you decide to play)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sodami</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for the tip, will check it out now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>spiritsofding</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">personally id suggest try SK.<br />
<br />
The only class id ever quit my shaman for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Arctarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Same as abbode, SKs are a great overall class, useful in group/raid/duo situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">personally, i would say what class to chose depends on your end goal of the game.<br />
<br />
right now, if you said you wanted get to 65 with 400+aas and go to GoD in a huge raiding guild, i would not say shaman.<br />
<br />
if you want to enjoy the ride, get to 60-64 and quit, shaman is a fun ride.<br />
<br />
depends on when you quit, as to what you chose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>gurgul_povar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Been playing since beta (I am not even sure how long that is anymore).<br />
<br />
I have played a mage to 50 when the cap was 50 and then got him to 56 after the cap was raised to 60. Loved the mage.<br />
<br />
Played a cleric to 60 back when the cap was 60 and loved it.<br />
<br />
Played a warrior to 53 and loved it.<br />
<br />
Played an SK to almost 53 (he is my main alt now and I play him from time to time). Love the SK.<br />
<br />
Playing my 65 shaman and I have very very few complaints. Love the shaman.<br />
<br />
I think every class has a lot to offer. If you are really interested in playing a shaman I suspect you will enjoy it very much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I became redundant in my guild when a 2-boxing Officer with more resources decided that she was bored with her Cleric and decided to level up an Uber Shaman Twink.  Like our guild needed another 65th level Shaman.<br />
<br />
Shaman do have a bit of trouble finding good groups if there are 65 Beastlords around.<br />
<br />
Soloing is steady and sure but mind numbingly boring.<br />
<br />
I have a new Zerker toon; gonna try to find a guild that does not allow better connected officers to run roughshod over the rank and file players.  I assume that a straight DPS class will always be welcome on raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sodami</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have looked into beastlords. How do they compare to shaman?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have looked into beastlords. How do they compare to shaman?<br />
<br />
Beastlords get a limited arsenol of older Shaman spells (much like rangers get weaker druid spells, etc)<br />
<br />
They also wear leather armor.  To make up for this, they can duel wield and fight passably well (about the same as a bard) and they have an INCREDIBLY powerful pet.  Combined with even our weaker level slow spells, they make VERY powerful soloers, and with their great pets (and the buffs for their pets - that adds proc, a lot of haste, etc) they make excellent additions to groups/raids in the form of DPS.<br />
<br />
They never get as &quot;good&quot; of a slow as us, but theirs does cast faster.  And at level 65, it is a 65% slow, and the different between them isn't so much that they can't take over slowing duties.  <br />
<br />
They dont get as good of buffs as Shaman do, but in the end game, so many people have maxxed - or near maxxed - stats that it doesn't make a huge different there, either.<br />
<br />
They are fun to play, i'lll admit.  They are powerful.  Some people here are jealous of the fact that they compare in so many areas that a Shaman had, basically, to themselves before they were released.  <br />
<br />
I personally duo with a beastlord consistantly, and despite the overlap, we do very well.   <br />
<br />
They can add to groups and raids very effectively, as well as solo very good.  (not as good as a necromancer, or charm enchanter), and they have trouble with multiple mobs (even a Shaman can off-root one- BSTs get NO root or snare spells of any kind.  The AA proc doesn't count any more then a magician's earth pet root counts as a reliable root)<br />
<br />
I like 'em.  I like my Shaman more, but a Beastlord is easier to play, and still enjoyable.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>TPFKAFaern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have looked into beastlords. How do they compare to shaman? <br />
<br />
Let's put it this way - many people consider Shaman to be a hybrid of Beastlords.<br />
<br />
I've noticed more and more in LDON that people will take BL's over Shaman. Sure we want Focus, but the pace of LDON means you want DPS. (Like Trials).<br />
<br />
Where a GOOD Shaman will make their money is to be both healer and slower. (Q helps immensely). Now either Q is rarer than a sober frat boy after an all night kegger or insanely expensive - or both. <br />
<br />
Shaman (With Q) + Charming Enchanter + 4 x DPS = Teh win.<br />
<br />
Shaman need SOMETHING. I can't emphasize this enough. Either more burst damage or better heals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I've never had problems with getting groups in LDoN, though I often have to play healer in a group full of dps. I realize beastlords offer much in dps and have some great attributes, but I've never felt intimidated by their abilities.  If you are mobile and on your toes you'll find that Shaman are as versatile and useful as any class.  For instance crowd control in a LDoN for a beast lord usually just consists of offtanking an add with their pet or themself, hoping the rest of the group is doing fine.  I am able to move around, root rotting, vping, off tanking, splash healing... and all those other things dependent on the situation.  Or you can find yourself sitting somewhere stagnant, like bot, and realize how much more dps other classes have (then again in bot malos/stronger slows are very nice, and dots can actually run the duration).<br />
<br />
I dungeon crawl with the same full group from my guild, and since they all play their classes very well and are diversified (chanter,cleric, druid, sk, plug in a dps) I find myself having to do much less to keep the group going.  But plug me in a pickup LDoN or planes group and I'm golden.   :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, they can give a helluva lot more atk than a shaman, and what other stat do people really want buffed anymore?<br />
<br />
The only way I noticeably beat out a bst is with debuffs and healing.  Shaman can do great things in a group that's carefully molded to cater to our remaining strengths.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>spiritsofding</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">i have an alt bestlord that is kinda stranded at lvl 56; i feel bst lords are similar to shaman versatile but no real vutting edge. There spells are pretty weak til lvl 59.....except for there pet heals/speed/proc spells.<br />
I used to think that warders were awesome, untill i grouped with a 61+ necro......u ever been in a group with a 65 necro 65 druid or even enc......<br />
Charmed mobs outclass any other pet. Its great fun.....go try it))<br />
<br />
bestlords are hard to equip. Unless ur in ubber guild #543, and have grp lbl 65 can help u farm twink gear, then u will pour a LOAd of pp into supplementing the beastlord mediocre melee performance.<br />
The plate classes are far superioir, *cough* even a ranger can outclass a bst in melee.*<br />
<br />
if u want soloing power then go for necro or enc(charm mobs) or ranger.<br />
if u want to grp alot with friends/raids then yes bst lord is a good addition to a grp.<br />
<br />
Rangers were a joke pre luclin, but the aa they got then,have made them a decent class. ranger with maxed out bow AA are very impressive. Possibly snare kiting gets boring fast, but some rangers can do an AA in pos on frogs in roughly 90 mins.<br />
IMO shadowknight is still THE most fun class to play.......2 years ago i would have said that of shaman but am afraid eq is biased towards melee classes.<br />
&lt;Have u seen the hybrid anti fissle AA ?  obscene!! guess they need it tho LOL&gt;<br />
<br />
*I realise that bst are very depended on their pets for there dps&#8230;&#8230;infact this is a weakness&#8230;&#8230;ok its situational&#8230;&#8230;.heres an example;  at 55 I was grped with a lvl 62 necro in chadok mines, camping the corner where the hafling mask drops&#8230;.in 4 housrs bst died 3 times necro 0.  why?  When u get adds u find that u are fighting one mob and ur pet is fighting another&#8230;&#8230;.any even con mob or better can intereuppt ur pet heals, let alone self heals. Pet dies first then u die with min 2 mobs on ya.<br />
When **** hits the fan, bstlord pet is a liability. Am not saying rangers could perform better in a dungeon setting like this, but certainly a sk could&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;they are far more flexible in dungeonsm which IMO is where the fun REALLY is in eq.<br />
Fdeath is a awesome ability&#8230;..its very rare my necro friend ever gets killed, only when fighting mobs that cast dots.<br />
<br />
Rember when picking melee clases&#8230;..that u have to run about a lot cos of lack of gate. So bard or sk or pally are the more appealing classes. (the latter 2 get the fastest horse as an aa)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
When I made my post, I forgot to mention the non-stat buffs, but i was frankly too lazy to go back and edit it. :)<br />
<br />
That should have read, &quot;they dont get as good of stat buffs as shaman&quot;, then it would make sense because everyone DOES have stats nearly maxxed in the end-game.<br />
<br />
Beastlords do get a better +ATK buff, which - as LaughingWoman says - is probably the most important buff there is nowadays. <br />
<br />
The downside of this is, I know my brother at least HATES buffing and would rather I do it. :)  If a beastlord is casting buffs all the time, it cuts slightly into their DPS.<br />
<br />
(They can still sic their pets in, but he hates doing that - if he wanted to ONLY use his pet, he would've been a mage and stayed back out of the fight - he likes to get his claws bloody)<br />
<br />
Shaman do need something - and different kinds of buffs have been suggested, from everything to better ATK buffs, to buffs that increase Strikethrough.  I wont go into the details - this was just a thread about classes. :)<br />
<br />
Just wanted to post that correction.  Thanks, LaughingWoman, though I really was just too lazy. :D (found a sunbeam... it hurts being a Cat Shaman sometimes)<br />

I'm thinking I need to make that druid alt I've been considering...because if they can accumulate 200k by level 45 then that's the alt for me!  :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
No gate and no root/snare bug me about BL<br />
Spell availability and grouping / soloing kinda worry me about shaman<br />
<br />
Anyone know how hard it is to get torpor / quiessence on Xegony?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>SylentsofXev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Anyone know how hard it is to get torpor / quiessence on Xegony? <br />
<br />
I dont know about xegony, but i got both malo and torpor for 5k a piece on Xev.<br />
<br />
research is your friend</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I rarely have problems grouping.<br />
<br />
It's not the 'log on and get 3 invites in 10 minutes without even putting LFG up' like it used to be, but it's not bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>qhor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">make a shaman woot<br />
bl's are cool and stack a mite better than shamans since they do more than .0004 dps but shamans can do a lot more in a pinch to make or break a solo group or raid situation which imo is what makes a class fun.<br />
paladins clerics bards and chanters are also good for this + bards can pull and pulling's my new kick, pulling is super fun.<br />
shaman suck at it though but it's fun to pull trains on unsuspecting groups after lulling them into complacency with textbook malo/slow calls and whatnot woot<br />
so yeah most important i think is pick a class/race combo that interests you and is fun or funny and you like to roleplay a bit because it spices eq up lots. if as you say you like the shaman class then hell yes, create one by all means and don't listen to the negativity here it's just all of us being burned out on the end game which imo is a bit dull and repetitive for any class<br />
<br />
ya have fun</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Qatrixaro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">May not be wise to re-start as a shaman.  Almost every 65 level guild has at least 3, the most I've seen for a single 65 guild is 15, may be more elsewhere.  In short, if you plan to raid and earn DKP, you'll be at the bottom of a very long list.<br />
<br />
Classes that no-one seems to play or reroll to anymore are Rogues and SK's.  Not sure why but just recently we've had raids called of since there was no lock-picking rogue available.</div></div><hr />
