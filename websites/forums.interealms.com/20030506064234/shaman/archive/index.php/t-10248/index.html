<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Krygor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im reading the posts and see a lot of people not worrying about getting wisdom above 200 and more concerned about hp/ac. Is 200 wisdom important to a shamman like 200 intelligence is important to say a wizard?<br />
<br />
Also would like some ideas as far as upgrades on my gear then if 200 wisdom isnt all that important. heres then link:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Wisdom is important, but not as important for shamans as int is for wizards. Shamans can convert their hp into mana starting at level 24. The process only gets more powerful as you get higher in levels. Shamans can therefore replenish their mana pools quite quickly, so we don't need the huge mana pools wizards need. Also, shamans are usually THE slowers in groups and raid settings. This generates a lot of aggro, so shamans need high ac to survive, particularly if the slow is resisted. On a last note, once a shaman has the AA skill Massive Cannibalization (canniV), he or she can convert 1950hp to ~1100 mana. You need a lot of hp to use this skill effectively, if not just to survive casting it, then to survive low hp aggro that may result. I don't have canniV yet, so others can probably explain this stuff better than I. Still, hope this helps some. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Krygor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hmm ok thanks.. just started using canni 1. Think I might have to rethink things a bit then... Maybe wont worry about wisdom as long as I can keep it above 175... Time to get some new rings and maybe some other items replaced.</div></div><hr />
