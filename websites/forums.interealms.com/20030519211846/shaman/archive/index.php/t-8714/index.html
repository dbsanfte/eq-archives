<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think those folks certainly have the muscle to heal and tank, digging up a wizard or trueshot ranger would help reduce the amount of time you're fighting him which can only be a good thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you can get a 60+ cleric to Aego buff the two groups before the fight, that would help a lot. Otherwise you're set. It might help the melee to wear resist gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>shatterstarix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yep resist gear, KEI and aego prolly before we head out. just wanted to confirm a small number of folks have the DPS for this. thaks for the replies!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">With the Pally as your main tank, you should be able to beat Rak. I found that our tank 60 SK with average resist gear wasn't taking many of Rak's AoE.<br />
<br />
With druid there able to buff people with circle of seasons, as Rak now uses ice comet. (I think this is a new thing) You shouldn't have any problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Rak is casting:<br />
FlameSongOfRo (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=820&amp;source=Live) (PB AE 850x2? fire)<br />
Circle of Force (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=463&amp;source=Live) (Wiz/34 targetted AE 216 fire DD)<br />
Bonds of Force (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=636&amp;source=Live) (Wiz/29 targetted AE snare)<br />
Ice Comet (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=732&amp;source=Live) (Wiz/49 single target 1120 cold DD)<br />
And something with a &quot;combusts&quot; message, some fire-based DD.<br />
<br />
Maybe more, but that's what I got out of my log. He cast FlameSongOfRo 7 times on us and we each resisted it maybe twice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>GraemeFaelban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">He roots as well.  I pulled him out to the mage pet, and he rooted me before I lost aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Innatook</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">all you need are 2-3 fire pets, and a couple healers to heal the pets at max cast range. I did it with 2 fire pets, very easy, keep mellee around to stop any adds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I would advise against just using pets. The get chewed up really quick now.</div></div><hr />
