<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Milhouse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It looks like a JBB is currently around 20-25kpp on my server (Seventh Hammer).  Should I go ahead and try to pick one up now or do y'all think they will drop in price once PoP is released?  If the consensus thinks I should pick one up now, if anyone on this board is from seventh hammer and is selling one, please contact me by replying here or sending tell in game to Brump.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Prices only drop if demand drops or supply increases.  I don't think PoP will really affect either supply of, or demand for, JBBs.  I could be wrong of course.  Maybe PoP will introduce something that right-clicks Ice Strike with a 4 sec cast time and is Iksar usable and falls from the sky like raindrops on the Plane of Phatshamanlewts.  Who knows?<br />
<br />
No reason to wait if you have the money and the seller IMHO.<br />

For you people who have a JBB:<br />
<br />
Where did you get it?<br />
Friends?<br />
Saved for it? (if so where did you get the cash???)<br />
camped it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Numbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Where did I get mine?  Bought in bazaar.  How did I get cash?  Uncancelled EQ, learned about focus items, rumaged through bank, saw &quot;Improved Healing 3&quot; on my Idol of the Underking that I wasn't using, sold it in bazaar, it paid for JBB.<br />
<br />
It's good to be a packrat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fozy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I got mine my trading for it.  JBBs typically go for 34k+ on my server so I had saved about 14k and traded an Ikky plate for it.  Oh how I miss that ikky plate though.  Oh yeah, I got it off a guy that was offering it in the market channel.  Its the only one I have seen up for sale in months.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hunted rockhoppers in mons letalis. Sold superb and flawless hides for 250 plat each to desperate tailors working on their shawl quests. Paid 15k for my jbb. Also made 4 levels there.<br />
<br />
It was nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Arctycwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm on the Seventh Hammer too.  I went to Seb and got into  crypt groups.  The second crypt group I was in a JBB dropped for us.  I was grouped with mostly friends and they were kind enough to let me loot it.  The crypt is pretty fun even if you don't get one to drop right away and exp isn't too bad.  I got pretty lucky because like you said they go for about 25k on our server.  They used to go for about 12-15k until the bazaar hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah, my first trip to the crypt and a JBB had just dropped. Guildies asked me if I wanted it... so sweet of them! :) But I already had one since level 51, thanks to Mons Letalis.<br />
<br />
It's unlikely you can do the crypt at 51, or will do the crypt at 51, unless you're with friends who are high level, and then the xp will be crap. So if you want to get a JBB when it's the most usefull - (45-55, when you live and die by it), you'll probably have to buy or get a friend's.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A friend gave me one.  I was a happy kitty:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I keeled many, many HGs to get the cash to buy my JBB. I did have to borrow a few K from a friend cuz I found a seller and I was a little short on cash, but after I got my JBB, I went back to RM and keeled some more HGs to finish getting the cash to pay my friend back. If you can catch RM when it's relatively unpopulated (hard to do at times), you can make a lot of cash rather quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If you are willing to wait I would bet you could find a JBB for less in bazaar.  I have seen them as high as 30K and as low as 12K on Xeg and I would bet most other servers experience the same goofy price swings on nearly everything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Lyam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I picked up my JBB last night, I too am on the 7th Hammer and I paid 25k for it.<br />
<br />
For me as a casual player I may never get to be part of a raid that gives me the chance to loot one so I considered the 25k to be a reasonable price.<br />
<br />
As a side note a Cleric mate of mine asked another friend, a Mage,  about a week ago &quot;What is a Jaundiced Bone Bracer and is it worth 10k?&quot;<br />
<br />
His immediate response was &quot;HELL YEAH, buy it  for Lyam it is his Holy Grail&quot;<br />
<br />
Unfortunately as expected it didn't last that much time someone grabbed it and was for sale again 2 minutes later for 34k.  Looks like someone was out to make a profit.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Personaly I would wait and see what Widget of Shamanistic Uberness drops from the level 10 mobs in PoP :-)<br />
To answer the hijack questions: I keeled about 400000000000000 Hill Giants and saved up roughly 20k, then made enough SoW potions to clog up my mules 8 10 slot bags he was packing and to clog up his bank as well, then sold those at 100pp a pop in EC Tunnel (none of this easy crap for us old timers).<br />
Once those were sold, I rinsed and repeated and then got a but load of upgrades, including the JBB...I was around level 48 or so BTW.<br />
Oh yeah, Monah if your out there, thanks for the JB greaves dear and I miss ya!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Enkebesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Bought mine for 8k and 12k respectively (yes, I was that much of a AC-junkie in those times).<br />
<br />
Ironically, soon afterwards we camped 4r/emp for quite some time (in futile attempts to get my 60 spells), and 4 JBBs dropped there. We gifted them to 4 Shaman from my old guild (one of those I bought I sold for 10k to a shaman twink in my guild, I never treated twinks as fair as Shaman mains :)).</div></div><hr />
