<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wazbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well during the whole fiasco with fileplanet I was mad, and I still don't like em.  I am also glad that someone found out a link to the fileplanet servers that allowed me to download before I got the key, though I don't remember it any more.<br />
<br />
After finally getting in this morning I realized, this is the best 8 dollars I have ever spent.  At first I felt kinda bad paying 8 dollars for one week of gaming, but if you think about it its still cheap, one movie or two video game rentals, and I am bound to get more than enough fun time out of these 8 dollars.<br />

God this game rules :D<br />

Because I'm not one of the lucky ones whose account was processed correctly on the first try.   *starts breaking things*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wazbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Don't worry too much, I had to wait like 12 hours to get my key.  Just make sure to fill out the page to get your key, and you will get it eventually.  Plus, I am sure their server load is down some and it should be faster.<br />
<br />
If you didn't get billed I would sign up again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Oh, I got billed instantly, all right.  ;)  <br />
Funny how THAT part of the process doesn't have any problems - paypal sent me email the second I hit the signup button.  Then about 26 hours till I got my beta key.<br />

S'okay, logging back into WoW felt eerily like sliding a needle back in a vein.</div></div><hr />

Addictions come in all shapes and sizes, 'eh?<br />

We've already sent out our notices to our friends letting them know not to expect to see us for a while. We've accepted the fact that we're about to become hermits again. :)<br />
<br />
I'm ok with that. LOL</div></div><hr />

Heh.  Even thought I love the warcraft universe, and I'll be a blizzard fanboy (though not a rabid one) til I die, I'm seriously considering not buying WoW.  Not because I think it'll be uninteresting, but because I know how weak I am in playing &quot;not too much&quot; mmorpg when I have them.  I really want to get laid and learn kendo and do good in school this semester, and when I played eq, the getting laid thing falls by the wayside.   :(</div></div><hr />

Hookers, firearms, bribery... problem solved, you can play WoW now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">On the bright side, you really DON'T have to have 2-6 hours to rub together to feel like you accomplished something in WoW.   At least not yet.  This really IS the best $8 I've spent on a game in I don't know how long.<br />
<br />
Yes, the house is a mess... but we're much better about making ourselves stop to eat than we were with EQ.  Primarily because we knew we coul d pick right back up where we left off... we're not completely screwed in-game because we stopped for an hour to eat.</div></div><hr />

In the end a hooker and a gf costs about the same. you gotta spend a lot of time on a gf and money too.<br />
<br />
