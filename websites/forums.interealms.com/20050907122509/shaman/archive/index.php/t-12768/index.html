<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Quinner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just reached 44 and am looking for advice on where to solo and as to my equipment. How am I doing? Everything is 100% bought through really good trading and selling or made by me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Durdend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I had concentrated on Wis in the past too, until I started dieing all too often at 50+% mana.<br />
<br />
I made a switch to Hp, AC, Mana and Wis items.  I die a LOT less often.<br />
<br />
As to where to hunt, I was in Dulak's Habor last night with a lvl42 Paladin buddy.  We both got great exp, and you can get the no drop quest peice for you Stoicism spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>saco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I also did the Wis thing all the way to 40, but it seemed i too started dieing ALOT more....<br />
go buy your self 6/65hp rings for starts (if bank account alows of course) then work your way up to about 830 AC 1500hp... my Lvl 45 shaman has about 893 AC buffed and 1800HP buffed wis is at 184..<br />
<br />
Where to hunt you ask?? CC (crystal caverns) all the way to 47, hunt the Geo's great cash and xp at your lvl, made about 3k in 5hr game time...<br />
