<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Irksome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Used to be the best way after Greater XXXX turns trivial was to do Titan's Potions (grow).  They were trivial at 180ish, and were cheap (20is).  I heard that they might have nerfed it, haven't confirmed myself.  I hit 180 and have never ever EVER considered raising it more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>pokalow998</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">oh cool<br />
i am 65 lvl , can i get 180+ skill?<br />
also , what potions i make first ? i am 101 skill now.. i dunno enough to combine Greater XXX potions now :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">u can go over 180, not sure what potions to make past 180 though. from 101 i did titan potions all the way up to 170.  i ended up broke and with a bunch of potions i can't even give away :/  only reason i did titans is because there was a good chance i wasn't going to be able to sell the other stuff either and titans were the cheapest to make.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Playing Mr. Obvious here, get your wis maxxed (guess no problem with 65). Rob a druid :), get wis buff, whatever ...<br />
<br />
Personally i have checked more, what potions i or guild could use eventually (resists, ds, ...) and made these.<br />
<br />
No matter how cheap a potion is, its wasted money, if you can't use potion in my opinion.<br />
<br />
20k should be more than enough, used much less (10-15, don't know) for 0 to 175.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>pokalow998</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">where can buy Maliak Leaf and Tri-Fern Leaf?<br />
i can't buy it in PoK and Halas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Heigelyac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">there is a vendor that sells only the &quot;new&quot; luclin components in shadowhaven.  when you zone into sh from the nexus look left, there is a row of doors.  go across the mini bridge and go one door to your right.  if you see a barbarian in a cubby, you found the place<br />
<br />
titan will make your skillups, but it's a pretty useless protion, unless you are having everyone in your raid grow to help push a mob (like IV)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>pokalow998</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">cool thx all,<br />
just got 176 skill now, like burned 6.2k form 101 to 176 only</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Inqubus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I took all my 10 shot grow potions I used to skill up and stuck em on my vendor for 150pp.  I only have 2 left now after about a month or so of off and on selling.  Not bad profit margin for something that doesn't sell supposedly ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thyrm Jarlson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It cost me right around 11k to go from 103 to 180 skill. I pretty much just made Titan Potions.</div></div><hr />
