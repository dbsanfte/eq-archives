<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I went to PoI the other day looking for a group.  Couldn't find one (17 people in zone, apparently mostly 65's PLing alts), so decided to try soloing.<br />
<br />
Was able to kill 1 MOB, and another popped on me.  Had both slowed, but even with Fungal (regen wore off during second battle), the second MOB (yellow con, hit for 286) wore me down.<br />
<br />
I dropped no less than 2-3 Plagues, E-bolts and 1-2 Epic DoTs on each one. Also was using JBB for additional damage as well as DogDog (tm).<br />
<br />
I do not have a horse, and Jobarer was not in Alpha Mode, but the sheer HP's of the MOBs (again yellow con) I could not keep up with the damage. (again they were slowed).<br />
<br />
Wrong zone to solo? Tactical mistakes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well without know what gear you have I would say tactical mistake.  If your gear is the issue then not much else to say link that gear = )<br />
<br />
More then likely you got got a a bad RNG for those with resists/them NOT missing you hehe.<br />
<br />
Slowed and keeping dog healed you should be able to beat them.  But not at 52.  Head back to PoJ if you would like to solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You are gonna be a LONG time trying to solo in PoI with the spells available to you at that level.<br />
<br />
Get a group together, even if it's just you and a couple tanks, and you'll do well there.  Otherwise, PoJ is a far better choice at your level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hail,<br />
<br />
At 52 you should be grouped in PoI in my opinion.<br />
Especially without a mount.  You really need to get one of those! ;) <br />
<br />
At 54 if you have the points you can get Anathema.  That plus epic and a disease DoT should let you root/rot singles if you are very determined.  Tanking in the face isn't a good option for you right now, though it will be viable later on in the lower Tiers of PoP if you want to do that (I did).  At 56 with a new powerful poison DoT, you'll have more DPS at your disposal as well.<br />
<br />
52....wouldn't recommend soloing in PoI unless you are extremely well twinked, and even then it isn't efficient.  If you are determined to solo I'd recommend old world or Kunark zones for you, though the exp rate will be lousy compared to PoP.  SolB, Lower Guk, Burning Woods, Skyfire, etc.<br />
<br />
Two or 3 player groups in PoI will be much more effective as Sudedor said.  Grab a knight tank and any DPS class and you should be okay, though for most efficiency you should be using Stoicism out of combat to help heal.  If you are primary healer AND slower, don't worry about doing any dps (just use dogdog &amp; click your JBB) as your contribution with slows and heals will be plenty.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seeing this Poor soul attempt to solo PoI in my mind is either, a Brave adventurer or a poor soul who doesnt understand the Dangers of this zone.  Im rather shocked you tried this.  Heck, I'm lvl 56 and I havent tried this.  you have however encouraged me to try this with my lvl 58 Monk for 2 boxing  ,or my lvl 53 pally, in 2 boxing, I think I will give this a swing.   PoJ is far too easy for me to 2-box.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Huurgh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You should do fine in Velks zone in. Of course it is slower, but if you prefer soloing I would suggest you give it a try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ribwitch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">At level 52 I wouldn't recommend soloing PoI either, i'm very well twinked, ie: Fungi tunic, drog, JBB, some ornate, Foci items.., Anyways at level 54 I was able to do it, Just try and get enough buffs, for you and your pet!!! Don't forget pet toys:)!!! (Virtue almost a must, to be mana efficient)...Yes a drog will help wonders! with canni/fungi/regen..etc<br />
<br />
But I recommend waiting till you get your new puppy at level 55, he'll fight them much better/faster..<br />
<br />
Get a partner (Fellow pet owner/tank) and go down to PoJ Death Row (Next to trial NPC)..Very good exp, and reasonable on gems, made 6k in one day down there. And with 2 people the mobs should never run out, and THEY DON'T RUN:)</div></div><hr />
