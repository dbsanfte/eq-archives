<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I sure hope they are holding a few back, because if thats all I'm getting I'm gonna be pretty disappointed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i given up hoping, i just not gonna bother with it,, looks like another yheska!<br />
<br />
i feel my time with eq coming to a close. the only reason i stayed so long is that other companies droped the ball with their efforts.. but the new set coming all just seem infinately more playable, better dynamcis and learn what SoE just seems cant.. that players are important.<br />
(oh and they seem to be doing proper beta test and taking time about it not just trying to milk the cow)<br />
i see eq2 flopping amazingly and eq dying a slow agonising death. remeber we are Prophets!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The only ability which is somewhat exciting and new is Persistent Casting, and that's a general caster skill. That and Advanced Spirit Call are the only abilities I am even remotely interested in, and only for the pvp aspect of it. Secondary Forte to some extent. <br />
<br />
The rest is a very meager collection of abilities that are totally uninspiring and won't even earn a /shrug from me. Most of them are just very minor hassle-removers for insane AA costs. 20AA's to hit the three bst pets with that AE focus? No thanks, I'll just buff them separately if it's that important.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Whatever happened to Consumption and Spirit Shield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think this is an old list.  Notice the description and talk about Pet Affinity, which is decribed as letting you buff the pets of others with group spells.  That was changed in Lucy a long ass time ago to be something that people with pets buy if they want their pets to be hit with group buffs. <br />
<br />
So I think this list is a bit old.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hate to say it Landragoran, but as the author of the article I can assure you I copied them word for word.  They are what's currently listed in the AA window under the GoD tab on the beta server.  Dunno anything about the Lucy stuff, but with all the changes that keep happening to the Lucy entries, I kinda wonder if maybe the devs aren't just messing with the spdat file to teach us not to parse it or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bamce ConstaCani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">but loy added more bank space, maps, and ARMOR DYES!!!! ....errr wait... the last one was a bad idea</div></div><hr />

Please crawl back to wherever you came from.  I didn't miss you in your absence :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Secondary Forte is about the best new AA that we get so far.  You put your new specialty as Specialize:Conjuration and that is some serious mana savings on all dots/poison DDs.<br />

i just got free 300 AAs on beta today so i'll be testing out the new pet stuff and crit dots tomorrow.  Hoping for the best of course.</div></div><hr />

If this wasn't breaking the NDA, I'd ask you to tell me how good Persistant Casting is...(PM me!  :rolleyes: )</div></div><hr />

With the insane prices for AA's in this expansion they going to be giving everyone 300aa's for buying the piece of crap?  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Wow! I guess they're not interested in selling this<br />
expantion to Shamans. At least not this Shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Jeez what a big list of total crap.<br />
<br />
I dont see myself buying this expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">This is kind of off-topic, but how did you get 300aa on beta, Valsuvious?  I'm in there too, and it's kind of bugging me that I can't test any of that stuff...  I'd need to earn more AAs there than I have on my main to test most of that stuff, and that isn't going to happen in 2 weeks... :\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I got 750AA on beta just to test the stuff. Not much to say about it tho, except that the graphics of zergpets are broken :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only way I run out of mana is chain raining, so I guess it will be evocation for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Everyday I get up and hope that they've relized how crappy the aa's and spells are and how insanely overpriced they are, but I doubt there will be anything more then tweaks at this point.</div></div><hr />

I can't believe how badly they jacked up the costs on AAs I might not purchase over existing ones.  Some of these would be fine if the AA cost was nuked.</div></div><hr />

<br />
it's actually the graphics on all shaman pets.  Right now they don't look like they are attacking at all.. just standing there in front of the mob.  I physically had to turn on pet attacks just to see if he was attacking (which he was.. although I did it partially to also see him crit, which was gay cause he crit almost never).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Merwenn0</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">http://www.rpgexpert.com/562.html - Check this out. It doesnt tell you which aa's are for class, but it does give you an idea of all the aa's that there might be. For example, this list has Quick MGB aa on it, that I'd assume would be for all mgb classes. It is relativly old though. Best you can say right now is to wait until the expansion comes out to see what actually AA's they used, since, even in beta, they may not be releasing all the info and new stuff before the expansion actually came out.</div></div><hr />
