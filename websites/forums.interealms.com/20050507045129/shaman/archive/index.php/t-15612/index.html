<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kreil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just made 61 a few days ago. I bought the new regen spell Replenishment from PoK library. The spell listing says the duration is over 19 minutes. I was in Veksar the other night and noticed that it was not lasting very long. So I right clicked the spell in my book. It said spell duration 6 minutes? ***? Since I have only had the spell a few days maybe I missed something? Anyone else have this problem?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tinwe Ambersky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Around 19 minutes according to Lucy and that sound right to me (I cast it 3 times per hour or so with scr3). The only 6 I see in the description is the 6 second cast time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">heh, three times per hour with SCR3?  That's 30% extention, which on a 19 minute buff works out to 5.7 minutes, for a total of 24.7 minutes duration.  You should only have to cast this 2.47 times per hour, not three :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>xDeMeNtiAx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">how do u exactly cast a spell only 2.47 times though is the real question at hand!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It's not nerfed; you made a mistake reading the spell description.</div></div><hr />

Funny you mentioned that, I have this purple spotted one for sale.  Belonged to a little old lady gnome, only sat on it on sundays so low milage.  Runs on hay and woodelf parts.  Make offer!</div></div><hr />
