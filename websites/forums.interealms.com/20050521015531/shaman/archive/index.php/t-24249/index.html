<br />
Just destroying the CDs would still leave you tempted to start again the next time they go on sale.<br />

Remember this is an addiction we're talking about. Extreme measures may be called for.</div></div><hr />

I've been clean since Feb without even the slightest desire to play.  I'm back to playing single player RTS games and I'm loving it.  Suits my lifestyle better. I can pause a game if my kid wakes up in the middle of the night or if my wife is getting frisky.  No bowing out and feeling guilty for dumping a group of friends and/or strangers.  I do miss my friends, but I lurk on their boards as well and there's emails and stuff.  The way I look at it is I played while it was fun and it's easy to quit when it stopped being fun.  I got my money out of it, the game and the class were great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yea.. that pause button is a magical thing. I've been tinkering around with Diablo II lately.. old game I know.. still fun to play for now. It was kinda tough at first... but I read about having to grind to get things, and it just doesn't seem worth it. Pay to be tortured? Anyways best of luck.</div></div><hr />
