<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I got my 8th AA last night and trained Spell Casting Reinforcement 1.  However I didnt know the cost of the next one would raise to 4.  Very misleading.  Had I known this I would have gone straight for MC.<br />
<br />
My question is will the next level cost 6 or 8?  Does it raise 2 or double?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wargbearjumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">all the skills in the second category cost 2 - 4 -6 points to raise.. not just reinforcement.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thats what I figured I just wanted to know if the cost went up by 2 or if it doubled. <br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Wait til you work on some of the multilevel class AA skills...I believe it's 3, 6, 9?  (could be wrong).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Aye, for skills with level progressions, the number of AA points is as follows:<br />
<br />
Achetype Abilites: Level 1 is 1 points<br />
                             Level 2 is 2 points<br />
                             Level 3 is 3 points<br />
<br />
Priest Abilites:      Level 1 is 2 points<br />
                             Level 2 is 4 points<br />
                             Level 3 is 6 points<br />
<br />
Class Abilites:       Level 1 is 3 points<br />
                             Level 2 is 6 points<br />
                             Level 3 is 9 points<br />
<br />
You need 6 points in Archetype to put any in Priest.  You need 12 in priest to put any in Class abilities.  The minimum to get the Cannabalization Skill is 23 AA points.  6 in any combination of Archetype skills, 12 in Mental Clarity under the Priest skills (mental clarity 3 is a prerequisite to canna), and then 5 to actually get canna 5.<br />
<br />
It's a long trip!  :)<br />
