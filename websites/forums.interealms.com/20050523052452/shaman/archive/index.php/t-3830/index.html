<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I didn't see a post about it, but I think VI nerfed our class abilities a bit.  It seems that at least 2 of them have gone up in AA point costs.  Of course, I didn't pay a whole lot of attention to them originally, so I might be mistaken, but perhaps someone could confirm . . . ?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Which 2?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As I said, I could be misremembering, but I think it was Spell Casting Reinforcement Mastery.  From eq.castersrealm.com, it was 5 points, and I seem to recall that it is now 8 points (perhaps castersrealm had it wrong).<br />
<br />
The other one was pet hold, I thought, but as I review it, castersrealm says it was 6 points, and it is still 6 points I think.  I couldn't check canna 5, as I already have the skill.  Perhaps someone could confirm that it is still 5 AA points to get it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Spell Casting Reinforcement Mastery has always been 8 points, Caster's Realm has always been wrong.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vorpatril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Aye, as castersrealm is wrong about how Malosini is acquired ( they say it's a drop ) and how Paralyzing Earth is acquired ( they say it's a vendor spell ).  <br />
<br />
I'm not one to believe whatever I read on the web, but one would think they would have such simple information correct given that it has not changed in ... 3 years?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Koraden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think the problem with sites having 3 year old incorrect information is that most people know its wrong, some people post here about a stealth nerf, not knowing the info is wrong and some post posts like this one, but no one actually bothers to email baelish@castersrealm.com and tell him that the info is incorrect :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Wargbearjumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Castersrealm still says the Duration on Turgur's is like 3 minutes or less I think...    I recast it at 5 all the time with no problems :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Vorpatril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hehe, good point Koraden! :)<br />
<br />
Actually, I tried to post a correction under the incorrect information, but one can't post unless they register first. I am habitually disinclined to go through a registration process if I can at all avoid it. I guess I'm just kinda bitter because I looked like such a newb saying in auction /wtb Malosini! Later followed by me spending a half hour looking for Paralyzing Earth in FV. <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Actually, the problem with bad info on castersrealm is that even if you do submit a correction, they no longer do anything with it.<br />
<br />
I know... I have submited corrected info on quite a few things (Malosini, Paralizing Earth, the mage focus earring, and a few other things). The old, bad, information remains in place despite my efforts months after the submissions.</div></div><hr />
