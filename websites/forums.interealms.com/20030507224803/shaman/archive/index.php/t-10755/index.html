<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bearknukl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi there, sorry to bring up a magelo equipment question, but here it goes.  I currently have no valuable pp, but i guess i can make some money.  Seeing my gear<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=181055<br />
<br />
what should my next goal be as far as equipment goes? and how should I continue from there?  Should i be saving up and buying or are there things i should be targeting and camping.  or should i just close my eyes, be content with what i have and keep working on exp. to get to 60<br />
<br />
Additional info<br />
All veliuos faction crap from raiding.<br />
Play time sporadic.<br />
no horse yet</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>bakkal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Legs to Grey Suede pants, <br />
Shield to Sarnak Battle Shield,  <br />
Boots do a search for Dusty Soriz boots (might get lucky), <br />
Cloak - Anything with HPS on it, personal thing I hate that cloak.<br />
Wrist - Sentry Bracer, Bracelet of Fortitude, Barbed Rubicite. Anything<br />
Black Sapphire earring to replace pixie Rib<br />
Head - Anything with HPS</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rewts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would try to camp for a Hiero's cloak and a JBB<br />
and Earing of Solstice would be nice, but takes some cash<br />
Need a better neck (can swap out for EE3) Shrouded medallion in ME perhaps.<br />
If you are in a guild, try to get a Vindi BP<br />
<br />
IMHO your AC is too low, and you could easily give up some wiz.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>bearknukl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Okay, made alot of BIG changes as i worked through level 57<br />
Here is my new Magelo.<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=181055<br />
<br />
err since, the new magelo basically replaced my old magelo, for those who haven't seen my inventory prior.<br />
<br />
My bracer used to be a Supple Scale (in bags) and a Rune Etched bracer.<br />
My shield used to be a Shield of Bane Warding.<br />
My chest used to be an Emerald Scale (I also now have an Ixsar Regen bp in my bags.)<br />
One of my ears was a Pixie Rib.<br />
I switched out the Hardened Grey flesh sleeves for the deteriorated because the 3k difference helped facilitate other trades, and its arguable which is better.<br />
My face used to be a Mask of War.<br />
My neck used to be an Amulet of Insight (which i now just keep in my bags.)<br />
I don't know if this change occured in between the time I last posted but I switched the Howling harpoon in the range for the beginners magic manual.<br />
and finally I didn't have a horse.</div></div><hr />
