<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grumgor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The first island that you come to, when you got on the boat at Freeport, is called Sister Isle. (I'd jump off the boat, if you're kos to elves; the dock that the boat stops at has a reception comittee of level 20s) On it live wood elf rangers, virgins every one, and they all drop a purity belt. There are two types, the &quot;A Sister of Erollisi&quot; and the named sisters. Named are 20ish, stay away from them. The generic ones are between 9-13, and wander around. Easy enough to get one by herself, but beware: they are social, and a runner can easily end up getting friends. <br />
<br />
The belts are light weight, so you can easily get a bunch of them, and they sell for 1pp each if you're a Troll (and up to two pp each for some Darkelves I know, darn their charisma). This island is easy to solo, with our level 9 spells, and good way to make the money needed for level 14 spells. Just beware the named sisters, which tend towards the city part of their island, and also a named bandit who is also in his 20s. The bandit wanders all over, your best bet when pulling is to look all around before getting a sister, and then pulling her to the shore; very rarely, if ever, do the sisters wander by themselves to anywhere along the shore of this island.<br />
<br />
The best way off the island is gating, and I'd keep sow on at all times, along with gate memmed at all times. This has saved my butt, when the bandit snuck up on me, and so I was able to outrun the bandit and the sister I had been beating down, running around the island's shore, until I had enough distance to cast gate.</div></div><hr />
