<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wwen Valimar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After a much whailing and nashing of teeth I finally got the spell at level 52. I bought the Admintite band, and camped the teeth with a pally friend and got those in one night. (which was much more fun with another person btw) Last night I finally looted a burning sash, it took all night to. It was easy, but not. I had trouble recruiting people for the imps. Foretuneatly it was easier to get people for Vance. My first ranger quest completed since my Ivy so I'm rather thrilled. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Motius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Congrats :)<br />
<br />
I never managed to get that quest done before I got Califaction.  (/rude butler)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Amdee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hey, way to go! Always good to see ranger-only quests being done :) You'll love your new nuke!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>TheOne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I still use this spell al lthe time at 59.  Unless the mob is FR or MR if I have kei I nuke everytime those two spells come up.  I can't achieve that damgae melee wise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>makrus quintius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Whew,<br />
Finally finished Call of Flames spell quest last night at level 58.<br />
A long time completing this quest, but worthwhile.<br />
Did turn in to Ganelorn, spawned Vance Bearstalker a little ways off. He was Dark Blue to me at 58.<br />
Aggroed him and duoed him with heals from a 60 Druid(thanks Miriane).<br />
He put up a good little fight but was really not so tough, and yes he will summon. He hits for 115 or so and has a lot of HPs.<br />
<br />
Dont give up on the quest, its a royal pain in the arse and really should be a bit less involved for a level 49 Spell.<br />
Toughest parts are getting the Burnt Sash in SolB and those darn fangs in Castle MM.<br />
<br />
It is a nice addition to our lacking DD arsenal and combined with Firestrike makes a nice combo DD while soloing (2 second cast time can help with aggro and pulling). Would have really come in handy a few levels ago....;P<br />
<br />
Stay safe all,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brumuuil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">the butler's your bottle-neck, Motius?<br />
Wow - I've collected like three sets for carious guildies when I was bored, and my bottle-neck has ALWAYS been that farkin' maid!<br />
<br />
/h8 maid Issis!!<br />
<br />
anyhoo - good luck and stuff!  If I'm KEI'ed, I always use it, can't wait to find the amulet for Icewind - would like to see what those can do chained every time they pop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dirus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I love this spell. I did the quest at level 50 and use the spell constanly. With KEI it can really up your DPS. Other rangers in my guild have all seem to have blown this off becuas we get the 300dd at level 52. I keep trying to tel them it is worth it, but they dont seem to believe me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Meecham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Haha - I ended up with 3 butler fangs and at least 4 sets of shoulders from the avenging caitiff before the maid finally dropped for me. I haven't been back to Mistmoore since. Some day when I am more uber, I'm going to go back and just lay waste to the castle.<br />
<br />
Grats on completing the quest, it's a good spell to have in the book and definitely makes a nice punch of damage. I just got Icewind tonight, but think it will be worth keeping them both memmed in many situations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Archyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Grats on the spell, still trying here.........<br />
IF THAT FARKIN MAID WOULD COUGH UP HER DARN FANG I WOULD BE FINE!!!!!!!!!<br />
Sorry I was having a moment.<br />
:-P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>hebuorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">its a an awsome spell ... just to bad it take that much time to get it ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Belgaren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Kind of makes me feel a bit better that the maid is such a bottleneck, as after camping the area all day Saturday &amp; several hours Sunday the only fang I have is the maid fang I found for sale in the bazaar.  Now if the stupid butler would just open wide &amp; say &quot;AAAAAAAAUGH&quot;.  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Poster-01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">the fangs are often for sale in the bazaar on zebuxoruk - 50pish, of course its not very rangerly to buy quest components from others now is it .....</div></div><hr />
