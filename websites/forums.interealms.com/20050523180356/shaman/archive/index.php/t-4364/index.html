<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The Obulus Death Shroud has become somewhat synonymous with the focus effect (Mana Preservation III - makes all cast spells cost 10% less mana.)  The price of the ODS has skyrocketed since the focus effect was put in, etc. etc.  The ODS is recommended as standard high-end gear, etc.<br />
<br />
I've been wary about getting one because it would represent a big decline in stats over my IGS.  I figured someday I'd take the plunge, but it was really bugging me than even un-uber me was going to give up 10 raw AC and 9 to each resist for this effect.<br />
<br />
Well, last night I saw a Crystalline Torque (ac 12, mana preservation III, all/all, drops in Velks) go up in the trade channel.  I picked it up for 4k, and I love it.  It's still a bit of a stat downgrade (over the shrouded medallion I had before) but not nearly as bad as the IGS swap-out.<br />
<br />
Just wondering- why is the ODS the MP3 item most people go for by default?  Seems like the Crystalline Torque is going to cost you less stats, and is cheaper to boot.<br />
<br />
Thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">For me it was a comparison of what I had as well, but being a troll couldnt wear the IGS so went from :<br />
<br />
Elder Wolf Hide  +10 AC +4 Str +4 Wis +4 Int +30 HP +5.00 Wt   <br />
to<br />
Obulus Death Shroud +10 AC +3 Str +5 Sta +3 Wis +1 vsMg +1 vsFire +1 vsCold +1 vsPos +1 vsDis +25 Mana +2.00 Wt  <br />
<br />
Which with the MP3 is a huge upgrade, whereas in my neck slot I have:<br />
<br />
Medallion of Life  +10 AC +5 Str +5 vsMg +5 vsFire +5 vsCold +5 vsPos +5 vsDis +50 Mana +0.10 Wt   <br />
<br />
So would be quite a drop in AC, Mana and Saves.<br />
<br />
I think the reason a lot of people go for an ODS was it was a pretty nice shoulder item to begin with.  Adding MP3 to it just topped it off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well for me, I use a dragon talisman and it gives hps in addition to resist and wisdom etc, only thing that isn't high is ac.  IGS gives good ac and good resists but my resists are pretty high already and AC is over 1000 so..... I figure I can swap in the IGS if it's really needed. So far I haven't really missed it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Actually had the Torque and figured I would monkey around with it, swap it out, etc.. its pretty much become a perma item now because I am too lazy to remove it and put it back on and spoiled by the mp3</div></div><hr />
