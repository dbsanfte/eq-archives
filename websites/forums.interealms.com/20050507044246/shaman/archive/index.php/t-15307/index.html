<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kenshon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Here's how to do it.  Once you get lvl 29, you're golden.<br />
<br />
Go to Marus Seru.<br />
<br />
Get good hp/ac gear.<br />
<br />
Put on these buffs:<br />
Hp/ac (and any other hp/ac buffs from nearby clerics or druids, etc)<br />
agility - so they miss more...you gain from them missing too<br />
dexterity - for skill gain<br />
frenzy (adds ac and dexterity)<br />
regen<br />
sow<br />
<br />
Go out and collect 4-6 rockhoppers, stonegrabbers, and zelniaks.<br />
Do not pull lightcrawlers and if they add bring your train past guards and guards will kill only the crawlers.<br />
<br />
Find a long stretch to run along.  Go to one end.  Get yourself beat down to 40 percent or so(in case you get chain bashed real badly) and in the meanwhile attack one of them just for chance weapon skill gain.  Run to the other end and heal (Greater healing does 300).  Run to the other end and heal( another 300 - should be near full life if not full). Stand and get beat up to 40.  Rinse Repeat.  When you go oom run to NL zone line, get beat up till around 20, and zone into NL.<br />
<br />
Med up and repeat.<br />
<br />
<br />
At level 29, I'm averaging at least 4 to 6 skillups in defense everytime i did this.  Much quicker than solo tanking.  And then you can just rot root to level if you wish without worrying about defense skill.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ooogly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Needlites in Echo Caverns hit REALLY fast but not for much damage. They are great for getting defensive skill up's at that level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Discordja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">An easier to way to do this is to get a friend to help you out.  Head to echo caverns and pull one of the skeeters.  They hit about a billion times a second but only melee for about 10-15 which makes it very fast skillings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hamenu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Mix in a damage shield and those needlites drop like .. ummm flies? :)  <br />
<br />
Great defensive skillups in echo.</div></div><hr />

A nifty plan for sure and would definitely.  However you don't get any exp.  I think that's the reason tanking mobs is recommended.  You will build your defense, weapon skills, offense and gain exp/loot.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I too am wondering why you need to do this. I got at least 5 skill ups per level up to about 180 skill, when it just slowed down. Both are maxed now anyway.<br />
<br />
I guess if you're having a real problem with skills it would work, but how does one get in that situation in the first place?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>kenshon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My defense was low because I almost always group.  Soloing is so so boring.  And grouped, I rarely get hit, and if the group is running as it should, I shouldn't.<br />
<br />
Solo = no fun.  I like the hectic buffing, slowing, and backup healing.  And always canning.  Good stuff.  <br />
<br />
But anyways thats all over, cause I uninstalled EQ this morning and I'm not planning on coming back.  I've got addiction issues, heh.<br />
