<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>warmag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I posted this in replies in other posts, but repeating here for completeness because I consider this the best of all the things I tried at level 53 to solo up. (Umbral plains in a group will probably be your best bet, by the way for XP at level 53, but if you must solo, here is what I did). Either get yourself alot of fish scales to keep enduring breath on you or buy or camp for a fishbone earring or other enduring breath item so you don't have to worry about ever drowning in there. Swim down to Kedge Keep and invis up and go down the well to where it splits (not all the way to the bottom, but at the split). This is the 2nd floor. The loot off the mobs on 2nd floor is horrible, and you know what that usually means, right? Bad loot = good XP! A word of caution here. The golden haired mermaid is pullable but sometimes her &quot;guardians&quot; a.k.a. stilleto toothed pirhannas are setup so that when you pull her, at least one of the two guardians will come with her and that could equal fast death of your pet, and then yourself if your root doesn't hold on the one you're not fighting. To avoid all the problems you might get by pulling the golden haired mermaid, simply avoid it solo and stick to the stuff right on the 2nd floor.  Also, don't kill the teeny fish or you wind up with pirhanna spawns wandering around in their place and that could really mess up soloing here. Another thing. No AoE spells on 2nd floor or things below you may come up for a visit.<br />
<br />
Setup: invis yourself and swim down to 2nd floor. Setup with a pet in either the east or south cubbyhole. Pull extremely cautiously. The mobs in here you will not always see and generally have a high aggro radius so all you need to do to pull most of these is simply inch carefully towards a mob and it will come right to you, or inch out slowly towards the well and a mob you didn't see before will come to say hello with it's teeth. Buff the pet with HoS, Strength, Dexterity and spirit quickening. Give yourself a HP buff in case root drops off something (so you don't lose too much HP too fast), and inch out into the doorway and you should get aggro'd right there for first pull. Inch out to the left or right just a bit to get 2nd pull. 3rd pull you go to the well in the middle of the room and sort of wait there for the last one or two wanderers. You have to clear these wandering mobs first to safely pull the occupied cubbyholes. Have a &quot;/pet calm down&quot; macro button set so when you get hit you can back the pet up to the cubbyhole you're pulling to. It's very bad to fight outside that cubbyhole or you will get adds. Pull with slow (or if it aggros you first, back up, /pet calm down repeatedly, and cast root on the mob after you get in and then slow it) and then toss an E-bolt. Add a 2nd E-bolt on sharks when it wears off, and keep root up with pet on the mob. For pirhanna you might want to toss in a disease dot because they seem to regenerate or go down in hitpoints slower than other mobs. Just root and rot, med and repeat. Fast from 53 to 54. Clear out about 3 to 4 wandering fish outside the cubbyholes before trying to pull the shark or pirhanna. Also clear to the left and/or right cubby hole (depending on if you are pulling from south or east of room) before pulling the mob across the room from you because the farthest mob from you will bring in adds along the way otherwise. It takes practice to get a system down in a spot like this but the XP is worth it I think. Root and rot and med up. I tried melee on the mobs too with my 2hb that does over 100+ dmg a hit, but it's alot faster with root and rot method because these mobs will take your HP down which equates to more downtime and less HP for canning back mana. I only perfected the teqnique in my last yellow in 53 in Kedge, so hopefully these tips will help others so they don't waste time. <br />
<br />
Ultimately you will have better XP in an Umbral Plains group (which I found better XP surprisingly than even The Hole). Those that want the loot and somewhat decent XP might try OOT zone and hunt seafuries, but I wasn't getting all that great XP there compared to Kedge to be honest. If I could do all of level 53 over again as a barb shaman, and couldn't find a group, I'd definately go with 2nd floor in Kedge. For evil race barbs, or those that don't care about faction hits, you might want to try High Keep as mentioned in another post (sounds like that's the best XP of all from what I'm hearing).<br />

Hope this helps. <br />

1) Mobs don't run when low on health in Kedge, correct?<br />
<br />
2) When did Kedge start turning green to you?  After dinging 54?  or are there still things to hunt up to 56, etc?<br />
<br />
Good post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>warmag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes. Mobs do not run in kedge, and it's also a zone I believe where fear won't work on them either (though shaman blinde does, but I wouldn't advise using it in such a high aggro zone). The reason for root, though, is after slowing and dotting the mob will have you high on its aggro list, so unless you want to melee (which is okay I guess, but not optimal when considering all the downtime off the high hits they'll give you) I would go with root and rot in this particular area. <br />
<br />
First floor is already green to level 53, except for one mob up there. Second floor is primarily all blue to 53 with a few occasional green wanderers. At 54 I still saw blues here and will probably do at least 1 yellow bubble of XP here of 54 to preserve level in case I die later before moving to Umbral Plains to get a taste of that good group XP again. Also, I would not use the level 54 slow on these mobs because I found I think it has a lower percentage ratio on the slow and the older (level 50?) slow seems to work best.<br />
<br />
There are mobs here that will probably get you XP up to 56 I'd imagine but I don't know how safe it is to solo deeper in. I went down to the mermaid caves in a group and a level 60 warrior had no problem taking these things down, but from what I read on Kedge soloing past 2nd floor is really tricky. A druid or ranger could do it, or anyone with mez or harmony because otherwise you chance getting adds. The mermaid area will probably give you adds without harmony on the mob, same with seahorses in spots. I'd stay away from the chapel completely if soloing unless you are really good at what you do and can pull a train all the way up to the top and zone it, come back and pick up what's left behind. I saw a group of 55+ pull Estrella up to the top of zone like this. The puller shouted &quot;Train&quot; but I didn't care because of the soloing spot I was in on 2nd floor south nook was safe (I think they pulled Estrella from east nook route). I went up later and saw Estrella's corpse up by zone. <br />
<br />
I also saw people down in the mermaid area teamed up in pairs. That would be optimal XP in the 54-55 range I bet. Pairs would do well in the mermaid area. Seahorses you'd need at least two people I think to do safely because of wanderers and high aggro which might mean fighting up to 3 mobs at once. - Warmag of MM</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>warmag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">On the day I posted this I saw a level 50 mage on 2nd floor pulling stuff, and before my post this place was pretty much a ghost town so I'm guessing other pet classes read our posts too. I'm glad though that someone found it useful at least, however I noticed that the pirhannas were spawning in place of the wandering little fish, so as a reminder: do not kill the really small fish that wander in this dungeon or you'll get pirhanna wanderers instead which can mess up your soloing really bad with sudden, multiple adds in the middle of a pull. If you see wandering pirhanna on 2nd floor and you didn't kill the tiny fish but see someone else in the zone, remind them to please not kill the tiny fish. - Warmag of MM</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>warmag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Update on this dungeon. I went back and tried south cubbyhole on 2nd floor again at 54. I had to gate out of there at least 3 times from south cubbyhole due to weird adds or pops. Considering there are wandering tiny fish in here and that it's known that killing these will spawn pirhanna, it may be possible that pirhanna will spawn here now at random even without killing the tiny fish, (or maybe the dungeon &quot;senses&quot; I'm higher level and makes the area tougher? I don't know) so my advice is avoid the south cubbyhole or at the least, keep gate up or start out in east cubbyhole with pet, buff up, and kill your way _slowly_ and carefully around the room. The xp in there was awesome at level 53. Stuff starts greening out at 54 though, so I had to move to other places. Anyway, just be careful on 2nd floor in south cubbyhole. I'm finding it a little more challenging there these days and tons easier pulling from the east. - Warmag of MM</div></div><hr />
