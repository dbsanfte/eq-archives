<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Meener</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The only guy I've seen that's as interested in PoG as I am is an epic mage (56).  Until now I've only fought there in groups of 4 or 5.  It's also, um, some of my first experiences with 50+ mobs (I just dinged 50 a few minutes ago).  <br />
<br />
Anyways, my question.  I get up there, he's beating up on something.  I slow it, make a pet, buff up, etc.  Next pull is a Spirit Stalker.  He sends in the pet, I slow it, poison it, wait like 30 secs, then plague it.  No problems so far, I can med even.  Then the pet gets low and he starts to make a new one (chain casting).  As soon as he does /pet get lost the bear starts summoning me.  The new pet can't build up enough aggro.  I died (so did he), and getting a cleric to PoG sucks royally.  <br />
<br />
So, um, how do I not die?  Is there a way for us to do this effectively?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not having a shaman or mage high enough to have tihs problem....still here's some possible suggestions....<br />
<br />
Ask the mage if he/she is willing to not chain cast the pet.  The mage has pet heal spells.  You have heal spells.  Heal the mage pet.<br />
<br />
The mage can mod rod for more mana if needed and you can heal him back up or regen him back up and you can canni for mana or mod rod for mana also.<br />
<br />
If the mage is chain casting, then buffing the pet cannot help, but if the mage is going to try to keep the pet, then you can buff the ac and hp of the pets at a minimum.  If you aren't chain casting pets, then the mage can summon armor for his pet.<br />
<br />
You can tank for the pets and back off to let the pets take damage when you get hurt.   (not sure how that works with summoning mobs).<br />
<br />
If he's an epic mage...it seems mana and time wasteful to be chain summoning epics...of course, he might not be using epic....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Meener</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I can't tank for him, the stalkers double for 300 and I just don't have the AC or HPs.  My gear totally blows (which is why I decided to go ahead and ruin my PoG faction).  <br />
<br />
It's still a problem though, because if I get aggro---I'm dead.  Try explaining to the High Elf Clerics in your guild that you need a res in PoG.  Not pretty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>zymral</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i would agree with the above poster. the main problem is you are not high enough.  One thing you might look at is where your pet is at in refrence to the mage pet and the mob.  If you position him on the other side of the mob there will be no reposits and you will only have to heal your pet (your pet will be closer to the mob and a lower lvl thus your pet will take the agro and the mage pet will be hiting the mobs back alot).  Another thing is heal the pets. when a pet dies all agro is lost but yours isn't so you jump to the top.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Focus on healing (new heal should help with this) rather than dealing damage. Damage is what the Magician and pet are for. As others have said, you want to keep using the same pet fight after fight (esp. as you'll probably want to keep HP, AC, and Regrowth buffs on it). Don't use your wolf pet as it will take pretty much all the hits rather than the Magician pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hail,<br />
<br />
House said &quot;(new heal should help with this)&quot;.<br />
<br />
How so?  Kragg's Mending is level 58.<br />
Superior healing is at 51.<br />
<br />
I recommend leveling to 51 before trying again.<br />
Superior heal will make a big difference for you healing the mage pet.<br />
<br />
Talk the mage into keeping his pet alive would be my advice.<br />
That means HoS, Stamina, regen &amp; haste can go on his pet PLUS Muzzle of whatever (if he's high enough for that, not sure what level mage spell that is), summoned armor, and weapons each time.<br />
<br />
Good luck,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Meener</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">He's 56 with epic.  But I want to go now (whine) :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Sorry, I hadn't noticed where squidly said he just made Level 50.<br />
<br />
Added later:<br />
<br />
Also, don't bother with any buffs that affect Str, Sta, Dex, or attack speed. Burnout has better Str and haste than you can buff (w/ Muzzle of Mardu the pet will probably come close to or hit its haste cap), so your spells will have no effect. Give the pet your best hit point, AC, and regeneration buffs.<br />
<br />
Honestly, without Turgur's, Regrowth, and at least Superior Healing, you're going to be leeching off the Magician :-P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>AlynaRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Frekkels, Stamina has no effect on pets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i dont really like partnering with mages.  last night in the crypt i actually saw a mage pet dispell the mob.  i didn't get a screen shot but my group saw the little blue type as well.  not sure what pet it was.  i can do no damage really with a mage pet there because i always get agro.  since root lasts all of 2 seconds with a mage pet there i get beat.  my pet is worthless with the mage pet tanking since my pet always takes lvl agro.  mobs tend to run since root doesn't hit.<br />
i like necros better but that is a personal choice.  besides now that dots stack you can ebolt and bane while they have ebolt on.  mobs die fast.  with most mobs slowed the necro pet can tank and if it cant it doesn't matter since necros have a few different ways to heal you when you get pounded on.<br />
<br />
my personal view points out of the way.  with your problem i think you need to lvl first :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Falaanla Marr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Mage pets no longer dispel, that was taken out.  Trust me, I've been playing a mage for awhile.  At one time, Epic pets used to dispel, and so did fire pets, but Verant stripped that spell from them.  I have never seen them cast it.<br />
<br />
The Muzzle spell is Muzzle of Mardu.  10-15% haste.  Get one for your doggy if you have one too :)<br />
<br />
If mage is using epic, try to get the mage to give the pet 2 Gnoll Hide Lariats also, that stun is a HUGE benefit.  <br />
<br />
Chaining the epic is NOT a good idea also, make sure said mage knows that.  IF you chaincast, you do it solo with an earth pet :)<br />
<br />
But yeah.  Let pet get aggro, do your normal stuff.  Treat the pet like the Tank it is if you are using it as a tank.   Depending on the playstyle of the mage he may or may not be used to it.<br />
<br />
FYI, Epic has ~ 4k hit points, so healing it is a good investment.<br />
<br />
But yeah, if you are using hte pet as a tank, treat it like one.  Drop your biggest buffs on it.  Give it your biggest regen (Epic pet regens 35 hp/tick already, your regen helps quite a bit more).  The epic pet is quite a beast, though.  IF you are duoing with a mage, you would be MUCH MUCH more efficient wiping through masses of lower dark blues rather thanone higher dark blue.<br />
<br />
I love duoing with a Shaman...like I said, its why I made one of my own.  A Shaman and a mage were virtually MADE for each other :)<br />
