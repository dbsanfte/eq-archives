<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Looking for a complete and current list of Shaman spells.  The more detail the better.  I have been using caster realm.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />
:)&gt;&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Lucy (http://lucy.fnord.net/spelllist.html?classes=SHM&amp;source=Live) pulls its list right from the everquest data files, so you can't get much more accurate or timely information, I reckon. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tavokk Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have to agree. You can't beat Lucy especially when you're wanting detailed information. Even when CastersRealm was keeping the list up to date it still lacked alot of information we'd consider useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Lucy has good facts for sure - but no discussion, and I guess the discussion on spells at eqtrader is less than sterling.  Wish they would put in plan english what the spell does and where it comes from, modifies disease counters by 9 doesn't mean a lot to this ol troll.  Thanks for the responses.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bartmeista</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">counters are actually fairly straight-forward as far as how they work, which is as follows.<br />
<br />
1) mob_047 casts Togor's Insects on your grp's tank<br />
2) your grp's tank tells the grp, &quot;gdi i'm slowed $*^@&quot;<br />
3) at this point i still use SS greaves which has Abolish Disease as a clickable effect so i target 'em, click, and wait for a 'cure' msg.<br />
<br />
this works because if you look at lucys info on Togor's Insects (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=507&amp;source=Live), note the &quot;Increase Disease Counter by 12&quot; portion.  this means the debuff will remain on the person until a) the debuff wears off as its duration expires, or b) we remove 12 Disease counters.<br />
<br />
note that Abolish Disease (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=98&amp;source=Live) removes *36* Disease counters, so we definitely get a happy tank once cast. <br />
<br />
the same applies for other debuffs, curses, etc.  you get the counters on ya, you gotta get the same amount off to 'cure' yourself. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Janathia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just took a look at Lucy and noticed the info on the spells are not quite accurate. For instance they give the same description for Focus of Soul and Focus of the Seventh, saying both give 544 HP's, 75 Str, and 70 Dex. <br />
<br />
Not saying all spell info on Lucy is wrong, just that I noticed this error.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Last time I checked Fo7 and FoSouls gave the same HP/Str/Dex ...<br />
<br />
So long<br />
Nirtox</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Janathia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Last time I checked Fo7 and FoSouls gave the same HP/Str/Dex ...<br />
<br />
So Fo7 is just a group version?   I don't have it yet, but I had assumed it gave more HP's, etc.  /bleh  I've become so accustomed to casting the single targ version, don't know what I'll do with a group version if I ever get it.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>SneakyB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Fo7 is indeed the group version of FoSoul.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">For a spell list, why not try Shaman of Justice? www.planeteq.com/shaman</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">This is the first time I&#8217;ve been to Lucy. Is there a way to sort the spells by level? The only sorts I see are my name and by class.   I consider knowing which spells I get each level to be rather vital information. <br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">In Lucy, click on the class, spells are automatically sorted by level.<br />
<br />
And I have a page that lists all the spells by level and where to buy them.<br />
