<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>EQBendur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My current day-to-day group make-up is shammy/warrior/rogue.<br />
<br />
Another that I think would be ideal is:<br />
<br />
Gnome Chanter: slow/haste/charm/dire charm/tinkering/My own KEI<br />
Halfling Cleric: best heals/best AC buffs/best HP buffs/forage/My own Virtue<br />
Halfling Ranger: track/snare/good dps/forage<br />
<br />
I'm thinking that a Ranger could tank most exp content when backed by a Cleric/Chanter combo.<br />
<br />
So what are your thoughts and why?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Danemoth Spiritconvoker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Im currently working on raising a paladin and a warrior. My trio would either be:<br />
<br />
Shaman/Paladin/Warrior or<br />
Shaman/Paladin/Cleric<br />
<br />
I just need a meat shield or two so Im not always stuck soloing :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lorianna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Warrior / Shaman / Druid<br />
<br />
This is my static group that I hunt with on off-raid nights.  We have all played for 5 years plus, the warrior has 14+K hps and 800+ aa's, both the druid and I are in excess of 400 aa's.<br />
<br />
With this said, this allows us to go and do weird things depending on our moods.  Farm Harbringer's or NC, work faction, visit old world zones (getting to know Mistmoore again), farm for tradeskills, work the tables camp in RCoD, or Taskfiend in MPG, or any camp that MAY be open in WoS, you get the picture.<br />
<br />
Of course, inevitably I am the body that gets left behind when we have to exodus.  Thank goodness the druid also has the no exp rez aa.  <br />
<br />
We really do have alot of fun.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>jolav21</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">SK - Tank/puller(spliting)/snap aggro/snare<br />
Shaman- this is the shammy boards slow/dps/buffs/root cc<br />
cleric- res/heal/buffs<br />
<br />
In my opinion you need:<br />
1. a puller(who can split)<br />
2. A tank<br />
3. healer<br />
4. somone with rez<br />
5. slower<br />
6. snare<br />
<br />
the above combo covers all of these<br />
<br />
I have an SK &amp; cleric friend &amp; we can chain pull in MPG &amp; can keep 1-2 ph`s down in RS. Not easy but it is doable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Enchanter slowing is doable in some cases, but rather iffy. Unlike Malo(s), their MR debuff carries  high agro, their slow is only Magic based and whimpier, their armor is basically paper once the Rune is gone, etc. You make want to make sure that the person who will be playing the Enchanter is comfortable with constantly slowing before he commits himself, it's not for everybody.<br />
<br />
Also, you are often better off buying long lasting buffs like KEI and Virtue in PoK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>leibeast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">pally/warr/sk (yes any of the above)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Necromancer :D Army of one.<br />
<br />
Crowd control and mana regen (chanter)<br />
FD split pulling  (monk/sk)<br />
Rez (cleric)<br />

And the list goes on ......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Percent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">This is a trio I often run with (myself + 2 players not me 3-boxing) and we work really well together.  Myself (68 shm), 66 mage, 65 bard.  The mage's pet when fully buffed is close to 10k hp (he's got most pet AAs) and takes aggro quite well.  We've only recently started testing our limits on things to try but have been using LDoN to guage group abilities.  We haven't had a loss or death yet and usually finish between 30 - 40 minutes at a casual pace.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shlob</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I would have to say Shaman Monk and Enchanter. shamans can heal slow buff and now 0% rez. monks if outfitted right can take hits better hits then tanks! ench is for my C3 haste and MR resist since i have the other ones just fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Froggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">My normal group when I played was... necro, shaman, sk. I covered heals, SK tanked, necro blasted stuff with DoTs and what ever else he did. If CC was needed, the necro would kite or use undead mez or I would root with VP and keep it locked down. The SK was in full elemental and VT gear, before OOW mind you, and he could handle 2-3 mobs if it was needed, I could handle a mob if it came down to it, and the necro was possibly one of the most skilled players I ever played with, and could survive off of most encounters.<br />
<br />
Not that it matters, but that was my ideal group, made up of friends.<br />
<br />
I guess the best group I would do is...<br />
<br />
depending on content...<br />
<br />
Shaman<br />
SK<br />
Beastlord</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>phatteydump</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If i was to be 3boxing, i would go with-<br />
    -Shaman (buffs, slows, heals, cute pet)<br />
    -Mage (insane pet, nukes, summoned toys, dmg shields, easy contorlability for boxing)<br />
    -War or SK(*War*duh, hes a tank, thats what he does-*SK*Decent tank, pulls, FD, Summon, another pet, free horse)<br />
<br />
*on a side note, i think i would go with the war in this sittuation just cause it would be a LOT easier to box, but you lose a ton of the skills that a SK brings to the table.  Then again, you could just lose the tank altogether and keep it Mage Sham combo and own everything anyway*<br />
<br />
<br />
Grping i would have a-<br />
    -Chanter (Crack, Haste, buffs, CC, slow, pulls)<br />
    -Cleric (Heals, buffs, and Rez, what more could you ask for?)<br />
    -War (again, hes a tank, hes there to get hit, lots)<br />
<br />
*anyone notice how that is the fabled &quot;Holy Trinity&quot;...sad but true, you can do almost anything you want with those 3 chars.*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>EQBendur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I always suspected that a shaman/mage could do awesome 2-box.  Here is the progression of character combos that lead me to my current.<br />
<br />
Started with Cleric.<br />
<br />
Started a Necro on the same account.<br />
<br />
Moved Necro to a different account and had quite a bit of fun with a charmed snake in The Grey.  Eventually (I think I was shard hunting) I realized I just needed more beef to tank certain situations and had always been impressed with the earth pets ability to take a beating.<br />
<br />
Started a mage on the same account as the necro.<br />
<br />
Epic'd the mage via the funds of my main, the Potter Cleric.<br />
<br />
This did me quite well, but then I realized that more and more, the Cleric was a pull toy and little more than complete heals and buffs on the pet.<br />
<br />
Acquired a third account when a friend quit.  That account had a much more well geared mage, so started a shaman on my mage account.<br />
<br />
Ya still with me?<br />
<br />
Anyway, that was on a PvP server.  Got the gf into the game and knew she wouldn't want to deal with PvP, so moved cold turkey and started new.<br />
<br />
She had never played anything like this before, so had her start a warrior.  Figured itd be the easiest to learn on.<br />
<br />
Created a shaman as my main, figuring that when slowed, the shaman could keep the warrior healed through most situations.<br />
<br />
Created a rogue to 2-box with the shammy.  I just hated all those times when I wanted to do something that needed a lock picked.<br />
<br />
Anyway, that's my story.  All toons are level 55 now, but was just &quot;dreaming&quot; of other possible combinations.  Something perhaps that would challenge the GF a bit more.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Me... I would go:<br />
<br />
Shaman - cc, heals, cures, slow, haste, and so on...<br />
Paladin - *cough* backup heals, stuns, some cc ability, decent hp buffs, other utility also<br />
Rogue - DPS, access to locked areas needing picklock, Corpse recovery if things go horribly wrong ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>EQBendur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Paladin - *cough* backup heals, stuns, some cc ability, decent hp buffs, other utility also<br />
<br />
I ALMOST went with that exact combo but was afraid that she wouldn't pick up on what to cast and when, etc...<br />
<br />
Bendur</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Warrior - best tank<br />
Cleric - best healer<br />
Bard - best at everything they can do, and they can do almost everything</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Ideally you would want:<br />
<br />
Rez (Cleric, Paladin, possibly Necromancer)<br />
Healing (Cleric, Druid, Shaman)<br />
Tanking (Paladin, Shadowknight, Warrior, Ranger, Beastlord)<br />
Haste/Slow (Shaman, Enchanter, Bard, Beastlord)<br />
Mana Regen (Enchanter, Bard, Beastlord)<br />
Snare (Ranger, Druid, Shadowknight, Bard)<br />
Stun (Paladin, Cleric, Enchanter)<br />
Crowd Control (Enchanter, Bard)<br />
Single Pulling (Bard, Monk, Shadowknight, Enchanter, Cleric)<br />
<br />
And of course as much DPS as you can squeeze in. Some decent combinations are:<br />
<br />
Shaman/Warrior/Necromancer (only missing stun. nice DPS)<br />
Druid/Enchanter/Paladin (Next to no abilities overlap. lowish DPS without charm)<br />
Cleric/Shadowknight/Beastlord (low on mana regen, slow and haste)<br />
<br />
And so on . . . basically select a healer or tank, select the other to overlap the first in as few areas as possible, select the third to bring as many abilities as possible from those you are missing.<br />
<br />
Now if you are content with limited content you can get almost any group with a shaman in it to work (I only ever seem to have trouble fitting in wizards in my odd groups).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Froggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Shaman and druids are now in the Rez group if you dont mind a 0% now, xp rez later method to doing things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Hrendra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">From an infrequent poster but daily 3boxer, my own experience ;) SK, shaman, cleric has strong durability. There's a balance that needs to be struck between dps and durability. Occasionally I wished I had more dps in the lower levels, but do fine as it is now. Never run out of mana, invis, ivu, recover and rez corpses, two pets for offtanking, group healer, patch healer, self healer (SK), ch, fast heals, hot's, feign pull, lull pull, debuffs, two rezzers (at 70), three classes that aren't fragile. It's a strong trio that successfully trios in zones up to Riftseeker's. Only thing I'd ever potentially replace the shaman with would be a beastlord for more dps. =p My better half had her cleric first, then I designed the other two to complement her. My goal was to have a lot of freedom to do what I/we wished and not be limited by lack of certain abilities.</div></div><hr />
