<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dekurgen Heyokah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I had a question regarding our potion Mystical Aptitude. It raises the effective casting level of the caster by 3 level's. I know this decreases fizzle rate, but does it then also apply to resists? Meaning if a level 65 shaman throws a slow on a mob while having this effect, is the casting level of the shaman level 68 in regards to the mobs ability to resist the slow? If so, this potion would have a greater desirablity for shaman, wizards...well, all casters really as we all know what a difference a level makes.<br />

 A fellow shaman observed he had less resists while using this potion(he had left overs from GM trophy attempts). But we havent tested it fully yet and I was wondering if anyone else had. If that is the case, VT shield with Brilliance of Ro(raises effective casting level by 20) would seem too overpowering, but I couldnt help asking.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Big discussion on it, from shortly before PoP came out.<br />
<br />
Definitely reduces fizzles.  In my limited time playing with Mystical Aptitude, it seemed to let me land things better.<br />
<br />
Haven't touched it since then.  Random number generator seems to give me huge streaks in my resists and/or successes anyway, so a test pool of just about 100 casts or so (IIRC) isn't that big.</div></div><hr />
