<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Still enjoying myself in OoW so please dont think this is a complaining post.<br />
<br />
First couple of weeks in WoS I found myself able to Malos,Slow,Bane x 2 and ussually a SoT on most mobs.<br />
Now I seem to be finding that as others in group get their spells and gear that mobs are now dying in probably half the time they used to and that if i Malos,Slow then i can probably get 1 Bane and maybe 1 Yoppas dd off on mob before it dies.<br />
Not quite as easy in MPG but still the mobs are dying quicker than they used to.<br />
What this has got me to wondering is that if in a couple of months or so when everyone is up to date with gear and spells are we going to find ourselves in the same position as before OoW and everyones going to be concentrating on DPS for groups and Shaman are going to be left out in the cold again ?.<br />
The wife has a 66 Beastlord and on release of OoW she struggled to find a group there whereas I had no problem now she has no problem getting a group and Im getting nowhere near as many offers as before.<br />

As the others gear up and Spell up. We will become less useful in full groups.<br />
<br />
 Right now people like the security that a shaman can bring. I mena if we die three times a night then they don't But as it gets more trivial We will become less useful to the min/max groups. But will become mroe useful to the Oddball/ Farm groups. <br />
<br />
Dps will still be king. And as it ramps up and people learnt he encounters and how to mix/max the groups we will become less and less desired. Because we still do nothing fast. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bartmeista</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">*shrug*  I'm absolutely loving our AA's and spells (with the small exception of having, /gasp, too many buffs now to do at raids, but I'll live :) ).  I'm still seeing not shortage in demand for Shaman, I don't go lfg in WoS or wherever often, but when I pass through or we're hitting a few quick raid targets there I see those Shaman that do lfg there get snatched up pretty quickly.<br />
<br />
Once more folks start doing PG and moreso the trials from within PG, the demand should be there as well.  Do you need a shammie for all of them?  No.  But we're certainly adding more to some of those trials than many other classes are able to.  Not to mention the loot there owns.  :D <br />
<br />
We can output some fast damage between the new poison rain and DD imo.  Does it match that of a Wizzie, Mage, or even a determined Druid?  Of course not, but that's not what we do best.  But it sure is nice to lay down the rain, get a crit (or two) on half the rains and fire off Yoppa's Spear while the rain continues to fall on the mob.  Doing 5k in 10 or 12 seconds isn't exactly horrible if you ask me.  That on top of dog dog and a dot if it's not the fastest fight in the world.</div></div><hr />

At the moment beastlords are actually crying, and crying hard because they do not feel they can:<br />
1. Function as slowers due to no spells that lower mobs magic resistance<br />
2. Function adequately(sp?) as dps due to their dps being split 3 ways (pet/spell/melee) and they need 3 times the aa a wizard needs to get a comparable dps increase.<br />

Like when paladins seriously expected to tank like warriors (better actually) and heal better than shaman, running about overpowered creates a certain expectation and re-calibrating can be a noisy process.</div></div><hr />

Try this on for size:<br />
Oh I have no doubt Shamans are whining. Ratcheting down to being merely &quot;overpowered&quot; always results in the biggest class whines.  <br />
Think in context of how other classes viewed shamans from, say, Velious onward.  Even go back to kunark if you like.<br />

Kind of interesting no?</div></div><hr />

*gasp!* Because we all know that would be so unlike some other classes which will remain nameless lol =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Just because you feel we cannot put out dps doesn't mean we aren't doing well.  We have the ability to play backup and even primary healer now, and our buffs are back to what they were meant to be.<br />
<br />
Reading your description, I would recommend varying your DPS.  If you're group is killing quick, and you don't have too many mezzed mobs in camp, load up your rains and go to town.  If you're worried about waking locked down mobs, load Bane and Anathema instead of trying to stack Bane twice (or drop ice/poison dd's after Bane).  Point is you can't just rely on one spell for DPS.<br />
<br />
In my experience, I'd say Shaman in my guild getting alot more group offers than Beastlords right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Man, I must read these boards too often, I knew Snoww's response before he made it.  :)<br />
<br />
I've done WoS with pickup groups that were strong (all above my level, 66/41), where I felt less than totally needed, and I've played with guys similar in level/ability to me (no omens or gates spells), where I kept very busy and they were very happy to have me there.  Just depends on the group, camp, and mobs you are pulling.  Nothing new here, same can be said about most zones.  Sure, some camps really need cc, so a chanter is prefered, others can make due with high dps and unreliable slow, so a BST is best.<br />
<br />
However, in either case, a shammy can provide most of the same functions, cc with root or VP, dps with rains and dots, to a decent degree.  Add our spot heals and other benefits (really don't want to have this conversation again) and we are a solid choice in most cases.  Not always the best choice in every case, but solid in most.  We have better dps than a chanter (most don't charm in omens for obvious reasons) and better heals/slow than a BST (slowing, even with mitigation, still makes a difference, especially with more than 1 mob in camp).<br />
<br />
And, let's be real, as others gear up and get their new spells, so will we.  Group HoT, better buffs w/over stat and other modifiers, etc, still allow us to contribute and be wanted.<br />
<br />
Guess I'm still looking at the glass half full, and don't really see it changing dramatically.</div></div><hr />

Care to clarify in regards to how you think Beastlords are faring compared to Shamans?  Or don't, just dont know what you were trying to say here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I think Beastlords and shaman are both fine in Omens.<br />
<br />
Both are viable and valuable.<br />
<br />
As time passes, Beastlords will find that Omens suits them more and more.  It's an extremely good design for them, and suits their strengths.  That they whine unreasonably doesn't mean a thing.<br />
<br />
Ronax, I think that's a perfectly reasonable observation about shaman too.</div></div><hr />

Are you actually referring to my posts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">As the others gear up and Spell up. We will become less useful in full groups.<br />
Not gonna flat-out disagee Snoww, but I will say this. While our role may adjust, I dont think our usefulness will. Sorry, but Shaman are viable, even in the 45 second fight world, mostly thanks to a few key things. One is Balance of Nihil, another is our reasonable AE rain and poison nuke, and still another is killer AA that allow us to contribute in many more situations that we every could in Gates. <br />
<br />
The things you mention are things that are going to happen to 3/4's of the classes in the game. Thats just the nature of the beast. Hopefully, by the time the game gets COMPLETELY trivial, there will be something new to hold our attention. <br />
<br />
I am a medium level player, gear and progression wise, and PG isnt totally trivial yet. The trials are very tricky, and fun. Riftseekers CERTAINLY isnt even remotely to be considered &quot;easy&quot;. I see trials, events, etc all over that will continute to challange people in WoS, PG, RCDS, Nobles, etc. <br />
<br />
Are shaman going to become less &quot;desirable&quot; in group XP grind situations? Sure. But at least now we have respectable tools to contribute in almost every situation, even the high DPS-low HP mob battles like KT. Epic effect, Ancestral Aid, 900 damage AE, 1K damage fast nuke, 2300 hp fast heal, these are reasonable tools. And lets face it, our 1.5 second casting slow is still a very valuable spell, even in 45 second fights vs mitigating mobs. <br />
<br />
IMHO, we are not going to end up as far down the scale as we were for Gates. I think our spot is firmly cemented in the group &quot;food-chain&quot;, which is far more than I can say for some other classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">(Laughs)<br />
<br />
Sorry for being so predictible Thunderwolf. If I am anything I am consistant. <br />
<br />
It isnt the fact that I think we suck. I try to never say that. Cause playing Snoww is my choice in the game. And I have a multitude of classes to choose from. On my own accounts A Level 65 Enchanter with 140ish aa . A level 60 thief with 1 AA and ragebringer. And a Level 67 SK with 150ish aa. Plus Snoww. I always play Snoww first and foremost. <br />
<br />
We do not suck In omens content. In Gates content. Or any other content in the game. We can contribute to any group in the game. And I mean any. But our contributions are marginalized to medium level roles. We are the inbetweeners. We do nothing in the game btter than anyone else. Except slow. And with that we have been mitagated into parity with the three other classes who can slow as a group role plus add more to the table. <br />
<br />
If you have a cleric in your group In current content. You are better off with Bards, Beastlords. Or chanters all whom can do other things besides slow. <br />
<br />
Our other thing is heal. And Our heals are overwritten. By the said cleric. (HoTs) Our Blast heals are useful, but in the age of 15K tanks. Come on. We are only half as good as a cleric. And for our heal to matter we will more than likly be healing somone beside the tank. And the Balance AA for clerics do a much better job. Plus thier group heals And AA heals and group Torpor. (With no side effects)<br />
<br />
Druids With thier better blast heals can actually help a cleric. Or can slide over to Nuking. Yes we can apply damage as well. But it is our thrid role in the group and as we all know due to resist rates Malos is needed so we are alot slower than most at doing our damage. (Not to mention our damage is end loaded)<br />
<br />
People like the new spells. Good. I like them too. <br />
People like the new longer fights. Good I like them too. <br />
People are amazed at our ability to heal in current content. Or be viable in groups just like others classes at the prescribed roles we have been playing with for years.  Oh wait. Very very few can heal in MPG and beyond. Yet clerics can heal just fine. Even at much lower levels. and Gear and ability than said shaman. <br />
<br />
Ahh well. Back to work. But The balance has not changed. We are below where we need to be. And in fact lower than in Gates. Because in gates Every single mob did not mitagate slow. Now they do. And we are farther out.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I'm having fun there and actually feel quite useful. Recently I've been hunting in RCoD and MPG mainly. (I avoid WoS like the plague - I hate overcrowded zones)<br />
<br />
Shamans are the most reliable class for slows since after malos our slows are almost always landing in OoW, at least where I've been hunting. A chanter can tash but they have to be more careful not to draw aggro and Beastlords have to keep hitting their slows hoping it sticks. (or have a mage present to Mala) <br />
<br />
Already I've found myself using abilites I have that Beastlords don't that help and even save my group. I can HoT to help clerics save mana and concentrate more on blast heals and CHes. I can add +7% to avoidance thus further saving clerics mana and help lessen close calls and sometimes maybe even saving a wipe. There's even been times where we've had adds roam into us and I've used VP to knock the mob back and out of range before it could finish killing off our cleric.<br />
<br />
The ghetto rez (which I still need one level for) and both HoT's are very nice additions. We also really lucked out on an relatively easy epic 1.5.<br />
<br />
I'm also really enjoying the new rain spell. It's decent DPS at least when all 3 waves hit. And can usually get it off twice in a battle. (unless I'm in a high DPS group) And with the new canni I'm relying less on mass canni and I'm never running low on mana.<br />
<br />
I think if people spent less time worrying about other classes and more time trying to enjoy themselves they might actually have a good time.<br />
<br />
That pretty much sums it up for me. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, the new canni, yea that's horrible on my mana but i love it.  Becuase i have so much more time i nuke more and my mana bar actually moves down... though i still can't run myself oom heh.</div></div><hr />

Our healing isn't as far behind as I think you're describing.  Just because you can't heal all or the majority of a big arse tank in 1 blast heal doesn't mean you're not useful.  What's it matter if the tank has 10k or the tank has 15k?  He's still going to be taking about the same dmg (obviously there will be a difference because the 15k'er will likely have higher AC and probably more AA's, etc., but I'm talking in terms of only HP's).  The 15k tank just has more of a &quot;buffer&quot; if you will, and will only take a larger effort to heal (or a string of lucky crits :) ) if he's at a very low amount of health.  But he's not going to require more healing just because he has more HP's, if that makes sense.<br />
<br />
I've solo healed for numerous hours straight before in PG without any issues.  Just toss BoTrushar on as mob is inc, debuff/slow, blast heal as needed and refresh Trushar so it's on full time.  Rarely have my tanks ever gotten low unless I'm not paying full attention ( :eek: ).  We've handled two and three at a time even with ghetto CC, though I wouldn't recommend that at all, hehe.  Add epic 1.5 if you have it as well as Ancestral Aid for the more &quot;hairy&quot; situations, like 2/3 pulls, and you certainly help yourself out some.  Not to mention Spiritual Channeling if you start running low on gas.  It's only going to get easier when folks pickup Spiritual Serenity too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
not going to go into everything. i tend to be too long winded as it is. will say this though:<br />
<br />
get an add or 2 in Riftseekers--no matter how uber your group (was there with 2448 ac pally and similar chars)...they'll be glad they brought you :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Ahh well. Back to work. But The balance has not changed. We are below where we need to be. And in fact lower than in Gates. Because in gates Every single mob did not mitagate slow. Now they do. And we are farther out.<br />
I disagree, by a large margin. Slow HAD to be reduced in effectiveness. It is just too powerful. But now, we have been given far more tools and utility to add to a group. Better heals, 2 group HoTs, better nukes, etc. Honestly I dont WANT more healing. I dont WANT to be a main healer in PG groups. Healing bores me. I think we are approaching a very, very nice balance of healing, DPS, and other utility that makes us very solid group members, even factoring in the current &quot;everything mitigates slow&quot; state of the game. <br />
<br />
At any rate, there is just no way we are lower than we were in Gates, no way. In Gates we had puny nukes and puny heals and no group HoT. Gates spells were difficult to obtain, as well. I never even got my Gates heal. Only had Trushar about a month before I got Serenity. But those two spells, the OoW heal and HoT, are more than adequate for me. Add in Epic effect, Ancestral Aid, and a big regen, and my ability to heal my group is more than satisfactory to me. New pet, new fast nuke, new Curse, new AE, and my ability to contribute DPS is pretty close to where I want it as well. New buffs are just gravy, especially considering that Wunshi could parse out as the best new buff in the game (overcap STR is thought to add to % of max hits, overcap DEX is thought to add to proc-rate). <br />
<br />
I really think its a matter of how you look at the glass. Half-full, or half-empty. I stopped comparing myself to other classes, and started rating myself by my effectiveness vs the content, and no matter how I slice it, I am contributing a MILLION times more than I ever did in Gates.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Considering I had a group the other day use me for replacing a cleric (no other healers or slowers) I think at least some know of what we are capable of. I think our biggest problem in getting groups is that those that do not know or run a shaman, they have no idea of what we are capable of.<br />
<br />
The problem has more to do with education of the ignorant rather than &quot;adjustments&quot; to class balance.<br />
<br />
Well, at least that is how I see it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Spells that are just standard percent increases are not upgrades if they are part of a new expansion, they are merely adjusted old spells to keep up with the expansion.  Hence, our new nukes and heals are not upgrades when they are the same flat % increase from previous expansions.<br />
<br />
&quot;We finally have a 2k+ heal!&quot; - that is not equate to an upgraded heal.  We got a new heal, as expected, that is almost the exact same HP/Mana and the exact same cast time as our previously lacking heals.  Just because a new heal provides bigger numbers but still lacks in the same areas doesn't make it an upgrade.<br />
<br />
There are several new abilities and spell effects we got which will help but for now Shamans get groups because the fights are long enough we can really contribute.  As the original poster noted, OoW fights are getting shorter.  The shorter the fights get the less desireable we are.  Hopefully our new abilities and spell effects will compensate for that loss.<br />
<br />
Basically, once the fights are down to 30-40 seconds again, which it seems like they are headed towards, will our %modifier buffs, overcap buffs, group HoT, AA revive, and other *real* upgrades be enough to keep us in groups?  I hope so.  Beastlords won't be whining once the fights get shorter.</div></div><hr />

Normally I would agree with this statement wholeheartedly, but in this case, I dont think it applies as much. OoW mobs, for the most part, dont hit like Gates mobs. OoW is an easier expansion, in general, and our power was adjusted upward (granted so was everyone elses, but again, I am trying NOT to compare us to other classes, only to the content itself). <br />
<br />
Yeah, we got a bunch of spells we SHOULD have gotten to keep pace in Gates. But we didnt, and its time to stop whining about that. We got them now. OoW content is far more balanced for Shaman than most of Gates. A big part of the reason we got stronger is that the content itself is more in tune with our abilities. So the 2K heal, the group HoTs, the new fast nuke and bigger AE ARE upgrades, considering the content was essentially DOWNGRADED, to a degree. <br />
<br />
Also, a large reason I feel better about my class isnt the spells that just got &quot;percentage increases&quot;, but the NEW abilities we recieved. Rez, group-MGBable HoT, overcap, % to abilities buffs, etc.</div></div><hr />

So the 2K heal, the group HoTs, the new fast nuke and bigger AE ARE upgrades, considering the content was essentially DOWNGRADED, to a degree. <br />
<br />
Also, a large reason I feel better about my class isnt the spells that just got &quot;percentage increases&quot;, but the NEW abilities we recieved. Rez, group-MGBable HoT, overcap, % to abilities buffs, etc.<br />

Of course you do. If not, why would you own Kunark? <br />
<br />
The game IS the expansions, period. Our class is balanced against OoW spells and 1 Gates spell, Balance of Nihil. <br />
<br />
This &quot;gotta buy an expansion for balance&quot; crap is a big cop-out. Did you buy Kunark? Velious? PoP? Those are &quot;expansions&quot; you know. Balanced against 2+ year old content is irrelevant. The ONLY balance that really matters these days is whats out now. If you dont want to be more powerful, dont buy expansions.</div></div><hr />

All enjoyment of the new content aside. The classes are not balanced. Not within even the basic archtypes.<br />
<br />
Can a group with a shaman survive in current content at approximitly the same power level.<br />
<br />
How about with a druid.?<br />
<br />
How about with a cleric.?<br />
<br />
What classes are needed to supoort each group to achive flexibility and effectiveness. With each priest archtype? You get balance by looking at the abilities of each class in current content.<br />
<br />
<br />
As the content gets easier due to people advancing in gear and spells We will suffer a downgrading in utilitys usefulness. Once again, once it is all weighed and measured and pulls are learned DPS will be the king. And specilists will rule the day once again. I know this is the way of the game. But just because I know it doesnt mean I agree with it. <br />
<br />
We need on the whole a few simple changes. And then. I would shut the hell up. (Really I swear)<br />
<br />
1. Our Hots need to have at least 2 ticks added to each of thier base durations. And they HAVE to be able to stack with a clerics. (Effect we can heal more damage efficently and Give us time to debuff and blast heal while applying some damage. And Stacking witha  cleric means we are a team once again. Rather than master and flunky when it comes to heals)<br />
<br />
2. We have to have a viable Single target heal that is effective in content that now has 100% slow mitagation as a reality. That means ditching the 48% of a clerics effectivness Paradigm. The number should be at least 65%. (Effect. Shaman become actual secondary group healers. Clerics are breaking 10K hps now. Come on)<br />
<br />
3. Priests with the call of the wild ability should have another aa option. 3 6 9 XP returned with call of the wild. 25% 45% And the third rank should be able to enable a druid with the call of the wild ability to stack thier xp recovery as well.  So if both the shaman and the druid cast it on the same corpse 90% of the total xp lost can be recovered.  If they work in conjunction.  (Effect A shaman and a druid together can replace a cleric. But still not be as efficent or as effective  as a true cleric in his specilized role.)<br />
<br />
4. A reemergance of the true Battle priest role we had. Up the duration of Rabid bear. Or lower the recast. And add too it a Massive increase in hit point recovery while in that form but a steady loss of mana that limits spell casting ability greatly. Much like the old rage line before it became a watered down self buff.  ( I am being selfish here. I started Snoww because of the idea of the feral healer. And After I raged for the first time I was completly solidly hooked. Or role has always been the grease between the gears. Makign everything flow better. And I find that role has deminished with a lessoning of our individual toolsets. I miss feeling effective enough to meele when the situation can allow it.  <br />
<br />
<br />
There you go. Do I want to main heal in groups. Hell no. I dislike it. I am a poor healer overall in mindset and playstyle. I much prefer the changing role in combat that allows me to shore up the weak points of the group. But our toolset as it stands is lacking. In content while useing the full range of my abilities granted to me with no error on my part I cannot keep up in locations where a druid or a Cleric can heal easily.<br />
<br />
<br />
In three months we will be close to where we were in Gates. Useful unless a better class is around.  I don't want that again.<br />

Short answer, yes, definitely.  The only place in current content I have a hard time keeping a group up is in RS and PG trials (duh).  Everywhere else I've taken a group in OoW I have been able to solo heal over the duration of the group without issue.<br />

<br />
How will we become less desirable as WE OURSELVES get our upgrades, some of which address your below issues, at least partially anyways?<br />
<br />
1. Our Hots need to have at least 2 ticks added to each of thier base durations. And they HAVE to be able to stack with a clerics. (Effect we can heal more damage efficently and Give us time to debuff and blast heal while applying some damage. And Stacking witha  cleric means we are a team once again.

<br />
We're already healing at about 21% more effectiveness with out HoT's over a Cleric.  Yeah, healing 4920 - 5740 over 36-42 seconds sucks huh?  Our ability to heal other players and ourselves over time has already been significantly increased with the addition of epic 1.5 clicky and Anc. Aid.  Those on top of our castable HoT already makes us a viable main healer as necessary.  I'm like you, I'd rather go just debuffs and dps, but if another main healer isn't available, so be it, we move on and get some exp and I main heal.<br />
<br />
2. We have to have a viable Single target heal that is effective in content that now has 100% slow mitagation as a reality. That means ditching the 48% of a clerics effectivness Paradigm. The number should be at least 65%. (Effect. Shaman become actual secondary group healers. Clerics are breaking 10K hps now. Come on)<br />
<br />
Yoppa's crits for over 5k (believe 5450 or so is my current record) consistently for me, I don't consider that horribly weak either.  Would I take an upgrade, yeah.  We could use a slight one on the spot, you are correct.  I just don't know exactly how much of one would be best for overall balance.  Our HoT's really offset how much of a big blast heal they give us, hehe.<br />
<br />
3. Priests with the call of the wild ability should have another aa option. 3 6 9 XP returned with call of the wild. 25% 45% And the third rank should be able to enable a druid with the call of the wild ability to stack thier xp recovery as well.

<br />
Hmm, that's an interesting idea actually, works for me!<br />
<br />
4. A reemergance of the true Battle priest role we had. Up the duration of Rabid bear. Or lower the recast.

<br />
I agree that Rabid Bear has long needed an upgrade, it never really was all that even when it first came out.  Give it a lower re-use time, more effectiveness, and make it stack with FA so we too can be attack ho's!  :)<br />
<br />

Our toolset received many great upgrades with OoW, I simply don't see how you can say we're so lacking.  Could we use a little work still, certainly.  But we're far from being as horribly underpowered (esp. with respect to healing) as you're making us sound.  My 2cp.</div></div><hr />

6k+?  500 AAs?  I have about half that.  Not only that, but ya got the healing #s wrong.  And a cleric should be able to heal better than us, no questions.<br />

It may all be very true.  But we ALL know all of this already.  How many times do we have to see it?  It's common knowledge that people think SOE sucks.  It's common knowledge that people think EQ sucks.  That we're out of balance.  It's all personal opinion and perspective, 50% wrong/50% right.  It's a on-going saga.  There are Time-geared shamans who think EQ sucks, and there are level 63 baz-geared shamans who think EQ rocks, and vice versa.  It's all perspective.  We've heard a lot of perspectives.<br />

He said keeping a group going with similarly geared/leveled group members.  I was simply replying with my direct experiences, way to make this into another &quot;uber/non-uber&quot; debate, nice job.<br />
<br />
What's so hard to understand about Clerics doing a better job at healing than we do?  That's THEIR glory, their reason for being.  We shouldn't be better at overall healing than they are, it's as simple as that.<br />
<br />
With respect to the HoT's... <br />
<br />
Spiritual Serenity is 820 hp/tick for 520 mana = 1.58 hp/mana.<br />
Pious Elixir is 1170 hp/tick for 890 mana = 1.31 hp/mana.<br />
<br />
Our HoT is 20.6 % more efficient.</div></div><hr />

The first part is fine, but stacking with Cleric HoT is kind of absurd. Your saying we should be able to combo for nearly 2K a TIC on an HoT? Never happen, just put the idea out of your head. I do not want the game made that trivial. There would be no need to even have another heal memmed. <br />
<br />
2. We have to have a viable Single target heal that is effective in content that now has 100% slow mitagation as a reality. That means ditching the 48% of a clerics effectivness Paradigm. The number should be at least 65%. (Effect. Shaman become actual secondary group healers. Clerics are breaking 10K hps now. Come on)<br />
I will agree with this, in theory, but again, this is a topic that has been done to death to SOE. They have decided that we have enough additional utility to justify just a low percentage in the &quot;archtype&quot;, and frankly, I think they are right in some ways. For mysself, I am sick of ratios vs other classes. Is my heal adequate to save someone in a hectic situation? Yes. Is my healing ability powerful enough to contribute to a group? Yes. 2400-2500 heal, with a fair chance to crit, on top of an ourstanding HoT, and 2 group HoT options, is enough for me. Yeah, ok, maybe swap our Ancient heal out, and make it another 70 spell, or something. Fine. But you know something, its not worth getting my stomach all tied up in a knot about. Our healing ability is adequate within the role SOE has decided we fit in the overall scheme of things. And your theory that as the content gets more &quot;solved&quot;, we will become less desirable, has a counter-theory. As the content gets more &quot;solved&quot; our ability to main-heal that content goes up, because we CAN ADEQUATELY HEAL in most of those situations now. <br />
<br />
3. Priests with the call of the wild ability should have another aa option. 3 6 9 XP returned with call of the wild. 25% 45% And the third rank should be able to enable a druid with the call of the wild ability to stack thier xp recovery as well.  So if both the shaman and the druid cast it on the same corpse 90% of the total xp lost can be recovered.  If they work in conjunction.  (Effect A shaman and a druid together can replace a cleric. But still not be as efficent or as effective  as a true cleric in his specilized role.)<br />
Reasonable, but 2 hours to rez a corpse USUALLY isnt that big a deal. Where are you hunting? The halls of PG or wall in WoS? Drag to a cleric when group breaks up. In an instance? Pop out, go grab a rez, get a new one, or /dzadd a cleric and drag to the ZI. In most situations, its not that difficult to get your called-corpse rezzed later. People arent going to want a 25% or 45% rez. Will those corpses still be cleric-rezzable? If so, what diffference does this make? If not, people would likely rather wait for a better % rez. <br />
<br />
4. A reemergance of the true Battle priest role we had. Up the duration of Rabid bear. Or lower the recast. And add too it a Massive increase in hit point recovery while in that form but a steady loss of mana that limits spell casting ability greatly. Much like the old rage line before it became a watered down self buff.  ( I am being selfish here. I started Snoww because of the idea of the feral healer. And After I raged for the first time I was completly solidly hooked. Or role has always been the grease between the gears. Makign everything flow better. And I find that role has deminished with a lessoning of our individual toolsets. I miss feeling effective enough to meele when the situation can allow it. <br />
I find this option attractive, and gladdly support it, but its hardly a deal-breaker for me at this point. <br />
But our toolset as it stands is lacking. In content while useing the full range of my abilities granted to me with no error on my part I cannot keep up in locations where a druid or a Cleric can heal easily.<br />
And SOE knows this, and has decided not to make more adjustments in this direction. Dead horse theory to the extreme. Our healing was bumped up. Our DPS was bumped up. Our buffing was bumped up. The mobs in OoW arent really bumped up compared to Gates, so we are STRONGER. <br />
In three months we will be close to where we were in Gates. Useful unless a better class is around.  I don't want that again.<br />
And once again, I disagree. We have a MUCH wider set of tools now, enough to keep us an attractive option. <br />
Our toolset received many great upgrades with OoW, I simply don't see how you can say we're so lacking.  Could we use a little work still, certainly.  But we're far from being as horribly underpowered (esp. with respect to healing) as you're making us sound.  My 2cp.<br />

<br />
I assume you mean clerics always have a place in a group.  That's not true at all.  You've never done kite groups?  Clerics aren't useful at all in those. Have you ever grouped with a 2700AC, 15k tank in a non-high-end zone?  Shamans can heal just fine on them.<br />
<br />
Group quality is more about the members that make it up than the archetypal roles of the members.  The difficulty of the zone comes into play, but the skill and quality of the players can help with that.  I've been in riftseekers' as the only healer for a while and it worked out fine.  Mostly because everyone in the group was extremely well geared and had 500+ AA.  Now if you take a bazaar group to Riftseekers', they will die even with a cleric probably.<br />
<br />
This argument is old and stupid.  The whiners are basing their inability to be a secondary healer on their gear, spells and AA (or lack of), when in reality the more correct reason they can't heal is likely due to shortcomings of the other group members.  In summary:  If you get a ****ty group, you'll feel like you're a ****ty healer because everyone dies and you blame it on yourself.<br />
<br />
Edit: I may be &quot;uber&quot; now, but I was a bazaar geared shaman back a couple years ago.  I did levels 55-60 in PoD and PoN with a druid, a paladin and some random dps classes.  None of them were well geared either.  I was main healer in PoD courtyard with another shaman slowing and the tank told me I did a better job than most of the clerics he ever grouped with.  Back then do you think a tank would have joined the group if he heard a shaman was main healer?  Probably not, but it would have been his loss, as the exp was great and no one ever came close to dying.</div></div><hr />

Theres been some damn good arguments for either side in this thread then along comes this absolute classic.<br />
To say this bears any resembleance to reality is beyond belief.<br />
My Ranger when he was 50 could have main healed and provided damned good DPS in Crushbone but  that doesnt mean Rangers are uber healers :).<br />
As for you saying its not the Shamans fault its the fact the tank must be **** etc boy am I glad ive never grouped with you.<br />
<br />
I started this thread mainly to see if people see what i think is coming with mobs dying faster etc didnt intend it to be a Shaman can/cant heal post.<br />
<br />
Now basically it doesnt matter whether we can or cant heal do dps etc it all comes down to other classes perceptions of us.<br />

I think it comes down to a perception of us by other PLAYERS, not other classes. I tend to make a lot of groups, since I log in after my kids are on the bus early in the AM, and grab people as they come. I have done very very good groups that are Shaman, Druid, Druid, SK, Pally, Mage. I have also done Shaman, Cleric, Druid, Druid, Pally, Chanter. Almost every group combinaiton is viable for simple XP-loot camping in places like PG and WoS. Its when people start trying to force the &quot;optimums&quot; that it gets stupid, and Shaman get left to the side, along with half the other classes in the game. The min-max game some people play is what makes us SEEM less desirable. The reality is, Chanters love us, Tanks love us, other Healers love us. <br />
<br />
There are places where the less optimum groups arent going to be as effective, like PG Trials, Ikky trials, and Riftseekers, maybe, but even so, we have a viable group role in those situations. I think we provide a decent amount of burst DPS in addition to our other utilities to be valuable. I did a PU group with some folks from a couple more progressed guilds in Rift the other day, and they were SHOCKED at the utility I provided. Bane + Nukes + dog is some steady DPS, while debuffing  (Slow, Malos, Cripple) and keeping an HoT on the MA to save the Druid some mana. To be perfectly honest, its quite possible that some shaman have a bad rep on some servers because of the quality of their play, not the quality of our class. <br />
<br />
We arent solved. We arent perfectly balanced. We never will be. No class ever will be. Had a Paladin tanking in PG today. Gravy. Have had Pallys MA in Rift. Piece of cake. Nameds in OoW are punks compared to Gates, its actually the XP mobs like Elite Nocs and the Lightning guys (huge resists) that create problems. In Gates, we were lacking enough utility to off-set the whole 30-second fight issue. Now we have some. Get some crit heal and crit nuke AAs. Work yourself toward KT. There is OUTSTANDING loot dropping in this expansion. I wear 3 or 4 items myself and I am in a Time Farming guild. Runes are going to be coming down in price across the board, I regularly see them under 40K on my server now. Same with top loots. Magnetic stuff is damn solid gear for tanks, and a joke to make. There is lots to do and see. Enjoy the ride. <br />
<br />
Half full or half empty, folks.</div></div><hr />

That was an extreme.  I have also grouped in WoS and MPG with 2000AC, 11k SKs and been primary healer with no trouble.  Instead of a cleric, we used a rogue to dps down the mobs before they could do much damage.  I've also grouped with an 1850AC, 9k tank in WoS who absolutely sucked.  He had no aggro procs on his weapons (even though 25 or so adventures in ldon would get him an Anger III augment on both weapons) and he failed to be of any use to the group except sop up the cleric's mana because everyone else would get aggro over him.  I told him I would tank and things went smoother, since I could heal myself and maintain solid aggro.<br />
<br />
You would be blessed to have me in your group, because I actually pay attention to the situation at hand, rather than watch TV, change the baby's diaper, or talk on the phone like dozens of other group members I've had before have done.  I actually have people who send me tells regularly to group with me because of that fact.  I'm an attentive player and my groups almost never die, even if I'm the only healer.<br />
<br />
I've been in groups with noob warrior tanks who use BoC in offhand and a plain, unaugmented weapon in their main hand because it would &quot;increase their dps.&quot;  Those people are idiots and they don't know how to play their class.  If you don't know you should equip hate proc weapons in main when you're tanking, then you should quit the game immediately.  I've had ranger pullers train 6 mobs back to camp rather than run to a zone line that was closer.  That person was an idiot.  I've had enchanters charm mobs for CC, even though mez would have worked just fine, since the mobs were level 64.  That person was an idiot.  90% of being a good player in this game is simply paying attention to what's going on in the game, 9% is twitch reaction and 1% is ingenuity and game knowledge.  That final 1% of ingenuity and knowledge is what separates the men from the boys.<br />

That's exactly what it is.  Other classes always feel they need a cleric in group to do anything at all.  These are uninformed people who never deviate from the norm and try new things. Most people think shamans just &quot;slow mobs&quot; and that's only one small facet of what we can do.  If someone invites me to a group to just &quot;slow mobs,&quot; I don't want to be in that group and I'd likely get more xp by soloing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">totally off topic but-<br />
&quot;Right now people like the security that a shaman can bring. I mena if we die three times a night then they don't But as it gets more trivial We will become less useful to the min/max groups. But will become mroe useful to the Oddball/ Farm groups.&quot;<br />
<br />
shaman are on very low priority for most farm crews.  i can think of very few instances a group would want me over another cleric/druid.  most farm crews consist of few people playing many toons and have at least a botted chanter with them (there is the slow/cripple they need, focus/sence/fortitude make little differance if they have another cleric/druid instead of me)...my friends who have farm crews usually bring me out of pity, and the fact that i box a pally (when **** gets totally out of hand i log him in and rez the cleric. i usually bot a dps class and leave the pally logged by camp...)<br />
<br />
like i said totally off topic, but never the less, a misconseption i wanted to respond to.</div></div><hr />

Honestly, though, these types of players are exactly the min-max style of player I detest. IMHO this type of player isnt even really &quot;playing the game&quot;. <br />
<br />
XP grinding, loot/spell farming, etc, are necessary evils in EQ. I tend not to enjoy stuff if its too easy, too hard, or doesnt combine a couple goals into one. I didnt do any XP in Fire on my way to lvl 70, because I needed spells along the way. So I did XP groups where spells drop. I heard about a couple cool items for an alt, so I got some friends and we camped the area, with the &quot;cool items&quot; being a side bonus to the XP and spell runes we got while doing it (we all got some alt-loot along the way as well). I spent HOURS and HOURS and litterally 100's of 1000's in pp to do the Signet of the Arcane quest. Why? Well, it was a cool item, it was a solid goal, and even though there were parts I HATED, overall, I had a blast doing it. Thats EQ to me. <br />
<br />
There is a group on my server that sits in RCDS every morning, farming runes. /shrug, I guess I dont mind, since in the overall scheme, the more runes introduced to the market, the lower the price is going to get. But still, I would like to camp that area some, for my own runes, and my own loots, etc. No biggie though. <br />
<br />
I have always been a bit of a &quot;farmer&quot; myself though. During EQs first year, I farmed such things as the Captain in Najena for Large bronze, the robots in Sol A for Charred Shields, the King in Runnyeye for whatever he dropped, etc with my first Main, a paladin. Supplied my guild with this stuff, since I had extra time on my hands. I did Idols of the Thorned and Circlets in Droga, Forest Loops off Giants in FM, and Yaeths 73R off the Zorros in PoM pretty much totally funded my Earring tradeskilling. But these were all solo situations, where I was usualy farming stuff for a specific reason (like to supply guildies, or make PP to buy spells, etc). <br />
<br />
I see a lot of what you describe in the game now, 2 guys each 3-boxing, and I will admit a Shaman probably isnt high on the &quot;list&quot; in that type of situation. But I think that style of player is a small percentage of the EQ population overall. For the most part, the &quot;perception&quot; and &quot;comfort&quot; of having a Shaman still exists in many ways. And now, its not even a complete MIS-perception, because now, I truly feel I am not being &quot;dragged along out of pity&quot;, the way I felt when I got my Tipt flag. <br />
<br />
EQ is a game of cycles. One of the BIGGEST problems we had, as Shamans, was the &quot;cycle&quot; from PoP to OoW was too long. WAY WAY too much of teh game got &quot;solved&quot; in between. The expansions released in between these cycles pushed the game in a direction that sucked for us, without giving us ANY new utility to make up for the loss power. LDoN started the whole &quot;DPS is God, even in single groups&quot; theme. Gates reinforced it by making it so the faster mobs died, the better your group performed. Now, the fights are different. Speed killing isnt as critical. Adding 10-15 seconds per mob by haveing a &quot;less than perfect&quot; group set-up isnt that big a deal. Even if it was, we STILL provide new utility that has value. <br />
<br />
Of course the fights are going to get shorter and shorter, thereby pushing our primary function, slow, back into the &quot;less important&quot; folder. Mitigation contributes heavily to that as well. But hey, now I CAN heal on those short fights. I CAN drop a respectable nuke or AE. Bane tends to run nicely. Cant wait to get the new Curse. My group HoTs can help keep us alive in many hairy situations. I think the new Cripple is very sweet, I was using it the other day and the tank, who was boxing a rogue, remarked &quot;whats up with these mobs, I am hitting for max and getting MEGA high backstabs all the time&quot;, so I told him I was trying out the new Cripple. We did some very un-scientivic tests, and it certainly SEEMED like he was getting a ton more max hits with the cripple on. <br />
<br />
Stuff like that is what makes the game go round, not min-maxing and power rune-farming. At least to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Zunayn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">OoW has been very good to us in terms of buffs and AAs etc.<br />
<br />
Our dps is certainly not lacking either with both Yoppa and Sisslak dots which stack with anything.<br />
<br />
Without any kind of dot focus stacking those 2 and bane is pretty respectable damage, add some sort of burning affliction and crits its pretty good :)<br />
<br />
Yes we are not awesome dps over short fights but its far better than what alot of u make out.</div></div><hr />

Shaman are viable and valuable.  That's enough.  It's still ok to point out inconsistencies and areas for improvement (I would like to have SOE or something myself).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">The major problem of the class currently is durability/survivability. We lack an escape spell/ability, that we can hit when a &quot;oh ****&quot; situation presents.<br />
Shamans have every right to have such an ability because we rely on casting high aggro spells early to make us viable healers. <br />
<br />
Stonestance please, Rytan!<br />
<br />
As you may have noticed, I haven't been complaining much, because I think that the current issues are subtle(see above). Subtle means that not every average Shaman is aware of them.<br />
<br />
The Omens expansion is relatively easy(talking 1 group environment) which leades to classes like Shamans to perform at their peak. Shamans are the masters of trivial content and Omens approaches triviality and Shamans are *good*.<br />
<br />
However, people on this board must realize that balance isn't achieved by balancing content fopr the worst choice for a crucial function(healing for instance) as it will undoubtedly be more than trivial for the specialists.<br />
Omens is nice, but future expansions will have to be designed for the specialits in order to be challenging and I am sure they will. When that happens Shamans will find themselves in the same boat as they were in for Gates.<br />
<br />
PS: Whoever designed the MPG trials(raid and group) should receive a promotion.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Gaknab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Class balance is a myth, it doesn't exist and it never has. More to the point what most people refer to as class balance DOES NOT MATTER.<br />
<br />
I am not a cleric, I should not be able to heal as well as a cleric, nor should I be able to take his place consistantly in a group because clerics should (and do) bring abilities to the table that I do not have, and should not have. The same statement applies to other class people compare us to constantly, Druids.<br />
<br />
Look at it this way, if all classes were balanced against each other we would all basically be the same thing regardless of class or race. We would look different and perhaps we would all bring different things to the table, but in the end no matter what skills/spells/tools our character has we would contribute the same amound of healing, the same amount of Damage, the same amount of EVERYTHING to the group that every other member does.<br />
<br />
Does that seem absolutely retarded to anyone here besides me?<br />
<br />
What does matter is that all classes are balanced against the content they will be facing. This means that no one class is totally overpowered (As Shaman used to be circa Kunark, and various other classes have been over the last 5 years at different times) and that no one class is totaly underpowerd, and that all classes should be able to contribute meaningfully to a group that is facing the content.<br />
<br />
In GoD most classes were NOT balanced against the content they were facing. Thus GoD was seen as an increadibly hard expansion, and one that most players avoided. Personally I liked GoD for the challenge it presented, especially before is was &quot;rebalanced&quot; and made easier. However GoD was basically an exspansion for the High End Player only because of it's difficulty and that was by far the biggest thing wrong with it.<br />
<br />
To date I personally believe that OoW is very well balanced. There is a nice mix of content for High end and Low end players. The Trials in MPG are particularly enjoyable. It's nice facing encounters (Single Group or Raid) that make you think instead of just pull, kill, rinse and repeat. All classes can contribute meaningfully to a group in all the zones. Hell most groups I'm in we can switch out just about any one class for any other class.<br />
<br />
As a class we recived some nice new AA's and some nice shiny new spells. (Some suck, but hey they can't all be good!) Spells are also fairly easy to aquire, with the exception of the 69 and 70 spells. Nice gear is dropping (EP Equivalent) from single group killable mobs. I'm going to go out on a limb and rank OoW as the best expnasion since SoV.<br />
<br />
I've been in xp groups with 3 Clerics, hell I was in an xp group with 4 Warriors and a Ranger, and another with 5 different casters. All did very well and killed quickly and consistantly. I've been in groups with all kinds of different make-ups since OoW was released, and ya know what? I love it.<br />
<br />
The probelm as I see it is people are stuck in a certain mindset. They think they MUST have a cleric, a tank, a CC class etc in order to have a good group and gain xp. This is simply NOT the case. Sure there are places/encounters where certain classes are required to be successful but these are rare. A group with almost any composition can do well in most zones in OoW.<br />
<br />
Most players are just too afraid to think outside the box and try something different. They need their security blanket, they need to have a rezzer incase they die, they need to have a CC'er incase of a bad pull, they need to have that rogue to kill fast and on and on.<br />
<br />
By far the most overlooked aspect of any toon, is the SKILL of the player at the keyboard. With good/skilled players group composition becomes almost irrelevant. People need to learn to understand this.</div></div><hr />
