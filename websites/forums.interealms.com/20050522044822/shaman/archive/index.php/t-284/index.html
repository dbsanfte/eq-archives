<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Razco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well a big thank you to Verant for the new Cazic Thuke zone drops. This seems like an attempt to allow players who cant do ToV or PoM or other Uber zones a chance to get some decent shaman armor. I dont think its no drop anymore.. well bracers aren't at least .<br />
<br />
Barbed Rubicite Bracer - 13 ac .. 5 wis 5 int 35 hp  <br />
rog shm rng / all ... Magic ... NOT lore  =-)<br />
<br />
im just hoping the prices will drop on legs ... havent seen BP, arms, helm, guants, boots, if in fact there is a whole set of this.<br />
<br />
Btw its gonna look sweet on my iksar. bracers do =-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">/shrug  Kael or PoG aren't uber and the gear is just as good, if not better.   Hell I can solo some of the armor dropping mobs in Kael.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yeah hp on that are kinda nice</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Razco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yeah ... havent did Kael in a long time ... got tired of losing rolls on chain bp, leggs, to rogues. &lt;shrug&gt;... PoG ... need to go back and whack them some there ... i hate Tunare ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Magelo only lists bracer, coif, leggins, and belt /shrug<br />
<br />
At least so far none of the items you listed are added into Magelo DB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jukax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I don't really care much for the barbed rubicite armor; I'm after the flowing thought 3 boots that drop in the green pool...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hail Razco,<br />
<br />
I'm assuming that if its not Lore it must not be NO DROP?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Munkee Bizness</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i know this is off the topic of cazic but for the guy who mentioned PoG... it seems to have gotten a minor upgrade.. PoGs are now faster than sow (yes your corpse retrieval days are now about as much fun as testing faulty nutcups) and aggro range seems to be a LOT bigger (had a named treant a good ways off in the fog turn and beeline for our camp) the good news about the pogs being faster tho its only a minor speed upgrade while they are faster than spirit of wolf they are NOT faster than spirit of scale</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Anyone have exp seeing the new rubi drop? I ask because I am wondering if the different pieces drop where they used to. For example legs, bracer, shoulder, back in the tae room? <br />
<br />
Do all the legs drops from the same mob? Or do barbed and spiked legs (for example) drop off different mobs? <br />
<br />
Id like to go with a guild group and camp some (this stuff is a nice upgrade for me) but would like to have some idea of where to go for what pieces.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">PoGs are not naturally that fast.  They are buffed with SoW by themselves if unagro (before breaking in).  And I easily outran them with SoW just 2 weeks ago or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Razco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Buz .. its not no drop, my point was .. you could have 2 of them. for many shaman this is a huge upgrade. ( notice i said many shaman, not all)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Valka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">At the level you can be camping this at, shouldnt your JBB be on your other wrist? For the record though, the quest armor bracers are not lore, just the component to make them.<br />
<br />
Some of the drops in CT are nice, but I don't think they're on par with any of the Velious quest armor, the visible pieces anyway. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Valka not all shamans are lucky enough to get a JBB, they are very very rare (I'm one of the lucky ones though).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Razco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">if i could figure out how to slide the Jbb over my scales i'd wear one. Well then i'd prolly bag it. It just doesnt fit my playing style.</div></div><hr />
