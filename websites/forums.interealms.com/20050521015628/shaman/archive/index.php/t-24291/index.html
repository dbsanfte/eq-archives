<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know that this isnt the right place for this, but Superman, Christopher Reeve, died last night of complications from his condition.<br />
I dont know how many of you out there grew up with Sups as your hero, but I did, and he was a big hero to me as an adult as well, its difficult to live with a spinal injury as catastrophic as his was and not be bitter or self loathing. He managed to be neither, and was a big advocate for research into treatments on spinal cord injuries.<br />
Just giving some respect for someone who deserved it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I still have every single one of the Superman movies on VHS. To this day, I remember watching footage of his accident. In all of his television or magazine appearances, I never once saw him hate what life had dished out. He just took what came and grinned through it all. That, friends, is a hero.<br />

Sucks, to see that what you've grown up with dissapear for all eternity.<br />
Good tho, that Mr Reaves stuck it out so well on so many fronts.</div></div><hr />

    My Heart goes to his family. If you just heard him talk without seeing him you'd be hard pressed to know the extent of what was wrong with him. <br />
<br />
   While i of course never met the man. He is one who will be missed by so many and was one of them people everyone could look up too. Inspiration , Courage , Fortitude.....Could just go on.</div></div><hr />
