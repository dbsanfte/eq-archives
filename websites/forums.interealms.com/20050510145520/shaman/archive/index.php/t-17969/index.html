<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Galabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Are Shamans the best class for soloing, i dont like to group much and if i do its not more than me and another person.  Is the shaman the best for me to solo, or work with just a partner.  Or is a druid a better option for me? I had a 54 rng but the account got cancled an rngs soloing was pretty boring an not too easy.  So is Shaman, or druid the best soloing class or is it some other class.</div></div><hr />

Search is your friend</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Necros are the best soloers as far as exp/hour but shamans can solo quite well and in some instances, larger mobs (well, that used to be the case -- not sure any more). A shaman would be a better choice if you duo alot though, depending on the duo partner. Slowing, heals and lots of utility allow a duo to do quite a bit. There is a lot of detailed information in the Medicine Cabinet forum and as mentioned, you can use the search function. There are lots of threads on this topic. Happy hunting. :)</div></div><hr />

Necromancer = squishy<br />
<br />
I like to think one of my defining abilities is the ability to not panic if a spell gets resisted 4-5 times in a row (at least where I am now.  But then again, higher up, i'll have a pet to help, and better slows)<br />
<br />
I'm not saying necros are bad.  Well, I did, but heres my second-hand scoop.  (I get all my knowledge from reading message boards and magazine ads):<br />
<br />
Before a shaman gets the Canabalize AA, a necromancer will make a more efficient soloer, with a vastly superior mana regen rate.  They have all the tools we do for soloing, for the most part,  and suitable substitues for the things they do not have (like slows, though they can slow undead, I believe)<br />
<br />
Once a shaman can nab that AA, it evens up the race quite a lot because of the massive heal-over-time spells we have.   Sure, we lose a lot of hp, but gain it back pretty quickly.  <br />
<br />
A necromancer at the high levels will (probably) have a higher average mana pool over the course of his hunting then a Shaman, giving him a slight safety margin there.  <br />
<br />
Thats my take.  I may not be right, but hopefully if I am wrong, I am wildly wrong.  :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Shaman can solo. We've got all the tools to do it with. One of the things that really helps is working to get your gear upgraded so that you have as many HP as you possibly can. Being able to slow almost anything we would ever want to solo helps tons. Our DoT spells are among the best in the game. Our pet helps out with the dmg. <br />
<br />
At higher levels, get as much FT as you can. I know its not easy, but you can get it over time. Make sure you have all of the spells for your level. Not all shaman think FT is all that valuable for them, but any extra mana regen is a good thing. My shaman is hasnt been my main for almost 2 years now, but I have kept trying to get better items for him, and he can self buff to over 4k HP and has FT12 now. He also has a 4k mana pool. And thats with not raiding. So it can be done.<br />
<br />
After you reach 65, if you solo much, get Virulent Paralysis. Even level 1 of it is invaluable. Since we can make mana, the size of our mana pool isnt a huge factor, but having enough HP to be able to Canabilize during a fight offers us a way to get lots of mana back fast.<br />
<br />
Just for the heck of it, I went and pulled a PoValor golem the other day. I wanted to see if I could, and how tough it would be. Pulled with slow. Tossed Q on myself, Bane and Blood on the golem. Took a couple shots of each DOT, and more than a few Q's to get it dead, but when it died, I was at 50m and was at full health. I had no pet up either. And no crack.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Out of curiousity, how long did it take?<br />
<br />
I regularly solo golems in PoV using root-rot (no doggie).  I found that tanking IN TEH FACE and using dogdog cost too much healing mana.  Root rot is very safe - once malosinia is in, they don't break root much - but it takes about 6 minutes.  I usually can finish at 90+ health and 80+ mana, though, so I get about 6 kills an hour with virtually no downtime.<br />
<br />
If it takes you, say, 3 minutes to kill by tanking and 2 minutes to med up, your way may be better, although it's still riskier than mine.<br />
<br />
BTW I get about 1% AA per minute this way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bards will thouroughly crush you at soloing for xp.  Think Lennox Lewis vs your grandma.  As for necros, the size of your blue bar isn't everything that matters, it is what you can do with it.  They have too many tools and too much damage.  Outdoors that means more dps (aggro kiting is better than any method we have available for xp soloing) and more xp over time.  Indoors it means more dps and flexibility.  FD, insta-invis, insta-itu, harmshield, REZ, summon corpse, snare, etc allow them to get places and do things that we simply cannot. The new lifetaps narrow the tanking advantage anyway.<br />
<br />
The big shift in soloing power came when they stopped making all the good solo targets summon.<br />
<br />
We remain the best class at soloing one big, hardhitting-but-not-superhard hitting, unsnareable, unrootable, slowable thing outdoors (or indoors and easy to get to).  There are still some things we can solo that others probably cannot (zelnithiwhatever).  But the list of things that necros can do that we cannot do is undoubtedly longer.<br />
<br />
Charmers are a whole 'nother ballgame.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Flat out a necro has every important ability in the game except SoW. I can slow undead, pacify undead, charm undead. My pet is a beast and I can buff him with 65% haste. I can heal myself and regen mana faster than KEI or VOQ. My dots cover every resist and all stack. With Virtue up, I can lifetap-tank with ease. Defensively, I can FD, harmshield, evac, and shadowstep. I can invis to living and undead. <br />
<br />
And if I wipe I can summon my corpse and 93% res myself.<br />
<br />
Over all my necro solos about 200% better than my shaman does. And my necro can do this with a much smaller platinum investment in gear and spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>castsonu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">shamans own soloing i have soloed in plane of fire many times  in the back of the second castle we are hands down the best class to play no matter how much they try to nerf us will changing our slows or giving bst's and bards newer slows</div></div><hr />
