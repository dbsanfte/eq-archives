<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I'm running, if you can call it that, on a 4 year old system:<br />
<br />
A dell computer, 667mhz, 128 mb ram, 10 gb hard drive.<br />
<br />
I don't have the money yet to completely upgrade to another system, but I'd like to add more ram to the computer I do have.  I'm not completely computer stupid, but can I just pop in any stick of ram or are there specific things I need to look out for or do?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help you all can provide.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Denero Creed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">RAM wont really help you much in that system.  You are hitting the wall in terms of data transfer rates (proc, video card, and bus speads).  Be patient, and save up for an upgrade of some sort.<br />
That's just my 2cp anyway.</div></div><hr />

Well believe it or not as simple as it seems, it can be tricky to get the right stuff. www.crucial.com put in your computer make model number and the best part you dont have to get the ram from them just an easy way to tell you what type you need.<br />
<br />
For anything else..if your running windows 98/me it will not properly handle more than 512mb <br />

other than that not much to worry about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>7ekno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The DX9 patch is more RAM sensitive then before ...<br />
<br />
RAM will help you and a Video Card upgrade will help ....<br />
<br />
Ideal RAM is 512MB post DX9 with a GEForce4 MX440 video card (your CPU will be the bottle neck on any faster Video Cards).<br />
<br />
RAM upgrades can be tricky on Brand name PCs (we had Dells at work, and they had added extra notches to slots so you can't add generic parts) ... so check with the Supplier of ya PC for parts ....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have a Dell Dimension, bought a memory stick at <br />
my local Costco. Plugged it in and my system <br />
recognized it just fine. True &quot;plug and play&quot;, I <br />
didn't do any configuring at all. Ran 'dxdiag' to <br />
verifiy it. <br />
<br />
However, I'm a Solaris guy. Don't have nearly the<br />
experience that Chmodux has with PC's. I do think<br />
I know what his name refers to at least. ;D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well, you either have a 100 or 133 sdram stick. You have to look inside to see what you have.  There should be a sticker on it that tells you.  Then, just buy the same type, and you can even mix and match.  (128-64-64) (128-128-64)  etc.    If you are not sure what type it really is, just go to your local best buy or local computer store, bring the memory stick that you have now, and they will tell you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">First thing you want to do is check to see what kind of RAM you have, just like warbear said, it'll have a sticker on it most likely. If not, it should say it somewhere in your BIOS, but I won't go into that..<br />
Then you'll purchase your memory, whether it be 128 or 256.. Keep in mind that the memory you put into this computer will NOT be compatible with any brand new computer you buy nowadays, so don't spend too much money on it.<br />
Something else to keep in mind is that the larger stick of memory should go into the first RAM slot, and the smaller stick should go into the second slot. Makes for better performance all around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I was running a p2 450 with 512meg sdram and a 64meg geforce 2 until I got a virus that crashed me around november. Used to use eqw and run 2 accts at once also. Ram will definitely help ya out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Monjay-Tunare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">warbear has it right... (parity may come into play depending on your current motherboard)<br />
<br />
However to see some bigger performance increases you should at least buy a mobo that supports DDR ram. Can get mobo, ram and cpu combo on pricewatch relatively cheaply... anything else and you are just wasting money. Like putting a bandaid on an amputated limb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The sad thing is buying old sdram is almost as expensive as buying ddr ram.<br />
<br />
I would say save up a couple hundred and build or order a new pc. You can get a good prebuilt for around 400-600 and build a good machine for 300-500 or cheaper depending if you want a monitor or if you can use the one you got. And if you dont want to risk wasting a few hundred, just order another prebuilt from dell. They are giving away flat pannel monitors anyways and for the 599 it costs you get a 299.00 monitor for free, so thats worth it right there, and they arn't have bad pc's to boot. Granted, you could build a bigger PC for the same money, but you could sell that flat panel monitor on ebay and make a good chunk of your cash back or simply use it :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Rathjar is somewhat correct.. buying SDRAM can be(and is) more expensive than buying the newer DDR RAM, which is actually faster.<br />
<br />
However, getting a new computer can be a bit more expensive than he is saying. About $500 will get you a decent machine, and 800+ will get ya a real good one. I recently put one together myself, the total cost on the parts being $850. I didn't get a monitor or any software with it though.<br />
<br />
You'd probably be better off just saving up for a new comp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Take a crack at your PC manual, it should tell you  what ram you can use, I *think* most any pc166 should be a safe bet. I think the double density or high density stuff is a nogo, but most will have a little warning on the label just keep your eye peeled. If you have a circuit city or similiar store check those out, it is best to buy that kind of stuff close buy since returning them can be tough if you buy them through the internet.<br />
However putting together your own pc isn't too tough, intimitating if you aren't use to it though. Check out www.pricewatch.com my favorite place to get things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kvak1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">A computer that old will probably be using the Intel I440BX chipset on the motherboard. A chipset limitation means you have to use low density memmory modules. Either it won't boot or will only register half the memmory with high density.<br />
<br />
Higher density is cheapers as fewer memmory chips are needed. Due to this I highly recommend finding your computer / motherboard on Crucial or Kingstons website and then going with what they recommend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Haggr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Only 2 suggestions.<br />
1. Powerleap.com for a processor upgrade, relatively cheap.<br />
2. Pricewatch.com for memory upgrade and new video card.<br />
<br />
I put a 1.4ghz p3 into a old board (slot a abit bh6) major difference on computer speed p2/333mhz to a p3/1.4ghz. <br />
Your board probably maxes at either 512 ot 1gig ram. With win98se max usable ram is 512, anything over it screws the system up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Name brand cases will not support generic MBs in most cases. <br />
Warbear if you take advice from people working at best buy, then /mourn Warbear. The average &quot;Tech&quot;, and I use that term loosely, at the major chain stores is typically a kid who has had some classes and maybe has taken the A+ test, but has no real experience doing the work beyond what they have aquired at the store. These jobs the low pay entry positions, that people leave after about a year of Xp to get something that actually pays.</div></div><hr />
