Q?  Where joo a Baron when joo dinged?<br />
<br />
Gerka keys to fast Leveling:<br />
<br />
a) Grind <br />
b) Grind more<br />
c) Great mele output (fbss and gfg)<br />
d) JBB<br />
e) HHK (thanks soupypoopy)<br />
f) Grind some more.<br />
<br />
For a while mez slowed down on purpose because Gerka was getting some negitive feedback from members of da guild.  That was da primary reason I did some AAXP.<br />
<br />
The most important thing about lvling is determination.  After that, this board is just an incredable resource.<br />
<br />
Also it is so much easear to level now then it was da first time round.  I had 94 days in my Iksar Radag to learn da class and he only got to level 52.<br />

Friend of mine got a rogue to 60 + epic + full Kael quest armor in ......<br />
<br />
<br />
18 days 9 hours  43 minutes played<br />
<br />
On a side note he did 59 in Howling Stones solo in 17 hours (two boxing a 58 shaman for buffs/healing)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Something like 182 days for 60 :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Duffe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">those of us with over 100 days played have been playing from the beginnng when hunting spots were hard to get ahold of and dungeons were even harder to get into. there are so many options now that you can get to 60 in no time. <br />
<br />
grats radag.</div></div><hr />

My ranger has about 30 days I think at level 44 (created over 2 years ago)...he dont get out much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Torelorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">How about some advice for 56 then?  This seems to be a mystery level in the strat part of the boards.</div></div><hr />

lol<br />

<br />
On a side note, i have a 32 pally friend, who thinks hes all that.  He sits in the auction channel  ALL DAY.<br />
<br />
something like 20+ playtime, if not more.  at level 40's mines 8 :X.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Radag is a twink right ?<br />

first char ususlly take 50days+ to ding 60; It easy to ding lvl60 with same or less time if I start over again</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not always.  I'm level 54 with my beastlord, and have 21.5 days played.  I could be a couple levels higher, but I took off time to trade, work on skills, and quest.<br />
<br />
And it was completely untwinked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>bakkal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">How exactly does a short play time to 60 prompt the question &quot;Get out much?&quot; He could have done it over a year period and when he was on all he did was straight exp.  Think how often you are doing your trade skills, sitting in the bank looking for groups, chatting, raiding... Now imagine if all that time were straight exp.  It's not that hard to imagine really.  I am level 57 at 22 days played and raid in a guild or I would be higher level/shorter time.  It's not some accomplisment, I just log on and do exp.  <br />
<br />
If I made a monk and did straight levelling with the shaman helping out, I would expect pretty significant results. (or any melee class)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I think the 'get out much' comment was directed to those of us who have over 100 days. But, similiarly he has to look at how that time is spread out. I have over 200 days played on my primary, but that is over almost 3 years playing EQ, which works out to about 4.5 hours a day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I'm up to about 115 played and I have 8 AA points.  This is over a 3 year period.<br />
<br />
BUT I have a 47 Warrior (8 Played)<br />
41 Rogue (7 Played)<br />
30 Druid (6 Played)<br />
24 Monk (Like 2 Played)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I did it in I think 54 and change, but I spent many days helping people get epics and quest armor.  Made up for it though by gritting my teeth and sitting through Velks for the exp part as much as possible, along with a lot of solo time to max experience.  It was a race for me -- our guild did so much work on epics and ToV armor that I simply could not afford to not level as hard as possible every minute I had free, or I would literally never advance a level at all.  Many in my guild were around the same two or three levels for like a year.  I didn't want to be stuck at 54 forever.  There's too much good stuff at 60.<br />
<br />
Very hard on the in-game social life to do that, and hard in a lotta ways, but if you're in a raiding guild, you lose tons of hours raiding.</div></div><hr />
