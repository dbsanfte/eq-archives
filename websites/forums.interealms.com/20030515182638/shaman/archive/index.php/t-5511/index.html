<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey Folks!  I discovered the Scarlet Desert was nice soloing at 52, but wish I had come at lv. 50!!!<br />

You want to fight lightcrawlers, sunflowers, bloodtribes, scarlet rockhoppers, scarlet cheetahs, and sun reavers/reverents.<br />
<br />
I recommend leaving the other 4 little tribe men types alone--- I forget all their names, but they are different colors, red, blue, green....) since you start out indiff to them and killing them will just make you KOS for adds and such.  If you stay indiff to the tribes (except bloodtribe--I say wipe them out!) then no one but sun reavers/reverents will see thru invis and you can wander a tad more safely thru the zone.<br />
<br />
I recommend setting up camp alone the north wall, or in the NE corner.  Bring up doggie, buff him with HoS and Haste, and pull away.  When fighting sun reavers/reverents you want to buff your magic resistance.  Also, the bloodtribe shamans cast, well, shammy spells---so you may want to buff your poison and disease resistance if you are going to pull them.<br />
<br />
The rockhoppers can drop superb or flawless rockhopper hides.  The bloodtribes drop acrylia.  If you do not have a better cloak, collect the pieces for studded acrylia cloak (7ac +10 Wis, +3 str, +5 dex)--you will need a superb rockhopper hide and some acrylia.  The acrylia mask not bad either.  Tailoring skill of 188 recommended (trivial at 188).<br />
<br />
Over all the loot is so-so, but I think the nice stuff that drops here can make up for it.  Some pretty decent drops.  Check out Allakhazam's.<br />

<br />
Happy Hunting to You!<br />
