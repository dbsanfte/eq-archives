<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Good post in that other thread, Grafsha. At least I'm not the only one anymore. This will be a long post - fair warning. <br />
<br />
Keep begging for scraps at the table, folks. Just dont be surprised when you get your nose slapped. We all should know by now how these things work - you ask for one thing, and you get half, at best. Keep asking for only an 1800-point direct heal, because that will solve all our healing problems, without infringing upon clerics or druids. You'll end up with a 1425 direct heal that costs twice as much mana as Tnarg's.<br />
<br />
I know it's too early to be predicting gloom and doom because, based on Brenlo's comments, these changes had nothing to do with our discussions here. But you need to realize now what will happen if you continue to accept your position beneath druids as priests, and dont change your tune. <br />
<br />
They will happily leave us as third-rate healers below druids, meanwhile paladins just got a step closer to us with a 1-second cast 1000 point heal. I cant bring up Lucy right now, but I believe that paladin heal is one of the 30-second recast ones, right? Even so, how often do you cast Tnarg's? Unless it's an emergency like an overpull or resisted slow, do you honestly cast Tnarg's more often than that? I know I dont. Yeah, we're still better because we can cast ours more often, if the situation demands it, but havent we already discovered that in today's level 65 arena Tnarg's just doesnt cut it?<br />
<br />
You cannot honestly use slow as an excuse any longer. Too many classes have it. It's been mitigated in every expansion since they came up with the idea of mitigation. And hardly anybody ventures into any new or difficult content without some kind of slower. So even though druids and clerics cant cast it - somebody with them most likely can. And, guess what - somebody else's mana pool is saving them healing mana. <br />
<br />
If anything, I think cannibalize (CannV, more specifically) is what keeps us from getting better heals, in the view of the developers. They probably think we'd be able to sustain our mana indefinitely if we had druid-sized heals coupled with cannibalize and CannV. In practical use, this theory is flawed however. <br />
<br />
Cannibalizing only helps us recover mana faster, with the penalty of not being able to do anything else while we are cannibalizing. During a melee, which typically doesnt last longer than a minute (or two if you have multiples), if we're slowing we cant recover mana. If we're healing, we cant be recovering mana. If we're rooting, or VP'ing, or Spirit Calling, we arent recovering mana. If you're getting beat on after a slow, you cant recover mana (for a couple reasons). And if CannV happens to be fresh, or refreshes during the fight, then we can get a shot in the mana pool - but we have to spend some of that mana right away to heal ourself, and then maybe another heal for the person getting hit while we spent the time to heal ourself. And hopefully, the mob doesnt aggro when we hit the tank with that heal, and turn on us. One swipe from a 1200 hitting mob eliminates the Q you just dropped on yourself, and since you just CannV'ed, now you probably have low health aggro and you die. Or you play it safe in a fight with heavy hitters like that, and you dont CannV at all - in which case, it's benefit is nil.<br />
<br />
All of these things we may need to do in order to help keep the party alive in one way or another, prevent us from recovering mana and on top of that are usually costing us mana at the same time. Couple this with the fact that our spells typically cost as much or more than our counterparts, for less effect, means we are just as easily run out of mana as they are - something the general population doesnt realize. They think shamans = endless mana. They understand if a cleric or druid has to med after a big fight, but they dont understand if a shaman has to spend time to recover mana. They think you're a bad shaman, when in fact your other functions prevented you from recovering mana during the action.<br />
<br />
Now, in a good group - one that moves along nice and orderly, I probably wont ever run out of mana. In fact, I usually dont drop below 60 mana. But, then neither does the druid or cleric, in such a group. But ideal situations are not the place to measure anything. Proving grounds are usually the harshest situations - because those actually provide a test of the abilities. And even good groups can go bad sometimes, and that's when you find out who can cut the mustard. And with the current state of our heals, even if I was the smartest and best shaman in the world, I wouldnt make the grade if the **** hit the fan.<br />
<br />
The solution to this particular problem, in my opinion, is to restore shamans to equal healing power as druids are now, but make our heals slightly less efficient. Key word is slightly - not 200% or 150% mana cost, more like 120% mana cost to offset CannV, but the same amount healed, and cast times. This will bring us back to the table as a viable backup healer, or primary healer when you cant get a cleric (or the cleric dies in the middle of a fight). We're still not going to eclipse the other priests due to cannibalize, for the reasons I outlined already above...bigger heals, that cost more mana, are going to run us out of mana even quicker than before. But it will give us a fighting chance in those bad situations, if we are wise with our mana.<br />
<br />
We're not going to replace clerics, because they still have the real complete heal, and far superior quick heals and group heals (something we dont have at all). We're not going to replace druids altogether, either. Yes, if the group needs a healer, and doesnt have a slower yet - they'd pick us. If the group already had an enchanter or beastlord - they'd be better off taking a druid for snare, damage shield, and better nukes.<br />
<br />
For those of you who will say this will stick us into the healing role and nothing else, I ask you this; how does improving our healing take away from anything else that we already offer? Our other spell abilities dont up and evaporate if our healing is improved. We will still be able to do everything else we did before, but we'll also be able to heal once again on an equal footing with our counterpart priest (the druid).<br />
<br />
And dont come along and quote the part where I said I never run out of mana or usually dont go below 60 mana, and say that proves my entire argument wrong. Because quoting things out of context doesnt prove anything, except that you can ignore the actual relevant points which preceeded or followed it.<br />
<br />
Are there other issues that need to be addressed also? Some minor things, perhaps. Overall, I'm satisfied with most of my other abilities, but my healing is very lacking. As a priest, that concerns me more than whether the resist mod or percentage on the new slow is good enough, or whether focus gives enough hps compared to blessing of the ninth, or whether I get a new nuke spell that doesnt suck balls, or whether our bastard stepchild class can outbuff us. Yeah, those things may rub me the wrong way, but I can live with them. As a priest, I cant live with my heals - and neither can my group - and that threatens my very usefulness.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think these paladin heals have a 5 second recast.<br />
<br />
Since they can alternate Order of Nife and Light of Nife, the versatility and power of paladin healing will jump dramatically once this is widely disseminated.  It's not just the impact of one new spell; it's also how that spell incorporates into a spell lineup.  <br />
<br />
I'm ok healing comparable to druids like we used to at a reduced rate of efficiency, and it wouldn't unbalance anything - just like it never unbalanced stuff before when we had that ability.  <br />
<br />
But it's not going to happen.  The vision now is that druids heal better as their upgrade path, and frankly I'd rather SOE have a questionable vision than no vision.</div></div><hr />

Please do not ask for better melee ability. We are not a melee class, we're a priest. If you beefed up our melee ability, we'd be just another hybrid class.<br />
<br />
Seriously, if you're set on being able to dual wield, you need to roll a Beastlord.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">An 1800 hp fast heal would sure help tho.  With focus/AA's you could pump that to 2300ish which would be a pretty decent improvement over what we currently can do on average.  Also with crit healing AA's (which fire pretty good when maxed) we'd have 4600ish heals to toss around, compared to 3400ish that we have currently with maxed focus/AAs.  It would help.  But I'm not against equalizing fast healing power between shamans and druids once again.  As it was in the old days.  Druids can still fill in on hard GoD trials as porter/DD/backup-healer-for-named and will definitely have a place.  But our place is missing unless we can offer something greater than a heavily resisted, heavily mitigated ability to slow . . . o and some unneeded weak buffs.  <br />
<br />
Lately I despair of getting GoD groups, even within my own guild.  They'd rather use a bard than me, and i can totally understand.  I can't do backup healer even, because druids are better at it and have the benefit of being able to evac.  I'm not DPS, tho I do try.  So I just can't get groups for GoD.  My shaman is useless for that expansion.  Seems like a bad thing to make a class unwanted in an entire expansion to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>taggletoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think Gardeltron hit the nail on the head with his post here http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=20223.<br />
<br />
It's all about hit points healed per second and throwing in all these other factors(slow, canni, etc...) just confuses the issue.  This is where we have significantly fallen behind the other two priest classes in healing power. <br />
<br />
Tnarg(Shaman) 1300 HP/6 sec = 216.66 HP/Sec<br />
Sylvan(Druid) 2100 HP/6 sec = 350 HP/Sec<br />
Holy Light(Cleric) 3275 HP/6 sec = 545.83 HP/Sec<br />
<br />
The one thing I do disagree with Galdeltron on is:<br />
These calculations do not include the effects of AA's or focus effects, which I assume would have similar effects for all classes.<br />
If you factor in a healing focus item(20%), Healing Adept(10%), and Advanced Healing Adept(9%) this disparity becomes even greater.<br />
<br />
Tnarg 1300+260+247= 1807 or 301.16 HP/sec<br />
Sylvan 2100+420+399 = 2919 or 486.5 HP/sec<br />
Holy Light 3275+655+622 = 4552 or 758.7 HP/sec<br />
<br />
My math and assumptions may not be completely correct but if a mathematician wants to point out my flaws then please post the correct results and you'll still get a similar comparison.<br />
<br />
I see no reason and further no excuse why shaman were not given an upgraded direct heal in GoD.  The healing disparity was already there before GoD and now it is even greater. <br />
<br />
With groups becoming increasingly more dependent on a secondary healer the shaman class is becoming less viable in this role.  This was the utility I always saw with my shaman.  I could essentially fill two roles(slower/patch healer) allowing a group more flexability.<br />
<br />
Shaman aren't asking to be main healers all we want is to be a viable back up healers.  With one group encounters that require 2 healers shaman make a terrible choice.  We will never be a DPS class and I think most of us are fine with that.  So if a group requires a cleric(only viable choice) and another cleric or druid why would that group want to add a shaman just to slow.  There are other classes that can slow fairly effective that can bring DPS or other utilities to a group.  I may be in the minority but I'm fine with enchanters, beastlords, and even bards being a viable choice for slowing.  What I'm disgusted with is the healing disparity between the three priest classes.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It constantly NEEDS to be brought to mind, I think, that even if they brought us EXACTLY even with druids(think of the uproar!) in healing or DPS or both, it just wouldn't matter like everyone thinks it would.<br />
<br />
Not that we don't need the upgrade! But...<br />
<br />
If we're slowing and/or malos'ing and/or malosinia'ing and/or failing a slow(ing?) before we even START to  heal or DPS...even a fantabulous wonkalicious everlasting gobstopper of a heal or DD isn't going to be anywhere near as good in practice as it is on paper.  <br />
<br />
Paper has been nearly the death of the whole shaman class.  And we're as close as any class has ever been.<br />
<br />
In reality, having not just the option but, critically, the NECESSITY of doing other things before we even dream of doing healing or DPS reduces our actual healing/DPS output drastically, and all the more so against the quick-dying, hard-hitting mobs that GoD is all about. <br />
<br />
How game-unbalancing are your heals going to be on a melee group member who is already dead?  How crazily game destroying are your DD's going to be against a mob that is going to be very close to death by the time your first spell that isn't a debuff or a slow even lands?  And what if you absolutely MUST launch a heal somewhere before you even think about DPS? What then becomes of your fantastically, game-destroyingly unbalanced DD now that the mob is at 8% anyway?<br />
<br />
Well...nothing.  Wow you critted for 10 billion against a mob with 325 hitpoints!  Ah well, you got the white text that looked pretty anyway.  Goes well I guess with heals either being too late and critting for 2k more than the warrior actually even HAS, or just cancelling out mid-cast because the warrior died before your heal even landed.<br />
<br />
Nobody is going to be stacking shamans in their groups.  Almost nobody ever has or ever will, and who could blame them?  So really what the actual shaman is going to put out in terms of fantabulous healing monstrosity or uber DPS wizardy is going to be...slightly less than other classes might think if we got an upgrade.<br />
<br />
A big barrier to our upgrade potential is not what even radical upgrades will do at all, but what uninformed people will guess they WILL do.  Active play would prove them wrong enough, but many will agitate hard before improvements ever make it live to prove things one way or the other.<br />
<br />
Oooh shaman DPS!  Oooh shaman heals!  Let's get a warrior and five shamans!  We'll never lose!<br />
<br />
Umm...yeah.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The simple fact, is that SOE needs to put Shamans where they once were.  I like being a back-up healer, but I want my slows to be the best in the game hands down.  How about an unresistable 50% slow (non-mitigatable).  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I know you dont disagree with me, Gart, and you're understandably pessimistic that we would ever get what I'm asking. I'm pessimistic about it also.<br />
<br />
What I'd like to hear from Brenlo or Rytan, is why not? I've heard all the arguments the other players can come up with, and none of them explain why the discrepency still exists in today's game environment.<br />
<br />
How did the developers decide that clerics, druids, and even paladins - a hybrid healer - needed upgraded heals, but shamans did not? How did you decide that each of those classes needed new heal spells in Gates of Discord, but shamans only needed a small upgrade to a heal-over-time spell? And why was that spell then changed to be less efficient than the spell for which it's supposed to be an upgrade?<br />
<br />
Oh, and yes, you are correct, Gart. I did finally get Lucy to pull up, and Light of Order is a 5-second recast, 1-second cast, 1000 point heal, for 430 mana.<br />
<br />
Speaking of asking for too little....since when does Canni automatically suggest more inefficient heals?<br />
<br />
Druids get mana regen too, why should we be penalized?<br />
<br />
I dont think we should be penalized for cannibalize IV. I doubt seriously that in today's game, with passive mana regen buffs for clerics and druids that cann IV gives us any advantage anymore in mana regen. <br />
<br />
I do, however, believe CannV does still give us something of an advantage, thus the 20% extra mana cost for our equivalent heals. That would mean our 2100 fast heal would cost us 660 mana as opposed to 550 for druids Sylvan Infusion. Our 4680 incomplete heal would cost us 720, instead of 600 for Karana's Renewal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Canni V is an AA, this is about our spell lines.<br />
<br />
Canni 1-5 and ACP could be taken from our spell line for all I care if they replaced our Focus line with passive mana regen that would benefit the group.  Cannidancing is annoying after the first 5 million times, and Canni 5 can be hazardous to your health if you do it at the wrong time.  High level mobs don't like seeing you drop 2K HPs, you make for an easy target :D<br />
<br />
IMO, give Shamans something that they are the best at.  If a group wants so-and-so, they need to get a Shaman.  Otherwise, they will put alot of strain on another class to do the Shamans job.  Sound familiar, it's alot like being the main healer in a group as a Shaman.  We can't replace a Cleric w/o a huge mana strain and tidy mana management, so why should a Chanter/Bard/BL be able to replace us w/o some kind of strain?<br />
<br />
Or, just give me Ensnare...I will solo the rest of my time in EQ :P<br />
