<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Psycotika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">just wondering what root everyone uses... at 57 I still use the level 14 spell  :D when root rotting it seems to break EVERY time I cast a new dot. for me, all roots seem to do this though. /sigh or mabye I just have crappy luck hehe<br />
<br />
in groups I usually load up Paralyzing Earth for when I need to ghetto CC and park them away from the group.<br />
<br />
anyway, I was just wondering what root works best for you guys at what level</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aridor1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have used immobilize since the day i got it, cheap mana cost, good duration, super fast cast.   to me, its a winner.   I only stopped using it when I hit 65 and got the 64/65 dots and use the lvl64 root, petrifying earth, it has a longer cast time then immobilize and more mana but its rarely resisted even without malo and lasts a long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">root or petrifying earth</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">In group as temporary crowd control:  Immobilize.  Not too expensive, and I like the quick cast, even if it lasts only a minute.<br />
<br />
Soloing, I use Paralying Earth.  It usually sticks through Plague, sometimes even through Bane.  Wishing I had Pox of B.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">once you get the 64 root you wont use anything else :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">once you get the 64 root you wont use anything else :)<br />
I still occasionally use the 62 root (Greater Immobilize) just for the faster cast time over Petrifying Earth, since both have the -30 resist modifier on them.  But if I'm parking them for CC, Petrifying Earth is the way to go.<br />
<br />
I know many swear by the level 14 root for the mana savings, but mana generally isn't a problem after Torpor/Canni5.  So Petrifying Earth is the winner in my book.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I used Paralyzing Earth up till I got Petrifying Earth and I still am surprised the latter has not been nerfed.  They are both great for root/rotting multiple mobs at once.<br />
<br />
Greater Immobilize is pretty handy in situations where you need to root off a horde of incoming mobs fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Immobilize is the one I almost always have up. Fast casting and I use it a lot. When grouped with a chanter, every mob gets a root right before the mez break. Waiting for a tank to taunt 2 or 3 times  before a mez break just takes too long. <br />
<br />
Usually, if I need to switch over to PE for something long lasting, I'll just sit down and mem it when needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>slimb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Fetter :)<br />
<br />
But being a wizard I don't count.  I find my fetter will generally hold through two or three nukes if I'm lucky, or it'll break when I look at the mob funny.   However, I would stick with immobilize personally and used it until I got fetter (hated the PE and Enstill, used level 4 root until I got immobilize)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Depends on the situation.  Generally when grouped in the planes I have greater immobilize memmed for the cast time.  Even with an enchanter there'll be times when you need to assist with cc.  When I'm soloing places like seb or pog for cash, its greater immobilize, lets me park green/l.blue adds for (usually) 3 full minutes while I take out whatever I'm killing.  The level 14 root is also in the front of my book for root-dotting, and for when I'm duoing with my rogue buddy, to keep proximity aggro on myself so he can backstab, and not blow a mana bar doing it :)</div></div><hr />
