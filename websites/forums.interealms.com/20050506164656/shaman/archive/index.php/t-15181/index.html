<br />

<br />
Stormhammer server : Legacy of ages(VT, Sol Ro tower) www.legacyofages.com ; raid time shift toward Korean/Asia, raid start about 9pm Aussie time<br />
<br />
those raiding guild ususlly expect you raid 4-6 hours per night, and at lease 4-5 days per weeks  <br />
<br />
there are plenty of smaller aussie guild I can't remember, and also lots of other big guild raid at asia time zone with mixed of Aussie/asia radier which similar to Legacy of Ages, those guild ususlly start raid 9-10pm Aussie time(eg, Star at Tunare is PoTime guild base on HK)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>UloffBigkev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Bah Shamam, you always beat me to these posts :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hmmm.... Shamam, how come you know so much about Aussie guilds on so many servers? :)<br />
<br />
I am in SA on Prexus and we are starting into Elementals now and recruitment is on hold for the moment.<br />
<br />
But if you are interested drop a note on the boards and an officer will respond to your queries. Or just send a x-server tell :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Xhosa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">On the Tribunal server as stated there is Aurora Noctum and Southern Legion.<br />
<br />
Aurora Noctum is a full time raiding gear requiring level 65 and required AAs depanding on class. Thier players must be available to raid minumum 4 times per week and are expected to raid if they are online. <br />
<br />
Southern Legion (100+ members ,500+ characters in guild) is more social but do take on some hefty mobs and fast making their way to AoW and the first set of PoP Bosses. SL have no level requirement to join and raids are not compulsory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>shakoor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Oh wow, I didnt know there are so many of them! Thanks guys for the info, I'll definitely check them out. And I live in Sydney, for someone who asked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Diashan Malkier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">was suprised myself how many, ive met about 4 Australains on Karana, though it would be nice to chat with people who understood our humour at times, the US raid times seem to suit me better, no way could I raid 4 mights a week, my wife hates the game with a passion.<br />
I just moved from Wollonging to North Nowra, the more miles between me and Sydney the better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I play on Brell<br />
I belong to Zenith http://pub63.ezboard.com/bzenith64504 is the forum.<br />
We like shaman, look us up, use my name.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah and we are the only Aussie guild. There are a couple of Asian guilds that log on soon after us but like most servers Aussie hours are quite quiet, we have those areas we are capable of raiding pretty much to ourselves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Dont know about Aussie guilds, but E'ci has a couple Hong Kong/Asian based guilds. Those are probably a couple hours behind Sydney though, arent they?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>7ekno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hey Guys  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Legacy of Ages on Stormhammer has 1 (may be 2 soon) openings for a Shaman, we recent had one of our guys quit   :eek: <br />
<br />
The advantage to SH is you get to keep your gear   :cool:  bad news is it cost $$  :( <br />
<br />
Our Raid times start at 8pm Sydney time (low key mobs), we have a full raid force (72+, last Bertoxx raid we had to drop peeps) by about 9pm, we maintain a full raid force for 3-4 hours !<br />

Guild chat is Aussie chat here. Best advice I could give is to make an alt on each server you interested in and send tells to some of the people in each guild and see who you like and what their requirements are. Ask for a name of an officer and chat to them. Find a guild that meets your requirements and vice versa. Do you want to raid 7 days a week or do you want a raiding guild that is social at the same time where raids are not compulsory ?</div></div><hr />
