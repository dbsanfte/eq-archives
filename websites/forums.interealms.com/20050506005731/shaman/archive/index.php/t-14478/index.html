I am currently 63 without epic and the only AAs I have are due to flags (4 currently). I am not sure if there's anyone else, I know there was one shaman that made it to level 62, but I never see him on anymore. That doesn't include anyone that might be roleplay or anon. ^_^ If you're a froggy shaman on povar I'd love to hear from you ^_^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">We had a level 50 frog shammy flagged in my last guild less than 3 weeka after LoY went live. then the guy parked the shammy, he is one of those guys who plays 5 toons at once and was an officer in the guild. We had 3-4 level 60's without epic but this guy abused his power and got his, needless to say thats one reason why i left. Personally I hate twinked up alts who get thier epic then don't get played.</div></div><hr />

Good for you.  We all know what an extraordinarily taxing chore thinking is for you.  <br />

Gold star and a pudding snack for Kkrush.  Your mom will be sooo very proud of her widdle man...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Vhalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">A couple of Frogs with Epics on Rathe that i see all the time :<br />
<br />
Ribbislow -- 65 + epic, Shaman<br />
Ribbiburn -- 65 + epic, Wizard<br />
<br />
If you gotten at least one toon to 65 (no matter how long it took you) you can get an alt to 65 super fast. I believe Ribbislow had 20 days /played when he got 65 w/epic. <br />
<br />
First toon to 65 is taking long time because you spend a lot of time learning the game, making friends, raiding, questing, tradeskilling... <br />
<br />
...when you take an alt and want to get him to 65 you than already know pretty much every XP place in the game, have friends who can powerlevel you (or use your old lvl65 main to do that,) you dont group with newbies 1-60; you dont *waste* time tradeskilling, questing, raiding; you twink the heck out of the alt; you can pretty much finish entire epic in two days with one group. <br />
<br />
Im not saying that they got their alts to 65 not legit, in a matter of fact it was very legit, they worked on everything that they have on that alt and the only part they *skipped* was the boring XP time that most of us hate :D ... I highly doubt that someone could get their alt to 65 in 20 days /played including getting an epic if they havent done it the *hard way* before with their original toons.</div></div><hr />
