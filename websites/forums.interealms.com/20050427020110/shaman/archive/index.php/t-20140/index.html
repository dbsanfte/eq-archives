<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>spiritsofding</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Named mob in chardok near graveyard before the arch,<br />
<br />
He used to drop a hammer as his RARE.<br />
<br />
A nice 16 22 no drop hammer......very nice twink item for a sk.....it procs an anti undead DD.<br />
<br />
As this is difficult spot to camp, i have not seen this mob drop said hammer since a chardy raid in mar 2002.<br />
<br />
Anyone seen it drop in recent days??<br />
<br />
Believe its got same grpahic as copper hammer.<br />
<br />
sk id in in 30s stil and kos,,,,,,,,,so tough to get this drop!!<br />
<br />
I have a old alt parked in chardy whos ally that i use to chk spawns....<br />
<br />
any info appreciated)<br />
<br />
<br />
acquired jeldorin from GYard a little while back.......someone offerd me 15k for it!!  Shame the halfling mask is no drop........would be perma camped i guess then tho!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xatrei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Was passing through there about 4 weeks ago, and Zo'Lun was holding the hammer when I passed him.  Didn't have any gimps nearby that could use it, so I didn't bother to kill him.  Got the hammer for my rezbot about 8 months ago.  Those are the only 2 times that I recall seeing the hammer, and I used to farm chardok a lot - it's quite rare.  He spawns reasonably often, but he has 3 other loots (2 droppable, 1 no drop) that are all more common than the hammer.<br />
<br />
Not sure I'd agree with you on the twink value, though.  Like all other chardok loots with a proc, it procs at 49.  Until then, it's just an ugly hammer (looks like a Hammer of the Dragonborn) with a decent ratio, and there are far better weapons to put into an SK's hand than this.  You may not want to burn a lot of energy on this one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>spiritsofding</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No idea what the hammer u mentioned lookslike....<br />
<br />
graphic dont really matter tho.<br />
<br />
lookded it up on allahkzam...........&quot;This weapon + a mage focus bracer can amount to about 330odd hp per proc&quot;   vs ubdead of course.<br />
<br />
hmm k u probably right......its just a fun toy , than anything really worth the effort......u can buy 20 22 ihb in bazaar for 200pp these days LOL(glacierbone hammer)<br />
<br />
stil something to aim at i guess)<br />
<br />
glad it still drops!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xatrei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Actually, I retract the &quot;ugly hammer&quot; bit.. When describing the graphic, I was thinking of another hammer (Sarnak Lightning Caller) that drops from a different named in the Chardok mines.  That is the one which looks like the the hammer of the dragonborn (or worker's sledgemallet or dark ember).  The hammer dropped by Zo'Lun looks like a Sentry Maul (2 handed sledgehammer look w/ opaque head).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That ratio was good in Kunark days.  It's not worth it anymore.  You can buy glacierbone hammers (18/22) for 1-200pp now.  The recommended level cap appears broken, so no penalty for not being lvl 60.  There are others that are 1.0 ratios, as well.  Good in it's day, but not anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>spiritsofding</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i use the glacier bone hammer atmo(20/22).<br />
<br />
Am wanting the dizok hammer for soloing undead...i am a fanof charasis and so this hammer will be useful there; sk has a imp dam IV ring on atmo.<br />
<br />
Certainly this item is a mere luxury, that i wil be lucky to pickup.......i not gonna break my back to get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>spiritsofding</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i have a best alt i play sometimes, and have been in chadok alot kiling stuff ....farming certain drops.<br />
<br />
Killing here gives +ve goblin hits<br />
<br />
Therefore the idea of being NON kos to goblins is a possibility.<br />
<br />
<br />
The obvious advantage would be that of easier farming in droga.<br />
<br />
I guess SOMEone out there must have killed ALOT of sarnaks over the years.......<br />
<br />
has anyone tried this???<br />
<br />
shame there no hand in npc like herald &quot;ow dont hit me&quot;</div></div><hr />
