Some news for you all. <br />
<br />
Call of the Ancients, apparently the description is incorrect and we will be refunding any AA's used to purchase it. It is intended to grant HP and not endurance. <br />
<br />
I talked with the &quot;Spell Guy&quot; and he was already looking at making some adjustments to healing including HoT and will let me know when he has something concrete. <br />
<br />
The team is also looking to shift the slow immune creatures about, in some Gates zones, so that there are no concentrations of them in one area. <br />
<br />
I will pass along more information as I get it. <br />

This was posted on my Guilds message board by a fellow shaman, however no link and I have yet been able to find out where he saw the post. I may even be behind the times and this is old news to everyone.<br />
<br />
If so please toss me some links!<br />
<br />
Otherwise all I can say is I am highly upset that our Healing spells get upgraded then in a nerf our first and only Raidable MGB is nerfed into just another God Leader AA. I don't know about you all but my guild while raiding has been enjoying the Endurance Regen and when doing some rather hard Adventures it does make a difference!<br />
<br />
Do others feel this way?<br />
<br />
Why is it now being made into a HP buff? Did SoE find that Endurance Regen is to overpowering? And how?<br />
<br />
Found this link on my own, following them is another story:<br />

<br />
However this AA in itself has not been talked about and what impact in turning this into a Hp/Health Regen vs a END ward would have on our class. I mean we finally got a MGB/AA sorta and it was unique in it regen'd Endurance - There is no other way to do that in game!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tikcuf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There is another thread about this (I'm to lazy to look for it) that states this has always been a hp regen and never was endurance...<br />
<br />
Search is your friend... :D<br />
<br />

Well I was going on the info people where giving me Ward vs no Ward in regen of their end. <br />
<br />
However it still does not answer the question, why nerf our only class unique AA and make us another healing Ward which prob will not stack. Unless its a AA like SotW CeleRegen or Paragon then really there is no point in making it a ward that will be killed with the first wave of an AoE.<br />
<br />
As it is now 4 shamans cast MGB Sta Focus and CHA and whatever else just to make the 9AA of MGB worth it, why not put some forthought on our use of MGB much like Druids have to?</div></div><hr />
