Shawn Lord: Your group can approach certain NPCs who will ask them to perform a task or explore a location. If the party leader accepts the adventure, the party will be given what is, essentially, a key to the dungeon. All members of the group will be able to enter that dungeon to face the dangers there, but other player characters will not. These dungeons will be created on the server specifically for their use, and will only exist as long as the characters are having their adventure.</div></div><hr />

Oh.My.God.<br />
This sounds awesome for me, a shaman who hates raiding with the fire of 10,000 suns, and my tiny guild!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">We are also introducing some new environmental elements: objects that break, or need special skills to open, etc.<br />
<br />
If I find a nice shield that breaks all the time, I'm going to be very unhappy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Orgak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This makes me happy in the pants.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's not the way I read it. I read that as in, you're fighting near some crates, and you stumble through them - they crash to the floor and fall apart.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">this sounds like its going to be the_best_expansion_yet.  i can't wait!  for a more casual player in a smaller guild, this is going to simply own.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>woon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Aye I hope it will be as good as it sounds. would be good to go crawling in some dungeons with some friends. But they really need to redo some of the existing dungeons now imo without having to buy a new expansion. Hopefully they will keep it up ala nurga and droga<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Sounds like Sony pulled their head partway out of their behind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Now... on to the itemization!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Lethis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Score one for the casual player  :) One group for a 30 to 90 minute dungeon sounds really appealing to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Toshizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Guess you will never be able to find me again...I bet with enough preparation I could go through the whole area solo maybe. Sounds like a NICE expandion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>wsbsteven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">This was one of the things I liked about Anarchy Online.  I just hope there aren't any &quot;brown cave&quot; missions, Old AO players know what I'm talking about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I feel loved.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Lethis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">This was one of the things I liked about Anarchy Online.  I just hope there aren't any &quot;brown cave&quot; missions, Old AO players know what I'm talking about.<br />
<br />
Those were THE worst missions. I never took missions that weren't in cities for that very reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Foggy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">This potentially sounds like the best expansion yet for me.  I would love to be able to pop on for an hour or 2 and do something meaningful, rather than log on, get in group, sit in corner of Tactics pit for a couple of hours.  Getting together with a group of mates and fighting my way all the way through a dungeon sounds awesome to me, I really hate camping one spot.  Only real shame is that they cant do a Diablo style dungeon generation where the actual dungeon changes each time you go in it :) But I'll settle for what they are offering - it will hopefully extend the life of EQ for a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>ColtraneRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'm really looking forward to his as well. Sounds like they are doing a few good things up there at Verant. Now let's talk about handing out all those PoP zone flags....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>trolebus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I have a question about instancing:<br />
<br />
Were are we going to go to get corpses back? If we are bound outside, no one will be able to go back for his/her corpse (a new instance would be created, with no corpse). <br />
I supose they will take this into account, but just in case, i mention it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I would hope they have something like graveyards for these, otherwise a fair proportion of people will stick to PoP for exp.</div></div><hr />
