<br />
If I get some tradeskill time this weekend I am thinking of sitting at the ledge in OT and waiting till a 'goon wanders up to terrorize everyone and jump him. <br />
<br />
Refresh my memory - the general is lvl 60 right? The others are 55. Are they all Shadowknights? From the numerous beatings I took from them back in the day, I seem to remember they proc'd some sort of 150DD while pounding my head in. I have a full spellbook save for malo. Can anyone who has been in on a 'good keelin recently give me some thoughts about em. <br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

Last time I was running to Droga to work on faction (Ally last night, woot) I stopped to pick on a goon.   I malo it, then I try to slow, bounce, bounce.  Root, bounce, bounce.  They are pretty MR even after Malo.  I didn't feel like a knockdown drag out fight with a goon, so I went to slaughter goblins instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I too am waiting for the day when I can hand Innoruuk, Dragoon T'Vex's ass ! I owe the general as well. They are all SK's, and I believe that all the goons minus the General are lvl 50. Other than that I'm not sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gytmee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I stopped off in OT the other day when I only had like 1 1/2 hours to play and was camped in SF from helping to kill Talendor.  Killed 3 of them (NOT the general), and they all went down quite easily.  I malo'd (didn't bother with malosini after it), slowed, cast one bane (I found out quick they are very if not completely DR, so didn't use poxx - although I never tried it with ID first *shrug*), and then just epic and jbb, standing in his melee range the whole time, casting torpor when needed (which was only like twice per goon I think).  I was happy to get some revenge from all my deaths at their hands when I was in my 30s and low 40s :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Regular goons are lvl 51. general is 58.<br />
<br />
regular goons are warrior types. <br />
<br />
general is a SK.<br />
<br />
they are fairly MR, tho i can snare them and kite them with fair amount of ease. assist range is also huge, gotta find a nice safe place cuz they wander at ya from halfway across the zone.<br />
<br />
don't bother trying to root. waste of time.<br />
<br />
they drop a black stone that's inny diety only no stats, DE only, and has no use that i can find.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Was in OT killin golums last night, killed about 10 goons, and the general 4 times. regular ones slowable, no malo, few resists, general, no dice, had to use ID/POI.<br />
<br />
I feel a little better now.</div></div><hr />
