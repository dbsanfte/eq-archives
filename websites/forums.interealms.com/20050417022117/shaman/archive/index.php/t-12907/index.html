<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Roktar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">25 Shaman looking for hunting grounds, pref solo, but i will take anything. I've tried DSP but cant get a grp, so I guess i'm a little low. Open to all suggestions, thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Keriru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've been soloing right next door since lvl 20...sometimes I partner with hubby's BST...just dinged 25 - mostly soloing.<br />
<br />
Rockhoppers in M.Seru. I run from NL across the zone to the other zone line. I single pull stonegrabbers and rockhoppers inside the tunnel, because the guards don't help and I avoid adds.<br />
<br />
I don't know much about shammy's, but I think I'm doing okay. I get all buffed up and sowed, pull with slow, run a bit, weaken, run in the tunnel, dot, run all the way back, dot again, and than melee...nuking if it's yellow or red. <br />
<br />
I never zone, if I'm struggling, I run out the tunnel, root, run back in the tunnel to med and heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sordia Winetrsbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I agree with the M. Seru.  I am currently leveling my warrior there, you will be able to solo rocks and greyhoppers.  I have been there since 20ish and the exp is still very good at 27.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm 26 now and I'm also in MS...goes pretty fast fighting yellows and reds...I plan to move to DSP or Sola or Lower Guk at 29 (in case you were curious... :cool: )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Baxteria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">On pvp, it is difficult for evil races, well around my level, to solo on the moon, and although M Saru, and even PC was good to 25 (26 really l blued out), I could not hope to do that without a strong group of evil brothers.<br />
<br />
So, I went to Warslik Woods and fought at the Dalnir Cave. The yetis con yellow, even, and a few blue at 23, but if your twinked or just have a tank partner, you'll do find. However, any addition is fine, I guess because i was using a 21 Chanter before SK volunteered his services. Anyway, ding 24, scribe, and stay here...if the exp is good, and I know it will be, why leave? Your safe and it will get you to 27, no problem. At 25 - 27, although a group of a tank (for MA, unless you find a monk on PvP that is evil) and a chanter is great for Dalnir Entrance. First, the exp on pvp is increased over that of regular servers, the bonus for being in a dungeon, and group exp makes this combo of players fly by. Only advice I have to offer...when in doubt, call it, and get out. Nothing worse than going back for a cr and finding a Coerced *Insert Name Here* CC your body. Hope this helps and good luck.<br />

Yoos gots to be carefuls of de wizards tho, deys can burn yoos down fast.  Just be shure to leave dat placer in a hurre if yoos gets in trubles.<br />

Dem gobos neer de entrance can gos down veree fast too yoos Envenomerd Breath spell,  yoos can also slow dems attackers speed with yer slowee spell and tank dems some.<br />
<br />
ooc: Basically just solo near the entrance and look out for the wizards.  The MOBs give a good 2% a kill as a troll and proabably more as another race.  I pull with slow, then E. Breath, then root.  Then depending on my hps I melee until I am 50-55%hps and back off.  Throw in the occasional nuke and DoT again when it wears off and you will have yourself a dead goblin.  Loot is ok In about 30mins I got 16% with zoneing a few times and a few other mishaps and about 10-15pp-ish from vendor loot.  Also I kept regen up at all times and almost constantly kept my life at 60% with canni-dancing and waiting a tick or two, and canni-ing again.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Savvik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I did 24 to 27 in the Needlite room in Echo Caverns this weekend. Root, and your 2 best dot's them melee till they run and let the dot finish them off. Once the 2 spawn is broken, it is a very easy camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Lyanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I did my warrior from 25-30 in Merus Seru, almost always took things on when I was 50% health.   My shammy like my warrior just started working near the Sanctus Seru entrance and rockhoppers seem to give the most bang for the buck (less hp) at 25 for me.  But if your an evil race (shammy is iksar) Sanctus Seru will welcome you to dinner, with you as the side dish.<br />
<br />
So sad, I liked that city.  Once you learn where the right vendors are that will talk to strangers, get used to the big open spaces, then the backdrop makes it a nice place.  Very pretty, very unfriendly.</div></div><hr />
