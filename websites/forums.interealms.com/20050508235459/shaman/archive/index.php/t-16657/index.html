<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">In a Ruj Hills normal adventure the other night, this was our one gear drop:<br />
<br />
Spaulders of the Slavemaster<br />
Slot: SHOULDER  <br />
AC: +8 Cha: +8 Wis: +5 Int: +5 Disease Resist: +8 Cold Resist: +8<br />
HP: +40 Mana: +20  <br />
Classes: All Classes  <br />
Races: All Races<br />
Slot 1:  Type 1<br />
Recommended Level: 63<br />
<br />
Since I won the roll, I set about to try to sell it and discovered 6 available in the bazaar at prices down to 1500pp.  Thinking about it, the big problem is the crazy recommended level of 63.  I mean, how many level 63 players would wear this?  Nice enough item for a level 40 player, but 63?  <br />
<br />
I am sure Sony knows this, so what are they up to with these LDoN drops and their recommended levels?  My theory is that Sony is using these drops and the player economy of the bazaar to establish a certain minimum level of gear for, in the case of this drop, level 63 players.  Since these will obviously be readily available and cheap, Sony can tune the LDoN dungeons on normal with the knowledge that even the most casual player of this level will have gear of at least this level.  It sets a &quot;lowest common denominator&quot; for gear.<br />
<br />
Any other theories why the recommended levels seem so out of whack?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Any other theories why the recommended levels seem so out of whack?<br />
<br />
Because LDoN is meant for the non-raiding people and those without anything from PoP, the raiding crew was simply &quot;thrown a bone&quot; to keep 'em from clicking &quot;End Billing&quot; after &quot;Quarm has been slain by ...&quot;.  Not everyone is fortunate enough with their dice to obtain anything out of BoT (I know from personal experience) or feels like stashing up the cash to try to buy it, so instead they have the option of exploring the dungeons, having fun, gaining experience and money, and the occasionally decent drop.<br />
<br />
Sure, there's some decent stuff out of PoJ (Pauldrons of Witness comes to mind, had that before getting Weatherbeaten Shoulderpads out of BoT one night), but not everybody can (or wants to) go there.  If it wasn't for the dumb luck in Bazaar I had with the Pauldrons before moving from Rodcet to Maelin and the even dumber luck of having the Weatherbeaten Shoulderpads defaulted because it was an upgrade, I shiver at the thought of thinking about what I might have in it's place.<br />
<br />
Why should not wanting/having time to raid be a &quot;glass ceiling&quot;?<br />
<br />
That probably wouldn't be too bad of a chanter shoulder either, though I have no chanter nor any that high, so I can't comment on that.  Just because there might be better for shamans out there, doesn't mean it won't be a real nice upgrade for another class that may otherwise get overlooked.<br />
<br />
That's my thoughts on it anyway.<br />
<br />
Also, remember LDoN is still a new expansion, SOE has a habit of drop-nerfing just after an expansion is released, so... wait and see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Phatcow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The lvl 65 point of view ...<br />
<br />
Anyway the first night of ldon I got a Steel-something BP and it was a total upgrade for me=)  On my warrior I got that Guard2 1hs weap which was an upgrade for me.  There was a monk tunic that dropped last night and the monk said /shrug ... point is and I believe this as a person who runs a vendor almost 24/7 someone will buy anything you put up for sale.  Yes those shoulders weren't all that for a lvl 63 but as Karaab said ... not everyone is a uber raider who would scoff at this.  Think about it goto the bazaar tonight and look up windblades.  In Bristlebane there will be 1-10 for sale 15-20k ... they will all be sold in a weeks time and then there will be another 10 up there.  They will sell once they find their price and recommend doesn't me required.  I bet a lvl 55 person could buy these without taking that much of a hit.  To each his own =)<br />
<br />
BUT...<br />
<br />
these should be recommened 40 for sure because they do suck =)  RvR was not thought out on these.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hmm isnt this the sort of post that someone somewhere else on the board commented on as in people looking down their noses at other people.<br />
Woot yer this gear isnt great but i know a lot of people who would wear it.<br />
Lets use me as an example.<br />
Lvl 62 now currently got roughly 2k in the bank.<br />
Play roughly 2 to 3 hrs per day 4 or 5 days a week.<br />
Still no Torpor but ive got no way of getting 30kish together only got Malo as i spent a few days farming.<br />
My shoulder slot is Shawl of the Firewalker which i only got as someone had priced up in Bazaar at 500pp.<br />
Not all of us are in raid guilds or can play god knows how many hours per day and perhaps now Sony realise this and also realise the fact that people like me are a large part of their customer base.<br />
Before you all start saying well you could go farm etc etc let me ask you why should i invest so much time farming just to get a halfway decent bit of gear.Its just a huge timesink and before anyone says well you have to do it think of how many people on this board complain about not having an out of group shrink as thats a huge timesink :).<br />
Then there is the final solution to you looting this crap gear :-Either dont roll on the drop or now youve got it just give it away.<br />
<br />
PS<br />
<br />
How dare Sony release an expansion that you dont need to be in an uber guild to enjoy :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tiorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Have you ever seen the jasinth crap that drops in KC?<br />
<br />
I mean hello, clearly a lvl 50 ish zone with stuff that is NO DROP, &quot;BOGGLE&quot; for lvl 20ish characters?<br />
<br />
Sometimes I WONDER if anyone, I mean ANYONE at Sony actually has EVER, I mean EVER played EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Maybe the point of my post wasnt clear.  I am not looking down on anybody's gear, in fact I seldom raid and my gear is crap compared to most raiders.  My point is that even someone like myself, with modest bazaar level gear, is surprised by the high recommended levels on this stuff.  This a useless drop to, I would guess, 70% or 80% of the recommended level 63 players.  This seems to be typical of many of the LDoN loot drops in the normal adventures.<br />
<br />
What interests me is, why did Sony make this seemingly strange design decision?  And the point is not to complain that it is a bad design decision, maybe it is a good design decision.  I just find it interesting to try to figure out what Sony is up to--and I believe these recommended levels are telling us what Sony's internal design assumptions are for the lowest common denominator of gear at a given level.  Indeed, these plentiful drops with a high recommended level (thus, cheap in the bazaar) will make it so.  In effect, it is a way of ensuring that even the most casual of players will be geared up to this level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Some people have short memories (that is to say that many people have not been playing EQ for that long). There was a time when Jarsarth was worm by many shaman, and worn with pride - the leggings and the bracer were both considered quite a reasonable choice. Sure, jarsarth looks pathetic now, but an awful lot has changed since the days when Kurnak was a new expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Any other theories why the recommended levels seem so out of whack?<br />
Isn't it obvious?  Its the +8 CHA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think there are a couple things you need to keep in mind when considering this issue. This is not the first expansion to have &quot;questionable&quot; suggested levels on drops. This is the type of equipment they THINK you should be using at those levels. They know many can and will do better but this is their way of limiting the amount of people who have access to really nice stuff. Remember when they used to put negative stats on stuff? This is the new, and I think, better way of accomplishing their goal. I don't neccessarily aggree with their point of view but they didn't ask me before they made their decision.  <br />
<br />
Secondly, if you notice, over the course of the last 3 expansions they have increased the amount of &quot;usable&quot; items being dropped and the ease with which you can acquire them. In just one day of soloing in LoY, I can come up with several pieces of equipment, some of which I may actually want to use. This is in response to all the, I think valid, complaints that it is just too hard to earn equipment through honest effort. One of the checks on this is the fact that many ( actually all that I can think of ) are lore, meaning you cannot bring an absurd amount of them into the game, some of which you use, the rest of which you sell in the bazaar to people who may never have been in the zone you got it from. Secondly is the whole recommended level thing. That just makes that equipment appealing to a smaller number of people.<br />
<br />
I don't always agree with the decisions they make, but I can at least understand them. There are some items that no one in their right mind would be using at the recommended level, because there are better/easier to acquire items somewhere else in the game. Its a big game and they sometimes overlook stuff like that. Personally I would like it if they would spend more time fixing things like this that are wrong in the game and less time selling us new expansions, but they would not make as much money if they did that. By the way, I love LDoN, I would just like the things I've already payed for to be right before I give them money for something new. <br />

I had a plate BP with decent AC drop the other night that is probably the best pally/sk tradeable BP for the lvl 60 recommendation, better then the blue diamond cultural stuff. The chain BP is above the level of a tae ew bp, so also usefull at 60.  The leather drops I've seen were rather poor for the recommended level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Whenever I look at anything with a rec level cultural armor comes to mind. Since there is so much of this stuff in existance with a resonable rec level of 45, why can't they just balance rec levels on anything else compared to the cultural?<br />
<br />
Theres a lot of PoP drops with rec levels of 50 or 55 thats not even close to cultural quality. That is something I've never understood.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I like it. Means that if I group with someone actually playing an honest to goodness &quot;first character&quot; they'll have relatively easy access to decent gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">They've had relative ease to decent gear for awhile now.  It just depends on what you consider decent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">/shrug<br />
<br />
I wore a Tattered Mantle til I got the shoulder from the named frog in PoS, and then the Haste of Mithaniel shoulder thingy from PoI factory.  This was well after I turned 65, and not all that long ago.  There just isn't a lot of good buyable hp stuff for some slots, shoulders is one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Whether you agree that the level is too high or not, it seems to me that it's their way of making sure that it's scaled to the level you can attain it at.<br />
<br />
The recommened level 63 stuff drops from the highest level normal dungeon - when your average level is 62 or higher. The stuff coming from lower level dungeons has lower recommended levels.<br />
<br />
I don't see anything much wrong with making stuff reach its full potential only at the level you can attain it at. The biggest counter argument to this is that there are already better items out there with lower recommended levels. They're trying to do things the &quot;right&quot; way, just that things have been screwed up for too long for it to make much difference.<br />
<br />
But, I am wearing 2 upgrades that have dropped in LDoN normal dungeons, and it was a close call on the Crypt Robber's BP too, so I don't think it's all that out of whack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>trolebus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">&quot;recomended&quot; is the key word here. <br />
<br />
I would love every item having recomended levels. That way twinks wouldnt be so overpowered at their lvl and non twinks could have someone to group.<br />
<br />
Twinks lvl up so fast and easy that at the end they just don't know the class they are playing. <br />
<br />
With recomended lvls, equipment give some stats acording to the lvl of the user, so twinks have &quot;nice&quot; equipment,  not &quot;gods&quot; equipment. <br />
<br />
That &quot;63 recomended&quot;, means a little less stats at 60 and a little more at 55 but can still be wearable, so it doesn't limit the market that much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Phatcow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">On one of my twinks I think he is wearing 50% recommended stuff .. come one we all know stats dont mean anything =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Yodelroy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Oh nos! you figured out the secret meaning of LDoN!!!<br />
<br />
L = Lowest<br />
D = Denominator<br />
o = or<br />
N = No-drop</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Well, I agree with Roxanne.<br />
<br />
If you are 63 and you don't already have at least equivalent or better shoulders, you aren't trying very hard.  Therefore, what's the point in this drop?  <br />
<br />
/testbuff comes to live servers in a way.  <br />
<br />
I wore several pieces of Jarsath at one time.  That stuff was the shiznit then.  I even gathered an almost full suit just because I liked the chain look back then.  I wish we had that look with the new models.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">It would seem to me that the reason for this is to, for the first time in a meaningful way, prevent lowbie mudflation, and quite frankly, it looks to me that they're doing a relatively good job at it.<br />
<br />
If there for instance were no recommended level on those, and everyone and their brother got one in the bazar at lower levels, then the classic &quot;why bother?&quot; syndrome would come.<br />
<br />
I'm glad to see the rec levels on the gear, I just wish it sold to merchants.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Update:  As of last night, there were 10 of these Spaulders of the Slavemaster for sale on Bertox and the price had dropped to 490pp.  Whether it is intended or not by Sony, I think there is no doubt that this level of gear dropping in LDoN will very quickly become a new baseline of gear for the levels indicated.  I suppose this is no different from the plentiful drops of previous expansions, especially since the bazaar opened.</div></div><hr />
