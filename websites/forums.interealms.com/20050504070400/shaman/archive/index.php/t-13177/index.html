<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Korsib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a quick question that I am hoping to get answered.  Basically, I am looking for opinions on what is faster as mana regen, either, watching for my mana regen tick, stand up, cast canni, then sit down, or just chain cast canni, letting my mana regen while I stand up.  Also, I don't have a horse/lizard yet, I realize this won't be an issue when I do, but until then, I have to watch the ticks.  also, I realize what kind of mana regen you have (FT, KEI, and others) change this, but just sort of a general opinion is what I'm looking for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">edit - deleted reply.... sorry you a frog.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">watching for my mana regen tick, stand up, cast canni, then sit down<br />
<br />
You got it!  Canni Dance &gt; all.  I've found that a player info box with percentages will show the tick quite clearly.  If you get into the habit of doing this now, you'll love yourself later on when you're indoors and again horseless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sordia Winetrsbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There is a noticable difference in how fast you regen mana when you cani-dance (sit and med with the tick) then when you just chain cast cani.  I will tell you that once you start cani-dancing, if you make an alt, make sure you put a harmless thing like sense heading where you put your hotkey, and never put gate in your cani-spot.  You don't want to know how many times I ended up at my bind point instead of cani-ing when I used to swap cani out for other spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>kanelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">why would anyone unmem canni ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Khatmandu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Much faster doin the dance. Stoicism/Torpor makes it even meaner.<br />
<br />
Have tried both standing and dancing and dancing beats it significantly.<br />
<br />
<br />
And as soon as I can buy a lizard when I get the funds I am going to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I would highly recommend buying a mount as quickly as possible.  I&#8217;m sure it helps other casting classes as well, but for a shaman it invaluable.  I love just being able to chain cast canni from the back of my little green lizard.  And when I&#8217;m indoors I really miss Poky.  He sucks for movement, but he&#8217;s my new best friend when it comes to casting.<br />
<br />
And if you don&#8217;t have one I&#8217;ll second the recommendation for a player window with percentages.  I used to get headaches from watching that stupid blue bar.  But my new window has percentages and it makes a world of difference. <br />
<br />
Another game altering experience is the stoicism spell.  As soon as you can, get some friends together and do the quest.  If you can complete the quest before you can actually cast the spell, all the better.  That way you can memorize it as soon as gain your level.  Doing my canni dance indoors still takes a painfully long time, but now I can heal myself up quickly and without using up tons of manna I just danced for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">HAHA Radag</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sordia Winetrsbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">why would anyone unmem canni ?<br />
<br />
*chuckles*<br />
<br />
I USED to un-mem cani to gate out somewhere for speed (it was and still is in my 8th spell spot).  I USED to re-mem cani afterwards, but of course I didn't always remember to do this.  <br />
<br />
And honestly I know I am not the only one who has done this, I know quite a few other shaman on Xev that have had cani-gate incidents.<br />
<br />
Other more useless spells slots get dropped now, and I haven't done this since sometime in my 40's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My Cann-based accidents all come from playing casting alts, and trying to Cannibalize.<br />
<br />
I learned to put &quot;safe&quot; spells in slot 8 PDQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The canni-dance is more efficient than just standing there and casting canni but I lost patience for canni dance about a year ago.  If you just get a horse then you don't need to canni dance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Getan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">a skill of 200 in Med give approximately 20 mana a tick. Canni 1 gives between 20 and 29 mana a tick. If you can time things right and get both Canni and Med to go off during the same tick you get 40+ a tick. This is why the Can Dance is so effective.<br />
<br />
With a horse you get to med while standing up which lets you chain cast Canni while still getting the benefit of Med. I've noticed though that you don't get the bonus regen for siting when on a horse. You also can't use bear form while on a horse so there are some trade offs when using a horse.</div></div><hr />

Spammed every 4 secs or so... for some reason monks can't canni... *shrug*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Dasgood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hrmm... At 44 I must say I never have used canni ... With C3 I never seems to be out of mana and all I do is solo.  I guess if you played with out C3 you might use it all the time.<br />

Am I being stupid?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">As with everything in this game, it all depends on your play style.  I haven’t’ really soloed since I was level 38.  So I have to keep everyone in the group buffed, the mobs slowed and often play healer at the same time.  I go through a lot of manna very quickly.  I get KEI whenever I can.  It makes life much more enjoyable.  But once it runs out its back to doing things the old fashioned way.  <br />
<br />
If you don’t need to canni dance with your play style, more power to you.  *smiles*  There’s certainly nothing wrong with it.  I’d suggest learning how to dance, just in case you should need to do so in the future.  But otherwise do whatever works best for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>wsbsteven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Just before I went afk in Trak's Teeth I casted what I thought was invis.  I return to the keyboard at my bind point.  Now I knew I couldn't be dead because I wasn't gone long enough for something minor to kill me, plus I still had my buffs.  Turns out I casted gate instead so I had to run back there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Mafdet de Leone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">As someone points out, depends on how you play your shaman.<br />
<br />
A horse really helps.<br />
FTs item really helps.<br />
Putting AAs into mana regen AND HP regen helps. (mine are maxed)<br />
<br />
I also maxed out WIS very early on--probably in my mid 40s<br />
<br />
I only have to get KEI if I'm solo-ing, or duo-ing with a melee in certain zones, where you might get potentially 4-5 adds or trains that you have to derail.<br />
<br />
In group situations, I don't really need KEI, and I barely have to cana. The only time I really get LOM is if I have to buff a group from the onset or if I have to do Crowd Control on multiple mobs that continually break root...ergh. But, usually by then, the cleric will need a med break as well, so it's not really much of a loss. LOL<br />
<br />
And, no, I don't have Canna5 yet, but will soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Agendon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">If you dont canni you probably arent as effective as you could be... just nuke/dot if you have too much mana! That always helps with faster kills and that means more Exp in the same time...and that is really great, isnt it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Well if your Full health and dont feel the need to canni dance weather in a group or alone your only reaching about 1/2 your potential.  By canniing your health you have effectively increased your mana regen and mana pool by almost twice what you would other wise have.<br />
<br />
The spell doesnt look like much when you look at how much mana it provides in the short term.  Canni 1 gives a whoppen 25 mana for 50 damage at 24.  By level 39 that 25 mana is not all that much.  When you start adding that up though over time it starts to make a huge difference on what you can and can not cast in a length of time.  In 6 secs you get 25 extra mana. (Bah not that good could cast maybe 1 root)  And no one has ever ran out mana and needed just tad bit to get that root off.  Start doing the math though and multiply 25 mana by interval of 6 secs and you start seeing in less then a min your getting enough mana to cast the higher cost nukes, Dots, Heals, or Buffs.  Its not the one cast of Canni that counts its the 10-20 casts that turn you into a mana generating machine.  <br />
<br />
Nothing compairs to being able to keep near full mana when you lack kei and the other casters have kei.  While your casting your 200+mana slows constanly and keeping all those high mana buffs up on your party.  With few enough left to throw couple heals here and there when needed.  When I do have Kei most times it feels wasted as I cant get rid of my mana fast enough.</div></div><hr />

**Is it Cast THEN pause...or pause then Cast? I've seen it both ways on this board.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Luthair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">**Is it Cast THEN pause...or pause then Cast? I've seen it both ways on this board.<br />
<br />
<br />
You may have seen:<br />
/stand<br />
/pause X, /cast Y<br />
/sit<br />
<br />
Which would have the same result</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">why would anyone unmem canni ?<br />
<br />
I always unmem it when gating to bind ...<br />
<br />
Honestly i am too lazy to canni-dance most of the times, when i am not in urgent need for mana. I prefer to just fire off a few cannis (more effective with higher ones) until HPs and mana are equal percentages then med off the rest.<br />
<br />
After all med breaks are good for:<br />
- getting a drink<br />
- using bear's room<br />
- doing housework<br />
... and much much more  ;) <br />
<br />
That doesn't say canni-dance isn't a great tool, when you need the mana/hp FAST.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Before the first board wipe, someone had posted an excellent thread on the various efficiencies of various levels of cannibalization versus medding.<br />
<br />
Their conclusion at the time (pre-horse, pre-KEI, pre-Torpor) was that<br />
<br />
   *) Chain Cann 1 + Regen is barely better than medding.  The health and mana regen from sitting is worth about the same as the chain Cannibalizing.<br />
<br />
   *) Chain Cannidance + Regen is significantly better than medding and is pretty important at low levels.<br />
<br />
   *) As you level, the importance of the sitting health/mana regen decreases and the importance of the cannibalize regen increases.<br />
<br />
Basically once you get Torpor/Cann IV, whether you are sitting or not is more or less irrelevant.  Just one more Cann IV makes up for a lot of time on your rear end.<br />
<br />
Oh, and a &quot;hybrid&quot; method - cannisitting - is halfway between dancing and chain cann.  Basically you chain cann but sit down after the cann takes effect.  This puts you sitting about 1/4 of the time, and when the tick occurs in this 1/4 you get the sitting benefit - but you don't have to watch the health bar for the tick update.<br />
<br />
These days with horses, stoicism and buyable KEI, the rules are different.  If you have a KEI, you don't really NEED to cannidance... you're still better off than a cannidancing shaman with no KEI.  If you have a horse, the health benefit of sitting is gone but you keep the mana benefit, so you get half the benefits and don't have to dance.  If you have Stoicism, you can probably regen the health so fast it doesn't matter (dunno, I never had that).<br />
<br />
But even if you don't need it to be better than a cannidancing shaman... a cannidancing shaman with KEI is going to have better mana regen than a KEI'd shaman sitting on his or her fundament.  So if mana is a problem you still need to use the most efficient way, and all this is still relevent.<br />
<br />
I'm going to go offline and attempt to recreate the figures I saw quoted in this really old post, and maybe update them for stoicism and horses.  If I find time  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Korsib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Well, I want thank you all for the advice.  I kinda wish I had made a canni dance hotkey, but I didn't.  Did it all by hand :).  But anyways, just picked up a drogmar last night, so that is nice.  Don't really have to worry about dancing outside now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">lol, looks like I'm not the only one who occasionally joins a group, buffs, hit's canni hot button and .... Loading, please wait - you have entered the Nexus <br />

Am I being stupid?<br />
<br />
<br />
You arent being stupid, you are being ineffecient.  Canabalize is our own personal mana regen spell that stacks with C3.  Use it, it works, im addicted to canabalize.  <br />
<br />
Going back to the thread:  Ya cana-dancing is more effecient!<br />
<br />
But when you canabalize every freakin 4 seconds you are playing your shaman (ie Me) it gets annoying to stand-cast-sit-wait-stand-cast-sit-etc...<br />
<br />
I just stand there and cana down then med up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oooooh yea... At a Trak kill I was 2 boxing a clr. I keep cann in spell slot 1 always 24/7. Well at this particulr raid I had dememed cann and put cure up. So we engge and win. I am cureing / healing a few people after the fight. And I am just look out of the corner of my eye to demem cure on the shm and remem cann. Welllllllll in my book gate was right beside cann so you can kind gess what I ended up meming. I go to cann and the screen freezes (What the??)(Relizes what he did)(hits head on keyboad) I drop back into world at my bind just in time to get awarded a trak tooth:P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Hildaorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">If your making a Hot key to Canni dance, Cani 1, 2, 3 cast fast enough, that you can set it up for 2 Casts. Which makes it even more effecent.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Korsib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Well, I just had the same sort of unmeming canni situation yesterday.  Was grouping in Overthere, had just gotten gooned, so I was rememing spells and rebuffing people.  While the bard is playing mana song, I start casting 'canni' over and over and over; and for some reason, my mana just wasn't going up.  I noticed earlier that my friend in the group got shrinked, and I didn't even bother to think that no one else could have done it cause it has to be in group and there was no one else that could shrink in group.  I had had shrink up in my canni slot since I always shrink myself on my lizard so I'm not in the way of people.  I suppose it wasn't as bad as gate would've been, but still annoying  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />
