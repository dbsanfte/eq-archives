They give good experience up to Level 55. They main problem with them is that they are over-camped and there are only 2 camps of them in the zone.<br />
<br />
It helps immensely if you have good HighKeep faction to begin with. If you are constatntly aggroing gaurds, you can forget about it.<br />
<br />
2 nobles spawn in the gambling room on the second floor and 1 spawns in a room on the 3rd floor (but this spawn is shared with a gnome caster who is low level and gives massive gnome faction hits).<br />
<br />
I basically did a root &amp; shoot on them and would go in melee for the last couple of bubbles. They will run when they get low on hps.<br />
<br />
I would pull them out into the hall and deal with them there. They only thing you had to watch out for is accidentally hitting a wanderer with an arrow as they walk into the hallway.<br />
<br />
These guys were decent xps for me when they weren't camped. Problem is, you got a long run to get to another camp when they are occupied.<br />
