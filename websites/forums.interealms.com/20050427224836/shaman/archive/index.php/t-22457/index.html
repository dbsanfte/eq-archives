It's a very good thread.  The original thread should perhaps be stickied, but just so folks know, this is now added as part of the larger tips thread.  The link and formatting didn't translate below, and I did this kind of quickly so if I grabbed the wrong stuff or attributed things incorrectly, I'm sorry.  Anyway, this was post added:<br />

Gangaskan's Guide to Spell Linking: High cool factor <br />
see this thread:<br />
<br />
if you want to put this in the medicine cabinet or whatever mods ~ ~dosent matter <br />
<br />
<br />
i would link it from TSWarrior but i think its down well anyways<br />
<br />
step 1 make a hotkey <br />
step 2 find the hotkey in your name_server file that contains your hotkey information open it <br />
step 3 find the hotkey you made ex. slow, malos, etc, etc <br />
step 4 find the peice you want perferably an un augmented peice of equipment or item. it can be made auged fake like but thats harder to do<br />
step 5 make your key lets say ---&gt; %T &lt;--- is SLOWED ! at this point you can use character map to make it snazzy or whatever if you wish<br />
step 6 use this box  it will be what you need to start off the link<br />
step 7 to get the code of the item use ;t item link it will say could not find player blahblahblahblah <br />
step 8 make your link like so 0016994-00001-00001-00001-00001-00001E8BC5E4D Š&#321;&#337;&#373;&#904;&#273; this is an example mine i use it links Whore's bane <br />
step 8 make shure you have text going on the front of it and the back<br />
step 9 save it and use Save as .... under where it says encodeing use UTF-8 thats what eq uses to read it <br />
step 10 reload your UI or you can zone / log it dosent matter but reloading the information is what is critical<br />
<br />
<br />
there you go its all good and going <br />
<br />
this is my Slow msg <br />
Page2Button9Line1=/gu &#8594; 0024699-00001-00001-00001-000018EO5AFD1 %T  &#8592; is 0016994-00001-00001-00001-00001-00001E8BC5E4D Š&#321;&#337;&#373;&#904;&#273; I know Kung Fu <br />
<br />
it shows %T and Slowed as a link if your gonna use %T as a link make shure you add in spaces to make the full name get in and good luck if you have any more questions ask<br />

Rascalan's helpful tip: <br />
If the cut and paste isn't working here may be the reason why....<br />
<br />
I just got this to work last night after messing around with it for about three days. <br />
<br />
What I was doing wrong is if you read the post it says you need the &quot;box&quot; linked item (slow message or any other message)than a &quot;box&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
The box, item link, message, and box need to have no spaces between them. <br />
<br />
The part I missed is before the first box and after the last box you need text without spaces also. You must have some form of text touching the first and last box. Than it seems to work. <br />
<br />
Hope that might help some of those struggling with this matter.<br />
<br />
and a clarification of the tip from Rascalan... <br />
<br />
This is how the link should be made....<br />
<br />
some text,&quot;box&quot;,item link, message, &quot;box&quot; some text <br />
<br />
All the text must be running together to get this to work. No spaces in between them. <br />
<br />
The link will than be the right click of your message, ie <br />
<br />
Turgurs: 0019265-00001-00001-00001-00001-00001546DB724<br />
<br />
I would type something like this for slow message: <br />
<br />
&gt;&gt; %T ~~0019265-00001-00001-00001-00001-00001546DB724SLOWED!!!~~&lt;&lt;<br />
<br />
My message would read &gt;&gt;target ~~SLOWED!!!~~&lt;&lt;<br />
<br />
You would then be able to click on SLOWED and would get the scroll of the spell listing what it does. <br />
<br />
The no spaces are required and is why I used the &quot;~~&quot; before and after the item box.<br />
<br />
Winterfury's Summation <br />
I took what I read here and experimented a bit and got it working just fine. Once I started using it, of course, all the tells came in asking &quot;How the hell did you do that?&quot; So, I put together the following message for them. It's basically a re-write of Gangaskan's message, written with the ini.file noob in mind. <br />
<br />
========================<br />
<br />
The following technique can be used to incorporate item links into your hotkeys, so that messages can actually contain more information for the viewer, linkable and unobtrusive, but communicative. Using these links, players can actually see links to the spells referenced by your messages, so that they can better understand what you’re actually casting. The credit for this goes to Shaman (yay) Gangaskan Gnollbasher on Torv, whose post on the Crucible site was the first I read on the topic.<br />
<br />
Step 1: Make a hotkey and give it a recognizable name, like Linktest. Give it some kind of /say text like “/say I have SLOWED %t.”<br />
<br />
Step 2: In your EQ folder, find the file named [YourCharacterName]_[ServerName].ini. So, for example, my file was Winterfury_Firiona.<br />
<br />
Step 3: Open the above file in Notepad and find the hotkey you made. You’ll see the text next to the hotkey that’s labeled by page number, line, etc. You will be editing this text.<br />
<br />
Step 4: Your hotkey will start with some kind of /say or /g, /rs, whatever. The rest of the text will consist of whatever you would ordinarily put in a hotkey message, but will include a snazzy new link. The link you will create consists of four parts: <br />
<br />
a) an opening “box” character (hex 0x12); <br />
b) an item code; <br />
c) a label; and <br />
d) a closing “box” character. <br />
<br />
I’ll explain how to get an item code and make a “box” character below. But the result should look something like this:<br />
<br />
/g0026915-00001-00001-00001-00001-00001C7442067 MALOS on ---&gt; %t in 4.3 seconds ...<br />
<br />
Note the opening /g makes this a group message. Following this is the required “box” character which denotes the start of the item link, followed by the item code, the label (“ MALOS”), and finally the end “box”, followed by the rest of the hotkey message. The text that you put between the last number of the item code and the closing “box” character (in this case “MALOS”) is the label and is the pink text that people will see as a link in the message.<br />
<br />
Step 5: Save As … the file and make SURE that you select UTF-8 encoding in the bottom drop down. This is the format required to be read by EverQuest and is the only way that this will work.<br />
<br />
Step 6: Once the file is saved you’ll need to reload it into EQ either by restarting or just zoning will do. I test these by standing next to a zone line, alt-tabbing out to edit in Notepad, then jumping back in and zoning. <br />
Ok how do you get the item codes and how do you make that little box character? Every item in EverQuest has an item code and it’s accessible using a simple technique. Send a ;t to an item, and EQ will return a message saying it “Can’t find player xxx…” where xxx… is the item code. Simple, huh? So, typing ;t followed by a link to an item will get you that item’s item code. It’s just like sending a tell to someone but sending it to an item instead of a player.<br />
<br />
The box is not so simple, I’m not sure how to natively create a hex 0x12 character but fortunately you can just copy and paste it right from this example above.<br />
<br />
That does it. Let me know if you have any questions about this technique or suggested improvements. I get a great variety of responses to these messages in my groups, ranging from “Ahhh, so THAT’s what Cripple does” to “Wow, your HAXXORS ROXXORS my BOXXORS”. It’s always neat when a fun technique turns out to have some nice utility as well.<br />

<br />
This really is Malosini.<br />
<br />
Is there another method of getting the item codes, the tell thing doesn't seem to work anymore as described.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">if you need any link and i mean ANY  ask tunare.minimyrist   with !link item link     .... or   for example  you dont know how to spell cazic   and you want the CT brain  you can do ;t tunrae.minimyrist !link Brain    and it will give you everything thats in its database at the moment  with &quot;brain&quot;  in it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ronax   the ;t method still works for me</div></div><hr />

<br />
Edit: insamadentally, (mebbe I'm just doing something wrong tho) but when you change the format of your .ini to UTF-8 it seems to lose all your friends / ignored. I just keep a copy and copy / paste them into the new one and off ya go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">when you change the format of your .ini to UTF-8 it seems to lose all your friends / ignored. <br />
<br />
Same thing happened to me.  Friends list got blown out so be sure to copy it before making changes : )<br />
<br />
Ronax the ;t method still works for me <br />
<br />
Think I know where I went wrong, was using /t instead.  Figured it would act the same, will try it when I get home.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I don't recall losing friends/ignored list.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Keep the default EQ display font, otherwise it could look great for you, but will be garbage for the others in your group/raid - and they're the ones you are trying to tell, right? And don't change the font at all in the text editor, leave it as is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Setanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The box (I am informed by a friend who has half a clue about all things computational - more than can be said for me) is that the &quot;box&quot; character only looks like a box (square thing, four sides, 90 degree corners and such) if your font has no character to represent it. In other words, boxes represent any character not covered by the font you're currently using.<br />
<br />
To me the box look like a vertical line with chevrons on the top and bottom. <br />
<br />
Ack, never mind - just copy this symbol - works fine that way:<br />

<br />
i've seen several people doing this, but none of the links have worked for assist. it would be cool if it did  ;). <br />
<br />
have to say thanks to Gangaskan for posting this. imo these are a great thing for debuff msgs during raids, as the spell name really stands out and is easy for everyone to pick out. also, I'm pretty sure I was the first person to use these on Stromm, and it made quite an impression on ppl ;). thanks!</div></div><hr />

And for a previous post reguarding the loss of your friends list:<br />
You need to add a blank line to the beginning of this file.  Doing so preserves the entire file, friends list and all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sowfor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Looks like they've stopped you sending the links to get the code</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Greeznok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">DOH, I got it to work.  The above item code was not quie right, used a diff one and its good to go.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I have been messing with this for a while.  I have gotten the spell links fine.  I am unable to get the %t to function right.  I can turn it to the link color but it only shows the nok part fo Greeznok. I tried apaces, no spaces etc.  I either get nothing or just the nok. I copied the part from above with the %t in it, could this not be a valid code causing the prob?  I get nothing when I click on the &quot;nok&quot; even though its colored as a link.<br />
<br />
Anymore tips on this? <br />
<br />
P.S. I also was able to get code for other items as of this post, so I assume you still can get any link.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Grimmy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I tried to get a few item links using ;t tunare.minimyrist !link xxx and got <br />

<br />
Any suggestions?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">So, typing ;t followed by a link to an item will get you that item’s item code. <br />
