its the usual gear, BoV, DI thing we had with every of our<br />
&quot;Who needs warriors ..&quot; series.<br />
after all, coll was using cripple and slow to keep agro ... so how to nerf that? lower the agro on both ? doesnt sound like a nerf to me ...<br />
<br />
@Loramin: am pretty sure coll is  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Any class that can hold aggro can tank him.  Monks have done it.  Shamans have done it.  I would bet an enchanter with comparable gear could too.  He must just not ba a very hard mob :P.  But with enough clerics, anything is possible.</div></div><hr />

Loramin, the guys in Fu can barely touch her gear.  I'm pretty sure I'm right in saying that since Banut left the server, Collectra really doesn't have much competition for top shaman.</div></div><hr />

Does it make her a good shaman ? No.<br />
Does it make her a well geared Shaman with the top guild on BB behind her ? Yes.<br />
When Vabtoo (monk) tanked Fennin that had the warriors crying out for monk nerfs.<br />
Just the sort of thing Shaman need when there is so much argument over the class :(<br />
No one who thinks Shaman are overpowered are going to bother noticing that she is Time equipped and has a big guild behind her all theyre going to see is that a Shaman tanked Fennin.<br />

My thoughts exactly :rolleyes:<br />
Because we all know that most shamans have 7k unbuffed and that it is the gear, not the class itself that matters.<br />

No one mentioned anything about getting a nerf.  People are talking about this halting any possible progression and could possibly put a slight on what we have been &quot;whining&quot; about for so long.</div></div><hr />

<br />
By the way, rumor has it that she also used her Poison DoT's when the Paladin started stunning, just to make sure she had it locked down :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Collectra is hands down the top shaman on BB.  Grats to AO on having this kind of fun.  One thing not mentioned is her AC is almost 1.8k.  AO does this sort of thing all the time, notice they got 11 clerics in a fast rotation healing her as well?  With that rotation, you can put almost any class in that role so long as they can hold aggro.  They should try a chain tashing chanter or a necro, I'm sure those classes could work, possibly better than the shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>shadowraine mystraithe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Wulfbane, ok lets get something straight here. Collectra is one of the best damn shaman i have ever seen play. she got the gear she has by standing out. She also can play pretty much any class, being a fanatastic Monk, and an exceptional paladin, pulling and tanking in Time. there are other classes she has played but those are the most recent. <br />
<br />
  that said. she used cripple and slow to hold agro. and AO watched what we cast and took it nice and steady until fennin died. her gear is great but her nerves were better, everything was calm and smooth playing. <br />
<br />
  its true she had a great guild behind her, but don't act like she is just her gear. Collectra is a badass and anyone that plays with her knows it.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>mmshah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Gratz to Collectra.<br />
<br />
I got some more specfic questions related to tanking for her thou.  Does AO pin Fenin?  Forgive me, but my guild still arrows him to death heh.  Pinning will solve the problems of melee push and summoning, which are massive for a caster trying to tank, cuz casting to keep agro and moving at the same time isnt possible.  Also Fenin is only slightly slowable as I recall, which makes every spell one casts have to be channeled, since its highly doubtful he'll ever get a full round of misses on u.  This too is major problem for keeping agro, so just wondering how she got around these things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Why would channeling be such a problem? <br />
<br />
Bash and kick are probably the only thing interrupting a caster(aside from summons, which shouldn't be too terrible if you place your rangers accordingly), since you will be standing with your back against the building.<br />
<br />
Hell, even if he/she was getting interrupted a lot, Fennin's aggro is highly proximity based. Some of the casters were probably not going full out either, so there's really nothing that would be overly complicated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">lol most classed if they have the right uber gear and aa`s can tank. and bets a necro could with lifetaps? and same hp?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I don't know if her Magelo is accurate, but it says she has 550 AA's.  She has maxed out everything but trade craft mastery (including Alchemy Mastery  :confused: ).  That includes channeling focus.  My guess is she got few interupts.<br />
<br />
My only question is does she really look like that IRL?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">congrats to collectra, that must have been an interesting change of roll.  If I recall correctly according to that eqrankings place she has been top equipped shaman overall for a while.  :)<br />
<br />
as for the original posters question - &quot;who says shaman can't tank&quot; ... well, no one?  <br />
<br />
To those who express concern about posts like these, who can blame them?  Kick a dog enough times and he will start flinching.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Tanking is easy.  All you have to do is stand still, keep the mob's attention, and not die.<br />
<br />
Cram enough clerics into a CH rotation to keep your HP from bottoming out and anyone that can generate agro can do it.<br />
<br />
And I'd bet that spam-clicking that time's antithesis with no recast time on it every chance you get in addition to other spells/DPS ought to be enough to darned near guarantee agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Umm.. just so that you youngsters don't start getting your hopes up, Collectra is actually a dude.  Sorry guys. He is a pretty nice guy though and I know that he'll answer questions for me if needed.<br />
<br />
Anyways, yeah, he sent me a tell after he did this (happened of course after I was telling the crucible that it was alot of fun being the tank in an earth group.  He told me he only used cripple and slow to keep agro, and was chaining it and still managed to keep agro over a necro that was attempting to take it from him.  Either way, it was a great accomplishment that .0000000000000000000001% of shamans will ever accomplish - until next year :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
hehe, well, I've survived four straight rounds from quarm, but I don't think that i'll ever be able to tank him.  Besides, if he actually connects you for full, he does 3800 each hit.<br />
<br />
Just in response to the kind of dmg that can be done.  Fennin used to average approx 1100 - 1300 dps on tanks before Time was really found  and the tanks upgraded to well over 11k hps.  Fennin averaged 1650 on Collectra.  Kinda shows you that every though he was able to tank him, it does show you the difference between the top shaman doing it now, and any warrior back a year ago.</div></div><hr />

Hey read my post.<br />
Ive grouped with AO enough over time to realise that most of them are pretty awesome players.<br />
Ive no doubt that she is a damn good or maybe the best shaman on BB.<br />
Her tanking Fennin however does not make her a good shaman.<br />
That was my point.<br />
MY point is there a probably a ****load of shaman out there who with her gear and guild could have tanked Fennin.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wulfbane</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>mmshah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Giac, ud need a corner pin to be able to do that and as I stated my own guild doesnt pin Fenin, we arrow him.  So thats why I first asked if they pinned him heh.  We've always had problems pinning him, ie dont use a zone wall so he can get pushed thru, but greater still is that we cant seem to avoid AE rampage which sort of defeats the point heh.<br />
<br />
Ive tanked unpinned mobs and as a caster its just a nightmare, mob goes all over the place and interrupts making holding steady agro difficult.<br />
<br />
No doubt Collectra's gear is amazing and she has been the best or one of the best equipped shaman that Ive seen for a long time.  And no Wulfbane I think Ive pointed some of the problems of tanking Fenin as a caster, so not just anyone could do it, ud have to be aware of those factors and possibly others that I forgot about and account for them to be able to tank Fenin.  I can only suggest that u try to tank a big mob to get a feel for whats involved, cuz its not as simple as u think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">i feel safe in saying that if i had all the no drop gear that she has either destoryed or has banked that it would be better than all the stuff i currently have at 63.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>CollectraBB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">It was a fun thing to do, which is why we tried to do it in the first place)  The officers said we'd only give it one shot, I'm grateful the clerics pulled it off with that kind of pressure specially since half were applicants :)<br />
<br />
When this happened I let a few friends know, because its a fun thing to share, though our bored news reporter decided it would be fun to add another series to the website, it got a lot of hits hehe.<br />
<br />
Info about the fight, well, as Val said I alternated slow/cripple ( TA click/ cripple cast ) to lock aggro, which worked rather well.  People are wondering about channeling etc, yes i got a boat load of interrupts, and had to channel just about every cast, also, when casting since fennin has a fast meelee ( even when slowed &quot;slightly&quot; ) I had to move forward the right amount to compensate(while staying in CH range).  But no it wasnt rocket science, anyone under the same circumstances could pull it off, I am grateful to have had the chance.  <br />

I'm not sure if the new engine coming is just a graphics overhaul or if it would allow them some flexibility in designing encounters? but it would be nice if a new engine allowed them to introduce some variety by having mobs that are particularly bloodlusty towards a certain class.<br />
<br />
<br />
On a slightly different note..<br />
 If I recall correctly according to that eqrankings place she has been top equipped shaman overall for a while.  :)<br />

Sites like magelo and eqrankings are examples of missed opportunity for Sony. Leaving the community to deal with this facet of the game is poor management in my view.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Devnull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Funny how fast things turn around when the shoe is on the other foot. Anyone else remember (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=16837&amp;highlight=vabtoo&amp;pagenumber=2) when certain members of the community claimed that monks were just fine, because Vabtoo tanked Fennin Ro. <br />
<br />
I guess maybe it is all about having enough hit points and a solid CHeal rotation. Maybe a shaman can hold aggro. Imagine that.<br />
<br />
Does this mean that either class is currently balanced? Hell no. It's just kinda amusing to watch the about face in execution.</div></div><hr />
