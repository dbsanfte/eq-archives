<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zirnak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm an Iksar and at lvl 20. Are there any suggestions of quests or mobs to kill that will increase faction with the merchants and shman guildmaster in Shadow Haven?<br />

Thanks for your help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ogreshm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can go from dubious to amiable in about 5-10 minutes. Talk to Trade Commissioner Henry in Shadow Haven, and he will send you on an incredibly easy quest that will fix your faction right up.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sverra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">From the Paludal Caverns zone line, get back into town and follow the left wall. He's in a building on the left.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gooch Gooch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well Ogresham, I wish that was the case with us iksar.  I've done that infernal commisioner quest about 15 times and I'm still dubious.  If there's another way in which to raise faction, I'd sure like to hear about it.  Maybe I'm broken though.  It seems that this quest might work with everyone but iksar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sepisis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Getting your faction in SH from apprehensive to ally takes about 30 minutes.  <br />
<br />
Doing the registration quest (same one as trade commissioner quest) will hit you up to amiable.  From there on you can get it up by running sewing kits from Stealon near the zone in from Nexus to Gearo in the bazaar.  Gearo gives you a bag of gems which you give to Stealon.  <br />
<br />
I would suggest that on an empty hot key page you make a macro that says &quot;I will make a trip to the bazaar&quot; (For stealon) and &quot;I will take the gems&quot; (for gearo)  As well as placing an empty inventory slot in the hotkey page.<br />
<br />
This quest grants a good amount of faction with SH merchants.  The hits for the houses of midst, stout, and fordel are considerably less, howerver.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its important to note that merchant faction is different from the fation of the 3 houses.  Merchant faction goes up much much quicker than house faction when doing these quests.  The ones you are conning are probably on house of fodel faction and not merchants of the haven.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ogreshm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">True, the quest given by the commissioner doesn't raise every faction in Shadow Haven (still dubious in some places). It will, however, raise your faction with most of the merchants, the cleric/paladin guild (I think) and all of the NPCs in the druid/shaman/beastlord area.<br />
<br />
You only need to do the quest once to become amiable to the NPCs on these factions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">There are also a lot of other quests you can do to raise factions easily with the other factions.  Each one has at least one delivery quest and each delivery quest has huge faction hits compared to similar quests planetside.  See Allakhazam's quests for Shadow Haven (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/qsearch.html?zone=153).  (Links to Allakhazam still work if you're not a subscriber, right?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Canabull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm wondering if there are any mobs in the game that can be killed to raise these factions.  Particularly the &quot;stout&quot; faction.  As you may or may not know, anyone with above dub stout faction can easily get smithing skill up fast, as there is a merchant next to a forge that sells sheets of metal and banded molds, who is on stout faction.  Running all these newbie quests is absurd, VI should have found a better way for players to be able to get factions up.</div></div><hr />
