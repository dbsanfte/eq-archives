<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>TheRiov</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm looking for an up-to-date guide on Plane of Hate. Everything I can find looks like its pre-Velious. No miniboses other than Maestro listed, no spawn points marked for minibosses, nada. <br />
<br />
I've done hate about 8 times now, but this will be my first time leading a raid there. I'd like a good guide on spawn points, etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
Suggestions?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The minis do not spawn in standard locations.  They can be anywhere.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Adonna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Do all the mini's spawn on second floor or can they randomly spawn from any mob spawn point?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Savona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There are only three demi spawn points on the second floor.  There are 9 on the bottom floor I think.  ANY demi can spawn in any of those locations.  Only Maestro spawns at the same place every time.  Also, it is completely random which demi will pop next.  Just because you kill Grandmaster R'tal (for example) one night doesn't mean he can't spawn the next night.  It just has a generic timer for each spot and spawns a random demi when that timer is up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Icye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The guide on Kruull's Siye is  ok got the lvls and stuff nice for knowing who you need not much on pulling and killing and stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vectors</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Anyone know what the spawn time on the Mini's is?  Went the other night and there were only two up.</div></div><hr />
