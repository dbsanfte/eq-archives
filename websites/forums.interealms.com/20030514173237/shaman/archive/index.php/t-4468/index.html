<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gaknab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">By far the BEST XP rate I have ever discovered.<br />
<br />
Duoing with my Roomate a 60 Warrior in Maiden's Eye.<br />
<br />
Zone in from DP, go straight out past the fortress and hang a left. Sit on top of the hill there right next to the lake. You run out and chain pull Umbrous Toilers, or anything else close.<br />
<br />
The Warrior sits on hill and kills everything you bring in.<br />
<br />
IMPORTANT!!! Keep the Warrior in Berzerker frenzy, his DPS goes WAY WAY up. Crippling hits Rule.<br />
<br />
Buffs used:<br />
<br />
Khura's Focusing (or FoS)<br />
Riotous Health<br />
Acumen<br />
Primal Avatar<br />
Celerity<br />
Regrowth of Dar Khura<br />
<br />
We've done this many times. The xp rate is almost 6 blue of ALT xp per hour for a Troll Shaman. I haven't come across anything to beat it yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Failbhe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I do the same with my warrior and shaman. But I take a right at zone in from Dawnspeak and head over to Akheva Ruins. It is the large domed building with what looks like a giants mill wheel over turned at the entrance.<br />
<br />
Once in AR, invis up and head straight inside to a fallen pillar. Set up camp on the far side of the pillar to the left, near what was the base of the pillar. Nothing paths through there and nothing spawns there.<br />
<br />
A level 60 can single pull all day long with lots of mobs to pull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chamelius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">AA is gained at the same rate for all races I believe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sevenkilts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">as such a duo I would go to The Deep. I usually do it with a monk (no single pulling, we can easily handle 3 mobs at once). Shrooms go down fast and on 7th Hammer zone in is hardly ever camped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Galamann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">How many alt points does ur warrior have and how is his equipment.  I tried with a warrior there and our only problem was we were the only ppl there and we stood in the middle of it, we ended up with about 6 mobs. lol<br />
<br />
I really like the idea of keeping him berzerk, i will have to try that out. Thanks for the input.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gaknab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">He is at about 40 - 50 AA points last I checked, has ambidexterity and Cloak of flames, NToV weapons, and SS quest or greater armor, he's very well equipped. If your having problems with too many mobs off the start, back off the hill a bit and onto the wall, kill some stuff in the general area and then move out onto the hill. The spawn rate is pretty high around this area so kill stuff as fast as you can.</div></div><hr />
