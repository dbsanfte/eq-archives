70 curse counter = Casting RGC on each person in your group twice.<br />
(I am sure gona love this one when every melee in the group is telling me they want to be cured first -  Dont think a group RGC is in Veriants vocabulary )<br />

4000 ae DD = Seen this one comming, Quarms father maybe ?<br />
(Well shaman will be totally useless due to the fact that we STILL dont have any type of group heal -  group Quiescence where are you )<br />
<br />
<br />
It sure is nice to see Veriant not adapt Shaman at all to the new GoD expansion.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I remember being very very afraid when I first saw PoP AE's.  AD's AE was GODLY!!!  Now it's nothing.  Ditto Quarm.  These AE's might seem like beasts now, but by the time you reach the encounter I am sure you will be adequately prepared for it.</div></div><hr />

Charm that add a proc charm, that add a proc charm... etc... going to be fun :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">btw Warbear those are single target effects, not AE's =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">So basically you melee and it takes you back in time.<br />
<br />
Yeah, so it takes damage away from stuff you already killed, and brings em back to life!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">So basically you melee and it takes you back in time.<br />
If I remember right a slow will cancel out any haste spells but not haste items. So a 120% slow on someone with a 40% haste item should bring him to 20% attack speed. Now, what happens to someone with a 19% haste item is anyone's guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">A Slow will negate worn haste effects as well. A 120% Slow would make sure that even with bard song, you'd just stand there and not swing at all(i.e. no hate procs which are independant from delay).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If you swing backwards is it 120% haste?</div></div><hr />

ROFLMA. I think I would be basically healing the mob with my DPS when I get slowed that much  :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Monjay-Tunare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hate to nitpik but it was Verant not Veriant, and Sony runs EQ now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I was healer on a couple LDoN runs tonight and at one point I really thought dang we need some kind of group heal. I can't see how it could be unbalancing just make it a 9 sec casting time with a 60 sec recast time and we'll feel right at home. After all shamans put up with crap like that all the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Radient Cure 3 is ur friend</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>wyrdrune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Radient[sic] Cure 3 is ur[sic] friend<br />
<br />
<br />
Radiant cure 3 only cures 16 curse counters, that seems a far cry from the 70 required, and not even half of the 36 that Remove Greater Curse will remove.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Burzlaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Maybe they'll break out a blood of nadox style rgc (/pray)</div></div><hr />

this looks awesome. Reminds me of way back in the day in dalnir doing the hardest sarnak in there that charms and half the group is charmed at all times running in circles creating chaos. Cant imagine what half a raid would look like charmed (other than dead ;0)</div></div><hr />
