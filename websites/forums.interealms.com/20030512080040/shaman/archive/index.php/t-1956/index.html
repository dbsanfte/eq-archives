<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grumgor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Have any of you guys ever been able to solo in Mischief? The rumors say he just lives in Mischief, always soloing, and that he is one of the two classes that would be able to effectively solo up there. (The rumors also say an Enchanter lives up there and does the same.) Any truth in these tales?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">PoM is soloable by all reports, yet its not really worth it, as every armour piece is quested.  And the card drops are rare as arse<br />
<br />
Probably easier exp to just group somewhere else.<br />
<br />
-And im guessing the guys who live there are jus trying to get shamanistic shennanagin boots- 45ac + stats, from the card quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yup, it's soloable... I plan to go there myself when I'm 60... I want the boots and the breastplate (although now there is better for bp, so it depends, I may not do this now) and when I have that I'll be happy :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i used to solo just fine in pom, havent been there since they changed it tho, was good xp :)</div></div><hr />
