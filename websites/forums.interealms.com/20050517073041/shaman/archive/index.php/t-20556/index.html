<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys.  I was kinda hoping to spark off a discussion on GoD AAs.  I can't access Magelo at work, so I'll edit in any that I miss later as people post (since I'm doing this from memory).<br />
<br />
Fury of Magic Mastery<br />
Critcal DoTs<br />
Runspeed 5<br />
Packrat<br />
Enduring breath (whatever the name is)<br />
Pet Affinity<br />
Second Forte<br />
Casting Subtlety<br />
Casting Persistance<br />
Broken Pet Swarm<br />
Healing ward<br />
<br />
So anyway, I got the first 3 things on that list.  Runspeed 5 is only 5% slower than SoW--and since it works indoors, I recommend it highly.  It won't get you away from some Kyvs or those superfast pet swarms that mobs in GoD cast, but it sure helps.  (While I'm at it, I do have to rant about 1 thing--how come the fricking mobs can cast 2 pets that last for 30 seconds and hit for 300s and have tons of hitpoints, and shaman get pets that have 250 hps?!?  What's up with that?!?  They're blue con mobs and cast better pets than us!!!!)<br />
<br />
FoMM and Crit DoTs are both pretty decent.  They do add a good bit of dps.  I haven't run parses, but I'm going to go out on a limb and guess that crit DoTs are firing at around 20% of the time on level 3.  Agro can be a concern with a string of crits (especially if you're nuking and get another crit), but overall both viable skills.<br />
<br />
So . . . now what?  I'm kind of at a loss as to what to get.  I finished all my other AAs, so I only have GoD left.  I think I've got like 10 AA saved, and they're not exactly burning a hole in my pocket.<br />
<br />
Packrat and enduring breath . . . well, maybe when the other stuff is done.<br />
<br />
Second Forte is supposed to max out at 100 skill (don't know if this was fixed or if people can still get it past 100 or not).  For 15 AAs, I just have a hard time justifying what's probably about a 2.5% savings in mana, if I remember the parses previously posted somewhere here in the forum.<br />
<br />
Casting persistance sounds highly craptacular.  Also from parses on this board, it is effectively a chance to channel through a stun.  Thus, (a) you must already be casting, (b) must get stunned, and (c) pass a skill check against this AA for it to work.  That's a pretty low percentage of usefullness.  It does NOT add anything to channelling is what I'm told.<br />
<br />
Pet Affinity?  Been discussed ad nauseum.  Frankly, I don't use my pet much in Time or GoD.  20 AA seems a lot to pay for a pet I don't use all that often.  If it offered innate dual wield . . . maybe!  Let's just say this AA is not too exciting for me.  Our pets barely make a speedbump for GoD mobs.<br />
<br />
Pet swarm--I'm a bit reluctant to get this because (a) it's still broken, and (b) I don't use it for DPS, I use it for push.  Level 3 is nice with all the doggies.  Drop it on a cleric mob if you're soloing and let them interrupt his low health heals and gates.  Use it in raids to wall a mob (Strafe to get an even distribution).  Dunno, maybe when they get pet hp fixed . . .<br />
<br />
So what's left?  Casting subtlety and the healing ward.<br />
<br />
How good are these two?  I'm concerned about getting subtlety because sometimes I need to tank.  If our group MT goes down, I WANT agro.  If a mob is chasing our clerics, I want to be able to pull agro and park it.  Does CS3 affect our ability to hold agro?  I've heard mixed reviews as to how it works with DoTs or just slows.  Would I need to keep an agro spell up if I get CS3?  <br />
<br />
The healing ward is, of course, situational.  How much are healing levels, refresh, etc.  Do minor AEs still eat the ward?  How many AAs does each level cost?<br />
<br />
I dunno, guys.  What would you guys recommend?  Any particular skills you really like?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jormal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There was some discussion in-channel yesterday afternoon that pet swarm was fixed at least in regards to HP. Swarm pets had about 2k HP and were doing 6-8k total damage to a blue mob depending on number of procs.<br />
<br />
As far as SCS I can still pull agro in PoE from a warrior tank if I try hard, but I can safely use Bane and BoS without having to tank (we had two shaman in group yesterday so I got to go into dps mode).<br />
<br />
For crit dots I don't have parses either, but my anecdotal experience seems to be more like 10-12% crit rate. I think I have some logs of soloing in PoF that I can manually calculate on. I like it because it takes about another minute off mobs at the tables so now they take me just over 4 minutes each.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think SCS3 is by far the best God AA we get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Go for SCS3, it was the first GoD AA I got. Persistant casting seems to suck, I get interrupted more than ever seems like, I haven't noticed it working once yet. Healing ward is worth getting level 1 I guess. Secondary Forte is worth getting a guess, mana savings is always good. I may go for new pet swarm next because I read it's fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm enjoying SCS3, as well.  I can stack bane and blood on any boss I want, and haven't gotten summoned since buying that 3rd level.  What I've noticed though, is that the AA doesn't seem to work at all on a resist.  As in, if slow is resisted, I'm instantly summoned and beaten on - where I don't think I've gotten summoned on a successful slow EVER with this aa (unless soloing)... anyone else noticing this?  Bug, or working as intended?<br />
<br />
I'm excited to hear that the new levels of spam pets may be fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I told you SCS3 was good stuff, Chu. :p  You won't have any major problems getting aggro when you want it (You have a TA), it just makes it less likely that you'll pull aggro unintentionally. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Went for SCS3, and now .5 points from FoMM3.  After that I'll go check back on older stuff, none of the rest of GoD overly excites me.  Fights are too short to make critical dots worthwhile, and I never solo anymore.<br />
If I had to pick some, I'd go RS5, PC, SF and then pets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>howjan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I went with SCS, and Persistant Casting after that as far as I'm concerned I'm pretty well done with grinding AA.  If a guy get's a point here and there helping people out or just dickin around...cool if not there's really no press to get anything.  <br />
<br />
I've seen persistant casting fire once I believe.  It's a waste of AA.  SCS seems to be decent, it appearse to help debuffing but does nothing for dot aggro as far as I can tell...or it does so little it doesn't matter.  It is a bit more difficult to maintain aggro with just slow and cripple...but a poison dot will still get you all the loving you need.<br />
<br />
Mana saving on anything outside of the main spec for me personally is a waste of AA, as are crit dots.  It's rare that I'm that concerned about maxing out my dmg.  At times sure, but not enough to justify the time to grind out the AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Scrantoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have to say SCS also is great, especially in GoD zones...  every little bit helps when you can't afford to get agro.<br />
<br />
I went a different route though then most, I went with Flurry of Magic Mastery.  I crit between 20 and 50 percent of the time... depending on the day/spell.  Having DoTs at raids lately has been a no-no.  I don't want to dot something, then have to worry if it is going to be mezzed later or not, for some odd reason. Also, I notice that during Adv's/EXP the Dot's don't end up running full course anyway...  so really isn't doing any more dmg for the mana then the Nukes are.<br />
<br />
I have yet to get pursistent, but I think that is probably my next one.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd rate them as follows:<br />
<br />
<br />
Fury of Magic Mastery - 5 (more burst dps is ok)<br />
Critcal DoTs - 6 (more burst dps is good)<br />
Runspeed 5 - 8 (running faster is always good)<br />
Packrat - 0 (useless)<br />
Enduring breath (whatever the name is) - 0 (useless)<br />
Pet Affinity - 1 (useless, but still better than the previous two)<br />
Second Forte - 3 (helps a little)<br />
Casting Subtlety - 8 (less aggro allows for faster slowing which we basically rely on)<br />
Casting Persistance - 3 (a ****ing joke, helps a little, I guess)<br />
Broken Pet Swarm - 8 (best AA imo, adds about 100-120 dps for the minute)<br />
Healing ward - 3 (good in theory, but the recast time lowers the usefullnes drastically)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well, would have to say that SCS was def. my favorite too.  However, on that note, I do have CA3 and FoMM3.  They are both nice, and I haven't had FoMM3 long enough to see a difference yet (or haven't nuked enough), but there are some problems with CA3. <br />
<br />
I do use alot of dots, especially lately when I'm soloing tryin to get stuff for the BiC quest.  However, the problems that I'm seeing is that CA3 brings alot of crits.  Thats nice and dandy, but although I didn't really put it together till last night, they seem to bring huge agro with it whenever it goes off.  Last night on one of the named in Trial 3 Ikk raid, I malos, cast bane, then nuked once, and I got summoned at 30% from 2 straight crits.  After going back through my logs, i do seem to get alot of crits that result in summons.  So, on top of dots already generating alot of agro, you have the extra agro from crit dots on top of that. <br />
<br />
As for the other AAs, i think that i'm getting the pet one next, since it seems to have been fixed.  CP I have the first two ranks, and I've noticed it go off once, but like what was said, I think that it has to be the perfect settings.  Don't quote me on this, but I think that you have to be casting beforehand, have to then get stunned, then stun has to break before your spell would have finished casting.  I have a screenshot that I can show you of the one time that I noticed it if anyone can host it for me.<br />
<br />
SF would have been nice, if I had gotten it in the first few days of goD..meaning I could have gotten the skill up past 100.. but now that I can't, it almost feels wasted.  yeah, i'll save mana here and there on dots, but not really so much that I notice it.  <br />
<br />
I don't have run5 yet, but i'll prob get it after I finally decide to finish a few others.. maybe in another 20 AAs or so.  I really just don't see a good reason for it right now, since when I'm inside, I don't really have to run from anything, and my sow boots are always in an inventory slot.</div></div><hr />
