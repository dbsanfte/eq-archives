<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I asked around in game, and someone told me that the serverwide channel for the crucible was serverwide.cruc.  Problem is, the last 3 times I have logged into the thing it was completely empty.  The most I ever saw there at one time was 2 (that includes myself).  Is there another channel that shaman typically /join into?  I often find myself having shaman questions and I am the only Shaman in my guild (well actually a new shaman joined recently, but we are rarely on the same time, and he hardly has the wealth of knowledge that the posters here have).<br />
<br />
Anyway, is there a channel that you shaman go to in game?  Or could we start a rally to get everyone in serverwide.cruc  :D</div></div><hr />
