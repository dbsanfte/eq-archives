<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kurrlee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm going to be starting a Shaman here in the near future on a second account. I am looking for a little insight into the decision of which race to pick.<br />
<br />
I've narrowed it down to either Troll or Iksar. Here is some background information.<br />
<br />
I'll not be soloing very much with the shaman as he will primarily be either duoing with my monk (Iksar) or on a raid/group.<br />
<br />
I am leaning toward Troll for the snare necklace and some extent the JBB. I do realize there are a varity of snare items out there, but unlimited charges sure is nice.<br />
<br />
The reason for the Iksar is avoiding the faction work for the Crucible...and the looks :)<br />
<br />
Any other things I should consider between the 2 races?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Both have a 20% xp penalty.. as far as snare goes I think getting a snare stick for the monk overall is going to be better for you because monk taunt really sucks :) <br />
<br />
You can use illusion potions I hear (not completely positive) to avoid the faction work needed? You should look into this.<br />
<br />
Also imo Ogre is a better choice because in the clutch, being unstunnable from the front means a lot, it also means that you can tank a lot of things normal shaman can't with the monk working the mobs ass.. you sit on your horse, malo/slow start jbbing the mob while dogdog and monk hit from behing.. jbb will almost never get interrupted and when your health is low torpor/other heals will have a FAR less chance of being interrupted when you go low on health.. #1 reason for any shaman death = mob comes at you when **** hits the fan and STUNS you.. every time I die it's because of stuns at least lately..</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Please, enlighten me as to the mobs in game that are only tankable by ogre shamans and none of the other races.<br />
<br />
Go troll, because if you have to ask you are not worthy of being iksar.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Spite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I went troll.  <br />
Long version:  I started a troll when the game came out, and had the totally wrong stats and got annoyed with people begging her dry for buffs.  Later on tried an iksar but didn't like some of the equipment limitations and wanted the snare item.<br />
Went back and created a new troll, got the snare item as soon as I could, and am quite happy with what she can wear.  <br />
<br />
Comes down to what you like tho, and what you want to do along the way.  I don't like how Verant gave away Grobb and didn't make a new city for the frogs.  Maybe one day I'll get a JBB for her, but maybe not.  Both have nice regen, both look nice, but I always had a softer spot for trolls than iksar.</div></div><hr />

I just meant easier :) and w/o as much worry. Usually I root a mob then back off to heal myself (no torpor/quie) but in CT I noticed an ogre shaman itf just torpor when low on health w/o any problems backed up against the wall..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Hyacinth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It all boils down to which character you think looks the best or which you identify with more. Every race has its advantages &amp; disadvantages. <br />
<br />
If you're planning on playing this shaman with an Iksar, you may want to play an &quot;evil&quot; race shaman, too.</div></div><hr />

JBB is a HUGE asset to a any shaman up to level 60 or so.<br />
Snare of any sort available in unlimited quantity is still snare.  It's a spell I don't have because I picked the &quot;wrong&quot; diety before they made the necklaces.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Slqmdooley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I love being a troll shaman.  I love the greater regen, I love the snare necklace, I love having naturally high sta and str.<br />
<br />
I dont like that my fire resist is sooooooo low - is a bit of a pain, not real bad though.<br />
<br />
I hate the exp penalty.  I am level 61 and cant help but think if I were an ogre or Barb that I would be 65 by now.<br />
<br />
Everyone and his brother is a barbarian however - if you do who all 65 shaman and ever happen to see troll - you know that person has tons of balls.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I&#8217;m playing a Vah Shir shaman because I like the look of the cats and I like not having to worry about guards in the &#8220;good&#8221; cities trying to lop my fuzzy little head off.  But if I were to play an &#8220;evil&#8221; race I&#8217;d choose a troll.  I like the look much better than that of the lizards.  An ogre wouldn&#8217;t be bad, but for pure handsomeness I like trolls a bit better than ogres.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kurrlee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Rolled a Troll Shaman last night.<br />
<br />
Figured I would play until 15 or so and get the necklace. Then make a decision.<br />
<br />
Played for 3 levels last night (*&amp;#&amp;*$ those halflings hit hard...and help each other lol)<br />
<br />
I'm already irritated that they moved the Troll city. Getting around is a real pain in the butt. Last night after I finally got to the bank, I decided to just cast a nuke on a passing NPC to get back to my bind.</div></div><hr />
