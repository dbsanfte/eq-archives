<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vorpatril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />
It's time for me to do the dreaded &quot;how can I improve my gear&quot; post. Here is my gear:<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=263887 <br />
<br />
I thought I had fairly good gear, but reading about other shamans regularly getting to 1100-1200 ac made me want to re-examine. Self-buffed, I can only get to 1092 ac and I'm an Iksar and supposedly get an AC boost. Going slot by slot through my gear, it seems that there are few items outside of ToV that could improve my gear - but yet I'm still very very far from uberness (1150 + ac).  I can see several places where I could gain 5-7 points of AC, but not a giant improvement.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyone have any suggestions? All input is appreciated. If not, I guess I'll have to go solo Vindi.<br />
<br />
;)<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

<br />
Hmmmm.  Lose the fungi and get a vindi bp as you mentioned, or even a wolf-callers or a thurg quest BP.  Even a wolf-callers will add 22 AC, and that will probably be more like 35 extra AC when actually worn.  Upgrade your other wrist to a spirit wracked cord, or another wolf-callers bracer.  <br />
<br />
I don't know about the exact AC formulas (I doubt many do), but as a kind of loose estimate at 60, you can estimate the worn AC of an item as raw AC x 1.5.  About 45-50 more AC should get you over 1100 AC.  :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vorpatril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for the replies. I made a mistake... I have already switched the Fungi for Barbed Ringmail (30ac) and apparently my updating my profile didn't take. Doh, that's why I'm not uber - I'm a g00b ;) The 1092 ac is with the Barbed Ringmail.<br />
<br />
The Mask of War is certainly interesting, I wonder if a 60 shaman and 57 monk can duo Bevellios?<br />
<br />
Thanks again for the suggestions...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Over 1000ac unbuffed is plentiful imho, lets face it, when a typical higher end encounter mob decides to hit you, chain ac+priest defensive skills (or lack off) are not going to help much at all, HPs will at least increase your chance of survival.<br />
<br />
Don't worry so much about ac, get those hps up instead =)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Err.  Hmmmm.  Well, maybe you could duo Dlammaz.  He is slowable, but he hits somewhere around 390ish if memory serves.  Rampages and enrages too, I think.  It's been a while.  Slowable with malo and torpor.  He''s level 62.  However, unless one of you is ally to kromrif and kromzek (maybe tormax too, but I don't think any other tormax mobs add), you'll get owned.  The repops would eat you two otherwise, since you have to clear up to him, and you wouldn't have the damage output to do it fast enough.  You can't single pull him, though the monk could split him (just not fast enough).  Basically, he's like one of the Sentinels around the tormax area in Kael.  Lotta HP, not too hard hitting.<br />
<br />
Just FYI, I was mistaken about Dlammaz dropping the mask.  It's a Storm Giant Warlord--the PH for Dlammaz.  You'll have to kill Dlammaz (since Dlammaz is almost always up) and then wait half an hour for the respawn.  :)<br />

<br />
With the Can 5/torpor combo, I prefer the added hitpoints of my vindi over the regen of the fungi.  My fungi has been untouched in my backpack for weeks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I play on Vorp's Server. He traded his fungi for torpor. Wish I could find a copy :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Mask of war drops off the Kromzek Warlord that spawns in Dlammaz place, I believe the Captain or something is the common PH and drops nothing, Dlammaz and Warlord are both just uncommon spawns.  Dlammaz drops Frostbringer and Cloak of the Maelstorm.  Warlord Drops Mask of War and dunno if anything else, only saw the mask.</div></div><hr />

No clue there, but I'm generally chaincasting Cann4/5 unless I'm moving/casting something else, and hence torporing lots too, Regrowth just doesnt cut it unless I need every single hp I can get my claws on.</div></div><hr />

Mask of War? Have a look at Mask of Terror. <br />

Mask of terror is definitely a nice peice but he specifically asked for peice NOT from NToV which is where the mask of terror drops. CT has a couple nice masks tho like <br />

<br />
Anyway, if there is an Iksar Grandmaster smith on your server (I'm the only one I know of on Morell Thule) ... get a few smithed items:<br />
<br />
Fearsome Skyiron belt  - I charge 15k<br />
Fearsome Skyiron mask - I charge 5k<br />
Fearsome SKyiron Bracer - I charge 7k (or bracer of sense?)<br />
Earring of the Solstice - can be had for 12k and a night of auctions<br />
Ivandyr's Hoop - count on 3-4k on an alt troll to do this quest?<br />
<br />
As a bonus most of these items are HP upgrades as well as AC and net wisdom/mana.<br />
<br />

Blacksmithing (250)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Vorpatril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Aye, Isazo, I'd love to find a GM Iksar blacksmith on Seventh Hammer. No luck yet though. If you're out there... send me a tell! ;) <br />
<br />
I have 175 in smithing and every day I kick myself for not getting to 250 before they changed the trivials. Ah well. <br />
<br />
Hi all, thanks for all the replies. My current wish list of things a person could reasonably get while not in an uberguild:<br />
<br />
- Earring of the Solstice<br />
- Divine Inspiration<br />
- Ethereal Mist earring<br />
- Fearsome Skyiron Bracer<br />
<br />
That would be a raw AC boost of 23... which would probably be 30ish in practice. That would make me nearish being uber. Of course, there's just that minor issue of that stuff all being insanely rare. :) <br />

I hate to sound like a snob, but if your guild cannot kill the Vindicator, then you really shouldn't have to come here and ask US why you aren't uber.</div></div><hr />
