<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Enobarbus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm proposing to start an ez-board called The Balancing Chamber ( http://p214.ezboard.com/bthebalancingchamber ). Please let me know what you think about the idea. Here is my rough concept for it: <br />
<br />
There are plenty of boards out there for each class separately. The Balancing Chamber is a class balance board. No ONE class is more important here than any other class. If you think so, then this is not the board for you. <br />
<br />
If you get your kicks flaming people that disagree with you in a civil manner, yet again, this is not the board for you. Incidentally, if you do flame and keep doing it, you'll likely just be precluded from coming back. <br />
<br />
I will be looking at the class community sites and will try to pick a few representatives from each board to approach for moderators. <br />
<br />
The goal is to get enough ideas that can be approved by enough of the class-wide player-base across the board that SOE will not need to worry about class balance. This would get done in what I call versions or stages. Each of these would have a clearly defined schedule of suggestion, rebuttal, suggestion, modification, final rebuttal, cutting out the losing suggestions and writing the final joint proposal. Then we would do the next round. <br />
<br />
The process will likely be long and sometimes painstaking, but I feel like if we came up with joint class proposals that had a decent amount of thought put into class balance, and if we could get someone like Brenlo to read the final reports, it might just yield something. Hope to see you all here. And thanks for checking it out. <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>FafnerMorell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The first thing that popped into my mind when reading this was &quot;This would be about as productive as taking 16 fully-clawed cats and putting them in a shower which alternates between freezing cold and boiling hot water. Then we could invite folks from SOE to step naked inside the shower. We could videotape what happens, and write up a long report on why showering with clawed cats is bad. Then we'd do another round with wild cats, then with leapords, and eventually working our way up to lions and tigers.&quot;<br />
<br />
In the end, the cats are unhappy, and anyone crazy enough to give the &quot;Balance Chamber of Blood&quot; a try would be even unhappier than the cats, if that's physically possible.<br />
<br />
But, other than that, it's a great idea.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Galamann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Lol. I think that sums up my opinion also Fafner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">LMAO Fafner, well said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Enobarbus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ah yes. the wonders of cynicism... <br />
<br />
Well, all I know is, when SOE asked each class to provide us with what we think our roles are/should be, no class could get a consensus. When SOE asked its own devs, they didn't know either, or simply didn't respond. Our class-wishlists have conspicuously vanished. Now they are asking for class reps. <br />
<br />
If nobody knows what's going on, and if everyone just wants to continue to bitch and moan about how their class is broken or needs this and that, then I wonder why anyone even plays this game. You people realize you are paying them money for this right?<br />
<br />
Just curious...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rgallnor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sounds like a great idea as long as everyone can keep an open mind.  Take the time to stop by there if you havent guys/gals.  Its much different then I thought it would be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well, I'll throw my 2c in like usual.<br />
<br />
First off all classes are not equal.  When you look at the total EQ population Clerics, Warriors and Druids each have about 12-13%.  Bards, Shaman, SK, Beastlord, etc. have (and I'm just going to round) about 5% each.<br />
<br />
People like to conveniently forget about this when they talk about class balance.  Also, given the way Sony has decided to balance the most difficult content, raids are usually dependant on the # of clerics available.  That's the cold hard facts of the situation.  And clerics are balanced for the most part (and correctly IMHO) by their healing power and not their utility or dps.<br />
<br />
I think I have flipped positions on the &quot;Priest&quot; balance since I have read all sorts of posts and really thought about the &quot;healing dilemma&quot;.  My current take is what's good for the game &gt; than what might be good for Shaman regarding healing balancing. And what I think is good for the game is a good strong healthy cleric class.  Clerics should be clearly the best choice (and maybe the only choice) as a primary healer.  When and if Sony takes that position, they need to re-tune shaman and druids to effectively compete for one of the 4 slots remaining in a group (excludes tanks as well, lol).  How they tune Shaman? I don't care. Just do it.  And make it fun, hopefully.<br />
<br />
Would it be nice if every class had a similar population and place in the &quot;overall balancing of the game&quot;? Yes, I suppose it would be but that's not reality.<br />
<br />
Think about if you were balancing Everquest.  First you balance tanking and healing and the damage output of the mobs. Then you work on balancing the player DPS and the hit points of the mob.  Then you work on the crowd control and the placement and agro range of the mobs.  And then.....taa daa..you work on the utility classes to fill in the gaps - that be Shaman in case I lost you.<br />
<br />

<br />
PS: The reason Sony has been apprehensive about posting meaningful class descriptions was so they could make changes in content without a bunch of backlash about how it directly affected the classes.  Up till now they could just say &quot;working as intended&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I had a look and I was less than impressed. Listing slow as a core class function right alongside healing, damage and tanking does not endear the poster to me.<br />
<br />
That being said it [I]is[/B] a newly founded board. It may well involve into something useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Toppo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Sounds like a good idea.<br />

It could  come up with something really creative and interesting; or it could turn out like Fafner's sketch and be very entertaining :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hey. I'll be the first to admit that I have very little of a clue about what is plaguing other classes. I guess the only thing that distinguishes me from the average griper is, I'm actually curious about what the other classes are missing. how it all relates.. I'm not interested in monk-leetness or monk-balance.. i'm interested in class balance and i think some many others are too and that requires first that we get some amount of knowledge about the class.<br />
<br />
We'll try to approach it slowly and methodically and we will moderate to keep the flaming and senseless griping to a minimum. We're hoping that the information and the progress will keep people positive. One of the main reason why people talk so much about their class, is cus it's all they really know. <br />
<br />
This will not be a &quot;SOE please look at us cus we can come up with the solution to all your problems&quot; board. we will try to come up first with all the information it takes to make anyone who reads the reports (which will be compild from the posts) to be able to understand class balance. We'll go from there.</div></div><hr />

you live in a world where you believe that if you are good/nice/polite/correct enough that sony will make changes.<br />
<br />
as long as you pay your money, why should they change?<br />
<br />
they are &quot;good/nice/polite/correct enough&quot;; that you pay them.  what else do you think they want?  to make a better game?  NO.  they want you to pay them.<br />

Oh yah cus the bitching and moaning has been doing so well. Every expansion has progressively gotten worse. So of course your way is right &quot;Teacher&quot;. I apologize</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">the only classes that have ever recieved any noticable upgrades , bitched like someone that just got their epic KS'ed.<br />

repeat after me<br />
<br />
the only classes that have ever recieved any noticable upgrades , bitched like someone that just got their epic KS'ed.<br />
<br />
Sony does not give a ****.  To date, we only have one problem that has been recognized by Sony, and it is not fixed after 2 months.<br />
<br />
if you pay them, do not expect jack.<br />
<br />
i do not know how i can be any clearer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">bonestomper is right on the money,  the only time SoE even listens is when class boards are screaming bloody murder.. and that has to go on for about 4 or 5 months minimum for anything to be done on the dev side.<br />
<br />
It's all about the process folks,  keep bitching.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Nice visual on the cats in the shower.<br />
<br />
I applaud any effort to correct the problem, but this should be a visible, concerted effort by the Devs not by the outside communities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Lol woow that's a nice description.  I think I'm about to check it out so see how appropriate it is...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Daekar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Better to just stick to the SoE boards and regular class boards IMO.<br />

<br />
/Agree<br />
<br />
Though I did enjoy the visualization of the shower bit lol, good laugh while at work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sordia Winetrsbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I know that no one is truly interested in this, but someone other then the level 55 shaman who is happy as pie go post over there on the off chance at all that the board is read and the happy-happy joy-joy opinion of Pre-PoP, Pre-65 end game is taken for the state of our game.<br />
<br />
And no I won't do it, as I am smart enough to know that I am not far enough into the problem areas to know how bad it gets myself (not even elemental planes flagged yet).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>SisterLi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">It is an interesting idea.  Don't be discouraged if it is slow to take off, keep working on the promotion.<br />
<br />
One suggestion -- can you cross-link a &quot;state of the class&quot; post for each class?  We've had a few very good descriptive posts on this board.  I recall several from early 2004.  I'll see if I can find them later for you -- but maybe someone else has them handy, or recalls authors?  My afternoon is pretty busy, so will be tomorrow before I can search for them.  Might be good to have folks start out by reading the state of the classes posts -- so they understand what other classes are worried about.<br />
<br />
Don't worry about the piss and vinegar crowd.  It is always easier to tear down an idea than it is to build it up, or to do the work to make it viable.  It would take just a few articulate folks from each class to get some really good discussions going.  Somewhere out there are the reasonable well informed folks you are looking for, just keep posting till you find them. <br />
<br />
Nice work on the forum design. <br />
<br />
No particular reason to believe that Bonestomper is correct about what motivates Sony to act.  It is just as plausible to believe that one of the reasons it is so difficult to get through to them is that they hear so much whining that they are hard wired to tune it out.  Hence what gets through are long balanced well researched posts or endless repeating of the same basic theme.  I expect it is more accurate to say that changes get made in spite of the mindless loud bitching, not because of it.<br />
<br />
Sure it would be nice if the developers were doing something like this.  But they are not.  Or if they are, it's not visible to the community at large.   The Balancing Chamber is an attempt to put some vision back into the game.  It requires work and thought, but is not impossible or doomed to failure.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Wolfborn01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I think the problem exists as the role of the shaman a few expansions ago was that of the slower / buffer. However 2 expansions later the role of slower / buffer can be duplicated with another class that can add more to the group than the shaman.<br />
<br />
Our role has not changed but the game has changed around us making us a lot less required or needed in groups. <br />
<br />
It's not a question of rebalancing the class its more a question of how to bring the class up to date after being ignored for so many expansions.<br />
<br />
Therefore how do you balance something when there main focus is taken away from them. This is something that I can answer!<br />
<br />
And this in its self has left a large proportion of the shamanic comunity jaded and disillusioned with SOE.<br />
<br />
However when ever you get all the classes together I think the major problem you will find is the fact that people are convinced that there class is much more broken and more important than the other classes. <br />
<br />
On a brighter side though if you can get the right repusentatives and have a massive ban list it might actually work. Good luck to getting it up and running just don't expect that SOE will listen though.</div></div><hr />
