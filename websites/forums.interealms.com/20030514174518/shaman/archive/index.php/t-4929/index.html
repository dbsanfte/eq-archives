<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Heelah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i know i've read several posts where people who skipped/repeated steps were having problems. dont think its possible to use the books off ghiosk to max faction anymore, and i bet they fixed the fools harvest as well. i kinda like that they make you do all the steps now. it is a social game right? be social, make some friends(even if only for 1 fight). do the steps, they're fun! or just screw around and have your tear get eaten. then when you petition, a helpful and easy to deal with GM will say,&quot;sorry, i can't help you&quot;<br />
i'd be ratherly upset if i got skipped on a tear to some joe schmoe who skipped their epic fights.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">2 of my guildmembers have done exactly this (factioned up and skipped the Hole, and Neh'Ashir).  They both did the final fight within the past month, both are now carrying the Spear of Fate.<br />

No, it has not changed.  Yes, I wish it would have.</div></div><hr />

 My opinion would be if u wanna cheat the faction bug go ahead but every time u click for that dot just think of the dishonor that took you to get that stick.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or, once you have the spear, be happy you saved time because someone at Verant coded the quest in a manner that allows shortcuts. Not that the shaman epic is hard, compared to other epics.<br />
<br />
This may be cheating, but so is following a walkthrough. Many people don't even follow the whole conversation, they just say the key phrase, to get on with it.<br />
<br />
I am positive that by now big V knows about this. Has anyone been punished for doing it? Anyone banned?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>ogulak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">=( bad new prob can't do it im warmly faction i been doing the firast drunken shaman quest for awhile.<br />
<br />
no luck turned in about 15 gems still  warmly any ideas???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">its interesting how everone thinks differently. the shamans (55-60 lvls) i know are encouraging me to skip the hole and neh. <br />
<br />
also i don't consider skipping cheating, any more than i consider the fact that i just read the whole walk thru vs. trying to figure out the quest myself. you can't honestly tell me most people don't follow the walkthroughs. our epic isnt the only epic you can do a little faction skipping either. i don't plan to skip, but i'll be honest, with the size of my guild (right around 8 people after a huge drama), and not knowing very many people and just one other guild that has better things to do than raid for me, the chances of me raiding the hole, or killing neh is nil. if i'm sitting at 60 and unable to get my epic, i will skip. <br />
<br />
(and no i can't leave my guild, its real life friends i've known for 10 years, and that is more important than the game to me.)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>em2johns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I did the quest from beginning to end.  One would think they could check that all parts of the quest were done, instead of just doing faction checks...  Answers my question as to how all these shamans were running around with epics though.  The Hole, and heading up a Neh Ashir raid were by far the hardest parts...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">if u want to skip the hole .... i sugest u do the quest EXACTLY up to the ghiosk books turn in, if u get the spirit refusing ur nbook turn in, then u got a real headache trying to figure out where u are at in faction terms.<br />
<br />
The stables part took me 30 hours to do:  that pissed me off enough to lessen my guilt about `the faction work around` on the hole!<br />
<br />
At the end of the day  REIF jbb and KEI (maybe horse) work just as well as a epic,  However it still feels great to have the spear. Untill u click the dot  first time and realise it take 9 secs to cast *sigh*<br />
<br />
In a months time there is bound to be a weapon quest to make the epic look like the featherweight it has now become.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Tagra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The stables ARE awful!  I was there for probably 14 hours total.  Ick!  But I'd rather do it by the book than risk losing out altogether.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I started my epic quest at level 34 or so, and have progressed along with it slowly as I levelled. I had some luck - whilst scouting Mistmoore to see where the black dire was and what mobs were around him, an epic'd druid sent me a tell and helped me kill him. Later in CoM I was hunting for the reports and a small raid turned up to kill Reavers - they let me loot Ghiosk for the books.<br />
<br />
I levelled quite a bit in CoM, and found it reasonable to solo especially once I hit 49 and got EBolt and the new pet. I got all the reports myself except for the student log. I'd been hunting it a while and killed the courier a few times, but a monk was camping the spot so I was hunting the entrance area when he sent a tell that it had dropped. I'm waiting to raid the hole next, but will need to wait for the guild to grow a bit, or get in on a friend's guild raid perhaps.<br />
<br />
Anyhow I've rambled on. The point I was going to make is that doing the epic is FUN! I've met new people, been helped by complete strangers, killed reavers with a 60 warr, high level enchanter and a cleric I met there, and also got some nice XP at the same time. Sure you can manipulate the faction and take a short cut and I bear no grudge against those who do so. I've a lot more respect for those that do it properly though, and I bet they get a much greater sense of achievement from it too.</div></div><hr />

anybody who skips this step is a big wuss!<br />
kirn was cake, we didnt even break a sweat. sure, took us 2 nights to get there (camped out 1/2 way there the night before, hehe) but this is NOT HARD! landed slow, malosi, EB and plague no problem. (kirn was an even con fyi)<br />
looking foreward to doing neh soon.<br />
happy hunting!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gildanni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Where in the quest can you check your faction by conning them?  I'm just curious.  I am up to the Neh'Ashiir part of turning in the ring, and wanted to find out what my faction is up to.  It's been a while since I did any part of the epic, so I don't remember.</div></div><hr />

these new resist changes will fix alot of the epic exploit.  No more easy epic but still hella lot easier than most.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Rumar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Eat fast food while playing your fast game Everquest. Never learn about the game, or a even a bulletin board, just ask someone to help. It's nice to run into lvl 60 folks in some zone who don't know what continent they even are on etc. But that's the game these days. Play as you like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Unknown_shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I am actually very torn on this issue.<br />
<br />
I am a level 57 shaman and have been levelling steadily for the past few months on my server.  Have a good guild with lots of helpful people and even did a few levels at the Stables in CoM with a monk.<br />
<br />
My BIGGEST issue with Everquest is the EVERCAMP aspect of the game.  Killing green mob after green mob for 24 hours is NOT my idea of playing a game.  And I doubt it fits in with many peoples' ideas.  :mad: <br />
<br />
I have spent countless hours in CoM, both EXPing, just killing, and PLing high 40 tanks/monks in our guild.  (Kills two birds with one stone).  I have NOT been able to get the page from the courier.  <br />
<br />
Another shaman in my guild and I started to clear out CoM (He was 56 I was 55), and after 2 hours of clearing, I logged (rather than roll against him if/when the page actually dropped).  I logged back on after a good nights sleep (about 9 hours) and he is STILL clearing CoM Stables.  It dropped about 5 hours later (I was off line going to the gym).  And so thats about 16 hours at a MINIMUM for that little endeavour.  :eek: <br />
<br />
This is not what the game is supposed to be about (at least for me).  I can understand rare drop from regular mob, or 1 in 10 000 chance of dropping from a_random_mob001, but not this.<br />
<br />
I also hold a Full time job and have a significant other.  Dedicating a sleepless 24 hour session to getting a virtual page in a virtual game is NOT going to happen.<br />
<br />
Grabbing 20 of my guildmates and heading to Fear to kill some bosses to get the Tear.  GOOD!  Sitting in one spot farming greens for endless hours on the CHANCE that one might have something I NEED.  BAD!<br />
<br />
At this point, since I have tried and tried, I have resigned myself to stepping outside VI's &quot;Monkeys pounding on typewriters&quot; quest designers and have started to do the Woe/Envy part again and again.  As well as popping Surestout and doing the gem quest again and again.  <br />
<br />
DO I want to do this?  No.<br />
Do I feel reseigned to doing this?  Yes.<br />
<br />
Its a shame.  I would like to do it 'by the process', but everyone knows that when a process is BROKEN, or so incredibly innefficient that you go around it and do your own. (I code for a living :D )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Well why did you wait to do the epic then?  I am level 46 and the City of Mist is great experience for me, and probably will be for at least another 2 or 3 levels.   If you are iksar then both the epic quest and the mini epic quest can take you from level 1 all the way up to level 50+ easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I must have gotten lucky or they changed his spawn. I didnt spend more than an hour in CoM for my page, and maybe 2 hours total for all of them. Did they change something or was i just extremely lucky. This is the first time i have heard of it taking a long time :(. <br />
<br />
If you are on quellious, send me a tell i can try to help ya out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Okay, you guys are making me feel EXTREMELY bad.  I got my page off of the first courier spectre that I killed (saw one before, but when I actually noticed that he was killing me, I had three other golemns that I was attempting to get away from).  <br />
<br />
Now my guild, being about 15 of my close RL friends coordinated a raid on CoM to help a guildee take out Neh (he was 53 magician) and also to possibly kill Ghiosk.  With me being the second highest in guild at 55 (a 56 Wizzy is the highest).  We had 9 people for the raid (most there has ever been on at once) and got wiped out by Lhranc (don't ask).  Now, there is no way that we are going to be able to attempt the Hole or even PoF anytime soon, prob not ever.  I am one of the only ones that are on consistantly, so I say, if you have the force available to do the quest the way that it should, then you should do it that way.  But if you don't, and it looks like I don't right now, then do what you can and do the faction part.  I will do the faction part, but plan on holding off on taking on Rak until I know that we won't ever be able to handle the Hole or even PoF.  Heck, i have a good magician friend and two good 60 cleric friends, so that may be my only saving grace on killing Rak.  <br />
<br />
Do what you can do with the available resources, that's what I say.  Don't exploit just because you can, but because that is the only way.</div></div><hr />
