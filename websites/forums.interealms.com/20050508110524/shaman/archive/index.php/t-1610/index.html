<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bruzza Bashalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Bought Torpor for 40K.<br />
<br />
That is a pretty good price on SolRo.  Last few people I spoke to wanted 70k and 80k, respectively.  I notice it a bit more on the &quot;global&quot; auction channel than before lately, but it could just be a fluke. <br />
<br />
&lt;-- Happy!<br />

<br />
Yeldema, here I come ;)<br />
<br />
3 spells left for a complete Kunark spellbook: Pox, Raptor and Voice.  Not in a rush for any of those either 8)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think torpor is dropping more frequently.  I raided with DarkBlood when they dropped severlous two days ago, and TWO COPIES dropped :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ezeekial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i paid 60k from my buddies at recon. much love.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mutkuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Grats Bruzza, good to see that some people get it on our server, i wanna be lucky and find some newb selling it for like 200pp but it wont happen that way, i just bought a JBB so im not gonna get torpor in awhile, Brie told me about TWO torpor's dropping and i drooled all over my keyboard... Grats to Darkblood shamans though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bruzza Bashalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">From what I understand from asking around, the two DB got and a copy Cult of the Ancient Wyrm got not too long ago account for the recent drops.  Not sure where mine came from, and I was not about to ask a bunch of questions either ;)<br />
<br />
It IS as good as everyone says too :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mcdunno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Bruzza is a gimp<br />
<br />
err..sorry,that just slipped out.<br />
<br />
and a copy Cult of the Ancient Wyrm got not too long ago <br />
<br />
Wonder if I can talk the guild banker into giving that to me so I can get the fungi I traded for my copy back? :)<br />
<br />
So did you go hit Yeldema yet or what?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bruzza Bashalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">McDunno is the true gimp here.... err, yeah, that's it! ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
No, I have not gone to slap Yeldema upside the head yet.  I have some Kael chain I want to finish the quest for first, then I will pay the littlist dragon a visit.  Glares to Tormax at the moment, ally to the rest of the giants.  The Coldain should really post some stronger guards at the mines in GD.. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mcdunno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Tormax faction sucks. I must be up to 60-70 dwarf heads so far, and my ranger is still only dubious. :( Been carrying around a greater dragon head for 3 weeks now waiting to turn it in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bruzza Bashalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">120 heads turned in as of last night, still glares.  Keep in mind I am switching factions though, and did quite a bit of hunting in the Kael Arena back in my days with the Cult.<br />
<br />
Should be able to complete my bits early this week (after a quick trip to SG for 3 jaundice gems).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mcdunno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Bruzza, you have any quest gems at all? According to the most recently updated gem inventory we have umpteen million jaundiced gems. I'm sure we could be talked into giving you 3 for any other 3 you happen to have. /shrug.<br />
<br />
Not an offical offer by any means, not my department :) But, like I said, we've got a s**t load of 'em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Bruzza Bashalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Got the faction, gems and sleeves last night :)<br />
<br />
Have 12 Kobold paws in the bank, and that rolled me over to dubious to Tormax.  For the record, 120 dorf heads and 12 Kobold paws did the trick.  Ally Kromzek, Amiable Kromrif, Dubious Tormax.<br />
<br />
We have a gem bank going, and a pretty good selection at that.  Nothing like the pile you guys have, but only a few of us are active in ToV at the moment anyway so it is enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Mcdunno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I wonder how long we can keep a private conversation going on this forum?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Arc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">not for long :/</div></div><hr />
