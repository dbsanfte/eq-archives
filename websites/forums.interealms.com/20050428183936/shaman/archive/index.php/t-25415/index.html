<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Looking for a profile system like Magelo, only for WoW?<br />
<br />
If you haven't found it already, Allakhazam has a pretty nice one (click character name link in my sig). I've played around with a few different systems, the main being Thottbot, but this is the one I like best.<br />
<br />
Pro's vs Cosmos/Thottbot: Doesn't run automatically, thus sucking resources. BIG pro IMHO.<br />
<br />
Con's vs Cosmos/Thottbot: Doesn't run automatically, so you have to remember to run the main executable after every session to have your profile updated. Not much of a con, really.<br />
<br />
Currently it's free, and not sure if/when he plans on charging for it (if ever).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The inane stupidity of the anon negative rep bumpers completely astounds me.<br />
You would support Thott after Crucible's history with him.... typical<br />
I even said &quot;ALLAKHAZAM&quot; you dumb ****ted phucktard. The URL in my sig doesn't even point to thottbot you numb nut!<br />
<br />
Though you should know, your bump was grey so doesn't affect me in the least. How does it feel knowing your opinion counts for squat you inconsequential, minuscule maggot? No brass to sign your name? Wuss.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I got a neg rep bump with no info at all for my post on Classic EQ remember whens. <br />
<br />
I don't even really bother posting anymore to the crucible general area it is a waste of time now. (Yeah it probably was before but I did like many of the personalities there. Now it is dinks and die hard SoE/EQ apologists)<br />
<br />
The profile looks good however. <br />
<br />
Have a good one.<br />

<br />
Val, post some more pictures of your dogs dude.<br />
<br />
Snoww - spot on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">What do these neg rep bumps affect anyway? Who cares about somebody not liking my post if it does not break the forum rules?<br />

I think Valgoth is running for &quot;Most Popular Crucibler&quot; and can't afford any bad press.  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hey who does it affect if a bum pisses on the side of a wall either. I mean you can walk right by. <br />
<br />
Big deal.<br />
<br />
It bugs me because anon flaming is not allowed on the board. Except for the rep system. It is a cheap way to get around the rules of the board. <br />
<br />
Do the individual bumps really mean anything. No of course they don't but the snide little jackasses that think they are pwning me while hiding behind the  small loophole that is there just irks me. <br />
<br />
Just like the smell of piss would irk me while not truly affecting me. <br />
<br />
It makes the place less nice to be around. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kryscha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I actually use WoW Rankings for my profile.  It's uses an app that collects the infrormation about your character while you're online, then you trigger it to update when you're offline. Haven't noticed any performance hits at all while using it, and my system is far from being anything special. <br />
<br />
Can reach it at WoW Rankings (http://www.wowrankings.com) <br />
<br />
As an example, my warrior profile is shown here (http://www.wowrankings.com/viewb.htm?name=Ire&amp;s_id=31).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">That's a pretty slick one Kryscha. I'll have to look at that one a little closer.<br />
<br />
Snoww - bingo!<br />
<br />
Soulstorm - See Snow's explanation.<br />
<br />
Krup - Let's see how you like it, 'eh? :) No big deal, right? At least on this one you know who did it and can respond. (Feel free to ding me back. I did it to prove a point that when signed you at least know where you stand and where the person who dinged you stands). But then again, neg rep bumps mean little-to-nothing to you, right? :)<br />
<br />
It's the internet anonymity uberness syndrome/&quot;1 R L337 4nD pWnEd j00 f00&quot; bullsh!t that I hate. Neg bumps are fine, just be man enough to sign 'em and offer a good explanation why. You (not &quot;you&quot; Krup, just &quot;you&quot; in a general sense) wanna disagree with my post? Ok by me. You wanna ding my rep? Ok too. Just have the balls to own up to it instead of hiding behind some false &quot;ubar! l337ne55&quot; facade.<br />
<br />
Anon negative rep hits are made by cowards who are afraid to actually respond to the post they're dinging because they lack the intelligence to properly present a valid argument or openly debate their position in a public forum. Hiding behind anonymity is pussified.<br />
<br />
Yeh, I know. It's &quot;my problem&quot; (my psychological unwillingness to accept it), and that these inter-nit-wits will always hide behind anonymity. But at least I have the pleasure of lambasting them in public and calling a lark a lark. I'll be pleasantly surprised the day one of them actually steps up and claims responsibility for their cowardess and immature actions while anon. Then I'll call them a p*ssy to their face (metaphorically speaking, that is :)).<br />
<br />
Yes, it makes me feel better.  :p<br />
<br />
[EDIT]<br />
Defining the word &quot;you&quot; as a general term. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Oh look! Yet another fuggin rocket scientist with no balls!<br />
<br />
anytime someone complains publicly of a neg rep bump = another neg rep bump. noone really cares.<br />
Yeh, I mainly posted it because doing so seems to irritate this particular anon neg rep bumping ass munch.<br />
<br />
P*ssy!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have set up an User account with them (free one), but am unable to set up a profile.  I click on &quot;Your Characters&quot; and all I get is a screen showing a banner that says &quot;Your Characters&quot;.  No links to create profiles or anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Have you configured the updater with your Allak's login info? Once you do that, log into the game and when you log out run the updater again. That's what I had to do. The updater creates the character entry under your account for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Melkiah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">you have to log into WoW on the toon you want to create a profile for, alt + tab out (leave WoW running), &amp; run wow reader to set up a profile. you have to log on to WoW reader using your Alla profile. after that you can just run the reader whenever you need to update, you don't have to do it while logged into WoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Sure enough.  I was looking for a way to manually enter my toon's information.  Completely missed the WoWreader thingy.  Thanks!</div></div><hr />
