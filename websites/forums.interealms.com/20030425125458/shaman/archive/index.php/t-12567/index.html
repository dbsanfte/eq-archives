<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Seefamus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been trying to find a good place to solo or duo with my 51 SK friend for some time.  Dreadlands was good until about Lvl 51, but exp is slow above that.<br />
<br />
I've tried ME, TM, TT and EJ but there aren't any good camps with lots of dblue mobs that have low HP.  I tried CS but it's always camped with peeps quad-kiting.  I heard Dulak was a good spot, but I don't have LoY yet, planning on buying it real soon though.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any other suggestions?  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  :) <br />

I browse through there frequently looking for new ideas, areas, etc...  I would link a few threads but there are really too many.  Check them out and you'll agree!</div></div><hr />
