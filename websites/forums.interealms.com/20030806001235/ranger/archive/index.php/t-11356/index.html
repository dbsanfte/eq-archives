<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>TheTorpid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, this ticked me off. <br />
<br />
  Group of friends and I head down to the 3rd floor of runyeye as they still con lt and dk blu to us so we figure we can get some loot and xp.  Anyway we get there and there is a 55 pally down there who is attemtping to claim the whole floor as his camp, prolly farming for the bazaar or something (although I didn't actually ask him).  After we &quot;discuss&quot; things with him for a few minutes he grudgingly says ok you can kill a few things but you had better be quick i'm taking things as fast as I can.<br />
<br />
Now later I take a low lvl pally friend to Pal Caverns to help him get some xp.. (he was 11 at the time) so we go in and there is 1 group at bandit 1.  So we go over to our regular spot near the lake and no one is there so I start buffing him up and pull  a bandit and imediatley get KS'd.  Accompanied by the shouts of Bandit 1 is camped please go elsewhere.  We then begin the traditional OOC about how verant doesn't accknowlege &quot;camping&quot; and how its common curtesy to let others have a &quot;camp&quot; etc.. etc..<br />
<br />
Now perhaps I am wrong but I kept going... I didn't take everything just 1 bandit every few minutes.. all my friend's char could handle.. and get KS'd 3 times in total.  Really KS'd where you hit a mob then someone runs by and takes agro.  A few times I went back and finished it off myself... a bit childish I suppose.  They tried to KS me a few other times also but my friend managed to keep the mob without my help.<br />
<br />
Isn't it common courtesy to share spawns?  Doesn't it seem like if you have been camping a spot for awhile and someone else comes on that they should also be able to get a few of those mobs?  That just because you have been sitting in a spot that everything that spawns in a 100ft radius around you isn't somehow yours because you were there first?<br />
<br />
Oh and if it makes any differance the previous night I had been helping the same pally friend in pal caverns and met a very nice ogre who offered me half the bandit camp even told his group to only pull from one side.  I went and buffed him as best I could and told him to take everything he could from the whole camp that we could only handle 1 at a time every 2 or 3 minutes or so.<br />
<br />
I know there are good and bad ppl in game but I seem to run into more of the &quot;camp nazi&quot; types than anyone else.... that one ogre nearly caused me to fall out of my seat when he offered me half the camp<br />
<br />
In this whole post i'm talking about regular mobs... bandits, goblins, gnolls etc... not named mobs for quest or raid types those are a diff story.<br />
<br />
So what are your guys experiences?  Good bad and ugly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dedolito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Courtisy is if some one is there, you move along.  Yes you can pull in the pnp rules, but you are seen as an *** by doing so except for unique situations.<br />
<br />
However, in the case of the Pally, it was &quot;right&quot; of him to yield whatever mobs you could kill to you since you got exp and he didn't.<br />
<br />
In the caves, however, you were in the wrong.  If the camp was already established and being pulled by others, you don't just walk up and start taking &quot;1 every few minutes for yourself&quot; unless they say you can first.  however, i am unclear as to if the camp was already established or not by your account.  you say it was empty yet being pulled.<br />
<br />
Anything that has a static spawn point, by player definition, is a campable creature, subject to player -run, first come, first serve rules.  Like I said, you can force the pnp rules if you wish, but you make a bad name for yourself if you do.<br />
<br />
This may not be so obvious at the low levels, but if you are in a high level group in Velks doing say the LS camp and another group waltz in and demands half the spawn, well paties are gonna get in a bunch.  Likewise in Fungus where on busy night it's almost like the old lguk where every mob is being cleared.<br />
<br />
If you can handle every mob in a given radius around your camp and have proven that you are able to hold it, then it is your camp.  You can choose to share if you wish.  However, higher levels like that pally trying to hold multiple camps doesn't float.  If you leave the immediate area you lose rights to the camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Simas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah normally one person cant claim all mobs, but in the case of camps   if someone was camped its bad form to pull from it. <br />
<br />
Even tho there is no mention of camps in the pnp policy or whatever, players tend to respect them and it works out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KaninZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Torpid,<br />
  Two examples for you 1) Splitpaw : when folks camp the spires there are single spawns that pop up in the same spot every time and there are players or groups that regularly camp each spawn point. To walk up and pull one of those spawns, even if the player or group is not immediately pouncing it (maybe regenning, the druid had to go walkies...whatever) is considered &quot;camp breaking&quot; and bad form. 2) Aqua goblins : They have loot WAY beyond their difficulty level and it's not uncommon to see level 50+ players solo camping them and protecting their camps with all the love and caring of a rabid pit-bull with a raging case of 'roids and a tooth ache. These things were green to me around level 12. I have camped them for the cash, but when someone came up who could still get exp. I gladly gave up the camp or offered to share (depending on how close my bags were to full...I'm nice, not stupid *g*). These are a group of spawns who pop up in the area around their tents and while it would be legal to run up and pull one that wasn't being engaged...it's still considered camp breaking because someone is &quot;working&quot; that close area where the spawns pop.<br />
   All of this is of course MY spin on honoring camps. You won't find any book from Mrs Manners on this...just use common sense and try to treat others the way YOU'D like to be treated and you'll do fine. Good hunting :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tathagata</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I agree, Im seeing more and more camp nazis. One in particular was the other night.<br />
I was camping the needlites with a low level alt, I had decided to med at the top just next to the two bloodsucking plants there.<br />
All of a sudden I hear the laughter of a skeleton and someone killing. I look around and see nothing. Hmmm wierd. A min later I hear more things being killed, I stand up and look around and there is a necro and his pet killing Needlites. He had not done a camp check or anything. I was incredulous. I told him they were camped and got the old &quot;no they arent&quot; routine. Chat went back and forth for a bit.<br />
I was incredibly angry and did something stupid. I ran down and stood in front of each spawn ready for it to spawn. When it did I took first hit, thus claiming the kill. Everytime he KS'd me (I was 25 cleric, him 26 necro). So eventually after much bitching and going on between the both of us I reported him. I admit, I just got pissed and should have just left after the initial stand off, but i was angry, this happens so often.<br />
After I reported him I realised I was being as much an ass as him and so I left to log in Tath and went elsewhere. I guess nothing came of the report as Ive not heard more of it since and I dont play often enough for them to try to catch me on.<br />
<br />
If any of you are that necro, well, I hope you burn in hell, you ruined my night, thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Katalaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Disclaimer: opinion to follow....if you don't agree with it, just remember that it is just that, an opinion.<br />
<br />
My opinion...there's nothing wrong with sharing. If you walk up and start pulling, yeah expect to get a not-so-nice tell, but if someone asks you to let them share, you will NOT burn in Ranger hell if you say yes.<br />
<br />
I spent from last Thursday until this past Monday camping bodyguards in EW. Every time another group came by and asked to share I said yes. Hell, I can't keep them all clear myself yet, may as well let someone else benefit from what I can't kill. <br />
<br />
The only time I got anal was when a wizard insisted on getting the whole camp because &quot;killing 3 mobs ISN'T quadding&quot;. I told her I'd be more than happy to petition for a Guide/GM to come tell us to share nice, and she decided it wasn't worth the trouble. Heck, I consider myself as having been generous, giving her 3 of the 4 guards, since I was there first. We actually became kinda good friends after that, somehow.<br />
<br />
I view a &quot;camp&quot; differently in every scenario. I don't acknowledge that they exist beyond player courtesy, and 99% of the time I don't say anything. However if there's a place I want to hunt and know I am fully capable, I'll ask whoever is camping static_spawn_00 to share. This is solo only. I won't bring in a group and ask to share someone's &quot;camp&quot;....why? Well, there are a lot more places I can exp in the game with a group than places I can exp solo. I can take my group to any one of a plethora of zones, whereas I only have two real gold mines for solo exp, and only one involves a &quot;camp&quot;.<br />
<br />
With the exception of the above-mentioned wizard, everyone has said yes when I asked (and the wizzy is the one who asked me for the camp, not the other way around). Sometimes being nice about things gets you places. Gabbing back and forth with another poor guy/gal stuck soloing just like you makes the night go faster, in my opinion :)<br />
<br />
I shared with a Warder who was PLing his enchanter alt at BGs on Monday night. Most Warders can take all 3 &quot;main&quot; BGs in a row, but this guy was quite nice about sharing and even slipped me a free clarity from his twink as a thank you. I was able to meet my exp goal for the day a whole hour early, and he had a whole extra hour of having the area to himself when I left.<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
Regarding the original poster - you should have asked about sharing the bandits before pulling, as a courtesy. There are plenty of spawns at both camps where sharing shouldn't have been an issue, especially since your pally friend could only handle one every now and then. I have found that it usually shocks people sufficiently when you ask that many will share with you. <br />
<br />
Never underestimate the power of &quot;please&quot;, &quot;thank you&quot;, and being sincere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Siriath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I disagree, depending on ONE thing. Were you pulling the Bandit with the Fishing Pole, or not? I have never seen that one single bandit considered part of the B1 Camp. And if anyone considers it that, they are screwy in the head. Neither that one, NOR the Named Bandit. (Marcia whatever) are part of B1. I've never considered them that, and if they are free, (When I was leveling in Paludal) sure, I would pull it. I don't consider Yelloweyes part of B1 either. I have happily shared Yelloweyes with someone while I pulled Recondites, and have had them share Yelloweyes with me. But the bandit with the fishing pole, just because he's near B1, doesn't make him a part of the camp. (Or her depending what spawns). <br />
<br />
In Runnyeye, that Paladin was an imbecile. No one whole floor of any zone should be classified as a Camp. Because if that were the case then people in the Crushbone TR would have the rest of the castle, and the tower to deal with. That's never been true. So, he was a moron. I don't care what class and level he was, just a complete moron.<br />
<br />
Do me a Favor, if you were Camping the one with the fshing pole, in Paludal, tell me the names of the people who griped at you, and give me the name of that Paladin. I want to know who to avoid when trying to get in a pickup group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Montegue</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">That camp in paludal can support 2 full groups at a good clip. They were being selfish, and they violaed the rules by KSing you. You engaged first, they KS'd, it's warnable. <br />
<br />
Not that any Gm at all gives a sip about us anymore, but it is against the rules.<br />
<br />
They were *required* by the rules that we all agree to every time we play to share that camp with you. They cannot own it, and it was not wrong of you to try to pull from it, especially at the low rate you were pulling at. They were the ones who were absolutely in the wrong both for their greed and for their violation of the actual rules in the game. <br />
<br />
The &quot;My Camp&quot; bull**** only flies with me when it's a rare spawn, like Stormfeather or something else that may cause a heart attack if stolen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Wwen Valimar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Its it very nice, but basicaly legal I guess. If I am farming plat from Runnyeye or such I do it when its empty and if there are people there of the appropriate level I leave if they mean to hunt exactly where I am or at least stay out of their way. Its just polite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>TheTorpid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I did pull the 1 bandit with the fishing pole out on the island, that was one of the times they tried to KS me but were unsuccesfull.  There is also a single bandit that spawns off to the side in the direction where maricella spawns that I pulled.  Oh and they tried to KS yelloweyes off me also... that was 1 of the mobs that I went back and finished.<br />
<br />
I guess my point is this, there are nearly double the spawns at bandit 1 than say.. paw in SK.  And at paw if 1 group claims everything there even if they can take everything they would be laughed at.  If a spire is open then it is just taken no one asks say the south spire if they can have the north spire if the north spire is open.  At bandit 1 there are 4 houses with 2 spawns each inside, not to mention the multiple spawns outside each house, beside the fire yelloweyes etc.. etc... and they wanted it all.<br />
<br />
For lvls 15-27 or so Pal caverns is the best xp I have ever found and for them to claim bandit 1 entirely just because they could take it was greedy to say the least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dedolito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ah, that makes morse sense Torpid.  Now I see what you were saying.  You are right, one group would technically not qualify as being able to own that enitre camp.  And given they were pulling the entire thing, then 1 mob wreally wouldn't have slowed them down.<br />
<br />
If they could handle all of those mobs I would have thought they would have moved deeper to where that named bug bandit camp.  Aren't there a lot more there?<br />
<br />
*shrug* <br />
<br />
at any rate, had it been me I peobably would have just moved on even if I thought it was within my right to make a single pull every now and then</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>TheTorpid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Cool, glad some of you see my point.  I will probably be a little more nice about it next time tho, should have done it to begin with I guess but I didn't.<br />
<br />
Live and learn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>RaynosRainmaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">&lt;sigh&gt; 99% of the really old school players, when seeing that the camp was taken would have packed up and walked away... Ive been playing since release, and way back on when, when camps first started getting established, there was no pnp... If it was camped, you took a ****ing walk. I still follow these rules, because I know what its like to have some ****tard come up while myself or myself and a group of my peers are trying to level and pull the play nice card and start cutting our exp in half... To all the pnp nazis, **** off. Jesus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Siriath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Then yes, I agree with you. You weren't, no matter WHAT anyone else says, pulling from B1. I don't care what crazed psycho wants to disagree with me, but, that would be like me claiming the Warrens. The whole Warrens. It doesn't work. The Bandit Camp 1, in paludal has, now, let me count this in my head so I may be off one or two, 20 spawns approximately.<br />
<br />
Now, if you think that someone is being a PNP Nazi because they want one spawn every few minutes out of that lot, and I didn't even bother to include Yelloweyes, Marcia, or the Bandit with the Fishing Pole, and that it cuts your XP in half, I think you take this game way too seriously and you need a permanent Vacation to the rooms with white walls and jackets that make you hug yourself. I don't mean the Ranger that responded here, because some people have no clue how many spawns there are there.<br />
<br />
I have taken all of B1 with a group, and a damn good group, and it was fun, and easy, because we had already broken the spawn by camping it from the hill a few rounds.<br />
<br />
Unless they were doing that, and knew exactly what they were doing, then no one was KSing any camp. I see the campe get split all the time, and there is no reason 1 group should have absolute control over 20 spawns. See the ratio here? A full; group of six would mean that each member had 3 spawns to his or herself, and TWO left over. Now, if he is pulling ONE spawn, then that means every single member still gets their 3 per, right? No reason for them to whine.<br />
<br />
I have split that camp numerous times without being asked. It's not a big deal, but rather common courtesy. <br />
<br />
If you think otherwise, then maybe you should be a rogue. From what I have met of them, they are greedy enough for 100 Rangers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tirwen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Originally posted by TheTorpid <br />
Oh and if it makes any differance the previous night I had been helping the same pally friend in pal caverns and met a very nice ogre who offered me half the bandit camp even told his group to only pull from one side.  I went and buffed him as best I could and told him to take everything he could from the whole camp that we could only handle 1 at a time every 2 or 3 minutes or so.<br />
 <br />
<br />
Now, I'm not personally familiar with Paludal (I'm not real crazy about most of the Luclin zones ;p), but my husband hunted in Paludal. He ran into a problem there one night when there were either 2 or 3 established groups sharing the camp (he was in one), and another group started pulling stuff from his camp. Actually, that other group was pulling from all sides, claiming that there's no such thing as camps (or words to that effect). A fellow guild member ran into that same attitude in Paw. Personal feelings are this - if it is a campable spawn, ask for a camp check. While it is true that your taking only an occasional spawn wasn't hurting them, I think it probably became a matter of principal to the other group - in other words, you ticked them off, so they weren't inclined to share. <br />
<br />
My own bad camp experiences... Undead circle in NK. 8 or so zombies up. Yay! Need the skins for pottery. No one is there. I kill 3 or so, then this necro and pet come up and take the next one that I pull. I think &quot;fine, I can share&quot;, so I pull another. He says something to the effect that he was camping them. I apologized and left. However it did leave me cranky since camping implies that you're there ;p<br />
<br />
SK... camping Ryleen Bloodspur. For those who aren't familiar, she's a static spawn, doesn't wander, and is on JP poacher faction. I was in my low to mid 40's. She was blue/light blue. I'm just out of aggro range, buffing myself, when this druid walks up to her (level 52) and whacks her one. Then he takes off. I sent him a tell asking if he didn't see me back there. Then I told him to go ahead and take her. He tells me he can't snare her so he can't kill her and that he's going to zone her.<br />
<br />
Somewhat separate rant, I was in EK last night, mostly to forage tea leaves but keeping an eye out for anything worth killing. There's little ones in the zone, so I'm not bothering to farm silks. I see a griffon up on track and head over there. I look around - no one. Cool! I finish buffing. The griff is flying around and at full hps, so I figure I'm safe. I cast snare, but it resists, so I fear, beat on it, try snaring again. Still resists. Then I get a tell saying I'm stealing their kill. I'm kind of surprised, so I say I'll zone, go ahead &amp; take it. They said they zoned (I still zoned anyway). Then they said they'd been KS'ed twice... both times by a ranger... what a shock. That made me even crankier ;p I told him I didn't see him and that I zoned. Then I went and camped. Obviously, in hind sight, the mob was snared (or something similar), but there's no way of knowing whether the resist is simply that or that someone else already has a snare on. I don't know what class the other person was (they were anon), but if they'd been KS'ed twice already by rangers, wouldn't it cross their mind that maybe their hunting style was the problem? Or am I out of line? As far as I could tell, the mob wasn't rooted or DoT'ed, and the player wasn't in the near vicinity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Taylen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">On luclin server both bandit camps are traditionally split by 2 or 3 groups each anyway (about half a camp is perfect for a group getting experence there anyway).<br />
<br />
They weren't very right to try and take the whole camp, but it's fairly obnoxious to bring up PnP. Try and split the camp with them, if you can't just move on, it's not worth the hassles of arguing and fighting over who gets the kills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>KaninZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Tirwen,<br />
  The person claiming the griffon was wrong. If there was no damage showing on the griff and he was nowhere in site....fair game baby. I've had a few folks try to chase me from kills saying 'MINE&quot; or &quot;I was tracking that!&quot; Frankly.....they need to get a clue...just because you want something doesn't mean you get it. If a mob isn't actively engaged (ie. Showing damage or sparkly skittles looking things flying off it) then it's up for grabs. Note, this means campable spawns too....if you aren't there....it isn't your camp. I don't catre if you just ran out of water or had to run to town to sell....your happy heiney wasn't there when I walked up and I DON'T KNOW YOU....you could be the type to say that even if you just signed on for the 1st time in two weeks. Yes IRL I try to give people the benefit of doubt....but that's RL where I can look into your eyes or read your body language to help me decide if you are honorable or &quot;embellishing the truth.&quot;<br />
    The above is my opinion of course. The easiest thing to do is be nice and use common sense :)<br />

Our Cleric went LD and it seemd like all the Orcs poped on us at once, I and the chanter were the only ones to zone int o Kith to survive.<br />
Our Bard, Rogue, and Ranger were bound at the ent to High Keep, for some reason neigther of them had a clue to the layout of HP (this made me lose alot of faith in the Ranger).:confused: <br />
Needless to say, as a Ranger Main, I knew the zone better than I know the back of my hand and ran to their rescue (I killed enough Orcs to become Warm to the Guards at that time).<br />
By the time we re-organized and got back to the Orcs, not some 2 minutes later a Halfling Cleric had already set up camp, not even bothering to shout if any groups were there!:mad: <br />
We asked if he wouldn't mind sharing, he said no and claimed it for himself.<br />
This is when the Ranger loged on as his 60 Necro (He regained my faith as a player, but not as a Ranger) and continued to give the Cleric a lil bit of his own medicine.<br />
<br />
All in all, it seemed the Halfling only wanted the Sharlock Pack!<br />
I laughed at him because it droped not 5min before the lose of our camp, I won the /rand, I knew that it would be a good long time befor another one droped and I called the Halfling a noob, for not being able to get a Rallic.<br />
