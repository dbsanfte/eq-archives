<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I won the cazic thule zone FT3 boots(boots of flowing slime i think) the other day.  AC 7, FT 3, some other stuff.  Stats are nothing to crow about, to say the least.<br />
<br />
I already have CoV quest boots, AC 21, lotsa very good stats.<br />
<br />
I also have torpor and canni 5.<br />
<br />
3 mana per tick times 10 is only 30 mana a minute.  That's next to nothing.  I can get hundreds of mana a minute with torpor and canni alone, much less canni 5 and regrowth.<br />
<br />
Even flowing thought 15, which is the max FT you can get, right?, would be just 150 mana a minute.  That's getting a TON of great loot to even think of FT 15, and it's still not that startling.<br />
<br />
Given that, and for a shaman with torpor/canni 5, would you keep these forever, and if you did, would you wear them 24/7, or only situationally.<br />
<br />
Thoughts?  I ask because my other toons are for the most part with pretty junky equipment, and selling these boots would go a long way toward getting them goodies.  I'm a truly terrible earner, and it takes me forever to get money.  These would actually be pretty darn good on my 54 druid, also.</div></div><hr />
