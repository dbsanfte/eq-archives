<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Uman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can anyone confirm that HA3 increase the amount healed by KM from 1950 to 2200 ish?  Druids confirm that HA benefits their percentage heals, and I was wondering if the same were true for shamans.<br />
<br />
 Yes, Healing Adept and Advanced Healing Adept affect every heal we use.<br />
<br />
Healing Gift affects everything BUT Tunare's Renewal and Karana's Renewal.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Only Extended Range works on 10-second complete heals for focus items. As for AA abilities, only Spell Casting Mastery and Healing Adept affect our percentage heals. It is stupid and was never explained, but for some reason Healing Gift does not work with our percentage heals.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, it sounds like Karana's Renewal (druid 5k percentage heal) is actually live?  (at least, to hear them talk about it, maybe they're wrong)  <br />
<br />
But the higher level shaman percentage heal still isn't last I heard here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No.<br />
<br />
Kragg's mending is flagged as a &quot;complete&quot; heal and is therefore not affected by focus items or AA abilities.<br />
<br />
The level 64 shaman heal spell never went live.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>mift atchou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">extended distance focus items affect -ALL- spells. even cheals and fake incomplete cheals. other than that no other focus items affect kraggs mending. and healing adept does make kraggs heal more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jeraem Gaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Pretty sure I heal 1989hp with lvl 1 adept.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Uman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Any other confirmation from people who have HA and have cast KM since getting it?<br />
<br />
I know conventional wisdom here is HA doesn't help, but it obviously helps the druids, and so far one report of it helping KM.<br />
<br />
It also seems that the PoP druid percentage heal (5k) is in fact live (not confirmed personally).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Uman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">2 first hand confirmations.<br />
<br />
So, HA is a very worthwhile AA (doesn't help quiescence but oh well) for shamans who often/sometimes play healer.  HA3 = 10 percent more healing (12 aa).  AHA3 = 9 percent more (for only 6 aa!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">even if it was affected , 39 hp isnt much a boost , might wanna research a lil more then 1 post going &quot;im sure&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The level 64 shaman heal spell never went live. <br />
<br />
Gloriana ... This spell didn't go live?    <br />
<br />
Khura's Mending Single Target Mass Heal Spell (Max: 75%/3120)</div></div><hr />

<br />
1989/1950 = 102% ... which is what HA1 gives.  the benefit from HA/AHA3 (total cost = 2+4+6+3*2 = 18 aa) is 119%*1950 = 2321 HP - or an extra 20hp healed per KM per aa spent.<br />
<br />
Clearly, SCRM is more dramatic (12+9 = 21 AA) for 150% healed with torpor/quiescence, but AHA (119%) is still good for the direct heals including KM<br />
<br />
Of course, KM is still overly gimped compared to druid's TR, especially on slow-mitigating mobs, and druids get the same benefit from AHA and stay 50% better at healing.<br />

nice numbers ...<br />

let me know when you get it if its actualy functional</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">You know anybody with it? <br />
<br />
I hadn't thought to ask anyone about it but since I'm about to ding into 63 and start thinking about 64/65 again instead of AA's ... so I guess I'll ask around Veeshan.    But to be honest I've not seen it &quot;In Game&quot; myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Cattiebri</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yes KM, Tnargs, ect are effected by Healing Adept AA ability. I myself have HA 3 and PoP HA 1 and it is finally starting to make a difference :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">since when is kraggs affected by anything, my understanding is that its listed as a complete heal which negates its ability to be affected by AA</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I have both HA3 and AHA3, off the top of my head my KM weighs in at about 2350hps.  Kraggs mending IS affected by Healing Adept and Advanced ha, although I'm yet to see a focus item that affects it.<br />
<br />
Focus AA's do affect cleric/druid CH also Lit, the only difference is that Clerics can crit there CH's, we can't crit ours.<br />
<br />
And yeah, Our 3.2k iCH got pulled, Karanas renewal is in the game (A few of our druids have it, although the agro it can pull now is really quite funny) /sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ivain_VZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">CH spells are affected by AA abilities. My fiance plays a cleric and has level 1 or 2 of healing adept and gift. Whenever she crits a CH she heals for 15750 or something like that, instead of the 15000 it would be without the bonus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Uman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Druids all agree that healing gift doesn't crit their % heals.  Almost certainly the same for KM.  Everyone has confirmed that extended range focus can affect 10-sec-heals.  No other focus does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gikk the Unholy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Healing adept absolutely DOES affect Kragg's, take it from someone with advanced healing adept 2.  Just one other comment:<br />
<br />
&quot;AHA3 = 9 percent more (for only 6 aa!)&quot;<br />
<br />
Advanced healing adept 1 is 2 points, lv 2 is 4 points, and lv 3 is 6 points.... 12 total.  That 9% is right though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Hardiman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Just FYI Uman, SCRM is 8 points</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Cantiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">WOW! Thats sweet. With Marrs gift and HA3, AHA3 that gives a potential of 44% healing increase. That would give a total heal of 2800 heal. Almost useful considering the mana cost and cast time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Marrs gift and the like doesn't affect kraggs mending =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Lind</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Originally posted by Litgruv <br />
since when is kraggs affected by anything, my understanding is that its listed as a complete heal which negates its ability to be affected by AA <br />
 <br />
  Since complete heal is effected by all relavent AA, I wonder what gave you that idea?  All %heals and CH are effected by improved range foci, all are effected by the SCM AA, all are effected by the healing adept AAs, and CH but NOT the %heals is also effected by the healing gift AAs.<br />
 <br />
  Of course, Tnarg's is effected by healing gift AA and it is effected by mana preservation foci and it is effected by casting haste foci/buffs in additon to everything KM is effected by, so since the agro nerf on Kragg's theres no reason to even use Kragg's over Tnarg's.  But thank you Litgruv for taking the opportunity in the healing nerf threads to piss on druids instead of dealing with an actual problem not only they have but shamans as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Uman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Yeah, my AA costs are all off because I got them from a web page.  Thanks =)<br />
<br />
And, druids report that improved healing focus items stack with HA/AHA (for non-10-sec-heals; the imp. healing focus items do nothing for 10 sec heals)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Uman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Lind = druid = knows more about healing than many shamans???  What is wrong with this picture? =)<br />
<br />
I guess shamans are trying not to think about how bad their heals are compared to druids, so have tried not to think about them at all (that, and not bothering to use KM in favor of getting a druid or cleric to heal).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
You even state that CH and the partial heals aren't both effected the same way. Crits and improved healing have always worked on a clerics true ch but that doesn't mean that they work on our spells. Heck the fact that they are limited to a max % healed and ch isn't means they are handled differently by the game. I'm almost positive that they didn't work at some point and that it has changed since they where added.<br />
<br />
I don't have any of the healing aa's personally but saying x works with ch means nothing as to if it will work with KM or the other % heals.</div></div><hr />
