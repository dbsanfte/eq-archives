<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am looking to find a more reasonable priced alternative to the Fungi, and heard that there is a Luclin version of it that has a lev 51 requirement on it.  Now I have heard conflicting stories and am coming here to get the definate answers.<br />
<br />
1.)  Allegedly it &quot;no longer drops&quot;  Any truth to that?<br />
<br />
2.) Allegedly &quot;no drop&quot;.  Others have told me that they have purchased one.  Who is right?<br />
<br />
3.) Allegedly reward for a quest. If so does anyone have some info on that quest?<br />
<br />
Thank you for your help!<br />

<br />
I can guarantee that it is not no drop as I passed mine to my mule today.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tienen Crazywolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">pretty sure its droppable) I bought mine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's droppable.  Tough to find one for sale, though (at least at the bazaar on Karana) and when it's for sale it's not that much cheaper than the fungi.  Bah!  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Crystalflake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It's droppable for sure, and on Tribunal at least, it's worth a crapload more than the regular Fungi Tunic..I've been offered upwards of 100k for mine...I wouldn't part with it for the world tho, looks freaking AWESOME on top of being a damn nice item.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Don't think I've ever seen one for sell on Tribunal.<br />
<br />
Hell, fungi's here sell for 80 to 100k...freakin ridiculous.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Silsisa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It's droppable, and it still drops about a week ago my guild got one and even though the shaman at the raid needed one the stupid warrior won it and is wearing it now /sigh.<br />
     We have been doing callers every wednesday for about 2 months and have only see one vest ;)...and we usually do 1 keg and a small when we do it.<br />
<br />
Sometimes in callers you get really lucky with the names and other times you dont get hardly any..last night we did it and i think we only got a 12/40 spear and Tiny Cloak..in about 2 hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Browu Frostforge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It was a defining moment in my EQ career....<br />
<br />
I had won the lotto for an RBG in Sebillis.  At the time, I was low 50s, broke and wearing an Ikky BP.  With the RBG, I was able to trade into either a JB BP or a fungi tunic.  They were both selling for about 20k at the time.<br />
<br />
Under advise from my guildee shamans, I went JB.  Not sure it was the correct advice at the time.  I would *love* to have one of those things, but they are up to 75-90k now.  Aint gonna happen anytime soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Lokeye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">On Veeshan, one was in Bazaar for 40k. Regular fungi goes for 55k + at the moment. If only I had more than 10k in the bank grr</div></div><hr />
