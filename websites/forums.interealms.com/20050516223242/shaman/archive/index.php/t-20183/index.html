<br />
You list some issues which are being worked on and should be fixed soon.  I have posted that secondary forte should not be granting 200 to your secondary spec.  I will find out about the pet call AA and call of the ancients and let you know.<br />
 <br />
As far as what shaman want, I read the huge thread on the old Newbie Zone, as did others on the team and there were no conclusions.  I also read many of the threads on the Shamans Crucible.  What I saw was a lot of ,the grass is greener, and class envy.  One email, from a prominent shaman even stated, we don't know what we want, we just want something.  That's not much information to go on.<br />
 <br />
Even here in this thread, I see division among shaman players, where what some perceive to be broken, others think is just fine.  You ask for statements and communication, while it is hard to comment when the message you are receiving is not unified and for the record the &quot;What's a shaman&quot; comment was meant as a joke.<br />
<br />
As I stated when I started this position, I will listen, but that does not mean your ideas will be implemented.  It may be that nothing is changed with shaman in the near future but if you provide a comprehensive list of what exactly shaman think does not work, I will pass it along.<br />
 <br />
I have been listening and will continue to do so.<br />
<br />
<br />
So he claims we have no defined answers, we are divided and what some see as broken some do not.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So what i challange to this community is a unification for upgrades. This post is aimed at purely the forum heavy weights. The people that accuratly can bust out math equations to prove what we need, the people that are our biggest and brightest debaters of the class. Not that we all cant input, but we need to decide and make a unified voice and i think our best should be the ones to put it into a final draft that we ALL agree on.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Why do i think this is going to work? Cause we ARE unified with a concern right now, we are not all worried about a  new FA, we arent worried about stat buffs, we have ALL focus on 1 central issue which is healing and we have been hovering around a means to fix this, but we have just not fully unitied.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Let me give a outline of what im saying, please dont take this as gospel, im just trying to give you something to help understand what i mean.<br />
<br />
 So, i have tried my best to articulate our concerns, so now your question is if anything, how to fix it?<br />
<br />
<br />
Well there is many ways at the crucible that have been brought up to fix this and a few of them are pretty intelligent and deserve some serious review.<br />
<br />
Example 1 is from this thread http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=20166<br />
<br />
In this thread a % fast cheal is mentioned. Basicly it takes the idea of our Kraggs Mending and expands upon it a lil by turning it into a faster fasting slighty bigger healing version. This is a very wise choice i feal for our blasting healing ability. This stops us from effectivly toping off a tank but would allow us the bigger heal to keep people from dying. It would be a effective tool with limitations to keep it from being too powerful.<br />
<br />
<br />
Example 2 is a direct upgrade to our Tnargs Mending. This would Also be effective as the desired upgrade would be something along the lines of the new druid heal for 2100 ( forget name ). We dont even care if its a equal upgrade, we just want to be brought a lil closer. If we get a 1800 or 1900 heal that is effected by AA and focus, we will rain down roses from the bleechers.<br />
<br />
Example 3 is our HoT. the current incarnation as of yesterday is this..<br />
<br />
03-04 21:48 Changed Mana cost from 225 to 285<br />
03-04 21:48 Changed Slot 1 from &quot;Increase Hitpoints v2 by 370 per tick&quot; to &quot;Increase Hitpoints v2 by 360 per tick&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
So first they gave us a 10 HP a tick up grade to mitigate mobs that hit on average 200-500 more a hit ( not round, per hit ), then they take the 10 away and add 60 mana to the cost. This is a line of spells known for its healing efficency in clerics and shaman. i wont figure out the math and speak for the shaman community, but I feel safe when i say that this needs a significent per tick healing upgrade and when i say significent, i mean more then 10 a tick. Try to remember that HoT is our main healing system. The shaman heals by laying Quiescence on nearly 100% of the time the mob is in camp and quick healing to make up for anything the Quiescence cant cover. Its a very acceptable aprouch to allowing us to be healers. We dont have the heal bombs that are needed to be a serious healer but we can do well enough for a exp group or in more general situations. Before if you had a shaman and a druid together in a group they were as effective as having 1 cleric minus the rez. This was BEAUTIFUL balance for the healing classes adn the game in general and i feel this should be the goal as we move into this new expansion and beyond. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As you see in this quote what i was trying to do was give answers, nto questions or complaints. This is what we need to do, we need to finalize some answers.<br />
<br />
<br />
#1  We need to give a direct and defined interpretation of a spam heal that we can ALL agree on. Mathmaticly figured so that the mana and usage is inline with our other heals and is line with what we feel is a fair upgrade compared to the druids.<br />
<br />
#2 a defined and mathmaticly reasoned approach to what and why we feel is need to make our new HoT a fair spell. This would include a defined DPS scale of mobs in GoD vs our healing ability.<br />
<br />
<br />
Remember the point is to provid a answer, not to comnplain. Its good to show why something is wrong but focus on the solution otherwise you risk running in a circle around the problem. I have fiath we can do this.<br />
<br />
I believe if we can ban together just this once on this 1 item that 95% of the shaman here agree are a issue, that we can hammer this into a solid steel response to the brenlo post from above.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you for listening.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ciele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Basically our spells got messed up during the beta test for Gates.  They weren't tested and any feedback given was ignored or half assed excuses were made as to why changes weren't made. An example of this is the fact that Breath of Trushar wasn't scribeable until the very end of the Beta.  No one could give feedback as to how much it sucked because no one could cast it.<br />
<br />
So in my personal opinion is what needs to be addressed.<br />
<br />
1) Balance of the Nihil should be the equivalent of Turgur's with a resist adjustment.  In other words a DIRECT upgrade, not a situational upgrade.<br />
<br />
2) Plague of Daluda is a piece of garbage.  It should be changed to be our ANCIENT spell and changed into either a fast efficient DoT either magic (Bane style) or poison (Blood of Saryn) or an improved fast casting direct damage spell either poison or ice.<br />
<br />
3) Breath of Trushar either has to be made into an upgrade to Tnarg's Mending, an improved direct heal, 1600-1800 hp range or needs to be made the equivalent of Holy Elixir, so we have some sort of stacking ability with clerics.  I'd prefer a direct healing upgrade like ALL the other healers got at the beginning of Gates.<br />
<br />
4) Ancient Chaotic Pain should be made a regular drop spell.  There is no reason a KEY upgrade such as this should be so inaccessible. None of the other classes NEED their Ancient spell to be balanced.  We do.  That is wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would back those suggestions 100% Ciele.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kowalsky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">almost 500 agreement to the &quot;one voice&quot; thread and we are not united?<br />
<br />
we have many suggestions there for them to pick one or some and implement it (or them)<br />
<br />
I don't see what they need more? should we teach them how to code too ?<br />
<br />
<br />
edit: btw, lets request for the new heal spell to be vendor sold with a decent price, and that it can be bought in old zone.. not only in GOD, for the one who still find nothing valuable to buy this extension :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think you'll find the one voice thread listed a number of issues, and what brenlo is saying is pick one. More people seem to be still rehashing the heal isuue (its my biggest concern) than anything else. I'd prefer to see a heal in the 1800 range or a bigger boost per tick than what we have now if its a heal over time. Probably rather see a heal as fast as tnargs but that does 50% more healing, so that with aa's we can crit for 4k or more. An upgrade to our Icheal would be nice also, 2k as a complete heal? *** is that, by the time we get it at 58 its already obsolete.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not united?<br />
<br />
There was a minor amount of disagreement, and for the shaman community that was a major accomplishment.<br />
<br />
We never all agree on anything, because the class can be played in so many different ways.<br />
<br />
The fact that there were so few disenting voices was an absolute miracle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think there is indeed a common and unified voice from the entire shaman community.<br />
<br />
/flip SOE<br />
<br />
I believe just about everyone can agree on that little comment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>TPFKAFaern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">For brenlo to claim <br />
<br />
 One email, from a prominent shaman even stated, we don't know what we want, we just want something. That's not much information to go on.<br />
<br />
Even here in this thread, I see division among shaman players, where what some perceive to be broken, others think is just fine. You ask for statements and communication, while it is hard to comment when the message you are receiving is not unified <br />
<br />
is both the height of hubris and extremely disengenuous.<br />
<br />
But you can forget changes to the class. If the past 3 years since Kunark have taught the Shaman community anything it's the following:<br />
<br />
1) Beta = implemented<br />
2) Shaman are ignored<br />
3) Sony does not care about this class<br />
4) Shaman will continue to fall further and further behind other classes.<br />
<br />
I sure would like to know who that &quot;prominent Shaman&quot; was.  For an extended amount of time Nixx sat on Test Server claiming how great Shaman were - even when he was GIVEN spells.  And you wonder why drop rates were never addressed ????<br />
<br />
And if a SINGULAR &quot;prominent Shaman&quot; sending an email is all it takes for Sony to say &quot;Oh well..Prominent_Shaman_01 says Shaman are ok&quot; then that is an EXCUSE for inactivity on the part of Sony.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is a Shaman&quot; was a joke?<br />
<br />
Well seems to me like the &quot;joke&quot; is on the current crop of Shaman players and I don't hear anybody laughing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ok stop complaining and bickering and looking at the bad.<br />

Resolution is the goal of this thread and im sorry, but if you cant resolve anything and bring unity pelase go post in the other 20 threads on this forum.<br />
<br />
This is a thread about progress.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Oh and FYI im going to let this thread grow and what not over night and toamrrow, then try see what we can muster for a response tomarrow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Numgrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'm going to humor Brenlo for the sake of arguement. The problem (his problem) was that the &quot;One Voice&quot; thread contained too many issues. Even if they are all legitimate. Common sense tells us, like it or not, they aren't going to implement changes addressing all of our concerns at one time (again humoring them that they will at all). Even as much as most of us feel many areas need changed, they wont likely ever revamp multiple major aspects of a class all at once. It's too much coding and too big of a change.<br />
<br />
So, as stated before, the upgrade to Tnargs seems to be the biggest issue at this point in my opinion judging from the amount of posts regarding that in the past month or so. I'm seriously hoping we can hash out ONE concern we feel is the most important to have addressed. Once that's done, let the math/chart/graphic wizards do some crunching/creating so we may come up with a viable solution for consideration. Then maybe maybe we'll see something actually happen. Worst comes to worst, we get ignored as per normal. Wouldn't be anything new, but it would eliminate the latest excuse given to us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I've requested again (and yes, I did send a lot of emails) that they have a moderated live chat with us.<br />

Best thing I can think of.  We should just elect a few representative and let them be a mouthpiece.<br />
<br />
Chutoi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If we are only going to present one request, I agree: a better spot heal, scaled as the number crunchers see fit.. <br />
<br />
If we will present a second request, I suggest: rework the existing Quiescence spell: instead of 4 tics at 300 health/tic for 200 mana, let's scale it up 50%, to 4 tics at 450 helath/tic for 300 mana.<br />
<br />
I don't want to step on Cleric or Druid toes, but I want XP groups to have confidence in my ability to keep them alive. And have the spells available to non-elemental players, please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">yes i think the problem was one of firstly saying we dont agree in the thread (which we do agree what wrong just not how to fix it).. and that we gave serval ideas that seem to look confused.<br />
<br />
i would say simplify it.<br />
<br />
shaman casting takes far too long, for fast fights we just can t cast more than 2 to 3 spells. which greatly reduces any utility we have, bacially malos , slow, and heal or dd. this is  the general problem. we are just to dam slow at what we do!.<br />
<br />
<br />
more detail.<br />
<br />
we lack quick damage and healing. which in quick fights is a must.<br />
<br />
our great mana regen is active, we cant do anything else while doing it or do it while chain casting, thats is a huge disadvantage, which is why is was so high, cause to make up with others it had to be as it isnt constant.<br />
<br />
our buffs have been degraded due to stats on armor making most people maxed anyway. make fo7 have all stats on it. make another hp buff with attck or some extra on it.<br />
<br />
<br />
our spell take to long to cast ie malos and slow. the mob half dead  by the time these hit.<br />
<br />
mitagation of slow, is a nerf to our slow healing.<br />
<br />
our HoT wnent from 300 /tick to 300 tick.... (now 370/tick) SoE see nothing wrong with that?<br />
<br />
<br />
bottom line and comon to all threads we need tweaking for fast paced game, all shaman i seen here tend to agree that.<br />
<br />
our healing and damage is below par. our buffs not needed, and slow not class defining. <br />
<br />
what else do you want us to say?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">So far im seeing a very defined and unified voice.<br />

<br />
Healing goes 2-ways Fast heals and HoT's<br />
<br />
Fast heal:<br />
<br />
Tnarg's sollution<br />
<br />
Slot Description <br />
1:  Increase Hitpoints by 1800 <br />
 <br />
  <br />
Mana: 650 Skill: Alteration <br />
Casting Time: 1 Recast Time: 5 <br />
Fizzle Time: 2.5 Range: 100 <br />
Location: Any Time of Day: Any <br />
Deletable: No Interruptable: Yes <br />
Target Type: Single Spell Type: Beneficial <br />
<br />
  <br />
Classes: Shaman/65 <br />
Duration: Instant  <br />
 <br />
 I picked about the same mana to hp healed ratio as for our cuurent tnargs, The same chain cast time only I turned it into a faster casting, longer recast spell as I think that an emergency heal should be fast.<br />
1800 hp healed (base) is enough for the purpose of an emergency heal.<br />
<br />
For our HoT I think this is something to strive for:<br />
<br />
<br />
Breath of Trusth<br />
<br />
Slot Description <br />
1:  Increase Hitpoints v2 by 560 per tick <br />
 <br />
  <br />
Mana: 500 Skill: Alteration <br />
Casting Time: 6 Recast Time: 2.25 <br />
Fizzle Time: 2.5 Range: 100 <br />
Location: Any Time of Day: Any <br />
Deletable: No Interruptable: Yes <br />
Short Buff Box: No Target Type: Single <br />
Spell Type: Beneficial  <br />
 <br />
  <br />
Classes: SHM/65 <br />
Duration: 4 ticks  <br />
 <br />
Lower then the cleric version in hp healed and slower casting but still a spell that is worth casting.<br />
<br />
And finally I think our Dot needs some adjustments<br />
For starters I think it should be made our ancient drop (this seems in line with other classes)<br />
<br />
Suggestion<br />
<br />
<br />
Ancient Bane<br />
<br />
Slot Description <br />
1:  Increase Curse Counter by 24 <br />
2:  Decrease Hitpoints by 600 per tick <br />
 <br />
  <br />
Mana: 530 Skill: Conjuration <br />

Target Type: Single Spell Type: Detrimental <br />
  <br />
Classes: SHM/64 <br />
Duration: 4 ticks  <br />
 <br />
Faster running and with a higher DPS then bane in its current form and still sticking to the damage increase we have seen at other classes</div></div><hr />

Upgrade to out spot heal and upgrade to our HoT<br />
<br />
<br />
Question is, can anyone crunch some numbers?<br />
<br />
Now, removing any and all GoD spells from this mix, because most regular people will never see them... leaves us with Tnarg's/Q VS Karana's Renewal (both PoP spells, Tnarg's = Shaman(62), Quiescence = Shaman(65), Nature's Infusion = Druid(63)<br />
<br />
Crunching some fast numbers, Nature's Infusion is a 1750 heal for 500 mana (Karana's Renewal - Druid(64) - is like a &quot;druid second CH&quot;... how come shamans don't get one?! 10 sec cast, 4680, or 75%, heal)<br />
<br />
Now, crunching fast heals (Tnarg's VS Nature's Infusion), you have 1300 VS 1750. Let's throw a bit of an upgrade into Tnarg's, make it 1600 (still giving druids a little edge in the way of fast heals) for 535 mana. It's still the same efficiency mana-wise as Tnarg's, but gives you a little more &quot;umph&quot;.<br />
<br />
Now, let's compare highest heals at 65. Kragg's = 1950 (or 75%), Karana's Renewal = 4680 (or 75%). Karana's Renewal has the 10 sec cast, and a 600 mana cost. Just for chuckles, let's give shamans another similar CH, to at least give them a bit more healing power when slow hits (because slow hitting affects druids and clerics just as much as shamans).<br />
<br />
This places Karana's Renewal at 60% better than Tunare's Renewal (Druid(58)) for 66% higher mana cost. (Karana = 600, Tunare = 400) Let's do the same with Kragg's. Now you have a 3120 heal for 600 mana. Druids still have a benefit, shamans get a bit better of a heal... HOWEVER the 10 second cast, for a shaman, attached to it, can't fly well with how fast things die.<br />
<br />
Now, because of a shaman's constant casting requirement (Malo*, Slow, Buffs, Canni, Heals), let's tweak the heal mana down, say, 10%, leaving the &quot;proposed heal amounts&quot; as is.<br />
<br />
I'm going to throw an arbitrary BoT upgrade (true upgrade) in here and change it to 450/tick (50% better) for 310 mana (55% more - keep it slightly in line with the druid CH upgrade changes)<br />
<br />
Let's take that 10% &quot;constant casting mana change&quot; into effect now.<br />
<br />
Breath of Trushar = 450/tick, 310 mana (after 10% adjust, 280 mana)<br />
Spirit's Mending (Tnarg's upgrade) = 1600, 585 mana (after 10% adjust, 525 mana)<br />
Body's Mending (Kragg's upgrade) = 3125, 600 mana (keep it in line with the druid version, not going to change mana costs)<br />
Malos+Slow = 650<br />
<br />
You could probably give it a little more of a percentage adjust because of the constant casting requirement in order to regen mana sometime this week... but I wanted to make it a bit small for the time being.<br />
<br />
Seeing above, you have a fair upgrade, while still allowing druids to be better in the healing department. However, it still, again, doesn't take into account the fact that a shaman/chanter/beastlord slow has incredibly similar benefits (even more so if the slow is mitigated, resisted, or flat out immune) for clerics and druids, who are able to get a passive mana regen with a group buff that actually costs LESS mana, and gives more HP (and even mana regen) than Focus does.<br />
<br />
Compare - Blessing of the Nine, Focus of the Seventh<br />
<br />
Blessing of the Nine - causes Virtue to bounce, but, stack with Kazad's Mark, and who needs Virtue? - 1700 mana, lasts 1 hour, 40 minutes (base), includes 8/tick mana regen, and 618hp<br />
Focus of the Seventh - causes no druid/cleric buffs to bounce (except cleric self buff, but we aren't talking about healing clerics regularly here either), 1800 mana, lasts 1 hour, 20 minutes (base), and gives 544hp, 75 str and 70 dex (which, for most melee classes, at 65, is probably max, or close to)<br />
<br />
Blessing of the Nine lasts longer (20 minutes), costs less (100 mana) and includes a mana regen and more HP. Kazad's Mark (to make the combo better than Virtue) costs 1800 mana (700 less than Hand of Virtue, but lasts 1 hour 3 mins base for 910 straight HP). Focus adds 544 HP and if your target already had max dex/str... that's all it adds... 544HP, nothing more, at least Nine has mana regen on it... and more HP on top of that.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Tnarg's for a shaman since its the only one we have.<br />
1300hps in 3.75 seconds for 450 mana<br />
<br />
Clerics there are a number of options.<br />
Supernal remedy<br />
1450 hps in 1.75 second for 400 mana- Substantially faster base and faster than you can get tnargs even with max haste, including cleric buff, and yet still heals for more and is cheaper<br />
<br />
Supernal light<br />
2750hps in 3.75 seconds for 600 mana- Same cast time, Over double the healed and slightly more expensive.<br />
<br />
Holy light (current live not improved version on test)<br />
3050hps in 3.75 seconds for 660 mana- A bit more hps and a bit more mana over supernal already more efficient than supernal by a little but and getting tweaked even futher up on test.<br />
<br />
Now lets try running some senarios<br />
<br />
We'll say a tank is taking 1300dmg every 10 seconds. That ends up being 130dps.<br />
<br />
Our shaman is going to have to cast 1 tnargs every 10 seconds taking ~5.5 seconds cast time and refresh and 450 mana.<br />
<br />
Our cleric will use supernal light and has to cast 1 ever 20 seconds and spends the same ~ 5.5 seconds casting and 600 mana.<br />
<br />
Ok bringing the shaman up to 20 seconds he's now cast twice spending ~11 sec casting and 900 mana. He now has to cann back 300 mana to match the cleric. That will take between 3 and 4 casts of cann 4 to make that up, we'll round down to 3 casts. That 3 casts takes ~15 seconds to cast but we only have 9 seconds so we'll have to settle for only 2 casts. That puts us at 164 mana gained so we're still 146 mana behind the cleric and we've done nothing but chain cast heals and cann for 20 seconds and the cleric has cast one spell.<br />
<br />
I'd hardley call 130hps a high dps mob in fact thats probably closer to a slowed mob in most of those zones considering the mobs can easily do that much dmg in a hit or 2.<br />
<br />
Even if you want to throw a q in there we still fall behind. Assuming you cast q at the start and it's always able to heal the tank he's gonna get 3 ticks if your lucky for 900hps healed and is behind the rate of healing needed and you've still spent more mana than the cleric.<br />
<br />
The hps healed per mana on the sells<br />
Tnargs- 2.9<br />
Nature's infusion- 3.5<br />
Sylvan infusion- 3.5 (3.8 on test)<br />
Supernal remedy- 3.625<br />
Supernal light- 4.6<br />
Holy light- 4.62 (5.0 on test)<br />
Obviously it costs shaman ALOT more mana to heal every point of dmg.<br />
<br />
Now hps healed per second<br />
tnargs- 260hpss<br />
Nature's infusion- 466hpps<br />
Sylvan infusion- 550hpps (560 on test)<br />
supernal remedy- 828hpps<br />
Supernal light- 733hpps<br />
Holy light- 813hpps (866hpps on test)<br />
Shaman obviously take ALOT longer to heal every point of dmg too.<br />
<br />
Ok so shaman take significantly longer to heal any given amount of damage, we are significantly less efficient at doing so?<br />
<br />
Yes I know we can slow but that takes time, mana and is increasingly less effective as mobs mitigate more or just become flat out immune. While shaman might be the only class that can slow and heal in any respect we aren't the only class that can slow and our lead, which is already small, just gets smaller as mobs mitigate more. Now by no means am I asking to be equal to a cleric in healing abilities or even a druid but there has to come a point when people realize that we are too far behind in every aspect of healing to be an effective healer.<br />
<br />
Honestly I can live with the efficiency difference more than I can the rate. Even with max benificial spell haste, max aa's and a imp healing focus tnarg's isn't big enough or fast enough to effectively heal most of todays content. It doesn't matter how efficient or inefficient your heals are if you can't keep a tank up.<br />
<br />
What I propose is trushar's infusion. 1750hps healed, 3.75 cast time and 540 mana. 3.2 hps per mana and 466hpps on the new shaman heal. Druids and clerics would still have a noticable edge and but shaman would not be so pitifully far behind<br />
<br />
For one last point of reference lets look at light of order a pally's top heal.<br />
Light of order<br />
935hps healed in 1 second for 440 mana (1000hps for 400 on test currently)<br />
Thats 2.125 hps per mana, actually less than shaman but 935hpps, significantly better than shaman. So a paladin is a bit less efficient, a bit lower amount healed but significantly quicker healing. The current version on test pushes it up to 2.5 hps per mana and 1000 healed closing the gaps on both area where they where behind shaman.<br />
<br />
An upgrade to BoT would be nice but an improved direct heal is much more important at this point. Same goes for the disease dot, yeah it would be great to have that replaced by almost anything but that isn't the biggest concern at the moment.<br />
<br />
Mostly a cut and past from the Breath of trushar changes thread but i think it covers the numbers side of things pretty well.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Now, removing any and all GoD spells from this mix, because most regular people will never see them... leaves us with Tnarg's/Q VS Karana's Renewal (both PoP spells, Tnarg's = Shaman(62), Quiescence = Shaman(65), Nature's Infusion = Druid(63)<br />
<br />
I highly doubt we'll get any help outside of GoD for our healing spells. Pre elemental planes our heals are sufficient and in the elemental planes they are still enough but it's right on the boarder depending on group and tank etc.<br />
<br />
Crunching some fast numbers, Nature's Infusion is a 1750 heal for 500 mana (Karana's Renewal - Druid(64) - is like a &quot;druid second CH&quot;... how come shamans don't get one?! 10 sec cast, 4680, or 75%, heal)<br />
<br />
Now, crunching fast heals (Tnarg's VS Nature's Infusion), you have 1300 VS 1750. Let's throw a bit of an upgrade into Tnarg's, make it 1600 (still giving druids a little edge in the way of fast heals) for 535 mana. It's still the same efficiency mana-wise as Tnarg's, but gives you a little more &quot;umph&quot;.<br />
<br />
Now, let's compare highest heals at 65. Kragg's = 1950 (or 75%), Karana's Renewal = 4680 (or 75%). Karana's Renewal has the 10 sec cast, and a 600 mana cost. Just for chuckles, let's give shamans another similar CH, to at least give them a bit more healing power when slow hits (because slow hitting affects druids and clerics just as much as shamans).<br />
<br />
This places Karana's Renewal at 60% better than Tunare's Renewal (Druid(58)) for 66% higher mana cost. (Karana = 600, Tunare = 400) Let's do the same with Kragg's. Now you have a 3120 heal for 600 mana. Druids still have a benefit, shamans get a bit better of a heal... HOWEVER the 10 second cast, for a shaman, attached to it, can't fly well with how fast things die.<br />
<br />
Now, because of a shaman's constant casting requirement (Malo*, Slow, Buffs, Canni, Heals), let's tweak the heal mana down, say, 10%, leaving the &quot;proposed heal amounts&quot; as is.<br />
<br />
I'm going to throw an arbitrary BoT upgrade (true upgrade) in here and change it to 450/tick (50% better) for 310 mana (55% more - keep it slightly in line with the druid CH upgrade changes)<br />
<br />
Let's take that 10% &quot;constant casting mana change&quot; into effect now.<br />
<br />
Breath of Trushar = 450/tick, 310 mana (after 10% adjust, 280 mana)<br />
Spirit's Mending (Tnarg's upgrade) = 1600, 585 mana (after 10% adjust, 525 mana)<br />
Body's Mending (Kragg's upgrade) = 3125, 600 mana (keep it in line with the druid version, not going to change mana costs)<br />
Malos+Slow = 650<br />
<br />
You could probably give it a little more of a percentage adjust because of the constant casting requirement in order to regen mana sometime this week... but I wanted to make it a bit small for the time being.<br />
<br />
Forget about the kragg's upgrade. It's not worth asking for. Even clerics are moving away from thier CH and it's much better. Odds are it would share the same limitations of the current version, not critable and not focusable so it would end up rotting in the back of the spell book.<br />
<br />
Seeing above, you have a fair upgrade, while still allowing druids to be better in the healing department. However, it still, again, doesn't take into account the fact that a shaman/chanter/beastlord slow has incredibly similar benefits (even more so if the slow is mitigated, resisted, or flat out immune) for clerics and druids, who are able to get a passive mana regen with a group buff that actually costs LESS mana, and gives more HP (and even mana regen) than Focus does.<br />
<br />
Compare - Blessing of the Nine, Focus of the Seventh<br />
<br />
Blessing of the Nine - causes Virtue to bounce, but, stack with Kazad's Mark, and who needs Virtue? - 1700 mana, lasts 1 hour, 40 minutes (base), includes 8/tick mana regen, and 618hp<br />
Focus of the Seventh - causes no druid/cleric buffs to bounce (except cleric self buff, but we aren't talking about healing clerics regularly here either), 1800 mana, lasts 1 hour, 20 minutes (base), and gives 544hp, 75 str and 70 dex (which, for most melee classes, at 65, is probably max, or close to)<br />
<br />
Blessing of the Nine lasts longer (20 minutes), costs less (100 mana) and includes a mana regen and more HP. Kazad's Mark (to make the combo better than Virtue) costs 1800 mana (700 less than Hand of Virtue, but lasts 1 hour 3 mins base for 910 straight HP). Focus adds 544 HP and if your target already had max dex/str... that's all it adds... 544HP, nothing more, at least Nine has mana regen on it... and more HP on top of that.<br />
<br />
Anyway, think I've bored everybody with enough numbers, but if it helps bring things around, more than willing to crunch more numbers. Unfortunately I'm on &quot;burnout&quot; status indefinitely (various reasons, up to an including, bored with LDoN and can't stand the sheer and utter boredom of raiding, leaving pretty much... fun outside EQ, simple as that) so if things change, may or may not see them.<br />
<br />
Forget about anything other than heals at this point. Verants response is we aren't united so we need to come up with one single thing to come back to them with. Current feelings on the board seems to be that our healing is the biggest thing that needs improving so anything else will just have to wait.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">With PoP, and especially with GoD, the game has been reduced entirely to tanking, quick healing, and quick damage dealing.*  Any class that sucks at all three of those sucks, period.

<br />
We aren't a tank class.  That leaves healing and damage.  We need to be substantially better EITHER at quick healing OR quick damage.  There is no division, just about every intelligent poster here has been saying that since mid-late PoP, and now everyone (except people saying that we are fine at all stages of the game because we own in upper guk groups) is saying it.  <br />

We ruled in the world where mobs had low damage output and high hitpoints.  That world has been replaced by super high damage output, low hit point mob models (and THANK GOD for that-we all know how much Luclin sucked).

It will be harder to justify increasing the output AND increasing the efficiency.<br />
<br />
If that's not high enough, bump it 75% to cost AND output, to 350 mana for 525 healing per tic. But bear in mind that the Clerics' Holy Elixir is 440 mana for 550 per tic.</div></div><hr />

Shamans are classified as priests, but if they cannot be relied on to fulfill their class role after all the debuffs go in, then there is something sorely lacking with the tools they have.  <br />
<br />
Balance is as much fairly distributing abilities among the classes as it is giving effective and useful tools for current content.  In direct healing, shamans lost out in both areas of balance.  No improved direct heal, and their current direct heal is not sufficient for level 65 GoD content. This observation does not only come from the shaman community, other classes are making this same observation.<br />

1700ish blast heal, upgrade to tnargs and some adjustment to BoT along the lines of 450-500ish hp/tick would suffice IMO.   There needs to be a gap between shaman and druid healing, it's just that it's grown too large and continuing to do so.</div></div><hr />

Mobs put out to much damage in such a short period in GoD and PoP that for our slows to be of value we need a fast casting unresistable slow.   Even if it gives us enough time to get of a regular tugur's.  <br />
<br />
Other thing is healing.  We need to be able to heal in a back up situation.  Hell, our heals won't even keep us up most of the time.  A fast casting good spot heal would be good enough, along with an upgrade to Q.  <br />
<br />
I think the main problem is though our aggro building.  To be effective we must be alive.  I think they had a good idea to give us the AA to reduce it.  Even if you got a good heal though, I wouldn't want to be relied upon as a main healer.  <br />
<br />
You cast of a slow and than start healing you are dead and than what good are you to a group.  <br />

There is no way in hell i'd want to be lumped with the 10 other DPS classes. And utility is for the dogs, very specific roles are obviously what SOE balances content around so we should be carving out a debuff (IE slows and maybe something new) and secondary healer position. I think we should be able to heal about 25% a heal, and fast. That means at the very least a 2k, and perhaps through an ancient spell 2.5k heal. With the new 500 hp AA for warriors coupled with new available augments they are hitting ungodly amounts of hps, and our heals should be able to keep up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">What is a Brenlo?<br />
<br />
This is actually quite a serious question because I cant really figure out what his job actually is and what his qualifications are. There is not much point in trying to communicating with him if he isnt the one at SOE that knows the most about what a shaman is. It sounds to me like he is some sort of general buffer/filter/screener so that the poor coders at SoE dont get too much work.<br />
<br />
I never understood - and still dont - why SOE dont appoint a single person to be a &quot;guru&quot; for one class that he or she knows intimately. This person could be anybody at SOE - their primary qualification for this job is that they KNOW what a shaman is (or a warrior or a cleric ....). And then give that person the job of regularily visiting the class-sites for that specific class.<br />
<br />
This doesnt mean &quot;our&quot; guru should visit here constantly and make tons of posts. It only means they have to read and hopefully understand what is being said. It dont think it has to be more than an hour or two each week to be able to pick up any hotly debated topics. And then SOE could schedule weekly class-meetings where all the gurus and Brenlo or whoever is actually in charge sit down and talk through the issues that each class is debating currently. Then they would be able to make some relevant decisions on both class-specific issues and general issues. <br />
<br />
If SOE wanted to be really proactive then Brenlo could make a weekly post about what had been discussed at these meetings. Just so we know that atleast something is going on based on all our discussions here.<br />
<br />
This is a far better structure than the one in place now where a generalist (Brenlo) filters out things he doesnt think are important and then present the rest to the people that really know something about the classes.<br />
<br />
PS. If more than one thing is broken SOE better fix them all. I see no reason why we have to limit our requests. If the people in charge at SOE are so sensitive that they cant accept constructive complaints then we have a bigger problem than we think. As for problems with GoD-spells then the points made by Ciele sounds like very resonable suggestions. When things are so clearly out of order as those are I see no point in adding on lots of numbers to make it even more obvious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">-snip-<br />
p.s.  Clerics actually get a Heal over time before shamans do - level 59 vendor Celestial Elixir (Kunark) ;p  While fixing the GoD shaman HoT would be a good idea to balance for effectiveness.   There is no reason to claim that shaman HoT should be the best HoT or even equivalent to cleric HoT due to precedence.<br />
Actually, clercs get access to their very first HoT, Celestial Health, at level 29, it was released at the same time the lower percent rezzes were handed out and the 90% rez was bumped down considerably in levels (old timers like me remember that rezzes were VERY rare in the mid 30s-50s, simply put you died, you ate it until they changed when exp rezzes were handed out). Further, they get access to Celestial Healing (handed out in Velious as a drop spell) at level 44. As far as Celestial Elixer goes, I am not 100% sure on when it came out as I didnt really pay much attention to cleric spells at that time.<br />
As far as time line wise though, Shaman were the first (at least in my recollection) to recieve a HoT, which at the time, was game breaking. <br />
We now get access to Stoicism at level 44 as well, which is in essence Celestial Healing with Torpor effects.<br />
We went from being really decent healers with that spell (as long sa your tank didnt mind the bad effects) to now were third rate at best. The game (and thus the vision) has changed, mobs no longer take 2 min to kill unless your solo, groups kill most pulls in 20 seconds or less; any more time and it really isnt considered efficient. In this world slow becomes less and less important, and it becomes even less important as mitigation becomes more and more common. Where do we stand with no real healing ability, something that as priests we should have, but sady due to our key ability, are shorted on.<br />
We now sit and look at our rather pathetic heals when LFG in a GoD zone or if we happen to be the only healer on a given Trial there and wonder what the heck were gonna do. Even with max heal AA's and Focus I cant really see a shaman being able to handle a 1200 hitter that quads and heavily mitigates slow with just Tnargs and Q (or even the new HoT). I know I wouldnt want to be such a shaman to be attempting it.<br />
I believe that changing the GoD spells as they stand now to something similar to Ciele suggested is really what sort of united and unifed front that we need to stand behind.<br />
Tnarg's is fine and dandy as it stands for a level 62 spell and for blast healing in lower end PoP zones and LDoN normals up to level 65. This is something that we can at least all agree upon and its something that we have all been able to do at one time or another. Go into BoT and serve as main healer for a group there and its still a possibilty, but becomes more dependant on AA and gear. Go into Tactics and suddenly its a job and you become a slave to the tnargs recast cycle that we all dread should there be a slow resist.<br />
I am no math wizard, I struggled through an undergrad physics and calc minor with a major in Bio and worked my ass off for it, so hard number crunching isnt what I can offer (I simply suck at it :p ). I can offer however a point of view as a non uber that does quite a bit higher end stuff...I do LDON hards, Tactics and now that I have GoD my semi regular groups are asking me to go there. I would be scared to death to try a GoD trial as main healer now...there are too many horror stories that have made me gun shy. I dont want to be gun shy. In 3 nearly 4 years of play I have never been gun shy nor have I run with my tail between my legs (well there was that time I camped out on a Dain raid, but what ya gonna do?).<br />
Cieles comments and suggestions were exactly what we need. Simply asking for an upgrade to our blast heal is only like sticking your finger in a leaky faucet...sure it keeps that annoying drip from bugging you, but eventually there will come a time that you have to take your finger out and you still have that drip. SOE needs to realize that we are not going to be placated with just one fix. We need major upgrades or changes in several areas. Brenlo either cant or wont see that and his statement and subsequent LOCKING of a thread shows that he doesnt really care to have it discussed. They either need to give us a major overhaul or just tell us to **** and live with what we have.<br />

<br />
1700ish blast heal, upgrade to tnargs and some adjustment to BoT along the lines of 450-500ish hp/tick would suffice IMO.   There needs to be a gap between shaman and druid healing, it's just that it's grown too large and continuing to do so.<br />
<br />
/agree 100%<br />
And I would rather a Direct heal than a 10 second CH type one. Shaman don't need to be in the CH rotation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">A shamans needs 3 things atm:<br />
<br />
1) A better direct heal. <br />
<br />
1800 with a 1 second cast time and a 5 second refresh for 600 mana. Take this as the model http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4894&amp;source=Test. <br />
This would help greatly with the issue of resisted slows. We could cast this to regain time for a second try without falling into the dreaded fast heal chain.<br />
<br />
2) A better Heal over Time. <br />
<br />
Shamans are hands down the ones casting Heal over Times more often than any other class in this game. Shamans were the first priest class to receive a HoT with Kunark. At the end of the beta in Kunark Shamans were the only class intended to have such a &quot;heal&quot;(a new way of healing). A few months later in an attempt to fix a cleric spell, their spell was &quot;temporarily&quot; changed to be a HoT till VI would come up with an idea about what to do with the spell. <br />
Our HoT should be on par with Holy Elixier(http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4882&amp;source=Test). Due to the drawbacks of Torpor, our spell was 33.3% more mana efficient. Breath of Trushar has no such limitations and thus it should be costing the same mana, period.<br />
<br />
3) A resist adjust to our DoTs.<br />
<br />
Trust me, if you have played a Shaman and have tried to go all out on damage, sooner or later you will get frustrated with the resist rate of our best damage source. Fights are already too short for DoTs, having to cast a debuff before hand and still have a 30% resist rate on many exp mobs, is unacceptable. We fall back to a 925 damage nuke that casts in 7.8 seconds.<br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
3) Higher durability(durability as in having a greater probability to live through fights by either handling the own aggro with certain abilities, avoiding to aggro alltogether or simply having tools to protect you from death or giving you a second chance). Basically, we are talking of defensive abilities.<br />
<br />
I have been playing this game since day 1. My Shaman was my first character and I bring 5 years of experience to this game. The durability of my Shaman with the best equip obtainable in this game currently, is incredibly too low. The Shaman's main role is to mitigate damage(through Slows and/or heals). We use both these tools, generating twice the hate.<br />
It's just reasonable that these tasks generate huge amounts of aggro, but every other class which is forced to generate incredible aggro performing their main task, has got the ability to &quot;escape&quot; death at one point or another.<br />
The Shaman has to be compared to 2 classes mainly. The Cleric(we are a priest class) and the Enchanter(they cast the one debuff that we are masters of and which plays a big part in our &quot;healing&quot; - SLOW.<br />
<br />
The Cleric have a vast selection of tools that make them 5 times as durable as a Shaman ranging from DA, DB, Bestow DA to Divine Arbitration(aggro less heal) and lastly the incredible Touch of the Divine AA.<br />
<br />
The Enchanter's defensive abilities come from runes(their fast casting Rune spells + the Instant casting Eldritch Rune AA are great and allows them to channel any spell easier since runes counter the pushing from hits as long as it's up). Doppelganger and Boggle(a spell that flat out erduces the current hate value by 500) are very useful abilities to ensure or increase the Enchanter's survivability.<br />
Pre-PoP the Shaman had a comparable durability using a non-mitigated slow(which allowed him to heal himself between swings) in conjunction with the difference AC and innate mitigation seemed to make at that level of NPCs dps ability. Today, the Shaman has nothing he can do to drop aggro other than hoping the tank will get a succesful taunt in. Even this doesn't work though, if the Shaman has a DoT or two running on this mob.<br />
<br />
To fix the Shaman class there's no way around the healing fix(point 1) and 2) and if you want the Shaman a desirable class again without infringing on anyone's abilities, you'd have to increase the Shamans durability and allow us to actually use our DoTs, which already generate unproportional aggro(the aggro part isn't Shaman specific). <br />
<br />
I could come up with an idea to increase a Shaman's survivability in groups and raids(I and others have done so and feel it's needed, if you decide to do a search, but I prefer not to in this thread to not divert from the main issue, which is essential, a fix to our HEALING.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">For the sake of a &quot;unified&quot; front (although I can't see how we could have been more unified than the &quot;proposal&quot;) I'm just agreeing with the spirit of most of the others here.<br />
<br />
Shamans need to be able to do somthing &quot;fast&quot; to be useful in fast paced fights.  I do not want a stronger 10 second CH.  I agree with most that the big CH's are the realm of Clerics and Druids.<br />
<br />
I want a fast single target heal, along the lines of what the druids have.  I am not asking for a better fast heal, even a fast heal that is as good, but tnargs just is not good enough.<br />
<br />
I would like to see our HoT increased to where it is useful again.  But I think that can wait.  (I am assuming that the shaman comunity will be lucky to get anything at all, let alone 2 things).  HoT spells in general are too slow for anythign but downtime healing (at least the weak shaman ones).  It would be nice to have a useful HoT spell (an upscaled Qui in the 400+ per tic hp range), but I'd rather see a better fast heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Bear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">HoTs take a buff slot that is the number one reason why i dont even bother to cast it anymore. people i group withtend to have full buffslots and if they dont have full then i rather cast FA on them then a HoT.<br />
Yes i am saying they dont even have room for Fa anymore at this point of games and all its click effects.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Giac,<br />
<br />
agree with 1) quick heal and 2) improved HoT.<br />
<br />
I disagree with your DoT suggestion though.<br />
<br />
Let's face it, DoTs have several inherent problems, we won't overcome any time soon: aggro issues, resists BUT most importantly the limited use of DoTs due to a faster and faster pace of gameplay and shorter encounters.<br />
<br />
my 3)<br />
<br />
3) update our DD lines, slap 100 - 300 damage on our final nukes Velium Strike and Spear of Torment and add a -20 - -40 resist modifier, increase mana costs slightly, they ARE already quite high.<br />
<br />
My point being: DPS via DDs is possibly easier to fix than DoTs. We are not wizards, but i personally don't care which way exactly we dish our damage, be it DoTs or nukes. And nukes will always be better usable in short encounters.<br />
<br />
Another point, someone remember those massive number crunching, that was done a while ago here on this board? I am terrible on maths, but maybe there is some raw material to use there? Can't find it atm :(.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Sciek hit the nail on the head.<br />
<br />
If we could just get one thing, I would ask for better direct fast 'patch' healing too, simply because we are a priest class. <br />
<br />
I don't mind being 'third' priest class, I just think we should be a damn sight closer to druids than paladins.<br />
<br />
This would be for the sole purpose of making shamans an effective BACKUP healer when grouping raiding. <br />
<br />
A fast 1700ish heal for 550ish mana (Tnarg cast time)<br />
BoT: 450 a tick for 300 mana<br />
<br />
This would go someway towards giving us a valid group contribution after sewers trials 1-4 as a Backup healer.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
If addressing GoD issues for shaman I would say these few tweaks:<br />
<br />
1/ make Chaotic pain more attainable for the common shaman. Remove it's ancient status.<br />
<br />
/2 remove our GoD disease DoT. Give us an ancient poison nuke or bane type DoT.<br />
<br />
/3 I dont think our 65 Nilhi slow should be less % than a hybrid's 65 slow /shrug<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
The Bigger picture:<br />
<br />
Stop marginilising the shaman class. We already are a slow paced class in a fast paced game, I don't see why we should pay double for everything we recieve.<br />
<br />
'You can't have good heals because you have slow.' - I still haven't figured out how to heal while casting malos/turgurs other than a premptive Q and charisma buff for DI. Then consider fast paced fights vs high DPS/low hp mobs(GoD), marginalise our already weak healing/DPS..<br />
<br />
'You can't have efficient heals because you have canni'. Again, how can I canni when chain casting Tnarg? or debuffing?, while all other healer/slower classes still gain their passive regen while chain casting<br />
<br />
Add to this we pay for inflated cost lesser duration buffs, which are marginalised by stat capped players. In the stat capped world, we only really offer focus and FA. I buff charisma more than any other stat buff (for DI)....and thats a 59 KUNARK spell ;)<br />
<br />
Anyway, enough blathering from me. Fix heals and I'd be happier, make chaotic pain attainable to non quarm+++ shaman I'd be happier. <br />
<br />
I don't want to be a demi-god class; I have spent the last 3.5 years playing my shaman as a main (I don't do alts..), I would just like to continue contributing to the game rather than having my class kicked from under me ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Tappion Zek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Personally with the way things are going, i think they should do this (and the %'s don't = % based heals, just amount healed)<br />
<br />
Paladins = 25%<br />
Shamans = 50%<br />
Druids = 75%<br />
Clerics = 100%<br />
<br />
Now i know a few of you will say &quot;Why are paladins as close to us as we are to druids&quot;. Well mainly that's due to the fact that paladins don't have the mana pools, types of healing spells, or the correct AA's (SCM) to sustain or be used as a main healer, so it's not directly related to this idea.<br />
<br />
Basically mobs need to not be stripping the damage healers can heal as fast as they are at the moment. That's what causes clerics to be the only true healer. Unfortunately there is no way we will be a &quot;main&quot; healer, so i think that it really does have to focus on our ability to put down fast patch heals (pretty much like paladins only much more potent).<br />
<br />
No idea if that makes sense, it's late and i'm tired.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Mob damage greatly scaling up means healing has to greatly scale up, to keep up, or it will fall behind and change for the worse the contribution of the healer classes and perhaps the balance between them, if not the balance of the entire game.  For shamans, healing has not kept up.  Their healing contribution has become severely marginalized, and the balance among the alternate healers has changed dramatically.<br />
<br />
Encounters with mobs speeding up because their hitpoints are so low and their die relatively quickly, narrowing the window of opportunity to put DPS and debuffs in on them, means you have to adjust player abilities accordingly, or balance again will suffer.  <br />
<br />
Shamans still are the kings of slow in more ways than one.  Almost every spell we have casts very slowly.  Adjusting our slow heal probably will have little effect because part of it's problem is simply that it's slow, regardless of how much or little it is.<br />
<br />
On the offensive front, we have a few problems as well.  <br />
<br />
1) With mobs dying quickly, the slow-casting DOTs we have are minor contributors at best, since they often have no chance of lasting for their full duration.  <br />
<br />
2) Significantly, shamans have so many other things to worry about -- malos, slow, spot healing -- that getting a chance to have a DOT last long enough to do the damage it was designed for is even less that it would appear.  Other DOT'ers, with good aggro control, can land DOTs fairly quickly.  A shaman has a lot of things to do first. This makes the ability to do damage with DOTs much less than it really might appear on paper.<br />
<br />
3)  High resist rates on DOTs(on our DD rains too, don't forget), combined with the fact that shamans have to do other things before they can worry about DPS anyway, means failure rates on DOT casts can push the potential DPS that DOTs bring to the shaman class even further away from panning out in actual play.  By the time malos and slow and perhaps a spot heal go through, and then a failure to land a DOT go through, a DOT that subsequently lands can have a very small chance of doing anywhere near its full measure of damage.  By this time the idea of DOTs doing much damage begins to drift into the very theoretical indeed.<br />
<br />
Theoretically, it's nice to have a DOT that does reasonable damage but takes two minutes to do it.  Or even ones that are, thank goodness, a little faster.<br />
<br />
But in actual play, the theory frays around the edges pretty severely, for the reasons noted above.  Think about how long the chain is that can lead to the ability to land the first DOT (malos, slow, perhaps a spot heal and/or perhaps a failure of the DOT to land even a single time).  By then, the time that has passed can make old ways of looking at shaman DOTs outdated.  Certainly you can forget the disease line entirely.  If the mob is due to be dead in 20 more seconds, what's the point really of using any DOT?  Even the best we've got or the best the game is ever likely to give us?<br />
<br />
That leaves us with a pet as DP or our DD's.  <br />
<br />
The pet is cute, but he gets ripped apart pretty quickly(just a whack or two in GoD and not much different in PoP) and his damage is pretty minor.<br />
<br />
Our DD's face the same problem as any spell-based DPS we can do -- we have other things to do first, that are more important, and need time before we can even consider DPS, so it's a big maybe what value any of our potential DPS has anyway.  Our rains are okay, but rains have limited value; mezzing and not wanting to break roots keep them that way and always will.  Our DD's that aren't rains, well...they could sure use a little work.  When we finally do get a chance to use them...wow they're pretty stinky. <br />
<br />
These days, unless I get a chance to do a rain, I feel like my DPS contribution is slight to none.  And -- resists are fairly high on rains, too.<br />
<br />
Which might even be fine, if our heals got some help.  We don't necessarily need everything, but as it stands, we clearly need to be able to contribute more.<br />
<br />
Adding in so much slow mitigation or outright unslowable mobs, and even the one thing we can unassailably offer and be the best at(even though by a small margin) -- our slows -- has been greatly devalued, if not outright made often entirely irrelevant.<br />
<br />
So our heals, slows, and DPS have been greatly diminished(at best) in comparison to the standard mob and standard mob encounter these days.<br />
<br />
It would be extraordinary, then, that we should not complain.  That would be asking for superhuman -- let's call it bovine, shall we -- grace and restraint on the part of what after all are merely humans, not to mention paying customers, some of whom have invested truly incredible amounts of time (and money) in playing the game.<br />
<br />
It would be valuable if we would make some clear points that could be used to start to rethink our class, and it seems more than fair to say that we have.<br />
<br />
Addressing these problems and doing something to fix them would be a fair response.  <br />
<br />
Especially considering the extraordinary amount of time and money many players have put into the game thus far.  They have certainly earned fair consideration as valuable customers, and a high percentage of them will likely remain doggedly loyal if they feel their problems are adequately and fairly addressed.  EQ is not a game where the average customer flits in and out, millions coming and rapidly going, to be replaced by an endless supply of other millions of customers.  It's a game with devoted core constituencies who need to be satisfied over a long period of time.  Their problems do indeed need to be looked at with vigorous and concerted attention on a regular basis.  <br />
<br />
This board has given some very good and logical starting points for Sony to do just that with the problems of the shaman class.  And, the shaman customer.  Unless they want to design slows out of the game entirely, or just let enchanters or beastlords handle them, it would be wise not to let things slip so far with shamans, or people will find little reason to play them, and simply either leave the game, sometimes taking several accounts with them, or play some other class.  <br />
<br />
Sony needs to remember to design things so we still have a reason to play, and play every class.  Unslowable mobs and slows that only partially stick are crippling enough to a class whose main point is slowing mobs, butslow-casting spells, some with a high resist rate and some that do damage only very slowly, and small slow acting heals in a game that is all about fast encounters with large damage spikes clearly goes over the top as a mismatching of class abilities to the new realities of the game -- a mis-design of the class at present.<br />
<br />
We need the class to match the game, or where is the motivation to play it in the first place?  It being the class, the game -- or both?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Otoole Frostypants</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">So what i challange to this community is a unification for upgrades.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Cause we ARE unified with a concern right now, we are not all worried about a new FA, we arent worried about stat buffs, we have ALL focus on 1 central issue which is healing and we have been hovering around a means to fix this, but we have just not fully unitied.<br />
<br />
Litgruv,<br />
<br />
The central issue in gameplay right now is not just how well we can HEAL. It is a big deal and has been for some time. However, the central issue in gameplay right now is the rate at which encounters take place. Encounters are SHORT. That's the issue. Shaman bring very little to the table where short term fights are concerned. For that reason, heals and damage should be our concern.<br />
<br />
If we centralize our ENTIRE concern around our ability to heal and nothing more, then we trap ourselves into the patch healer role with nothing more to do than occasionally hit a heal spell and then canni back the mana. If we can't add anything to the damage dealt in the short term encounter, we will end up whining about that in a few months. <br />
<br />
We have to open our eyes a bit and see the big picture. Yes, our healing ability is a concern. But if we honestly pigeonhole our &quot;issue&quot; into that one alone...I see a big problem stemming from that as well.<br />
<br />
I remember the days when clerics hated being clerics. That was Kunark. They were NEEDED in encounters but all they could do was heal and then sit and med. Stand, heal, med. BORING! They asked to be battle clerics. Now, look at them. They fight and heal. Good for them. It's more fun that way. I don't want to be a cleric. I don't want to be a tank. I want to be of use: In more ways than one.<br />
<br />
I hope you understand what I mean. If you've played this game since the days of Antonica/Faydwer/Odus only--then you have seen how the changes have effected each group along the way. I've been around that long. I have seen how we have grown and how we have atrophed.</div></div><hr />

Cause we ARE unified with a concern right now, we are not all worried about a new FA, we arent worried about stat buffs, we have ALL focus on 1 central issue which is healing and we have been hovering around a means to fix this, but we have just not fully unitied.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Otoole: you have a good point, but im just trying to say if we dont focus on something then everything will spiral into a &quot; i want i want i want&quot; thread and if we present 10 changes it shows we arent unified on what we want and will continue to get nothing. We have now heard back from a SoE rep that has mentioned this fact and we all know that shaman have unification issues in general cause we are pretty broad in out options of playing style.<br />
<br />
<br />
Slowing and Heals are good, but nukes and DoT and Buffs are putting too much info in one spot. We have attention and i think we need a focused and precise means of attack, for lack of a better term. Thats the idea behind this thread</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Otoole Frostypants</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">Understood, Lit. You have a valid argument as well. I think we are so happy to have someone respond to us that we don't know what to focus on as well.<br />
<br />
I AGREE. :)<br />
<br />
I hope you will look a the post I just started that points out how the game is similar to how it USED to be in it's incarnation--when we all liked the game. The EQ gaming community claimed that EQ was &quot;broken&quot; the moment Kunark went live and we never stopped bitching as a whole since that moment. hehe.<br />
<br />
They have given us more RAID content and we bitched about it. They have given us more SINGLE GROUP content and we have bitched about it. They have give us more things to DO and we whine incessently. Not just Shaman--EVERYONE.<br />
<br />
So, now that the game is a little more like it USED TOBE--albeit on steroids--we should RETURN to the role we used to have:<br />
<br />
Main Debuff<br />
Moderate Healing<br />
Little Damage<br />
<br />
That's how we were designed at the onset and that is where we need to return. That's how the game is built NOW. See what I mean?<br />
<br />
I don't want to be a master at damage dealing. I don't want to be a main healer. I don't even want to be the master at soloing. I just want to be able to round out any group make-up LIKE I USED TO when I made Otoole to begin with. Shaman USED to take an average group make up and make them better...that is what bards and shaman used to bring to the table. If I could do that again I'd be pleased as punch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">The problem is, we're not just deficient in one single area. The game<br />
pace has become much faster then Shamans were designed for. Our<br />
strengths were many as a &quot;jack of all trades&quot; but each trade has<br />
fallen behind. <br />
<br />
<br />
o Debufs - Slow used to be great, but now is mitigated. This skill has<br />
   been mitigated. <br />
<br />
o Bufs - When stats are maxed due to gear, bufs aren't as benificial.<br />
   Unless we get bufs that can go beyond the stat caps, this trade<br />
   has been mitigated.<br />
<br />
o Heals - Mobs are hitting harder; we cast too slow, and don't heal <br />
   enough to keep up. <br />
<br />
o Damage - Dot's used to be great, but now mobs don't last long enough<br />
   for the total damage to be done. Our nukes don't do enough damage.<br />
   Rains are what I used most of the time for damage, but you have to<br />
   be careful of hitting unintended targets. <br />
<br />
I'm willing to let bufs and debufs go, but we need to be upgraded in<br />
two areas: quick healing and quick damage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What I mean is, if the cast time was lowered and and the resist check improved for the debuff category...would you be willing to be a main debuff again? If there were a better ATK buff granted to us because stat caps are the ceiling, would you be happy as a buffer?<br />

This is a very valid question, and honestly, I am not sure I can answer it just now. Speaking for myself, when I first created my shaman, my ROLE was buffs, and debuffs, almost exclusively. Some DOT damage, but mainly, it was buffing and debuffing. Very little healing, very little damage overall. However, the pace of the game has changed so dramatically that I am not sure that this is a viable role anymore. I mean, if I am in a strong LDoN group, on normal, I don't even bother slowing the primary target. I slow the adds, and VP-root, and keep FA up on everyone, but I usually ignore the primary mob, it just dies too fast. <br />
<br />
Litgruv, I agree that we need to keep ourselves focused as a community, but honestly, if we ONLY get a slightly better fast heal, say, something in the 1750 range, is this going to be enough to make us semi-desirable in Gates? I doubt it. However, a bit bigger heal and a bit bigger nuke would allow us to contribute more. I use SoT in LDoN (using this as comparison, due to the &quot;speed&quot; of the battles there) because honestly half the time I try to cast VS, the mob is a) already dead or b) too close to dead for it to hit full. SoT casts faster, so I can usually squeeze one off after I slow adds, VP something, Bane it, and turn back the primary fighting area. Now, I have not played in Gates much, but its my understanding the fights are of a similar pace. If thats the case, then we NEED something more than a semi-effective heal to contribute.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">Agreed, now that brenlo is posting/has posted i think we are all feeling such elation at finaly having some interaction, that we want to go a lil nuts but...<br />
<br />
This is what im thinking.<br />
<br />
As for concerns, the first I will pass along is healing. I will see if this is what is intended or if there was an oversight. As soon as I know, you will know.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think he stated it pretty clear in Hen's thread that the way things are being handled are 1 issue at a time. So i still think its wise to focus on 1 thing, get it corrected then give thanks and see what else is needed and move on to that. I think its wise to curb our desire to blurt out everything we want like a school boy on his first real date with long desired woman. Trust me, im feeling it too, seeing brenlo post here give you one of those real life hopeful smiles. <br />
<br />
<br />
Now you say that a new fast heal isnt enough and that we need a nuke. Well to bring it around full circle, how about a real upgrade to our HoT and our fast casting  blast heal to take our healing to a level that will let us heal about as effectivly as we did in PoP ?<br />
<br />
Again, im not a numbers cruncher, more of a dreamer and direction pointer, but i think this is a acceptable start. No one is saying its the end all be all of class correction but its a start. Brenlo has spoken his words and you can chose to gain hope from it or think he is paying lip service. Im laying down my hope and believeing. They are listening and as long as we dont drive them away, there is no reason to believe they will go away.<br />
<br />
Just think about whats going on here, think about how the druids and BST's benifieted from a friendly and focused interaction with Absor. This could be the start of the same kinda thing, but now with us and brenlo.<br />
<br />
Trust to hope and time and lets see how it goes. in the mean time, stay on focus, one issue at a time. <br />

<br />
Sure, I'd be open to considering it. People have much better gear now <br />
and hit harder, mobs just don't last very long. I'd LOVE to be main <br />
debuffer again, but what would be effective? An all-in-one debuf that <br />
slowed and crippled, extreemly hard to resist, and fast casting (with fast<br />
recast time)? That would be considered valuable by groups, but I don't <br />
think Sony would be willing to give us something that effective. Yet, <br />
that's what it would take to make debuffing valuable again. Debuffing <br />
has to be done very quickly to be effective at this fast pace. <br />
<br />
As far as bufs, well with mobs going down faster, what do people really<br />
need? More hit points and the ability to avoid or mitagate mob<br />
damage. I think defensive bufs would be much more valuable then <br />
offensive bufs. Anything that would speed up the fight, would just<br />
eat into the effectivness of our debufs. <br />
<br />
Sure, I'd be open to bufs and debuffs. I never wanted to be a great<br />
healer, just a competent one. Really, all four issues should be addressed.<br />
The versatility is why I chose the Shaman class. However it seems we'd<br />
be lucky to get two areas looked at right now, and healing &amp; nuking<br />
seem to be getting the most attention.</div></div><hr />

I fear that if they fix just one issue, they'll think &quot;We just took care of<br />

got his attention, let's explain what we see needs to be done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">I could agree with Ciele too.  Simple changes most related to the new expansion sound reasonable.<br />
<br />
Beyond that this thread is once again degenerating into people's unreasonable personal desires that aren't unified and are often bordering on crack fantasies.<br />
<br />
Whatever you suggest, it should be something that empowers and pacifies the higher tier shaman (I'm very far from fitting that category) that feel lacking without unbalancing the lesser (normal/high LDoN / BoT level planes / etc) shaman (me) who have no justifiable complaint at our stage of shaman evolution and without turning shaman into godmode soloists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">I find it pretty funny when a) brenlo says the shamans aren't united, b) shamans make a post about how united we are, and c) in the 3 pages that follow on this post, the shaman community bashes brenlo, talks about buffs, dots, agro, heals, and nukes, all as things we need.<br />
<br />
Anyways...<br />
<br />
Looking at the previous fast heals, we have:<br />
Cleric: Supernal Light (2750 hp, 600 mana, 3.75 cast) 4.58 hp healed/1 mana.<br />
Druid: Nature's Infusion (1750 hp, 500 mana, 3.75 cast) 3.5 hp healed/1 mana.<br />
Shaman: Tnarg's Mending (1300 hp, 450 mana, 3.75 cast) 2.88 hp healed/1 mana.<br />
<br />
Looking at the new fast heals in GoD, we have:<br />
Cleric: Holy Light (3050 hp, 660 mana, 3.75 cast) 5.30 hp healed/1 mana.<br />
Druid: Sylvan Infusion (1925 hp, 550 mana, 3.5 cast) 3.5 hp healed/1 mana.<br />
Shaman: Erny's Mending ??????<br />
<br />
<br />
Mathematically, a Shaman's Tnarg's healed ~47% as much as a Cleric's Supernal Light, and ~75% as much as a Druid's Nature's Infusion.  A Druid's Nature's Infusion was ~64% as effective as a Cleric's Supernal Light.<br />
<br />
Now in GoD, a Druid's Sylvan Infusion is still ~64% as effective as a Cleric's Holy Light.  Along these same lines, assuming that our new heal should still be ~47% as effective as a Cleric's Holy Light, and ~75% as effective as a Druid's Sylvan Infusion, then our new heal should heal for approximately 1435 hp.  Given that the mana ratio's for the most part remained the same on the new spells, with the exceptions of the cleric's, our new heal should then cost us ~500 mana.<br />
<br />
<br />
IN SUMMATION:<br />
IF we are going to contend that our healing power should remain in line with these numbers, our new heal will be:  Erny's Mending: (1435 hp, 500 mana, 3.75 cast) 2.88 hp healed/1 mana.  With these numbers, we maintain the status quo of healing ~75% as much as a Druid and ~47% as much as a Cleric.<br />
<br />
IF we ask for a 1600 hp heal, using these mana ratios, it will look like this:  Erny's Mending (1600 hp, 556 mana, 3.75 cast) 2.88 hp healed/1 mana.  BUT with a 1600 hp heal, Shamans now heal ~83% as well as Druids now and ~52% as well as Clerics.<br />
<br />
IF we ask for a 1700 hp heal, using these mana ratios, it will look like this:  Erny's Mending (1700 hp, 590 mana, 3.75 cast) 2.88 hp healed/1 mana.  BUT with a 1700 hp heal, Shamans now heal ~88% as well as Druids now and ~56% as well as Clerics.<br />
<br />
IF we ask for an 1800 hp heal, using these mana ratios, it will look like this:  Erny's Mending (1800 hp, 625 mana, 3.75 cast) 2.88 hp healed/1 mana.  BUT with an 1800 hp heal, Shamans now heal ~94% as well as Druids now and ~59% as well as Clerics.<br />
<br />
<br />
Given that we would only be receiving a new fast heal, and not a complete heal, going with an 1800 hp heal would not be as overpowering as these numbers suggest.  Since we're not looking to take over main healer duties, with an 1800 hp heal, we would now at least be effective as a backup/secondary healer when things become shoddy.  <br />
<br />
AMONG THE FOUR SELECTIONS ABOVE, WHICH ONE DO YOU VOTE FOR?<br />
<br />
I vote for Erny's Mending (1800 hp, 625 mana, 3.75 cast) 2.88 hp healed/1 mana.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps from his perspective, when he's asking for the shaman community to decide upon ONE thing that could be improved, he sees lists of many items and the ranting of some as a lack of unity:<br />
<br />
c) in the 3 pages that follow on this post, the shaman community bashes brenlo, talks about buffs, dots, agro, heals, and nukes, all as things we need.<br />

<br />
I agree here BUT<br />
Until we know what vision SoE has for the shaman class we do not know what is reasonable.<br />
<br />
As example if they see us as a debuff class than an upgrade to the slow/malo lines are reasonable,<br />
If they see us as a healer then an upgrade to our heals is reasonable,<br />
If they see us as.................Well you get the picture.<br />
<br />
That alone is why it is so important to know what vision SoE has, as we all know that every shaman out there uses his spellset in a slighty different way and thus has his/her priorities in a different way organized.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">So you're telling me that some developer who is obviously having problems developing is going to tell me what his vision is of MY shaman?  Are you kidding me?<br />
<br />
Look at the class today...The fact that it is so muddled right now should give you a clear idea of what THEIR vision is.  If you wait for Sony to act, you will be supremely disappointed because nothing will change.<br />
<br />
Not only do we pay the bills, but we are Sony's greatest asset.  A very very vocal group of people who are constantly testing the class.  Sony doens't define my shaman, I define my shaman.<br />
<br />
And by presenting a unified front, WE define what high end shamans need to survive in higher end content.  And by looking at the poll showing who reads these forums, the majority of us are all level 65 with a good amount of aa and flags.  Speaking about higher end issues, WE should be defining clearly what it is WE need.  And by looking at the polls, we need a FAST potent heal.<br />
<br />
Look at the numbers I posted, pick one, and then lets bore it into Brenlo's head so he knows which one we all want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">Erny,<br />
This is not a flame or an attack but an explanation.<br />
<br />
What you say is simple and would have been true before GoD.<br />
At that point in time we knew all the encounters, we knew what to expect and we could draw the conclusions.<br />
However currently we do not have all that info and so we need  some input about the way SoE sees our role.<br />
We can only asume how the GoD end zone will look and what is needed to survive there, As wild speculation it could be that casting a true north lets the final boss fall down and hands us his loot.<br />
<br />
Also remember that while you have a vision on what your shaman needs so does every other shaman out there.<br />
And those views are not all the same, so we need this input and based on that we can agree with it and decide what we want or we can disagree and talk to them about why that vision is wrong.<br />
<br />
And maybe we need a fast new heal, maybe mages need a better nuke, maybe class x needs action y OR maybe some encounters need a bit of tuning and we need a whole different set of tools to stay a fun class to play.<br />
<br />
I do agree that what i have seen till now a new heal is a must</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">1800 Heal sounds fair but no other CH type heal.<br />

<br />
And even then if we had completly converted Brenlo over to our side guess what. <br />
<br />
He cannot make any sort of change. He is simply a conduit. Not the actual people who will make the descision. <br />
<br />
So he can honestly go to a dev and say. Hey. I got this from shaman. they want a new heal.. And do you want anything from Mc Donalds I am heae there...<br />
<br />
And guess what Not a damn thing will change. (And if you think I am implying that it is a subservient role that he is going to get lunch. Not at all. I get lunch for the guys at my work alot. Cause I am out. (Plus I get to pick where I am going)<br />
<br />
The chances of actually making an impact and truly getting A dev behind us to make changes are slim. Shaman have never really been a class they care about. Utility/ buff debuff roles are not sexy. We are not the rockstars in the group. We are the lineman. We make the game good for everyone else and until we are gone they will never know what they are missing. <br />
<br />
Brenlo once said in jest &quot;What's a shaman&quot;<br />
<br />
Well to that I tend to think. &quot;Whatever we need to be to get the job done.&quot;<br />
<br />
But sadly with the hyper inflation of the combat and DPS requirements we are the 8 tracks of Norrath. Damn good sounding. But obsolete. <br />
<br />
We are not portable enough anymore. And too expensive in the long run to maintain. <br />
<br />
Me for one. I am not happy about being on the pile with Betamax. An records. And Video disks. And 5 1/4 floppys. and 8 tracks... But that is where we are. <br />
<br />
Still functional and even loved by a few hardcore belivers. But in the long run, the run of the shaman is one of the past.<br />
<br />
So please excuse me while I am pissed off and grumpy about those damn kids that are on my lawn again, with thier warders and Super charmed pets crapping all over my crabgrass.<br />

Did you hear &quot;MGB Holy Elixir inc&quot; or &quot;DA / CR used&quot; or &quot;MGB SotW inc&quot;? And even beside raids I know lot of clerics using HoTs as a pre-heal on pullers or to cover AE / reposite / DoTs.<br />
<br />
Back to the topic. Shamans got left behinde over so many expansions now that is realy hard to focus on only 1 point that needs an improvment.<br />
<br />
If I have to choose I will pick healing too.<br />
<br />
A spot heal for 1700-1900HPs sounds good. But either 3.75sec with a hp / mana ratio only slighly worse then the druid on or a very fast (aka 1.5sec) with a longer recast time and the same hp / mana ratio as TM has (hey, I need time to get my mana back with canni!).<br />
<br />
A 300HP / tick HoT is really godly in trival content but doesn't cut anymore in EP+ / GoD. A now HoT (or upgraded Q / BoT)  for 450-500HP / tick for 400-450 mana sounds good for me. But please put the casting time to about 4sec. You know: I need time to use canni.<br />
<br />
To the general point of view of shamans: Tonight I couldn't sleep and decided to solo in PoF. I killed 10 or 11 mobs at castle 1. And about 35-40% if my Bane spells were resisted! Yes, I used malosinia. I got 1 resist on turgur and 2 resist on malosinia (after malos). No paralyzing earth was resisted (nor pox / BoU / BoS). I know the sample isn't long enough to say much but 1 out of 3 resisted banes amde me realy think about it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">As far as what shaman want, I read the huge thread on the old Newbie Zone, as did others on the team and there were no conclusions. I also read many of the threads on the Shamans Crucible. What I saw was a lot of ,the grass is greener, and class envy. One email, from a prominent shaman even stated, we don't know what we want, we just want something. That's not much information to go on.<br />
<br />
Why should the player figure out what needs to be done with the shaman class? SoE broke it over the last years, now figure out what to do to fix it. We the shaman community can give out ideas and hints, throw some numbers up to help you guys do it, but in the end you are payed to do your daily job. If you still think after so many valueable complains that the shaman class is fine, leave us at we are and see where we get to. Very lame excuse you SoE guys.<br />

Even here in this thread, I see division among shaman players, where what some perceive to be broken, others think is just fine. You ask for statements and communication, while it is hard to comment when the message you are receiving is not unified and for the record the &quot;What's a shaman&quot; comment was meant as a joke.<br />
<br />
You ask for a 'unified voice of the shaman community'. But do you really know what you are asking for? That's like asking for a unified idea how to get rid of all hunger and suffering in the real world. There will always be different opinions.<br />
We have so many shamans at different stages of the game, why do you expect us to have all the same wishes? All we can do is give you examples, hints, tips which are backed up by good arguments. You then have to filter those and measure them.<br />
<br />
Sorry, but you SoE guys really freak me out ...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">Druids can do more than heal. Its suprising how no one wants to recognize nuke, dots, snare, evac, root, charm, superior HP buff w mana regen(when no one needs stat buffs), spells which land easier (omg built in malos++!) and the exact same utility spells we offer. Oh wait... we can summon no rent bags $$<br />
<br />
Giving us healing ability CLOSER to theirs wont ruin the game. 1700 heal, upgrade BoT to 450/500 a tic, and lower its cast time to 3 or 4 seconds.  Remember, we cant do both at the same time. Until they give shamans an AA ability that lets us cast 2 weak spells at once, huge versatility is rather pointless.<br />
<br />
In GoD fights, a tank will die if a shaman has to heal. Its just a matter of dps'ing it down before it eats through his HP, since the tank loses them faster than we can restore them. I would like to change that. My healing should do more than prolong somone's death, it should keep them alive.<br />
<br />
HoT's wont solve the problem. Even at 600 a tic, the mob is gonna hit for 2-3k before the next tic lands. Hardly the healing solution we need. COMBINED with a good fast heal, and we'd prolly be ok.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u79"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p79">The way I see it, Brenlo is a little fish. Talking to him will accomplish nothing. It's like talking to a baroque facemask. What we need to do is find out who the big fish is, and try and establih a direct link with them, bypassing the figurehead entirely and skipping over to someone with pull.<br />
<br />
And yes, heals are the way to go. In zones like Vxed, Tipt, Kod'Taz, etc... our slows don't really land in time to be as useful as they were, and Tnargs won't mitigate one swing of a round from some MoBs. We're reduced to hoping our heals make a difference, or spamming the caster that is running around in circles for dear life.</div></div><hr />

You're borderline rude here. In fact, you are just absolutely rude. Brenlo is the person SoE employs to talk to their userbase. As far as little fish go, its a pretty empowering position. Do not try and poison threads with your myopic viewpoint.<br />
<br />
What we have asked for, and talked to death about, on these boards was for SoE representation to swing by. We finally have that. Perhaps you might want to save your 7th post for something with a little more civility towards Brenlo, and any other SoE folks that come here.</div></div><hr />

I canclled my account last week its still active for 2 more months, but I for one have had it. I play my Shaman as my main and Warrior as an alt both have gotten the shaft. The threat worked for warriors but I am just sick of the game sony plays.<br />
<br />
I may come back if things get fixed but for now Im done.</div></div><hr />

To me, spot heals are where druids should do better than shamans, but we do have HoT.  I don't want to compete with them in their arena.<br />

<br />
Our problems are with short term healing and with simply keeping people alive. Doubling someone's natural healing for a couple of ticks will not help us to keep them alive.</div></div><hr />

Why are you buying into the idea it's their arena?  <br />
<br />
Jeez, we used to heal AS good as druids with direct heals - absent mana pool issues.  We never got a hot until Torpor at 60 during Kunark, and it was pretty limited.  <br />
<br />
I can accept, grudgingly, some disparity now but to write off direct heal power this way is pathetic.   <br />
<br />
Newer shaman have some odd ideas about our role.  Let me tell you my view:  buffing was the least of it.  A necessary evil along with the good stuff.</div></div><hr />

I don't want to be the main healer for the group, nor do I think that's the role of the shaman post 60.  That's my opinion, and I think I'm entitled to it without getting flamed by you.<br />

That about those 150HP per tick was a joke right?<br />
<br />
If not you may want to reconsider before posting, I value that you have an own independant opinion but do not come here and tell us that we are fine when we can heal 150hp per tick for our groups.<br />
<br />
How is that gonna keep the tank alive? (remember that guy in plate standing in front of that angry mob)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I said &quot;or something&quot;.  It was a hypothetical need for a group version of Q, but I never thought about the exact numbers for hp/tick heal.<br />
<br />
IMHO, our job is to slow the mob and debuff them.  That's one way to keep the tank (** edit was mob **) alive.  It is the job of the healer (druid/cleric) to keep him alive.<br />
<br />
If you want to be the super class to slow, buff, debuff, heal, go ahead.  I merely gave a suggestion for a group Q.  The details can be worked out later if this is even feasible.<br />

Sorry I now see where I went wrong.<br />
I must have spend the last few years in EQ with the wrong impression that I was actually a HEALER.<br />
Completely my mistake, I will bow for your wisdom and leave the area now so you can have the stand all for yourself.<br />
<br />
And I promise you that I am gonna work on the part where I have to keep the mob alive, It will be next to the part where I can slow time itself. Man I will be so powerfull when i learn those neat tricks.</div></div><hr />

So basically you are saying we should undo slow mitigation (and slow immuneness) in a more complicated way then just getting rid of it?<br />
<br />
No thanks. Slow mitigation by itself is not a bad thing - zonewide slow mitigation on single group encounters is.<br />
<br />
Slow mitigation on raids is fine.<br />
Slow mitigation on nameds is fine.<br />
Slow mitigation on a few percent of the MOBs ina zone is fine.<br />
<br />
What breaks slow is huge amounts of slow mitigation, especially of the harsher types. What breaks shaman is huge amounts of slow mitigation coupled with short fights.<br />
<br />
Any blanket removal or part removal of slow mitigation at this state of the game is going to break so many encounters you might as well redesign entire expansions.<br />
<br />
This is much easier solved by adjusting shaman healing and redesigning the few zones where slow mitigation has been overused. These zones need a reexamination for stuff like knight tanking anyways.</div></div><hr />
