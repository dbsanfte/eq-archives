<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Orgak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering what the proven method is for slowing planes mobs.  I made my first visit to PoN last night and noticed that those mobs really really (did I mention really?) hate being slowed.  In the beginning, I was slowing immediately after the melees engaged.  Almost every time, the mob went straight for me.  Then I figure I'll wait until the mobs take some damage and the MT generates a decent amount of aggro before I slow.  Well, the group didn't like that idea because the cleric was always oom by the time the fight was over.  So, I went back to slowing immediately and taking a few hits every fight.  This of course, made it more difficult on the MT to maintain aggro.  Oh, and we had SK's in group, so I had their neat little anti-aggro buff on me the whole time.  Thoughts on this?<br />
<br />
Secondly, if my slows were resisted, the chanter in the group would land his slow.  Is my slow so much better than a chanter's that I should still try to get my slow to stick even after they land theirs (overwriting their slow)?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

2) Then Epic DoT. <br />
3) Slow.<br />
<br />
By the time the Epic cast is complete, the tank will have enough aggro that it stays on him/her when slow is cast..</div></div><hr />

Here's how I do it.  It isn't perfect, it probably isn't even smart sometimes, but it works for me when grinding exp.  Raid mini-bosses or named are handled differently.  This method requires Torpor &amp; Malo to be effective.<br />
<br />
Preparation:<br />
Two simple hotkeys setup to /assist Puller &amp; /assist Maintank.<br />
I force the puller to announce his/her incoming.  &quot;Inc %t&quot; is all I really need.<br />
<br />
Action:<br />
1.  On the incoming mesage, I hit my puller assist key.  I spam click it until a target shows up in window.<br />
1a. If the puller announces adds or is intentionally pulling multiples, I automatically cast Torpor on myself at this point.  (Torpor is hotkeyed with a &quot;Torporing %t&quot; message btw.)<br />
<br />
2.  Spam click Malo until the mob is in casting range.  The aggro on this is extremely mild, and if it is a warrior tanking, his arrow shots on incoming will overcome the Malo aggro.  (If the warrior didn't bring arrows &amp; the group has no access to free ones, expect to have initial aggro.)  With Paladin/SK tanks, this isn't even an issue.  <br />
<br />
3.  Cast Slow with Turgur's as soon as your gems refresh.  Note, on most pulls, this will have Turgur's landing or resisting right as the mob enters the camp.  With a good paladin/SK tank, the aggro still goes right to them if slow lands the first try because they are stunning, casting Darkness, etcetera on the mob as it is incoming as well.<br />
<br />
4.  Towards the middle or end of casting Turgur's (step 3), /pet attack.  Sending in the dog at this point will generally position him on the opposite side of the tank, which is what I want so he avoids enrage damage, and saves the tank from having to flip (which they generally won't do just for a shaman pet anyway).<br />
<br />
(If slow is resisted, I go one of two routes, usually dependent on the tank's class &amp; my trust in the primary healer.)<br />
<br />
5a.  With a Warrior tanking, I Torpor myself before casting Turgur's again.  (While casting Torpor, I announce slow was resisted x1.)<br />
5b. With a Pal/SK tanking, I cast Turgur's ASAP again.  Recast up to a 3rd time &amp; then Torpor self.  I announce all slows resisted.  &quot;resist x2, resistx3, I'm dead now,&quot; etc. :D<br />
<br />
I'm sitting at around 4400-4600hp buffed most of time while exp grinding w/ AC buffed anywhere around 1070-1150, so nothing uber, but good enough to get the job done.  This is enough to be able to tank most Tier1 or 2 mobs (while Torpored) for the period of time before aggro shifts.  Unless slow resists more than twice, I generally never require ANY outside healing.  <br />
<br />
It takes some time to train the pick-up primary healers NOT to heal me unless they see &quot;resists&quot; in /gsay.  Some never learn.  But most clerics &amp; druids eventually see the light.  Torpor w/ SCR3, SCRM, &amp; 8th shawl is an extremely efficient HoT.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Naralli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Another thing you can do to minimize the agro you gain from the mobs is to place yourself in close proximity to the MT.<br />
In my case I dual box my 65 warrior and 62 Shammy all the time and I find if I position my Shaman within melee range I rarely ever get hit, and If I do it isnt for very long before the warrior regains the agro.<br />
My tactics are the same as the above poster: I malo on incomining hitting my hotkey as soon as possible and once the mob is in range it goes off. This enables me to cast my slow as soon as my gems refresh getting the slow on the mob as soon as possible. Slowing ASAP is important in PoP as the mobs do so much more damage.<br />
By Positioning my Shaman close to the melee if I do get agro ( i dont always ) I find 90% of the time the warrior regains agro immediately because he doesnt have to run around looking for where the mob went too.<br />
Try it, it works.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Stand next to the MT when he stops from the pull or when the pull is inc and slow.<br />
<br />
No ping pong so the MT can pull it off you if you resist, or you can get that second slow off through the hits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It depends.  <br />
<br />
In my prefered group with a bard pulling and a SK tanking, the mobs never look at me...  The bard will occlusion and slow the mob before it gets to camp, the SK will snare as soon as its in range (even ifits not snareable, its good agro), I slow as soon as its in range, and never get agro.<br />
<br />
In a typical group, if the tank pulls they will have enough agro for me to slow with only occasionaly getting agro.  I malo as soon as the mob is in range (on its way to camp) and slow as soon as the gem refreshes (usualy land slow before the assist call).<br />
<br />
If we have a dedicated puller (fd splitting or lull/pacify pulling) I know I will have agro at the beginning of the fight.  I stand where the MT is waiting for the mob (so he wont have to chase it).  I torpor myself at the end of the fight (while cannibalizing back whatever mana I used) and if things are moving along this means I have torpor on when the puller brings the next mob in.  I malo as soon as the mob is in range, and slow as soon as the gem refreshes.  Slow will usualy land just as the mob reaches camp -and I will take the first few hits while the mt attacks/taunts/whatever it is they do.  Once the mt has agro I move back a few steps, we kill it, rinse and repeat.<br />
<br />
In any case, the mob is slowed as soon as it reaches camp.  I use malo even at 65 to ensure that my slow lands on the first try.  I can tank a slowed PoP mob for a bit if I have to.  I cant keep a tank alive versus an unslowed PoP mob, much less a caster.<br />
<br />
If there are multiple mobs, I trust the crowd controll person to handle them.  If I am the cc person, I root the first one in range, and then try to land slow on the one we are fighting before the tank dies... if not, well.. I told them to pull singles  :p</div></div><hr />
