<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Someone PLEASE stop me, I have one level FIVE character and I kid you not, 20 characters created just to play with outfits.<br />
<br />
Here are some of my favorite outfits (apologies some of the pictures are so dark)<br />
<br />
Fauve - Scrapper (http://www2.freepichosting.com/Images/421497681/0.jpg) <br />
<br />
Frostglitter - Ice Blaster (front view) (http://www2.freepichosting.com/Images/421497681/1.jpg) <br />
<br />
Frostglitter - back view (http://www2.freepichosting.com/Images/421497681/2.jpg) <br />
<br />
The Gray Malkin - Scrapper (http://www2.freepichosting.com/Images/421497681/3.jpg) <br />
<br />
Lark - Defender (http://www2.freepichosting.com/Images/421497681/4.jpg) <br />
<br />
Sweet Dreams - Controller (http://www2.freepichosting.com/Images/421497681/5.jpg) <br />
<br />
This is just SOME of the characters I've created. I really suck at coming up with Super Hero names, but I also have The Scarlet Siren (much better name!).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">what server?<br />
And are you in a supergroup yet? :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm on three servers now, I need that many to contain my OUTFITS! I haven't joined a Super Group, heck, I haven't even joined A group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fumeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You're such a girl :p<br />
<br />
j/k</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Im about to buy it in some days when I have more time off :)<br />
I think I will start at Pinnacle server as I already have some friends there who have an invite for me in a supergroup :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Glori ...<br />
<br />
I'm on Protector server:<br />
<br />
Karsan - defender<br />
Anvil - tanker<br />
Walkwer - scrapper<br />
Proteus - defender<br />
Cicero - controller<br />
<br />
I've mostly been playing my defender &quot;Karsan&quot; if you're on that one and want to drop me a line.  I'll be at my fiance`s tonight though.<br />
<br />
I must have deleted and remade about 40 characters now just to play with it and see what I can come up with.<br />
<br />
I've seen so many &quot;Tick&quot;, &quot;The Tick&quot;, &quot;The Ticky&quot;, &quot;Blue Bug&quot; - that it's not even a novelty anymore... and last night I saw an almost PERFECT &quot;Spiderman&quot;, &quot;Thor&quot;, and &quot;The Thing&quot;... all part of the guild &quot;The Marvels&quot;.<br />
<br />
Karsan wears basically black/gray camo fatigues with a black beret, and black/gray wrist and shin wraps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thlayli of Xev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I feel your pain Glori!!  I remade my toon at least 15 times, and have all of my slots full of outfits/name ideas.<br />
<br />
Right now I have a lvl 12 controller on Justice...but that doesn't mean I still don't have the urge to delete her because I wish I'd picked a different hair color...<br />
<br />
Thlayli in CoH (http://members.cox.net/adollyvida/ThlayCoH.jpg)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Um, Glori, does Frostglitter have a boyfriend yet?  I think I know someone who wants to go out with her.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hey Thlayli, I'll have to look for you, I'm also on the Justice server.  My character is a Lightning/Ice Blaster named DarkSpawn.  He's wearing a black and emerald green biological 2 body suit (kinda looks like The Spawn, but was not worried about an exact match).  Figured a Blaster (dps class) that can root, snare, and slow (secondary effects of lightning and ice powers) will be able to solo and group well.  <br />
<br />
BTW, our Super Group, we have 9 members so far, is called &quot;Team Vigilance&quot;.  So far so good.  See ya in game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I play on Infinity, part of the Super Group Defenders of Paragon. My main is an 11 Defender named The Vibe Raider, and my secondary is a level 4 scrapper named Murder. If anyone ever wants to group up, send me a /tell. <br />
<br />
Yes, I have continued the mangina tradition even in CoH.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Um, Glori, does Frostglitter have a boyfriend yet?  I think I know someone who wants to go out with her.<br />
<br />
/whisper I hear she's... erm... frigid.</div></div><hr />
