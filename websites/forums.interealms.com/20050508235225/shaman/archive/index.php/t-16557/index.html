<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grann Met</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I certianley hope that I am not asking a question that has already been answered, if I if i am just flame this post and hit me with a link ;) <br />
<br />
Does any one know / have a list of / have a link to somewhere that has a list of what all the different slots mean.  I know that slot 1 is most all non-weapon, non-time, non-LDoN gear and I know that slot 4 is weapons but my knowledge of slots stops there.  If any one could tell me what alots 1 - 8 mean, what restrictions they have, etc. I would very much appreciate it.  Thanks for your time everyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Stealing a quote from another forum to answer on this.<br />
<br />
Gah, 1-3 are armor augments and 4-6 are weapon augments. The &quot;lower augments fit into the higher slot&quot; claim doesn't point this out. Never seen so many people confused by the numbers 1, 2 and 3 before this expansion. Everyone wants to place type 3 augments into their &quot;slot 3, type 1&quot; slot and don't understand why they won't fit into a type 4 slot, which is a *beginner* slot for weapons. Your type 1-2 augments will fit into a type 3 slot and your type 4-5 augments will fit into a type 6 slot, *that* is how it works.<br />
And if I had a nickel for every time a rogue got excited about placing a type 5 damage augment into their type 4 Willsapper slot I'd be a majority owner of Starbucks by now...<br />
<br />
-FF  <br />
<br />
there you go.<br />
<br />
edit: type 8 is only from ime and I dont think we have seen a type 8 augment in game yet.</div></div><hr />

NOW I GET IT!  Thanks a ton Salorm    :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">That's a bad quote, because it is very very wrong.<br />
<br />
AUGMENTS WILL ONLY FIT INTO THE SAME TYPE THEY LIST!!! You cannot fit a type 4 into a type 6.  You cannot fit a Type 1 in a Type 3. You cannot fit a Type 3 in a Type 1. You cannot fit a Type 6 into a Type 5.<br />
<br />
Type 1: Single stat improvements. HP+12, Wis+5, Dex+6, Resists Magic +6<br />
<br />
Type 2: Multiple stat improvements, or large single stat. HP+40, Str/Sta/Wis+5, Resist_All+2<br />
<br />
Type 3: Worn effects. Regeneration, Flowing Thought, Vengeance, Enduring Breath, Spell haste IV.<br />
<br />
Type 4: Weapon procs...DD, Lifetap, Taunt increase<br />
<br />
Type 5: Improve base weapon damage, typically elemental<br />
<br />
Type 6: Improve base weapon damage, more. Often not elemental improvements, thus not putting in a resist issue.<br />
<br />
Type 7: May not exist. Nothing has been found with this Type, either augment or slot.<br />
<br />
Type 8: Exclusive to Time drops. No augments have been found that fits into this slot, but plenty of items have it.<br />
<br />
There are augments will specifically list themselves to go in ANY slot. These are generally type 1 in their power level. These are the only augments (so far) which will fit into Type 8 slots on Time gear. I believe this is to make it so that already very strong Time equipment doesn't grow to outright ridiculous proportions. Most any-slot augments are not very good, or the ones that are good are lore and very difficult to get.<br />
<br />
There's a lot of bad information going around about augments and about how adventure points are earned/spent. Please don't add to it by quoting grossly erroneous information.<br />
<br />
Edit-- Clarity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Arriana, do you know by having TESTED combining a type 1 aug into a type 2 slot or some similar attempt?<br />
<br />
<br />
  There are many people who believe that you can place a type 1 into a type 2/3 due to the wording of the patch message.   Until it was quoted to me directly I was thinking just as you typed, that the number had to be a perfect match.<br />
<br />
<br />
  If you look at the patch message, it does lead to this ambiguity though.<br />
<br />
For example, you have an item with three slots available and you have filled Slot 1 with an Augmentation Item. In your bag you have an Augmentation Item that can fit into any slot on the item (i.e. Type 1) and one that fits into Slot 2. If you use the Type 1 Augmentation Item first, it will fill the first open slot on your item, which would be Slot 2 in this case. This means you will not be able to use the Slot 2-specific Augmentation Item you had available<br />
<br />
<br />
  I bolded the line that leads people to this &quot;false belief&quot; and I am now willing to believe with them until I see it proven otherwise.  (though I won't spend any real points till I have tested it)<br />
<br />
<br />
edited to correct spelling of the qord quote</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you remove the (i.e. Type 1) reference, then it does make a lot more sense.<br />
<br />
Maybe I'll try making an LDoN smithed BP (which have Type 2 x2 slots) and see if a cheap Type 1 aug will go into it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">So how come no items cept for those bought with LDoN points have Slots 2 and 3?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think in the end they put no slots other than type 1 on old armor because they didn't want to try balancing all the augments around the previous expansion armor and setting a proper amount of slots per item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">unfortunately elemental armor counts as &quot;old&quot;.  And everything lower.  <br />
Total croc of ****.  Can't use useful augs unless u downgrade...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Scrav</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Type 5 generally appears to be for lower end LDoN weapons, while type 6 is for higher end LDoN weapons.  If you compare the Type 5 and Type 6 augmentations, you will find that type 5 is a lot cheaper than Type 6 in terms of the damage modifiers, but you won't see Type 5 on any higher end LDoN weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">So how come no items cept for those bought with LDoN points have Slots 2 and 3?<br />
<br />
Because it is easier to make a program that goes through the entire item database and adds Type 1 to armor, Type 4 to weapons than to go through 20,000 items and individually balance them.<br />
<br />
But it's not all bad, Land...there are some useful any-slot augs, even a +40 hp one you can buy (although it is probably lore).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Ok, I finally decided to sit down and test the myth myself.<br />
<br />
  I bought first a hammer that was type2/type4 slots.   Stuck in a STR mod that dropped in a dungeon and thought I had proof.... I got a lovely little announcement that &quot;The results of this combine is NO DROP and not usable by you&quot; and it refused to combine.<br />
<br />
  Ok, 30 points wasted, no biggie. <br />
<br />
   So I bought myself a ring with a single TYPE 3 slot, and tossed in the STR augment.<br />
<br />
  Then I realized that the STR augment was TYPE ALL.... oops.<br />
<br />
  So, I bought a solvent and destroyed the augment (oh well, not like I needed STR anyway, looted just to test this).<br />
<br />
  I then spent MORE points buying a TYPE 2 augment.   I attempted to augment the TYPE 3 slot with a TYPE 2 augment and.....<br />
<br />
<br />
  You cannot combine them :)    So there is now solid PROOF that the augment type and the slot type HAVE TO MATCH.   They just worded the patch message very poorly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Hannduvdeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Ugh, meaning I can't put an Extended Range IV type 3 augment on my epic because it has a type 4 slot.  That royally sucks arse.<br />
<br />
My thanks to Caanus Grey for testing that out and his/her super list on Safehouse.  And my sincere /rude to Sony for not allowing me to save up and buy &amp; use even one useful augment without having to buy a piece of LDoN gear (besides the little type 1 junk).   At least my bard gets to have fun with two weapon procs.  I don't understand the reasoning for this and am amazed at how poorly explained the whole system is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Grann Met</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">At last, the strait up truth.  Thanks for the posts every one I really appreciate it.</div></div><hr />
