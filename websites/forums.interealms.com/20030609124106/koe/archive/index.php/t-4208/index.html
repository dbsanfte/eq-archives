<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I got a Runic Carver for sale.  Don't know how much they are worth but I'll sell it for below market value to a guildy.  Normally I would just give stuff away but I gotta start saving up plat because level 29 spells are EXPENSIVE, that and at level 29 I wanna start working on my potion making.  Send either myself or Sherazad a tell in game or reply here if you are interrested.</div></div><hr />

In the wizard realm, the Frogluk Bonecasters Robe, which for a while was worth 20k, and I paid 10k for a few months ago, is now worth less than 3k (or at least I saw someone trying to sell one for an hour at that price).<br />

DN is the candy store of melee weapons, and other places are candy stores for other classes, so I hear.  As people get these drops (the quest armors in Thurgadin, Kael, and Skyshrine have made this happen), and go to fp to unload their old gear, prices drop, and quickly.<br />

Luck to you, Sori:)</div></div><hr />
