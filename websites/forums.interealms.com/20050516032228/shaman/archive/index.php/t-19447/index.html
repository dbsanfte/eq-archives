----------------------------<br />
<br />
Tonight we have a small update to fix some general bugs.  We are again changing charm (in exactly the way we thought we had last week)  No this is not deja vu.  You should also look for changes in that evolving zone of Nedaria's Landing.  I wonder what is going on there?<br />
<br />
<br />
- An update to the zone, Nedaria's Landing.  Make sure you check it out.<br />
<br />
- Charm spell change: If an NPC is in the middle of casting a spell when charm is broken, it will interrupt the spell.<br />
<br />
- Some general bug fixes.<br />
<br />
Make sure you log onto the Test server to see what other changes we are cooking up.  Our next Scheduled update is planned for February 10th.<br />
<br />
Remember Gates of Discord is coming soon.  Go to www.gatesofdiscord.com or EQlive.station.sony.com for more information.</div></div><hr />

I am 99% sure that only the buyer of that new expansion will get the tradeskill interface. Same they did with maps in LoY. Bastards.<br />
<br />
So long<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Any confirmation if they actually fixed the cheat this time? I've been doing /bug every time I log in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think they said that the new TS interface would go live in the GoD release patch, so just another 10 days. I've been doing a lot of TSing lately for the aid grimmel quest, I agree with your sentiment, I wish would get the interface patched in asap ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just curious.<br />
<br />
When a player charms a casting mob, does it interrupt the actual casting of that -previously uncharmed- mob as well or not? (assuming the charm hits, while mob is still on casting)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
hmmm, new way to keep mobs from casting CH?<br />
<br />
LOL<br />
<br />
Of course they fail to realize that you can just reverse the whole process and attack a Caster mob with your charmed pet and when it starts casting, break charm...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Don't think you can, I think the 'friend-enemy' check is done at the end of the cast (try malosing a charm pet that breaks, quite often when the recharm lands while you're casting the malos bounces).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rafeeky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">EQlive states that the tradedskill interface will go live on the Feb 10th patch.  Yay!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was thinking that too, but haven't had the chance to run my necro over and find out.<br />
<br />
The problem is that any zone with more than one faction can be worked with this exploit, and because its really just a faction bug, there are other ways than charm to activate it, particularly for those wiley chanters.<br />
<br />
Yet another example of a band-aid fix for a tournequet-size issue.</div></div><hr />
