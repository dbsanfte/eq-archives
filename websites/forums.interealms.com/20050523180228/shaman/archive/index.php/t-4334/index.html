<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Azazel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I play on the Seventh Hammer and have been auctioning for 5 days to get a bear skin potion bag. 10 slot.<br />
<br />
If anyone here plays on the Seventh and can help please let me know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">you could of tailord your own faster.. Here is the recipe if you want to go that route<br />
<br />
To make 5 charge or 10 charge potions you will need to have a Bear Skin Potion Bag. I keep one in the bank at all times. The bag is made through tailoring, here is the recipe:<br />
2 spiderling silks = silk thread (Tailoring Trivial 15) <br />
3 silk threads = silk cord (Tailoring Trivial 26) <br />
thick grizzly bear skin + silk cord = bearskin potion bag (Tailoring Trivial 68) <br />
<br />
The bag is tradable so if you have no tailoring skill get a friend to make one with the materials you gather. The skin is a semi-common drop off grizzlys in West Commons and other zones. <br />
<br />
Now make 5 or 10 single charge potions and put them in the bear skin potion bag. The combine is a no-fail combine , meaning you will allways succeed.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Also, if you can get the bear skin, it shouldn't be difficult at all to /auction for a tailor to make the bag for you. It's just not an ingredient that too many (if any) tailors keep on them.</div></div><hr />
