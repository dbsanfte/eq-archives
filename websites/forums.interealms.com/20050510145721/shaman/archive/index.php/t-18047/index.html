<br />
they are probably gonna be monk-alike version with different Melee skills..<br />
<br />

Looks like it'll be a new class what with the class title progression that has been added and such.  As long as they have the ability to head-butt I'm game.<br />

Im gonna have to come back and get level 70, just to say i did......damnit. :)<br />
<br />
I quit shortly after i hit 60 with my monk too lol!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I dunno, i guess it doesnt matter. Not to be negitive, but ever since PoP EQ seems so pointless now.<br />
<br />
The game is broke beyond fixing i think and thats why i want eq2 to come. EQ seems like its a beta eq2 or something. Its got all these ideas but are broken and mismatched and unrounded. In eq2 all this stuff will work better together i think cause the game will be built around it, not just glued onto a pre-existing game.<br />
<br />
Left my long time guild on MT and dont see any guilds there that fit me. Guess i have one foot out the door.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">the whole level increase doesn't bother me, obviously it'll trivialize some of pop, which was bound to happen, i'm just glad my exp bar is up at 98% full :) .. i've been running 90 aa / 10 real since dinging 65 and after 113 aa's i'm almost at a full real exp bar :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'm not even really playing right now. If they did raise the level cap it'd probably be the final nail in the coffin for me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
It doesn't feel pointless to me - my guild is farming VT and eyeing the Planes.  Maybe you have finished EQ.<br />
<br />
It is hard to imagine what they will do for a followup to POP, but then again POP was hard to imagine in the first place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">You have reached level 70, would you like to (D)elete Everquest, (C)ontinue grinding, or (M)igrate to EQ2 for a small fee?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sarania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">You have reached level 70, would you like to (D)elete Everquest, (C)ontinue grinding, or (M)igrate to EQ2 for a small fee?<br />
<br />
C is not an option and never will be an option. SoE stated a few months ago between LoY and LDUM they were planing on 2 more expansions and you know the &quot;super uber&quot; guilds are probably gettign bored with PoTime.Plus SOE has to clear these out out POT guilds to some place new so the masses can get their shot at it. Here is what i see coming in the next expansion or two:<br />
1. Level increase to 70<br />
2. More AA<br />
3. More Spells.<br />
4. Zones higher than PoT for raiding guilds<br />
5. nerfs on the requirements for elemental flags.<br />
6. nerfs on the respawn time of vt.<br />
7. removal of key to emp in ssra. <br />
8. more worthless potions<br />
9. more tinkering items to do away with our only selling potions. IE Anodizing SOW device, Anodizing Gate device. <br />
<br />
I think LDUM is the last expansion i wasted my money on and after the exp nerf it's definately a waste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">&quot;C is not an option and never will be an option.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sort of like all the other thing SOE swore they'd never do and then did :)<br />
<br />
&quot;1. Level increase to 70&quot;<br />
<br />
If not farther...<br />
<br />
&quot;2. More AA&quot;<br />
<br />
I don't care if we have more AA, I care if we have more USEFUL AA. Right now, shaman get 1 enormously useful AA, less than half a dozen sorta useful ones, and a ****load of completely useless ones. <br />
<br />
&quot;3. More Spells.&quot;<br />
<br />
See AA comment. Oh--and they'll make BSTs overlap shaman even more, making us even less preferred for groupage.<br />
<br />
&quot;4. Zones higher than PoT for raiding guilds&quot;<br />
<br />
Undoubtedly. Kind of sad, though, to consider there are undiscovered continents out there that apparently have street people tougher then the Elemental Gods.<br />
<br />
&quot;5. nerfs on the requirements for elemental flags.&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm dubious of this one. Its not really that hard to get into the elemental planes now, to be honest. We have a fellow on Bertox who organizes several &quot;pickup&quot; raids a week and has been very successful in getting a ton of non-guilded folks into most of the planes thus far.<br />
<br />
&quot;6. nerfs on the respawn time of vt.&quot;<br />
<br />
I would think if they were going to do this, they'd have done it already. Its pretty old now.<br />
<br />
&quot;7. removal of key to emp in ssra.&quot; <br />
<br />
I've been expecting this for a long time, but then, its also even older now, and still hasn't been done. I suspect SOE really wants to leave content that forces people into guilds.<br />
<br />
&quot;8. more worthless potions&quot;<br />
<br />
Are there any non-worthless potions? There's not a single potion I can make and sell in Bazaar on my server for a profit at the present. Skill-up people sell them all for less than ingredient prices. And still the only ones that sell are SoW and maybe the occasional DS or an illusion potion.<br />
<br />
&quot;9. more tinkering items to do away with our only selling potions. IE Anodizing SOW device, Anodizing Gate device. &quot;<br />
<br />
Gnomes are a &quot;preferred&quot; race for some reason, in the same way that enchanters, druids, bards and beasts are &quot;preferred&quot; classes.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">PoP destroyed the game for most people I know. <br />
<br />
The new Berserker class sounds interesting but too late I think, the game feels like it's in &quot;epilogue&quot; stage.<br />
<br />
I don't buy the common theory that EQ is being used to promote/beta EQ2. In fact my hunch is that EQ and EQ2 design teams are competing with each other, fighting for survival against each other. If EQ uses some ideas that seem to be EQ2ish, it's probably because they know they have to adapt to survive with a new game coming out soon as competition, even if that competition is from the same parent company.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">My bet is that EQ is being used to beta-test EQ2 functionality in a live environment:  Instancing, psychology (i.e. how to get players to certain zones), spell graphics, anti-cheating code, macro game effects of certain skills and spells, mob tuning, server tuning, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Takeshi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Exp was never nerfed in LDoN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">that's cool, well I dunno, every time I try to quit EQ, my imminent departure is delayed by another tantalizing expansion.  phfft!</div></div><hr />
