<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Adran Windrunner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi folks. I'm just recently started playing again, and have moved my shaman from my old server to Antonius Bayle, where some RL are now playing (a UK server at last! never knew how bad the lag was till I moved).<br />
<br />
So there I am, naked, wondering what new items have arrived in the last year that would be relatively easy to obtain to get me started. I apologise for yet another &quot;equipment advice&quot; thread. :)<br />
<br />
I guess what I'm looking for is decent &quot;twink&quot; gear that doesn't cost a fortune. I don't plan to spend weeks farming plat before I can even start playing, though I guess I'll have to before too long, as crappy equipment will make me a liability in groups.<br />
<br />
My plan is to run around camping mobs and doing quests to get myself some gear that I can get by with, then slowly work at replacing (or even improving on) my old equipment.<br />
<br />
Now, it's been a loooong time since I played, so I'm guessing that there's been some fairly radical item inflation. Bloodstained tunics and Runed Circlets probably don't cut it these days. ;)<br />
<br />
I can make Imbued Northman Ringmail, and I can do the Totemic quests. What I'm hoping is that some of you can recommend some &quot;new&quot; items (it's been over a year since I played) that are obtainable by a solo 54 shaman who has poor AC and low MANA pool.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There's always no drop stuff in karnors.. :) That would last you a little bit.. if you were looking to try and save plat from the get go =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thalarctos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Jbone stuff is really cheap these days.  The arms/hat/boots/hands can be had for 500pp on Povar.  At lvl 54, you can solo HG's nekked I'd bet.  2k wouldn't take long to get.<br />
6ac/65 rings and 2ac 35hp 25mana earrings are nice, and cheap if you know a jeweler.  I'd just fill out the rest with easy to get (rygorr/totemic) stuff for the time being.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Adran Windrunner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If JB really is that cheap then it's certainly something I'd go for. I have noticed that prices on a lot of items seem to have dropped quite dramatically. I don't think I'd seen any Rygorr when I stopped playing, though I'd heard it mentioned. I don't know the stats, but it appears my login account to eqmaps.com has been automatically renewed, so I'll trawl the d/b there.<br />
<br />
And thanks for the reminder about JS armour from Karnor's, I'd forgotten that - the bracers and legs in particular are good, IIRC.<br />
<br />
I had those earrings and rings on my old server, and another RL friend is hopefully moving his 250 skill jeweller across to AB, so that might make matters a bit easier. :)</div></div><hr />
