My good friend, she had 9 fails before a success.<br />

The record is one in my guild who took 13 attempts to get flagged.<br />
<br />
Do we suck big time or is Tipt everyones big nightmare?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It depends.

First time we went through - NO charmed Pooka.  = Success. (Cleric, Shaman, Enchanter, Wizzie, Warrior, Paladin. The only non-Harmonium in the group was me. (Harmonium is top dawg on Xev guild wise))<br />
<br />
Second time was with another group of Time-enabled folks AND Charmed Pooka. = Failure. (No names, suffice to say the Ranger decided to &quot;tank&quot; the add instead of assisting, resulting in a broken mez, and our 4th wipeout)<br />
<br />
Third time was with other folks, mostly EP and &quot;CPoD&quot; (except for me) = Success.<br />
<br />
If you don't use the &quot;Charmed Pooka of Doom&quot; a Paladin for stuns is invaluable.  Having a clue helps also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hail,<br />
<br />
Tipt I had 2 failures right at the very end, a few more false starts that never got close (group broke up), then I finally got the flag with a group of friends.  We used a charm pet throughout.  I think we got the win a few days before the zone nerf, but I could be wrong.<br />
<br />
Tipt&amp;VXed are the only GoD flags I have...Hard to me to get good people to run through Sewers w/ me since most already have the Rondo flag. :( <br />

Pally friend of mine sent me a tell inviting me for a Tipt group...had Paladin, Shaman, Bst, Ench, Cleric, Bard.  Bard was amazing, cleric was a bit slow on heals, low hp and mana pool, so I was doing a fair amount of patching along with slowing mobs on pull.  We did the whole trial in less than an hour.  Weirdest thing was that without a snarer, every 3rd or 4th kill, the enchanter would invis, bard would mez, I would malos the chanter's pet, and chanter would recharm.  Seemed to work for us.  The goal was to backflag the Bst and Ench, and I got a flag as well =).<br />

<br />
I went on a tipt run with a chanter that spent so much time freaking out and barking instructions over and over and over again about the agro ladder that he got killed by his own pet. The best way to do it is to not treat the chanter pet as the tank.<br />
<br />
It doesn't need a perfect group. It just needs a group that knows how to play their classes.<br />
<br />
My first success came from a BST, CLR, SHM, RNG, ENC, BRD group and the BST tanked every mob. The chanter pet was purely assist. Everyone was just flat out dps. BST slowed mobs on inc. I slowed as he did so mine was almost directly after his. Then it was nuke, heal, be ready to malos. I was busy the whole time and had a blast. I was backup healer and healed the pet between pulls. I played crowd control, and kept the pet rooted out of camp one time when the chanter lagged out and died on a pet break. All in all it's not that hard, it just takes a competent group of people who trust each other to add value.<br />
<br />
For the named the ranger ws'd the mob and before ws was down the mob was dead.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Frakass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">vxed : first try for both shaman and warrior back in february.<br />
<br />
tipt : first try for warrior, second or third try on shaman back in february too. was close call for both.<br />
<br />
warrior was well equiped elemental with 200ish AA, shaman had about 3k hp and 4200 mana with 50ish AA.<br />
<br />
Most failures came from charm break on pookas, I remember one guild group with pali tank (pali, cleric, druid, shaman, wiz, rogue) pass tipt easy and it was before they made last named easy.</div></div><hr />

Enchanter/Shaman/Monk/Paladin/Cleric/Druid.  <br />
<br />
Charmed pooka is quite a force.  <br />

I had a great time.  I'd be happy to go back and help flag people - if it's a reasonable group with a good puller.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">&quot;Charmed Pooka of Doom&quot; is a mixed blessing. It can be a very useful thing to have but the group has to be prepared to manage it. There are a number of different things you can do to help manage it. Snaring the pet, keeping it malosed and tashed. Slowing it or stuning it on break. Beating it down to 10% so it runs when it breaks.<br />
<br />
Personally most of my tipts have been on my bard and have been with a charmed pet. Altho we prefer crags or hynids as of late. The hynids seem to have lower resists over all and stay charmed longer. We usually take what ever we run accross thats blue first tho. We use the pooka with my bard because we can grab a tank, typically my room mate, a good cleric, an enchanter and my bard and any others and beat tipt 90+% of the time even if the other 2 do nothing but stand there the whole time.</div></div><hr />

Think we got it on our second or third time with a all guild group. Was a Paladin, Chanter, Cleric, Bard, myself and either a druid or ranger. All in bazaar/LDoN gear.<br />

We always use a hynid for our charmed pet. They seem to have a lower resist rate plus they've parsed out as more dps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I still had fun (sort of) but it's not the kind of fun I like, being relegated to casting maybe 3 times and then just to save someone else's butt who was more useful in the long run.  <br />
<br />
The more I think about it the less I want to do this with a chanter centric group,  give me a straight up normal group any day over being chanter pet support.</div></div><hr />

PAL + CLE + CLE + SHM + WIZ + MAG<br />
<br />
but the wizard screwed up and got summoned/killed about 5 seconds into the fight with the final named, and we ended up wiping because we didn't have sufficient DPS to finish the mob off without the wizard.  <br />
<br />
So I'm fairly sure it can be done, but I haven't heard of anyone who's done it without a chanter.  Encounters that basically require one specific class to have a reasonable chance of completing totally suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Serranex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">about 5 tries. I've seen people go over and over and fail though.

It's sooo damn hard to get a tipt group and once we do either someone important has to leave or we wipe out at the last boss because of some stupid bad luck. Last thing i need for KT too  :mad:<br />
<br />
Edit: Win! 16th try lol... :rolleyes: <br />
The group was a time equiped SK, and an elem equiped warrior who both boxed clerics + a necro. We got up to the last boss (took us about 4 hours..) and killed him pretty easily with the war tanking. Then after the warrior got his plate bracer we moved acrossed the bridge and wiped on the 2 bridge mobs  :D  The necro FD'd and rezed the cleric to rez the rest and then we just invised across the bridge for the flag.</div></div><hr />

I saved the key on my bard, so it makes repeats quite simple.<br />
<br />
As far as guild record, somewhere around 8.  At that point we feel bad enough for them to involve ringers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've since been on numerous flagging runs for guildies, no fails as yet, (although a few have been close) and spent a few runs farming bracers. I've done the groups with chanter pets (we prefer cragbeasts to pookas, haven't tried the hynids yet) and it is scary just how fast you can do the trial with a competent pet team.  I've also been on the runs with sub-optimal groups where every fight is 'seat of the pants' and I thank God that four hours later when we reach the final boss we actually manage to kill him.<br />
<br />
I haven't done any tipt since the warrior changes to the end boss. No specific reason, just haven't had to go back.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ohhhh is that what Vigdis meant ... ok, I must've been having a slow moment there when I read her original post. Thanks Phreak. :cool:<br />
<br />
Anyways ... I do Tipt usually with a monk, cleric, ranger, paladin, enchanter, and myself. The enchanter usually charms a pookah. Aside from malosing the thing every once in awhile (I think the most I've had to do it was four times in one expedition), I pretty much ignore it. She absolutely refuses to slow Tipt expeditions because she doesn't want to die. I've also done Tipt with both my usual enchanter friend AND a beastlord (my usual ranger friend was out of town on business that week, I believe) ... and even he refused to slow. Same reason as the enchanter, he didn't want to die. Both of them told me afterward they were glad I was there to take care of it. My monk friend is usually the one who puts our groups together, and he actually told me that he has trouble finding another slower for Vxed/Tipt. *shrug* I dunno. I just know I'm always needed in my group.<br />
<br />
Of *course* there are classes that can do things better/faster/stronger than we can, I'm not disputing that at all ... lol it's rather obvious. But really, in my Tipt groups, I'm always doing *something* ... nuking, slowing, and I'm always healing in between other stuff ... I've never felt useless.<br />

<br />
shaman is actually quite useful in tipt.  honestly you aren't adding a lot of speed to your run but greatly increase the safety and thus the winability of a crawl<br />
<br />
a lot of the groups ive done tipt for have been for alts or friends and Ive done tipt with a couple of marginal groups.  baseline tank is prolly a 6kish/1400 base warrior with def AA and a 5k mana cleric.  if you're north of that and have a decently equipped 8k+ tank obviously you can sleepwalk through the zone but to get friends through who might be a little undergeared ive found a shaman can add a lot<br />
<br />
ive played both chanter and shaman and say what you like i still vastly prefer shaman slow for its casting speed over tash+FD... in a marginal group like the first poster is talking about where your tank can take hits from mobs while pet destroys, but who cannot stay up indefinitely, over the course of the expedition, having mobs slowed before it's in camp saves clerics mana and allows you to keep moving ahead of the respawn, which makes doing tipt much much easier<br />
<br />
also assuming that you're using a pet, with TD3 and good char malos isn't imperative but it does help managing pets between recharms<br />
<br />
finally there's the issue of spot heals.  while a decent cleric can keep a marginal tank up versus mobs without undue hardship, for rampage, splurt dps from nocs and **** etc shaman are really nice to have.  just overall makes things smoother and safer<br />
<br />
 ive done tipt with dps heavier groups war bard cle ench rng necro and with heal heavy groups war bard cle ench shm druid<br />
<br />
and honestly i prefer the shaman group... the pet makes such quick work of the mobs that in the long run the entire expedition seems to take about the same amount of time either way.  the longest stretches are when you wait on the mobs to be pulled etc... but with a shaman things seem much smoother.  mainly because you dont spend 2 hours and get up there and then die from some burst of dps from the mob or if a broken pet gets in a swipe at your cleric <br />
<br />
about the kvy hunter, he's not hard.  the key things seem to be to of course dispell and also to make sure you fight him at spawn.  his dps increases at a distance from spawn so there's no point in pulling him.  send in pet, have bard or whoever dispell and take rampage, send in war with discipline and in 30 seconds mob is down.  there's isnt a whole lotta room for error (ie there's not a whole lot you can do to **** up)  as I say we've had a 6kish 70 AA war even tank him without issue so probably the main thing is to make sure your dispeller, tank and pet all hit the named at the same time<br />
<br />
as a chanter i have to say, pet breaking shouldn't be a problem, there's really limitless ways you can minimize the danger of pet running buck wild.  all of them are things that people just get too lazy to do like taking time at the beginning to make a few heal and root macros for your chanter and pet or taking time to properly position your pet and to keep your distance from it when moving it around.  but if you have someone who keeps zoning out for whatever reason, invest in a decent bard or paladin who will tab buffer the pet.  there's 0 way a chanter can die with a bard in the group when pet breaks<br />
<br />
I also have to note that for some reason the assist range on mobs in this zone seems almost buggily small... it's impossible to pull more than 2 mobs from an area that should assist 4 mobs... almost seems broken.  for a puller makes the zone really boring... a string of 6 single pulls followed by rooms with 10 mobs that all come by themselves followed by 6 single pulls etc etc</div></div><hr />

I pull tipt.  Mobs come to camp with malos and slow already stuck on them.  Mobs hit camp about 3-5 seconds after the previous mob dies.<br />
I keep the pet malosi'd every time it breaks charm.<br />
I help heal the pet.<br />
I root the pet when we don't have snare so the enchanter can recharm.<br />
I play backup healer to the cleric in the group.<br />
What class do you know of that can drop the MR of the pet by 50+, heal, root, slow, and do other miscellaneous stuff?</div></div><hr />

Well atleast at this point in GoD we're still able to function as secondary healers.  So we're able to fill 2 of the group roles.  It's also nice to have malosinia on the charmed pet as well.  So we still have hefty use here.</div></div><hr />

-pet sit (try loading up Stoicism when there's downtime to keep on the pet for snare/slow, root pet + heal chanter when charm breaks (easy to do since you get a nice message when it happens))<br />
-dot/nuke/melee for leet shammy dps<br />
<br />
<br />
I think a couple other classes can fufull these roles, but none are as adept to multitasking at all of them like Shaman are. THAT'S what makes us great for these trials - or any group anywhere for that matter.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Juror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">First try but our warrior - Slivereyes - kicked major booty.  He knew trial well and had killed boss several times.  Group was chanter (with charmed pet), druid, wizzie, cleric, warrior, and me.  Mostly I slowed mobs, kept pet debuffed and under control (rooting when necessary and keeping chanter alive), helped handle traps, and added what little DPS I could.<br />
<br />
It took me three tries for Vxed.  Once pet broke just as we pulled last room and all hell broke loose.  Other time two peeps were having stability issues and we had to call it quits.  Time we won, we easily cleared mobs and pally DA'd and dragged camp away while we ran in and hailed.  Bard helped kite.  We eventually died but at least we got flagged.  Three tries isn't bad for bunch of folks from non-raiding guild, no Gates spells, mostly ornate / LDON gear, not Time flagged.  :D   We hunt together all the time though and enjoy doing things that people say we can't do.  That makes a difference.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Hildaorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">I got my Tpit on the first try, but it was almost a fail.<br />
 Group was Cleric, Druid, Chanter, Bard, Warrior, Shaman.<br />
Warrior is new to the guild, and undergeared only 8.3k hp buffed. We were doing ok,had got to just past the Riddler. When the Warrrior got feared, mob then ate the cleric before it could be stopped. Bard got mob mezed, and than chanter kept it stunned while we nuked it down. Trouble was, no rez. So, Chanter logs on his necro, going to DA, and FD run in, and rez the cleric, two trys, no go. Another Necro from the guild that was at the blocked zoneline offers to try, he makes it, and saves the day. Big Sigh of releaf.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">I don't have any GoD flags, because groups do not need shamans there. Whenever I am in BoT groups (I am SICK of BoT) or anywhere else, or in LDoN's (both normal and hard), people send me tells after the run &quot;Wow, great work, I never knew that shaman can do this much and so well&quot; and so on, but when it comes to GoD - silence. I get asked for buffs and then they get a chanter or BST. Slow mitigation makes ALL of our slows EQUAL, and other then slow I, as a shaman, have nothing to offer to fast paced action - my DoT's are too slow and only cause me to get summoned, my nukes finish casting when the damn mob is already dead or about to die, my pet sucks big time and it just a waste of mana - can't take a hit, can't land a hit which would make a dent, I can't CC mobs and root CC'ing in many cases is useless due to mob being immune to movement rate changes..<br />
<br />
Basically, it's a crap and frankly, with the current situation the shamans are in now, i.e. offer ZERO utility other then slow - and in newer expansions, not even that - to groups, I don't see me ever get any of those flags, and seeing how we are already screwed up and about with OoW, it will be even worse. Only GoD groups I got so far were from guildies (and even those are not that often, because chanter is still preferred more then shaman) and couple of times from random pick-up ones, due to them being early gamers and there simply was not enough people online yet to get the classes they wanted, so after long time of waiting, they invited me. And of course, in one case cleric gated out in mid-run to go on guild raid and in other case we had problems with AFK'ing DPS class and over-eager warrior, who itched to pull anything what moved. So we wiped in the end, because he just HAD to pull additional mites...<br />
<br />
So anyways, I'm levelling up BST now. If I get him up to the level in time (i.e. soon, before I get bored) or before there are any other games out, I'm just gonna retire the useless shaman class char. BST's are way more useful and offer times more utility to groups then shamans do. Or, if any other games like EQ2 or WoW get released before I get there, I'll play those instead. Whichever comes first.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Blakcat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">I don't have any GoD flags, because groups do not need shamans there.<br />
<br />
Well friend you are misinformed. Shamans are needed there (As much as any other non-cleric, non-warrior class is needed there) You can not base any opinion off Tipt alone or one group gone wrong. My first experiences in GoD were from invites to Vxed and Tipt groups. Just like many here, I was invited to &quot;pet-sit&quot;, and slow if I could (I believe that was what I was told by the group leader). Now I could have got upset and either left the group (which would not have gotten me any invites back) or sat back and took the misinformed view of our appointed group leader. Instead I educated him and the rest of the group on what Shamans are capable of. Then after I educated them, I stepped up and showed them. <br />
<br />
If you forgot what we can do and can do well, just scroll back up to what Juujuu and Thlayli posted. One thing you do have to remember: this isn't BoT!! This is a few tiers above if I recall, and your not supposed to be able to walk out of BoT or normal LDoN and smoke it, but it can be done. Don't get me wrong I agree with the fact that shamans need some overdue tuning, but until that happens you got to make do with what you got, or stay out of new content that makes you think outside the box and forces you to come up with new strats to get thru these trials. Many people just have no idea of what we are capable of. Any person can roll a shaman-bot with all the spells and abilities, but it takes a real shaman to put them all together and contribute to the group. <br />
<br />
I'm now KT flagged. One of only 2 in my guild currently KT flagged. I did not have access to Smith raid. I don't have my GoD spells. I don't have one piece of GoD gear (hoping to change these two soon). I am not elemental (mainly ornate and LDoN geared). I don't have 500+ AAs. I did this with pick-up groups only, a guildie or friend here or there. KT is worth the pain of each trial, and I have yet to hear one shaman (at least on my server) say they felt worthless in KT. I get groups cause I am needed and have proven I can contribute to the group in any situation. I may not get much further, but its a feeling of accomplishment, when I zone into KT (aka stomping grounds of the &quot;elite&quot;).<br />
<br />
By no means am I saying as a class we are &quot;balanced&quot;, but i really get tired of people giving bad advice and saying shamans are useless and GoD is impossible because its new and hard. Seriously, take a moment and look back and rememeber no graveyards and 6 hour naked CR, and zones that you couldn't gate from, this to name a couple. I encourage everyone to challenge themselves to something that is a little more complicated and rewarding then BoT and normal LDoN's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">I don't have any GoD flags, because groups do not need shamans there.<br />
<br />
I am tired of hearing people spout this mentality. It is misguided. BOT is worlds and worlds away from GOD. Get yourself through some hard LDON adventures, group in the Elemental planes, gear yourself up as best you can, and THEN go try GOD. <br />
<br />
Like Blakcat, I'm KT flagged -- one of four people in my guild. I did all the sewer expeditions, Vxed and Tipt ... because Smith Rondo would kill my guild without a second thought. I am Elemental, I have three drops from Plane of Earth. I have 220-ish AA's. I'm not uber, I'm not at the top of my class on my server, I'm not this or that, blah blah. Just your average shaman, really. I did this with four of my fellow officers and two friends I've known since my days in Sebilis. It took us WEEKS, and seven attempts at one of the trials. Was it worth the effort? Hell yeah. I very highly doubt I will ever see anything beyond KT, Ikkinz or Yxtta. I'm simply not able to get there. That's fine by me. <br />
<br />
I get groups because my friend (monk) has said he cannot find a beastlord or enchanter who is willing to handle main slow in GOD. He says he cannot find someone who contributes as much as I do ... slowed mobs at 99%, solid backup healing, solid buffs, debuffs, and even a few nukes here and there. I get groups in GOD every day because I am needed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">On Terris-Thule I have been /lfg for sewers/vxed/tipt trials for about 3 weeks now since a guild I want to join requires a KT flag.<br />
<br />
Results: Vxed - done (dragged to hail, I got lucky), Sewers 1 done, Tipt - failed 3 times, Sewers 2 failed, time spent /lfg for trials - eternity.<br />
<br />
Biggest problem is getting groups.  I feel like a homeless man at the bus station waiting for a group to take me in for a trial.  I stand at the entrance to Vxed/Tipt for 4 hours a night with nary a tell except for me to buff the groups going in (I finally convinced a shaman bot to camp since he was negating any possible reason to take a shaman in at all by buffing people on the outside). Oh you might get an invite, but an hour later after not being able to find a tank or a cleric, the group falls apart.  Bottom line is - there is a perception out there that shaman's are not good for trials, no matter how false it may be, it is an actual mindset.  If you don't go to GoD with your group ready or a group of friends isn't willing to let you tag along or you aren't in a guild that is actually flagging for KT, you are in for a long journey to get your trials done as an unguilded shaman.  Plain, cold, hard facts - if your experience was different you were lucky.  /lfg for trials as a shaman, at least on my server, is pretty rough.  <br />
<br />
My frustrated opinion, <br />
Mach</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">Macheras, in those sorts of trials its unusual for people to take any class if they don't know the individual, so you might be sitting around for a long time no matter what class you were. Most of the people doing those trials are in mid to upper level guilds, and those folks for the most part stick to guildies or friends, or they just dont go. I'm not sure which guild you are thinking of apping to, but don't you need a champion to get in? It allways helps to have a few friends in a guild you would like to join. If you do, have them ask around and see if they have guildies who might help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">Three runs at Tipt so far, and three failures.<br />
<br />
Attempted with RL friends who are also guildies, all of us (except the Bard) are pre-elemental. Haven't gotten to the last mob yet, but we've gotten drops from the enraged maternal cragbeast three times; our Cleric won two of them.<br />
<br />
Bard, Cleric, Enchanter, Shaman, Warrior, and a hired Ranger each time. How hard is it to resnare every single time the charm breaks? /boggle</div></div><hr />

What would you take for the last spot?<br />
<br />
Shaman are not as useless as they seem on tipt.<br />
<br />
I would take a necromancer for backup rez or FD splitting with monk when harm won't stick over a shaman.<br />
<br />
I would take a pally for stunning the enc pet, backup rez, and group heals over a shaman.<br />
<br />
I would take a druid for evac, better backup heals, and a second snare/kiter over a shaman.<br />
<br />
I would take anything over a shaman really lol.  About the only thing that would be worse than a shaman in the above group would be a pure dps player. rogue, wizard, zerker, etc..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">I didn't write this from &quot;one try experience&quot;. I wrote this from months of trying, being LFG, seeing groups pass and ask for buffs, but regarding grouping they say &quot;We need enchanter (or beastlord), because they can CC (or pack DPS when BST) and slow mitigation makes all of your slows the same anyway&quot;. Who's telling they're not right? Being geared with elemental level gear and what else plays no role here, I've done many things in many areas way better then these so-called 'elemental geared people', proof for it being tells from people I've grouped with, literally after every single run anywhere. It's not the person why they don't want shamans in GoD groups in general, it's simply the class design. Enchanter slows like we do, with slow mitigation there. Enchanter can CC if pull goes wrong. Packs haste, can charm mobs and bring big DPS to the group, helps with mana regen and so on. BST can slow just as well with slow mitigation, can tank, packs mean DPS, has buffs which are wanted in some cases more then shaman buffs (considering that people only really want Focus for HP bonus and nothing else).<br />
<br />
Yeah, I've been invited into groups too, in some cases the group leader said &quot;Well, there was no chanter or BST available and we've been waiting for long enough, so shaman will have to do&quot;. Doesn'y exactly show that shaman is that wanted in GoD areas, where fast and high DPS is needed, CC and such. And this hasn't been told only to me. Sure, eventually may indeed get a group, if wait for hours, but I have better to do with my time then sit on one spot for hours just to hope to get the group. I've gained over frikkin' 130+ skill points in FISHING while sitting LFG for GoD groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Blakcat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">The common denominator I'm seeing in all these posts is &quot;I'm LFG for hours at a time, and no tells!&quot; Why??!! Are your fingers broke? Do you not know how to use the /LFG tool? Can you not be the leader instead of a follower? There have been several posts with a good writeup for each trial. If you missed it, here it is again: GoD Info (http://home.cwru.edu/~srp5/Gate_Tiers.htm) <br />
<br />
Read up, form a group, and have fun. There are many classes out there in your same position, and you will be suprised how many people would prefer to do GoD now then the same ole same ole. You won't win the first time, maybe not even the second, third, or fourth time (Especially the 1st Sewers, boss mob is killer), but you will learn the zone and have lots of fun attempting it. Not to mention exp and loot.  Hell how many times did it take you to get PoJ flag when it first came out, if you have it. Shamans were not needed there either supposdly. Once you start leading and you do it at least semi-well, people will notice and I can guarantee those people will come back for more attempts. Unfortunatly this game seems to breed more followers then leaders, but this can work to your advantage.<br />
<br />
For those of you that hate GoD and have had bad experiences there, I'm sorry to hear that. Nothing is wrong with staying in familiar territory, and to each thier own. But I was not &quot;lucky&quot;, I built my groups and lead us to victory, plain and well not so simple hehe. Like I said it may not be for everyone, but if all you do is sit on your arse with LFG over your head, you are crippling yourself and you will never see your full potential. Shamans are needed in GoD, it just may require you to expand your cababilities and think outside the box. For those of you still chipping away at those flags, GL and remember have fun, cause thats what its all about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">It's not as simple as that.  And yes, I know how to put together a group and use the /lfg tool.  It's not like people are beating down the doors to do pickup trials groups.  Yeah, I can find a 6k (buffed!) pallie for a tank maybe, but does that give me the best chance to win?  Good tanks and capable clerics are either raiding or have their own groups already.  Sure you can get lucky and get a good group going, but the &quot;hours&quot; I spend /lfg I'm also looking to put a group together most times.  I mentioned I have had several times where the group fell apart after an hour of standing there due to no clerics available or willing to do GoD.  So thanks for patronizing me.<br />
<br />
Update, last night log on 6:12 pm cst... /lfg for trials... logoff 10:45 pm cst.  5 tells for buffs.  That was it.<br />

<br />
Yes, it is as simple as that.<br />
<br />
No, people are not beating the doors down to do pickup trials groups.<br />
<br />
Hint, hint.<br />
<br />
It's been said many times, in many different threads, that GOD isn't exactly your best expansion for pickup groups. It's possible, sure, but difficult. If you want steadily successful pickup groups, go to LDON. GOD really requires a group of people that know each other, that are comfortable playing/working with each other, and who are steady and don't panic at the first sign of trouble. Get a group of your friends and have at it.<br />
<br />
A 6k buffed paladin will have problems in even the sewers, aye, but *might* could handle the 3 &quot;easier&quot; sewer trials. So? Go do some hard LDON and gear a group of friends up (and it will take time!) and THEN go try it. Get him to @8k buffed and it should be okay.<br />
<br />
/bow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">It isnt you Macheras, its just the way things are for those trials, they are not pickup group friendly. And if you do get a pickup group, chances are that it will not be made up of toons that have a high probability of success. You really need the sort of social connections that comes with being in a guild to progress there without frustration. In your position its a serious problem because to do the trials you need the social structure, but to get that social structure you need to have done the trials. Sort of a chicken/egg situation.<br />
<br />
There are only two solutions really, one is to get friends in the guild that you are trying to join to help you, or, join a less developed guild that doesn't have KT as a requirement, or at least until you have it done (that will likely make you a few enemies though, as most guilds dont like being used as stepping stones).<br />
<br />
You could opt for sitting there LFG as well, but the social dynamics are not in your favor in that option.<br />
<br />
The other thing to remember is that guilds that impose these sorts of restrictions on applications often do so to test apps to see if they have what it takes to make things happen for them, since those are the sorts of people they usually want.</div></div><hr />
