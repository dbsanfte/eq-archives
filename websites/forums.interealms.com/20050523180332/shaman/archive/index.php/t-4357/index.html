<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jasornik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok listen I have been playing eq since kunark came out and quit right about when the moon expansion came out. I decided I wanted to try something new, Dark Age of Camelot. Well I am getting bored of this now and thinking of coming back.<br />
<br />
<br />
Did Verant do anything to the game at all. Excuse me living in a shell</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A hell of a lot has changed since luclin came out, best thing you can do is read through the old patch messages, it will take a while but will give you a good idea of the changes:<br />
<br />
http://eq.crgaming.com/patches.asp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jasornik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">*sigh* I don't mean to be a bother but is it possible someone could just give a short summary of the major things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">High level game is still raid orientated.  It's claimed that PoP is to be more exp. group orientated but there's little sign of that in the latest press releases (unless gods can be killed by exp. groups now)<br />
<br />
Caster balancing hasn't gotten far and is now on hold until PoP completed.  What balancing there is - focus items - is mostly for twinks or people who can afford uber items.<br />
<br />
Bazaar is in and imho is very nice.<br />
<br />
Luclin graphics require much higher performance machines.  A lot of people don't use them anyway as in the bazaar you will lag to death.<br />
<br />
Kunark spell drop rate was doubled, so Torpor now drops twice a blue moon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Originally posted by CrustyOldShaman <br />
Kunark spell drop rate was doubled <br />
<br />
is that true  ? or am i just being gullible</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Pets supposedly don't break mez anymore, or aggro monsters if they are not engaged in a fight.<br />
<br />
10% healing penality was removed from non-clerics.<br />
<br />
DoT nerf on moving mobs was removed.<br />
<br />
Tons and Tons of very nice trade skill items were added.<br />
<br />
Alt Abilities were added, some of which are VERY nice.  Some of course are crap.<br />
<br />
Caster Focus Items were added.  They do various things; make spells last longer, cast faster, use less mana etc.  <br />
<br />
Newbies now return to their bind point fully dressed with no xp loss until after level 10.<br />
<br />
The Bazaar is in the game and functioning.  Very easy to make a nicely equiped twink in mid level gear now. :)<br />
<br />
Shared chat channels are in the game.  Can also talk CROSS Server now.<br />
<br />
IMO the game is more interesting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Actually, it's pretty obvious that you do mean to be a bother.<br />
<br />
You can now spend XP on things other than levelling.<br />
For the most part, many tradeskills are now actually useful.<br />
The game has a compass.<br />
By typing /guide you can get the /locs of important landmarks in every zone.<br />
Mages have a vital raiding role.<br />
Many items in the game now have focus effects for casters.<br />
Pets no longer aggro mobs.<br />
Pets us the AC of their owner.<br />
Pets no longer attack mezzed mobs.<br />
The new Graphical User Interface can be customized to show you almost anything that you want, including maps of zones, your pet's health, etc.<br />
The drop rate on Torpor and Malo has been drastically increased.<br />
With enough AAs, rangers now officially kick ass.<br />
Five wizards can kill any Kunark mob.<br />
Everyone gets two extra spell gems for memorizing spells.<br />
Ancient spells, extremely powerful versions of older spells, now drop exclusively from a three hour ring encounter in North Temple of Veeshan.<br />
Shaman DoTs are now lure.<br />
EQ now costs $12 a month.<br />
Bloodgills are blue.<br />
Pets now use their owners resists.<br />
<br />
I made up several of the above. You can find out which by not being lazy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jasornik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks for everones help.<br />
<br />
Bahimiron, notice you were the only one who was a jackass :(<br />
<br />
Anyways good luck, looks like I will open my account (hopefully my guys are still there) ;)<br />
<br />
Again thanks a lot!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Laugh!  I was about to ask about this one:<br />
<br />
By typing /guide you can get the /locs of important landmarks in every zone<br />
<br />
<br />
Then I kept reading ;P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Lemiak Purdyun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">just 4 made up right? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Anomalos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Jasornik,<br />
<br />
You posted this on monkly business boards already, and got knows what else.  There is no quick summary.  You've been gone for a time that more changes have been made than could be summarized.  Also, when you post on a shaman board, people assume you're playing a shaman, so they'll talk about shaman changes.  Same thing on a monk board.  Try freaking posting the class/levels of all your chars on their respective boards, then maybe you'll get a better response.<br />
<br />
Besides, what you're doing is like going to someone who watches CNN every day and say, can you tell me what's happened in the world in since last november.  You know...if you could summarize it in a few sentences, that'd be great.  Things change daily pretty much.  By daily I mean every day things are discovered/discussed, and those daily discussions lead to a patch, eventually.  <br />
<br />
Go troll somewhere else.<br />
<br />
Bahimiron, notice you were the only one who was a jackass <br />
<br />
Bahimiron simply told you to not be lazy.  That's what 10+ people told you at monkly-business.  If 1 person makes a comment, it's an opinion.  If a few people agree, it becomes popular opinion.  If 99% of the people believe it to be true, then I say it becomes fact.  You're lazy.  Go to sony's site, and read the patches for the last 8 months if you're so interested.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Preach on Anomalos.<br />
<br />
/cheer<br />
<br />
Also Jasornik, you can look at the eq castersrealm archives.<br />
<br />
Both those and the patch messages hold a lot of information that I'm sure will keep busy for a while.</div></div><hr />
