<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>magiclee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">first of all,I'm totally newbie here and just join the everquest adventure in a couple of days.<br />
So the question may seem too...simple.<br />
<br />
Anyway,the icegoblin caster necklace given by Shamus Felligan,I just cant find the goblin caster spawn spot.Any help with the spawn spot location will be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">hrrm i would guess its in one of the igloos, but i cant comment for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">sweet!  i know this one.<br />
<br />
as you go out to EFrost from the guard Bandl, take a right and hug the wall.<br />
<br />
around the corner is two huts for goobs, that is where casters spawn.  if you decide to do this, i would recommend you med and heal at the standard (flag on a stick) away from the huts, mobs cycle thru there often that will kill you.<br />
<br />
it will be the longest camp of your entire life.<br />
<br />
you can start there at lvl 4 and get exp till 7, you will still get exp for turning in the shattered caster necks later.<br />
<br />
the NON shattered beads are one of the rarest things in the game, i would suggest you look at the initiate symbols of the tribunal and just run to Qeynos and back</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">more hot info, if you do this.<br />
<br />
loot is not poor for the lvl and they gobos drop wrist pouchs, boxes and the occassional pack back.  <br />
<br />
save the regular (non caster) ice necks for the quest in the Warrior guild.<br />
<br />
you will get random 5th lvl spells for the shattered caster beads.<br />
<br />
they also drop an inordinate amount of booze.  beer and stuffs.<br />
<br />
as you face the huts, there is 3 spawns.  the one on the right, outside the hut, and 1 in each hut.  casters spawn at all three spots.<br />
<br />
depending on lvl, you might want to tag them to Bandl the first time to break up the spawn.<br />
<br />
the weapon stinks, but it was my first magic weap over 2 years ago.  <br />
<br />
now the tribunal symbol quest gets you a neck slot item that summons a hammer, and is far easier to do.  <br />
<br />
but before i got my ebon war spear, there wasn't a barb shaman that wasn't amazed i had the quest hammer when he inspected my gear.<br />
<br />
it is that rare</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>magiclee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">cool<br />
I havnet expected the detail answer like this.<br />
<br />
The information helps a lot.Thank you very much  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">when EQ first started the mobs near that camp dropped box of abukar's too...<br />
<br />
oh the good ol days</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>luvless??</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i tried doing this quest because i didn't have a 1hb and i was bored..  wrong choice!! haha<br />
<br />
anway.. someone said that the camp might be triggered by the camp north of bandl too (that's to the left).. seeing as i was lv 45 at the time (told you i was bored)... i just ran back and forth..<br />
<br />
i don't know fi it was just a spawn timer or what.. but it seems pretty reasonable.. kill one camp and the other is popped.. so if you need something to do while you're waiting.. now you got something :)<br />
<br />
<br />
note: i think i read somewhere that the goblin camp closest to halas (down the noob ramp stay to the right).. also pops the caster.. although i've never seen him there that i recall..</div></div><hr />
