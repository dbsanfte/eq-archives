<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Inqubus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just thought I'd post this since I figured it out on my own and might save someone some grief.<br />
<br />
The different UI mods I was using didn't seem to play well with the XML files they patched tonight and I was crashing to desktop on both comps I run.  I loaded default and all was honky dory.<br />
<br />
So I decided to recopy the default files to my mod directory again and copied the exact same files I was using before back into the mod directory, and wallah, it was all fine again.<br />
<br />
Don't know what they changed, but it definitely broke something somewhere and just required copying the default into the mod directory and moving the modded files back again.<br />
<br />
Hope this saves anyone from freaking like I did to see my slimmed down UI crashing EQ :D</div></div><hr />
