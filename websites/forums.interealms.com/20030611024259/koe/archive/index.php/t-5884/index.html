(For the uninitiated..<br />

&quot;..as best as I can tell, it started in the early 90's as a generic Sega Genesis game--your generic side-scroller shoot-em-up. The intro was poorly translated from Japanese to Engrish and contains quite a few grammatical errors. At some point in time, people picked up on it and started making fun of it. At some later point in time, people decided to doctor pictures and insert various phrases from the game (&quot;All your base are belong to us&quot; being one of the most popular). When you stop and think about it it is not very funny and even a little annoying...but when you don't, it just gets more and more funny the more and more you see and say the various phrases.<br />
<br />
This whole phenomena has been going on since at least December 2000. Very recently (February 2001), I picked up on it from Memepool. As I stated, it was really dumb, but something about it was just so incredibly funny that my friends and I kept saying it at work, emailing it, and ICQ'ing it across the globe. In the last couple of days, I have been hearing it from so many different people, most of which have picked up on the &quot;joke&quot; from all over the place.<br />
<br />
This is yet another example of a viral meme that will probably die off in another month....&quot;<br />

Yes, I spent many a day a year or two ago just surfing around looking for all of that stuff I could find.   Still pretty funny.</div></div><hr />
