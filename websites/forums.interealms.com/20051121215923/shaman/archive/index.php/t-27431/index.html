World of Warcraft Reaches New Heights - 7/20/05<br />
<br />
We're proud to announce that World of Warcraft has been embraced my more than 1.5 million players in China since its launch there last month, bringing the total worldwide population for the game to 3.5 million players! We want to take this moment to again thank all of our players for helping us bring the world of Azeroth to life.</div></div><hr />

bye!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>bumluc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Oh dear God please don't let anyone on this board be interested in anything other than EQ.  And don't let your carrots touch your peas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">And don't let your carrots touch your peas.<br />
<br />
^^ Best piece of advice currently on the boards.<br />
<br />
NEVER EVER let your peas touch your carrots. Peas are nasty, awful, mushy little green things. They are horrible. NEVER let your peas touch anything. In fact, they shouldn't even be &quot;your&quot; peas, because you shouldn't be eating them in the first place. Nastiness.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">People on this board can be interested in whatever they like.  But if they want to discuss those interests, they should do so on the boards that are specifically set aside for such.  This is the Everquest discussion board, there's another one for Warcraft.  Why then do we have recurring posts about Warcraft here?<br />
<br />
As an analogy, people don't go to AA meetings to discuss their coke habit, or their toenail fungus.  Certainly addiction-prone folks can have multiple problems, but in AA meetings, they deal with their battle with the bottle.</div></div><hr />

It is considerate of you, but please refrain. If I was a person who lets say didn't give a damn about wow, but I wanted to know how many they sold in china (or whatever), I would click on the wow area and use the search feature, or make a post in that section. <br />
<br />
Do EQ people post in the wow sections talking about the new expansion? I have not clicked over there ever, so I wouldn't know, but if we are we also should stop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I changed the title of the thread so that non-interested parties can avoid this thread.<br />

The more it gets bumped, the longer it stays on page one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">How about moving it to the WoW section?<br />
<br />
No, lets not, for no apparent reason.... change the title though...... come on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Denorea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">EQ vs. WoW!!!111!!one<br />
<br />
Lets get some baby oil or jello and they can go at it (the games I mean)<br />
<br />
Why do EQers hate WoW? and I've seen people who play WoW badmouth EQ.  Can't we all just get along?   Do we have bigotry in the gaming world?  I give EQ my whole heart &lt;3 and WoW is where I go when I wanna get a little on the side ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">We don't hate WoW.  We hate the pushy fanboys who think we care at all about their game.  Since we must want news about it, even though we don't look for it, or ask for it, or go places to talk with those who do look for it.  Right?  Must all be a playing hard-to-get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Warren Maguson Emarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Though strangely enough, the person who seems to want people to **** about WoW in every way shape or form has managed to bump this thread more times than anyone else...  <br />
<br />
It's been said before, if you dont like the content of a thread, avoid it, dont reply to it, and it'll die on it's own... the more you post, the longer it stays around.  <br />
<br />
I found the information interesting and I don't frequent the World of Warcraft forum because while I found it interesting, I dont care about the MMORPG 'wars'.  <br />
<br />
I appreciate that Thunderwolf posted it but I'm certainly not going to pat him on the back for a 'thread well done'.   <br />
<br />
My advice, relax.  A lot of venom wasted for no particularly good reason. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">How about moving it to the WoW section?<br />
<br />
No, lets not, for no apparent reason.... change the title though...... come on.<br />
<br />
I changed the title so that those who don't give a damn about WoW can avoid this thread without clicking on it to figure out what the hell 3.5 relates to.<br />
<br />
And lest everyone forget, this is, by default or design, not only the forum for General Everquest Shaman discussion, but General MMORPGLMNOP Shaman discussion - the concensus having been that a special forum for game-generic Shaman discussion would be a waste.<br />
<br />
If I understand the concensus (such as it was) reached in http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?postid=312056 it was that other-game specific posts belong in the other-game section; generic cross-game issues and even non-game-bashing discussion are fine in the general section.<br />
<br />
However, upon rereading this thread, I agree that it belongs in the WoW section, so cheers.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">OK, I admit it, I love to post the WoW numbers.  Yeah, 3.5 million players, that's incredible.  I remember when WoW launched and the discussions began here on it's impending failure, how most thought it would not even reach EQ levels of 500k players in the first year.  However, it's not that WoW is a better game, I think it's clear that Blizzard is better at marketing their game than Sony.  <br />
<br />
I love EQ and I love WoW.  Funny how for so many people it's either/or.  Go figure?</div></div><hr />
