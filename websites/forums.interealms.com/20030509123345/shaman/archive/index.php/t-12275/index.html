<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grimmlukk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just brought a computer home from work a while back that has a faster processor than my other boxes at home, but less RAM: 1.7 GHz P4 w/ 256 RAM, Radeon 7500 video card, think its 128, might be 64, running WinXP w/ a cable modem connection.<br />
<br />
Here's the problem: I zone like molasses!! It takes at LEAST 2 1/2 minutes for me to zone in any POP zone, sometimes (when theres a lot of ppl on) it take 5-6 minutes to zone. Seems to be much worse in Luclin and POP (especially POP!), but the box takes at least 2 times as long to load as any other machine I have played EQ on - maybe 5x longer than my 700MHz P3 with a 32MB video card and 768MB of RAM.<br />
<br />
I just ordered an additional 512MB of RAM ($162 w/ shipping for Rambus - not TOO bad), which will bring my RAM to a more respectable level.<br />
<br />
Thoughts? Will the RAM upgrade do the trick?<br />
<br />
I seem to recall a ATI 7500 driver problem of some sort, too. Anybody have any info on that?<br />
<br />
Thanks, in advance, for your help! <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">ram made a huge difference in zoning for me.  turning on texture caching also made a big difference in zoning for me.<br />
<br />
I don't have an ati card though so I can't comment on that part of your question.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There was a driver problem for the 7500.  Updated drivers took care of that a while ago.  RAM makes a godlike difference in how the game plays; even going from 768 to 1024 makes a difference.<br />
<br />
Turning on the texture cache will dramatically reduce load times for zones, on your second and subsequent visits to the zone.<br />
<br />
The files can get corrupted, and new graphics added to the game can mess up how the caches work, so if you see things like all your inventory icons looking like bead necklaces, or our feared &quot;clown dog,&quot; delete the *.txc files from your EQ directory.</div></div><hr />
