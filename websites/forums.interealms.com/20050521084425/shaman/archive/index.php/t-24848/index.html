<br />
I understand that there is a FT limit of 15. Is this 15 for equipment items only? If I buy all my AA FT effects do those count towards that 15 total or are they in addition to it?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes, 15 is the worn FT limit (unless you use AA to bump that up to a max of 18 worn). Worn includes tribute, but not spells/buffs, AA (MC), innate or songs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>biran808</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks did not know that tribute was counted. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kilgaroz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There are clicky buffs out there as well that will allow you to exceed FT18, but they're not common and you have to murder the clerics to get your hands on them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hey Samanna, just to be certain (I can be a little dense sometimes) my understanding is that with my current gear, FT 10, and tribute running at level 5, FT5, I am at FT 15 worn, which is max.  Therefore, adding any more FT gear only allows me to decrease my tribute, but will not allow me to exceed my current level of worn FT.  Is this correct?  Thanks.</div></div><hr />

Yes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I thought OOW AA could give 5 more to the worn FT cap?<br />
<br />
Havent bought it yet but its showing 0/5 and 5 for the cost. Was assuming would be 5 levels for 25 points. Am i reading something wrong?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">No, you are correct Shilzah.  There is an AA with OOW that allows you to increase your FT by 5 (for max 20) that runs 5 points per level (each level grants 1 additional FT).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah. Worn (including Tribute) caps at 15 (or more if you have the AA to raise your worn FT cap).<br />
<br />
Clicky MR buffs count like KEI or whatever - buffs, not towards FT cap. <br />
<br />
Just be careful, some stuff that was clicky was converted to worn a while back, I think, like some VT stuff. At least, I was under that impression.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Wow, I did not know that tribute wouldn't stack past the worn limit.  I can reduce the FT amount I'm getting from tribute by 2 now, woot.</div></div><hr />
