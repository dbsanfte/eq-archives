<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Piwacket</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I want to thank Brenlo and Rytan (the spell guy) and the Devs for listening to us and fixing our heals. :D <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ahem... &quot;addressing&quot; our heals would be a better term.  Although I do appreciate the attention, I'm hoping someone watches and reevaluates whether 250 more HP is enough for our direct heal in the coming weeks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, it's a nice start. It's also confirmation that<br />
they actually are aware of the issue. I hope they<br />
evaluate it to see if it's enough; I would't call our<br />
heals &quot;fixed&quot; just yet though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Whether they are fixed or not, I do want to add my appreciation for the fact that they listened to our concerns, and did something.  Some will argue that it is not enough, others will argue that its just right, and some while just whine and complain endlessly.  Such is life.  In any case, I'm happy to know that our issues are being looked and and I'm happy to see real action.  I was frankly stunned with the speed at which these changes occured (in a good way).</div></div><hr />

Once again I find myself sharing your sentiment, well said.  I had been discouraged after the last patch, when BoT got nerfed.  Seemed that they were not listening and actually going in the opposite direction. <br />
<br />
However, they came here and posted their views and committed to taking action.  In less than a week, the new and upgraded spells went on test and then live.  Bravo, a quick and positive response.  That is all I was looking for, some indication that the devs do care about class balance and shaman issues in general.<br />
<br />
I will continue to advocate for additional &quot;tweaks&quot;, but will also continue to enjoy playing my shaman.<br />
<br />
Thanks guys.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">the devs are listening and watching, this is a good thing, even if we dont get all we want or need any imporvments at this stage are a big help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tyck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Agreement and a solid congratulations on a very nice recovery from a very nasty situation.<br />
<br />
It will certainly be an interesting few weeks as we explore this new level of our relationship with Ryan and Brenlo.<br />
<br />
I think we can all safely say that the Shaman Readiness Index can be downgraded to:<br />
Code: Lavender - guardedly optimistic</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>korask shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Im never gonna be a fulltime healer for a group really, but when the healer bites it and the tank is getting whacked for 1500 doubles on a mob that mitigates slow, i'd like to at least be able to put out enough healing to survive that fight with a good tank. (in one group adventures).  With this it should be possible now.</div></div><hr />
