<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, normally I'm not a spelling nazi, but 2 things have been driving me nuts over the last few months.  Accordingly, the following is a public service announcement--<br />
<br />
The 2 most common spelling errors I see around here:<br />
<br />
MITIGATION--To moderate (a quality or condition) in force or intensity; alleviate. To become milder. <br />
<br />
Midigation is not now, nor, to the best of my knowledge, have it ever been a word.  Midigation sounds like Norse term for leaving Asgard and heading to Midgar. <br />
<br />
Ridiculous--Deserving or inspiring ridicule; absurd, preposterous, or silly.<br />
<br />
Example:  Equating Rytan with intelligence is ridiculous.  Expecting something beneficial for shaman from Rytan is ridiculous.<br />
<br />
It's bloody hard to write anything that's remotely thought-provoking or persuasive when you immediately run into a spelling error.  It's hard to attach significance a post when your first thought is, &quot;How much weight should I attach to the opinion of someone who's too stupid to spell something that they claim has totally screwed them.  If it was that important, they'd have learned to spell it, right?&quot;<br />
<br />

Thank you!  Carry on!<br />

At least as we're playing EQ side by side he stops and asks me how to spell things.  Unfortunately, we don't always play together.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, I'd be embarrassed if I misspelled something and someone called me out about it.  Not everyone got a's in english class.</div></div><hr />

Also, a very similar one is the difference between your and you're.<br />
<br />
This was very well explained by a guildmate from a guild I was once a member of, and he has since retired.  He was known as the guild grammar/spelling nazi.  As he put it, it's &quot;Your dumb a**, versus you're a dumba**.  :D<br />
<br />
Im pretty bad about correcting folks with spelling.  I know i typo some things occasionally, and sometimes it's not a lack of know-how in the spelling department, just my fingers hit the wrong key as I go (i use 2-3 fingers and hen peck the keys, as fast as most type the proper way heh!).<br />
I do generally notice and fix the typos immediately afterward though.  Things like U, wru, 2, 4, and the like also bug the daylights out of me.  how hard is it to use for instead of 4?  what about to versus 2?  pure laziness.... granted I understand the purpose of stuff like lol, rofl, brb, afk, and that like, but eh, fine line I spose... I'm a grammar nazi.  Help it I cannot.<br />
<br />
As to whomever made the comment about english class and A's.... I never once had an A in english class during grade school or high school.  a low B was my best, if that.... English class was not my forte, spelling on the other hand, I did blindfolded back then.. go figure.<br />
<br />
[edit]<br />
Ahh bugger!  I forgot a space between the first dumb / a** :( Oh well...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Halybuton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Just  my 2 coppers worth in regards to the spelling/typing of MITIGATION ( ;P )<br />
<br />
Most people tend to type things out phoenetically In other words spell it as to how they pronounce a word.  heck I tend to do the same thing  and most times i'm in the middle of doing like 40 billion things and don't have time to proof read what I type/write especially in  game and I'm a lousy typer lol  ( not to mention mistell between the various chat channels I  participate in)<br />
<br />
In today's vernacular Mitigation  does make the &quot;T&quot; in the word sound like a &quot;D&quot;  but at least when someone is typing out mitigation they aren't typing it out as mehdehgayshun as it would actually be spelled out phoenetically<br />
<br />
oh and for the person who mentioned taking the &quot;R&quot; out of warsh lol the very first time I heard wash pronounced warsh I had just moved to Tennesee from Miami, Fl  was going into 3rd grade and  had a heck of a time figureing out what they were talking about  lol took me 4 months of actually  learning to speak &quot;southern&quot; that I understood what my new neighbors were saying.  But even stranger was when I moved back to Tennessee after spending my first 2 years of high School in Singapore and getting used to the harsh sound of &quot;R&quot; after hearing the soft British  &quot;R&quot;  Now after having taken a few years of Spanish and having retired formt eh U S navy i can pretty much  understand someone  who has an accent that is different from my own and if any of you ever get the chance to have teh folly of meeting me IRL and hang out with me   You know I am tired when I start speaking with a southern drawl</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kryscha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I have to admit, despite my normal complaints about the 'tards in EQ with their plz, thx, etc, it's got nothing on what I run into in WoW on a daily basis.<br />
<br />
wut != what (you morons!)<br />
ne1 != anyone <br />
sum != some<br />
The list just goes on and on /sigh<br />
<br />
It is not uncommon to see all three of these spelling atrocities in one sentence. &quot;Wut&quot; for some reason particularly enrages me. My girlfriend just laughs at me whenever I sit at my computer seething over someone's use of it.  <br />
<br />
I miss the simple EQ spelling mistakes such as &quot;70 rouge LFG&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Tidykat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">In addition to what Halybuton brought up, people are funny like that.. they'll say 'warsh' instead of 'wash'.  Did I miss something? Last I knew there was no 'r' in 'wash'. Dopes.  Or my grandmother who absolutely cannot comprehend that whenever she says Tiger (local restaurant called &quot;The Tiger's Den&quot; (yes, there really is an apostraphe in it, go figure), she mispronounces it, and it comes out as 'tager' as opposed to 'tiger'.  Annoying as all can be.  And the people who say 'bolth', as opposed to 'both'.  When did the 'L' character take up residence in that word?  People :(<br />
<br />
As for the apostraphe + s thing, I always figured it as &quot; 's &quot; is essentially adding &quot;is&quot; to the end of the word, instead of using 'is' in the sentence.   Course it doesn't work in all situations, atouch and go sort of thing.  and as a kid,back when spelling was an actual subject in grade school and words like 'important' were considered tough to spell, I simply broke it down.  I could spell 'important' long before the rest of my class, simply by spelling it as 'imp', 'ort', 'ant'.  Heck, 2 of those syllables form other words, how easy is that? Maybe i'm just a tard :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>lestumpette</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I used to think I was anally retentive until I saw this post.  Yay Chutoi !<br />
<br />
My personal dislike is to see people saying &quot;I could care less&quot; when they are saying they aren't concerned/bothered/annoyed by something.<br />
Saying that actually means the opposite.<br />
If something doesn't bother you then the sentance ought to read:<br />
&quot;I could NOT care less&quot; or &quot; I COULDN'T care less&quot;.<br />
<br />
Translation: If you already are caring the least possible amount about something (i.e. it doesn't bother you) then you can't, by definition, care any less.  I hope I made sense  :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I believe the expression comes from ignorant people picking up from more intelligent folks who used it as abreviation for a longer more sarcastic statement.  The unspoken completion should be &quot;but it would be very, very hard,&quot; or with a pause &quot;...nahhh, no I couldn't!&quot; or &quot;but not without trying, and I'd need to care more to do that!&quot; (any of which followed by a very snooty &quot;hah hah!&quot;)<br />
<br />
There are quite a few of this innapropriate co-opting situations floating around.  It's just ignorance.  The other day someone who considers herself very well informed politically from talk radio was debating the Terry Shiavo case.  She quoted to me the passage from the Constitution (of the United States) that runs &quot;life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness&quot;...  Not a grammar issue per se, just hilighting the laziness of Americans with regard to language.  As a culture, we've developed a pretty insane generalization of accomplishments, ability, and knowledge.  According to popular feeling, if anything is done or known within a group you identify with, then it is yours.  One small punctuation error for a man, one giant infalibility for mankind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Random thought #453:<br />
<br />
The noun &quot;affect&quot; and the verb &quot;to effect&quot; do have legitimate uses, but they are so rare in day to day conversations that you are unlikely to run into them, except perhaps in &quot;to effect change&quot;.<br />
<br />
Stick to &quot;effect&quot; for the noun and to &quot;to affect&quot; for the verb and you will be right 99+% of the time :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's another foible I've seen though,<br />
<br />
&quot;I should of healed earlier&quot; or &quot;I could of killed that mob if it hadn't enraged&quot;. It's what's known as &quot;Estuary English&quot; over here, specific to areas east of London, and it really gets on my goat!<br />
<br />
The correct usage is of course &quot;I could have killed&quot; or &quot;I could've killed&quot;.<br />
<br />
Oh, and &quot;its&quot; is another peeve of mine:<br />
<br />
* The pet killed its target (correct usage)<br />
* It's been a successful raid (correct usage)<br />
* The mob's been slowed! It's now a pansy! (correct, if annoying usage)<br />
* The mob cast it's self buffs before we pulled it (incorrect usage).<br />
