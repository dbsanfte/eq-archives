<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You trying to solo in here? Bewarned you cannot single pull golems in there till L56 I think it is.<br />
<br />
The trick is, well it is tricky.<br />
<br />
1. Have levitate up if solo<br />
<br />
2. MR up<br />
<br />
3. Inviso up<br />
<br />
4. Gate loaded<br />
<br />
Random mob can be spawned, either 2 slimes 2 skeles or a combo of either. But only 2.<br />
<br />
It is easy if you are a FD class since you can zone in and FD right away, wait till the mobs go around to the back of one of the 4 pillars then stand up.<br />
<br />
Since you can't just have those things up and zone in. If you get attacked right away remember that the outside ring is your friend. You can run from corner to corned and the mobs will always take the longest patch to you running around the outer area. Just root em down and dot kill em. <br />
<br />
If you get in trouble just run off the side right into the wall.. it is a 12 second drop with lev up to the bottom, more than enough time to get a gate off and try again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The trick is to have lots of hps before zoning in.  If you know you are going to try to break it solo, get an Aego ahead of time, or at least a good couple of buffs to help you out.  The HTs are gonna hurt if two skellies are up, so be prepared to self heal.  <br />
<br />
Usually tho, it's one HT skelly and one Ravenous Gnawer (sperm thingy).  Also, if you zone in and dont move, you should be able to turn about and see where stuff is before aggroing anything.  Make sure to lead with a slow, and use root liberally.  <br />
<br />
Oh, one other trick.  U need lev up for this tho.  If yer getting owned, jump off the edge and float down to the top of the house.  You can camp out here, come back, and then float under the house roof to the glowing red ball which when clicked will port u back to entr to give it another try.  <br />
<br />
Actually a good strategy for a low level like you would be to do that right after you take the HTs.  Then all you need to do is heal up and port back up to engage the now HT-less mobs.  Without HT they really aren't bad.  <br />
<br />
Again the key is to have enuf hps to live thru the opening volley.  If you don't, don't zone in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>dirtybax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think those guys HT for around 700-750.  So shoot for 1600+ hp at the very least.<br />
<br />
~Bax</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Torlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Trick I used last night.  Have an ITU potion ready and after zone in, drink it. Worked great.  Had two HT'ing skellies and neither one saw me and was a fairly easy break.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lumes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I havent been to HS in over a year but I think I solod 57-58 there, likely 54 is a bit low to be zoning into this zone solo. There are 2 mobs that patrol the zone in and will attack you within a few moments of zone in, sometimes you will get lucky and one of them will be a ravager that doesnt see invis and you can jockey yourself around the other that will likely be undead so that he doesnt agro you until you are ready. Most likely tho both mobs will be undead so try taking a potion of unlife awareness with you (didnt have those back in my day).<br />
  If there are two SK mobs up at zone in all bets are off you will most likely die to the two HT's and the immediate melee attacks that will follow.<br />
  Personally I had MUCH better luck in the pit under the zone in pad. More room to maneuver and unless you are a troll with snare necklace you WILL eventually have a mob break root and run at the zone in, warp across the stair trap and agro 3-4 mobs on you and again you die.<br />
  IF you can master the tricks of soloing the zone in area and have some Naked Solo CR ninja maneuvers then this is a great zone for 57ish solo as the exp here is so insane I think I remember recovering the exp lost from unresed deaths in this zone (me and a necro were the only ones there for a week) in under an hour.<br />
  Take advantage of the ****ty pathing to root if you have to then burn em down with Some dots and jbb, killing the first one fast is the key so mana dump him with enough left over to keep 2nd rooted.<br />
   I think I had to naked CR before with 2 SKs up at the zone, came in with levitate, ran to pit wall, camped while sinking, was camped before pathing caught up with me, has to be in the corner that gets you farthest away from zone in pad tho I believe, good meathod to break into the pit for some solo action.<br />
  Personally I wouldnt waste time with the zone in pad golems, after a few hours of chain nuking with root you will get a runner that will get you dead, less you keep levitate up the entire time to get away far enough for a gate maybe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Originally posted by soupypoopy <br />
And a tip for the HS wanderers: Lev up before zoning in. Upon zone-in, aggro both wanderers and run off the north stairs and float into the basement. Take your time -- you want the wanderers to follow you down -- then gate. Now you've got the entryway free and clear of wanderers for the duration of your stay. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Lumes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hm never tried that, seems that the &quot;roamers&quot; should return to their pathing around the zone in pad a few mins after losing agro, less they get stuck due to the shi tty pathing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>ZernSaintwinter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">woot thanks for replies!<br />
<br />
 ok was in a group of 4, myself 54 shamy, 53 wiz,55monk,55 cleric. None of us have been there before. <br />
 Monk zones in 1st says it's ok. rest of us zone. i was slowest zoner. by the time i got there, monk, cleric were dead, wiz was taking her last breath. ACK!<br />
<br />
 we will try HS again tonight. thanks again everyone for the tips. turn right and float down. i take it the mobs don't follow?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Lumes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yes they do but it takes a little while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Lumes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The 4 of you should be able to break the 2 zone mobs cakelike, <br />
Monk zones in, FDs at zone in pad, lets you know what to expect in case you can use invis vs undead to get you all in w/o agro.<br />
 You zone 2nd since your the slowest.<br />
Yawn both, root one out of the fight.<br />
  Cleric zones hoepfully near same time as you, time both your zones, use that time to offset the clerics zone in time due to your slow zone time.<br />
   Wizard zones in to finish em off quicklike and suck exp cause hes the only way the monk can get out ;p<br />
  Hell I'd invest in some gate potions, leave the rest behind while you and the monk make 59th in 10 days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">At 58 (epic+jbb) I am looking for a good solo spot and thought about trying HS. <br />
<br />
But I am confused. I have never been to HS and I read things like &quot;run off the north stairs and float to the basement&quot;. <br />
<br />
Is the zone in an elevated platform that you can just  run off of?<br />
<br />
If so, why &quot;run off the North stairs&quot;? Why not just run off the platform in any direction? <br />
<br />
I see from a map that one of the stairs has a pit trap on it...the east stairs. If the zone in isnt something you can just run off, do you go down this trap?<br />
<br />
If you fall off the zone in anyway you can...do you always end up in the same place?<br />
<br />
<br />
I guess I am having a hard time picturing what you are all descibing. Thanks for any helpful answers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I started going to HS at level 54, and I had a terrible time.  I died sooo many times in 2 days, that I was ready to throw in the towel.  Although I kept at it and eventually found a strategy that worked for me.<br />
<br />
Zone in buffed to the gills, including levitate, sow, and invis.  Also have gate memed at all times, never unmem this spell even for a second. <br />
<br />
If 2 skeletons are up, be prepared for 2 harmtouches, however the max harmtouch from one of them is in the 500's and most of them are in the 400's.  First thing to do is root them, slow them, then heal yourself.  Its not fun to do this, especially at 54, and especially with no experience doing it before, once you get it down, then you are good to go though.<br />
<br />
There are 2 problems with fighting here:<br />
-Low hp mobs will run, and they ALWAYS run to the east wing, where you dont want them to.  <br />
-The repop on the 2 zone in mobs makes soling a pain in the ass because of the harmtouch, and the downtime it adds.  <br />
<br />
Here is a way you can deal with both of these problems.<br />
1.  Time the spawns, dont pull a golem if you are about to have a repop, you never know if you will get an add, or a runner.  repop time is 21 mins if i remember correctly.<br />
<br />
2. Always pull and fight to the northwest corner of the zone in.  This will make the mobs walk all the way around the outer edge before the hit the east stairs.  This gives you time to root, and reroot if it gets resisted (which WILL happen).<br />
<br />
Single pulling at level 54 is hard, but you can do it about half the time.   This is a dangerous place to solo, but the exp is well worth the risk.  You can expect to die a few times, until you perfect your technique, and learn what to expect.  Be ready for an emergency, and be ready to gate if you get an add you can't handle.  I higly recomend using the level 14 root, because it can be cast on low mana, and it is the least likely to be resisted (i think).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Torlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Another thing to add, watch out for the Trap on the East Stairwell. Can be very nasty if you pull 2 Undertaker Skellies. I know for a fact they HT for 731 each....;0</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Baldkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Maybe this map.... http://www.eqmaps.com/m3/howling5.gif  <br />
<br />
Will help you understand a bit of HS.<br />
<br />
As for why you run off the north stairs, its because on the bottom floor the ground is sloped up and the north side is a bit higher wall, and its a relatively safe landing..<br />
<br />
Where as east/west have tunnels and wanderers, and the south end is where the wanderers seem to path.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>raburr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">north side drop area drops u to a SS thats elevated with rocks..if u dorp off any other side u will get like 4 ht's...mobs at those sides of the drops...OUCHIE<br />
<br />
My guild uses HS as its main lvl spot..due to no one comes in there mainly...we have people from 45-60 grouping in there...usually 2 groups going at all times...either soloing pit or working a wing..fun zone</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">HS is an extremely fun zone, and the key quest is also very easy.  It's so easy that I did it with my monk twink and a necro buddy when we were 46 and 45 respectively.  He still loves the zone at lvl 56, and we have been doing a bit of duo work in the north wing for lewt and exp.  That's the wing you can get to with the small candle key that drops off a sperm at the zone in, which is a platform connected by four flights of stairs, one to each direction, north, south, east, and west.  <br />
So far for lewt in the north wing we've got an Adamantite club (did a pricecheck, got 15k offer), siren's scale robe (nice robe, prolly 3k), and a couple sub par weapons and items including a 5 int 50 mana stein and a yak blade with identical stats to SSoY.  <br />
<br />
South wing is also very nice, very nice indeed if you have a group or just a solid strategy.  I got a sash of the dragonborne the other day there, so that was a solid gain.  <br />
<br />
North wing has a few mobs that are light blue to me at lvl 60.  I think this slows down exp for me somewhat, but I dont bitch cause my 56 necro buddy is gaining good exp.</div></div><hr />
