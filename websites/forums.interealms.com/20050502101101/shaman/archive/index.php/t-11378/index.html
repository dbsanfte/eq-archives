<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zilansis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">:eek: <br />
<br />
from here (http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=54405) <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
                           Research - an old skill given new life<br />
<br />
                           With this patch we introduced the ability for intelligence casters (Enchanters, Magicians,<br />
                           Necromancers and Wizards) to create additional spell scrolls using their research skill. Many of the<br />
                           newly researchable spells have only been available from quests or killing NPCs in the past. The new<br />
                           research still requires components from risky locations or dangerous foes. Our goal is to increase the<br />
                           number of ways to earn rare spells, without reducing the challenge required. <br />
<br />
                           This, however, creates a bit of an inequity between the intelligence casters and the priest classes<br />
                           (Clerics, Druids and Shaman) when it comes to acquiring this type of spell. While there is nothing<br />
                           inherently wrong with different classes earning their spells in different ways, we don't see a reason to<br />
                           give more options to one type of caster than another. In this case, we have taken the opportunity to<br />
                           give the research skill a little more value and at the same time negate any imbalance between classes.<br />
<br />
<br />
                           Some time in the near future we plan to introduce recipes for the creation of certain spells for the<br />
                           priest classes. Intelligence casters can use their research skill to create these priest spell scrolls, and<br />
                           priest classes will benefit by having an alternate method for obtaining these spells. This helps out both<br />
                           priests and intelligence casters, and creates a new niche for research as a trade skill. <br />

I agree.  Stop the whining.  This is a good thing.<br />

Of course, it helps that my spouse is an enchanter with a 170+ research skill, and has a Thought Horror Scalp (% bonus to research) to boot. :)<br />
<br />
Initial prices will be high I'm sure.  The tradeskills market today is cutthroat though, and someone will start the undercutting within the first week, if not the very first day.<br />
<br />
This is good news to priest classes.<br />

Even though it isnt something that we can activly do ourselves, (baring creating a research mule) it is something we have been asking for. An alternate method to getting spells.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know which Arcane Caster spells are now researchable? Kunark Era, Luclin Era, Velius Era? Knowing this would give us a good indication to which of our spells would be made researchable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Holy negativity.<br />
<br />
Agreed, for wis casters the optimum would have been some new 'own' solution. But still this is a very nice change. I am guildless at the moment and know 2 or 3 int casters -without further thinking- for a bit research, so what is the problem again?<br />
<br />
And even if i have to buy the research, i rather buy it for a few K plat from a fellow caster (who invested time to raise research by the way) than feeding some greedy, ripping me off, ******* excuse of a trader.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Every pure caster spell is now researchable from what I've seen on the boards. Even KEI for instance which is comparable to our malo/torpor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">On AB KEI goes for 5K-10K max<br />
<br />
I think this is great news. Even if you dont know any necros, Wizzys, or chanters with a research skill, there will be a lot of them combineing the spells just to sell them on. <br />
<br />
So The prices will come down.</div></div><hr />

This is a very good thing.  <br />
<br />
The priest classes will get a similar ability in the future like the message said.  Then no one will have to rely on an intel caster for the spells.<br />
<br />
This sounds like the intel casters got an update to a neglected skill, just like shaman got some new life in the alchemy skill.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not to be negative, but they've made similar statements many times in the past and not followed through.  But like people have said, if you don't know any int casters that will try combines for you, that's the least of your problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Yes, it's great that there will be an alternative to rare spell drops.<br />

<br />
What if the components are no drop?  Imagine being in a pickup group and seeing the rare torpor ingrediant go to the necro because he's the only one with research and wants it for his level 6 froggy shaman.<br />
<br />
We'll see how it plays out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A Wizard in our alliance posted a message asking for new runes.  The recipe for Levitation she gave was Rune of Conglomeration amd Rune of Current.<br />
<br />
Personally I hope it is along the lines of Paralysing Earth and we can use the spells they Research.  (i.e., Levitation and the new EB).</div></div><hr />

Enchanters get them also. Off hand I don't recall what they where but they can make them also.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">I would expect that all 60 and below dropped spells will be possible through alchemy in the near future.  Probably dropped items to make.  More likely things found in planes or in LoY.  My Shaman is only at 56, so I am hoping this goes live soon.  My condolences to all those still trying to get the spells.  I have helped others, and if I seen another GW, I think I am going to scream.</div></div><hr />

Couple that with bad luck at Emp groups and this will be a godsend :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Daksa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">I think if this turns out to be true, then this is a great development.  You probably heard my husbands wail of joy a couple of nights ago when he found out he would not have to pay for his 60+ Wizard spells.  Some of those spells, if you could find then on a trader, were over 90k.  Not many people have that kind of plat.  If I can get torpor by collecting some rare components I'm all for trying.  I can tell you this if you find a person who plays a wizzy as a main and you bring him the components, 9 times out of 10 they will combine for free.  They know what it's like to pay out of the nose for spells and are very sympathetic.   This new development means I may actually get my hands on torpor someday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Vhalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">I am very happy about this. And so what if its a pure caster making it, if you dont have int-friends tough luck buddy you wouldnt get the spell without them anyways (go ahead, solo Trak 50 times before one copy drops) ... the price on the spells will drop too.<br />
<br />
BUT, letting int casters make their spells AND our spells is not exactly evensies. It's another slapped on fix requiring the least amount of work. <br />
<br />
--hell no, I can make illusion potions now and thats a slap in a face to enchanters no? <br />
<br />
Also, it will not drop of soulsek/rallos because thats where runes for lvl65 drop and youll get 65torpor/malo from there. It will drop at places where current components for those spells drop, which means you have a chance getting some of them from Sebilis and Velks (I saw few of them drop on a raid from regular mobs in Akheva last night)</div></div><hr />

OMG so FIRED!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">For some reason the game designer/managers don't want to trivialize the drop rates on these spells.  Perhaps they see that trvializing our high-level skills would attract too many Dr00d types and they're trying to save us from the embarrasment.<br />
<br />
but probably not<br />
<br />
On the other hand, one additional way, regardless of difficulty, to get Topor and Malo might drop those spells' prices into the realm of reality: at 20K-25k these spells drop into the range of items that a small-to-medium guild could buy for a member, or that one dedicated shaman could earn after some time in Seb, Rathe, Planes, or even the new LoY greenie zones (4-10pp per kill on the beach wasn't half bad...even looted a mithril amulet (95pp)  off one of em).<br />

Da plural actual be &quot;shaman&quot; also, tho most dictionaries list &quot;shamans&quot; as being acceptable in common usage.<br />
<br />
Da &quot;-man&quot; part of da name ain't a derivative like &quot;fireman&quot;.  Word cums frum a Tungus word (know Tunguska in Russia?) &quot;saman&quot; and/or &quot;sramanah&quot; in Sanskrit.<br />
