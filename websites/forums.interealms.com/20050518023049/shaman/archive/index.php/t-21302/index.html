Reposted from the Shamans Crucible.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
To the Sony Online Entertainment Developers . . .<br />
<br />
The shaman community has been trying for the last couple of years to come up with some form of unified commentary to express unhappiness with the state of our class. This effort has met with failure a number of times, probably due to the sheer utility of the class. We can solo, group and raid—so people with different play styles have different views of the basic problems. The net result is that for the most part, we can’t agree on much of anything, other than the fact that the shaman, as a class, has issues. <br />
<br />
Shamans are plagued with the perception that we are being punished for the powerful combination of slow and torpor back in the Kunark expansion. Each and every expansion we fall farther behind other classes in healing and damage <br />
<br />
With the impetus of the current spells and abilities from Gates of Discord (“GoD”), discontent seems to have increased substantially. The general consensus is that we have reached our pinnacle of usefulness in Kunark and have wound up at the bottom of the heap in just about any measure of class balance. Mediocrity compared to the other specialized classes we can understand. Being dead last in basically all categories is a bit much of a penalty for utility.<br />
<br />
Another difficulty the shaman are facing is that we are suffering deficiencies in so many areas, that it looks like we’re asking for the world if we suggest fixes for them! However, in terms of balance, fixing one or two of the issues would effectively negate four or five others. For instance, addressing damage per second (“dps”) covers nukes, damage over time spells (“DoTs”) and pets concurrently. A fix in one of those areas might make changes in the others overpowering. Accordingly, we decided to post a list of problems we feel need to be addressed desperately. After all, you folks at SoE have to decide what constitutes balance in the end.<br />
<br />
We are definitely not asking for every suggestion to be fulfilled!<br />
<br />
Top 5 Issues as a result of the What do we need the most? Poll<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Healing <br />
<br />
Shaman healing is extremely weak when we have to debuff mobs before each encounter. This weakness is compounded greatly with mitigation. It is most severe on mobs that have high dps but die relatively quickly. That is why PoP-type mobs, with high dps and low hp relative to older expansion mobs, have marginalized shaman healing and slowing ability. We often fall into the dreaded &quot;tnarg chain&quot; cycle: a slow is resisted and the main tank takes so much damage we can't stop casting tnarg long enough to attempt another slow.<br />
<br />
Shaman healing is way behind other priests even when slow is factored in. Healing needs to be re-evaluated in comparison to other healing classes, including paladins. This review should include cast time, mana cost and amount healed. Our heal over time spells need improvements and we need access to a group heal. Exp group mobs hit harder in one round than we can heal.<br />
<br />
* No group healing ability<br />
* Smallest direct healing ability<br />
* No upgrades to our amount healed in our heal over time line, which we received in Kunark.<br />
* Proposed Quiescence upgrade with the new expansion is insufficient, an extra 60 hitpoints per tick can't match the increased mob damage<br />
* No MGBable/AE heal, like other priest classes and our hybrid class, beastlords.<br />
<br />
<br />
Healing Suggestions:<br />
<br />
* Some sort of group heal or group heal over time (with MGB option).<br />
* Some sort of upgrade to or improvement of Quiescence.<br />
* Some sort of faster, larger, and more efficient quick single-target heal, more on par with PoP mob damage<br />
* AA HOT ability<br />
<br />
<br />
2. Mana Regen <br />
<br />
In the past, cannibalize and our ability to regen mana was blamed for shortcomings in other areas, such as mana cost and duration of our buffs and manacost of heals. With the new and widespread abilities in passive manaregen for other classes, an upgrade to cannibalize 4 needs to be implemented. We are the only class forced into a position where we have to sacrifice so much to regain mana. Most other classes simply use a buff slot.<br />
<br />
* Other classes get mana regeneration methods that are nearly equivalent to shamans<br />
* FT and other enhancements increase mana regen rate across all mana using classes<br />
* Mana regeneration spells are widely available to other classes<br />
* Cannibalize is active mana-regen and has a large number of penalties when compared to passive mana-regen (can't cast any other spells while regaining mana, can't move while regaining mana, cannot engage in any social interaction while regenning mana due to constant clicking)<br />
* Permanent Spell Slot required<br />
* The current Canni upgrade is unsatisfactory and does not address any of our concerns.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mana Regen Suggestions:<br />
<br />
* New AA ability for Cannabalize. <br />
* An upgrade or addition to Cannibalization, allowing (at the same ratio), greater or more frequent conversions of HP to Mana<br />
Alternately, some across the board adjustment in mana cost for our spells, considering the cost of similar spells to other classes<br />
* Upgrade Can 4 - bigger bites, less clicking<br />
* New Canni AA - hastened cannibalize<br />
* Can 4 as an AA, to eliminate &quot;greyed-out&quot; spell gems<br />
* CAnnabilize over time spell/AA<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
3. Direct Damage Spells <br />
<br />
<br />
Our nukes need help. Even with major improvements to our DOT spells, we need a better nuke. There is no reason that hybrids should be nuking on the same level us a pure caster class.<br />
<br />
* Under powered<br />
* Slow casting (especially velium strike)<br />
* Resist rates on rains are high<br />
* No nuke over 1000 damage, rangers can nuke almost as well as shamans. All other casting classes have a higher DD spell (cleric, enchanter, mage, wizard, druid)<br />
* Highest level poison nuke is 675dmg (compare to hybrid nukes from POP expansion, RNG -700dmg, BST -675dmg, SK -660dmg)<br />
* No specialized damage increasing focus for poison nukes<br />
<br />
Direct Damage Suggestions:<br />
* Velium Strike changed to casting time 6.5 seconds<br />
* Alternative, a new poison nuke. Suggestion:<br />
Poison based nuke, level 65, casting time 6.0, 1200dmg. 400mana<br />
* An upgrade to our FIRE based nuke line, introduced at level 1 but then abandoned, would be nice<br />
* Addition of a disease nuke<br />
* Keep the poison/cold nukes, up damage <br />
* True AE damage, ditch the 4 target limitation!<br />
* Focus effects for our nuke lines (poison, proposed new disease nuke)<br />
* Detrimental spell haste AA (similar to Quickbuff AA) to reduce casting time<br />
* In an overwhelming majority , Crucible shaman are distressed by the proposed GoD 2.1 minute disease dot, please reconsider adding a new DD in its place!!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
4. Slowing <br />
<br />
In the past, it has been justified that many of the things we are lacking at (such as healing) are a result of the powerful nature of slow. This argument is no longer valid. Encounters are designed using slow mitigation and with full knowledge of the effects of slow. The difference in slows between shamans and enchanters is small, beastlords are close behind with their very fast casting slow. Other classes like bards, necromancers also have the ability to slow pretty well too. With the proliferation of slow spells across other these other classes, we cannot see why shaman should continue to be penalized for having slow. Additionally:<br />
<br />
* Current new slow in GoD is substantially inferior to our level 51 slow due to recast time and short duration, it will not replace turgurs.<br />
* Lack of non-essential spell gems preclude wasting a slot for new slow and having 2 slows memorized<br />
* Slow mitigation has decreased the substantive advantage we have over other classes that can slow<br />
* GoD Slow upgrade is insufficient, recast times and short duration, when paired with a nerf in effectiveness of the slow makes this spell undesirable<br />
<br />
Slowing Suggestions:<br />
<br />
* Reduced agro, mana cost, resist rate, and/or recast time on (an upgrade to) Turgur's Insects, which has been in its current state since Kunark was released six expansions ago<br />
* An AA ability that mitigates mitigation<br />
* An AA ability for a random chance to bypass mitigation<br />
<br />
<br />
5. Buffing <br />
<br />
Once the masters of melee buffing, shaman have seen their buffs become at best marginally useful. Weapons with avatar procs were introduced all the way back in velious (with no component!), many players are reaching their stat caps unbuffed, and the proliferation of ATK buffs from other classes make our attack buffs of less relative worth even with stacking. Our hybrid class, the beastlord, can buff HP, ATK, resists and mana regen to higher numbers than shaman, and can buff nearly as well in resists and statistic buffs. Further, there is no discernable reason that our buffs should cost more mana and last a shorter duration than other priest classes<br />
<br />
* Stat buffs at level 65 are largely useless because of stat caps<br />
* Our hybrid class can buff more pure HP than we can, plus more of the other relevant stats at 65, ATK and RESISTS<br />
* Our buffs are shorter duration and higher mana cost than other priest classes<br />
<br />
Buffing Suggestions:<br />
<br />
* Group FA<br />
* Stat buffs that are attractive to the stat capped<br />
* A new shaman buff of adding +10% to weapon skills, +10% dmg to procs, +10% to avoidance lasting 1 hour. As str/dex/sta is pretty much maxed by so many people at the high end making the only beneficial means of buffing being hp and resists<br />
* Endurance buffs! Logical choice for shaman<br />
* Buffs which go past the sta cap (For example: So is someone with 305 Stamina was buffed with Boar they'd hit 355. Same would hold true for people at level 60 with 255. They could reach 305 with our buffs. And at 65 with 280 you'd hit 340.)<br />
* Integrating attack buffs with focus<br />
* Focus or FA augmented with the following:<br />
+30 accuracy (lowers hit/miss ratio)<br />
+30 combat effects (increases proc rate)<br />
+2 shielding (lowers damage taken)<br />
+20 Strikethrough (You swing, they dodge, you strikethrough and hit them anyway)<br />
<br />
Another topic the shaman community would like to bring under your attention is that sometimes we don't understand the developer's vision behind some of the abilities/spells that we are given.<br />
<br />
We (as a community) feel that there are major differences between how the current Dev teams views the shaman class and its role in grouping/raiding scenarios and how previous dev teams saw this role. So we would like to invite one or more of the Devs to come to our board and start a dialogue with us on the views they have for our class and how we fit into the big picture, after all it is much easier to talk when you know how both parties see things instead of making assumptions.<br />
<br />
Such an explanation will also be helpful to understand if certain perceptions we have about game mechanics are correct (slow mitigation and resist rate on slow spells for example) and we from our side can show how those game mechanics affect our enjoyment in the game (take it from me, chain casting Cannibalize 4 is not very good for your ability to have a nice chat in your group).<br />
<br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Is that what you all feel are your top issues?<br />

<br />

<br />
Level 70 will break a lot of content, and will squeeze everyone into the same zones for experience.  I shudder to think what will happen considering they are going to churn this expansion out in 2? months...  Is that even enough time to fix 50% of the bugs and issues that will arise?  How can they possibly hope to test the expansion?  The live servers truly are the beta servers...<br />
<br />
oops..and on topic... I think the petition is somewhat outdated seeing as a couple of the issues have been partially (or better) fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">You bet they will open up the elementals to everyone with the new expansion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
just funnin!  Thanks for letting us know what's up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Not to state the obvious, but they have must have started working on this expansion about the same time they started on Gates.  This is looking like the real expansion, with Gates merely being a stop gap release.  There is absolutely no way they could even code this type of expansion in 2-3 months, let alone test, refine and prepare for commercial release.  What we are seeing is simply part 2 of the Gates expansion.<br />
<br />
Also, I actually think raising the level cap is a much needed enhancement.  It will help to spread out and differenciate the high end players.  Way too many 65's running around right now with nothing to do but grind aa's.  And with the number of levels at which a mob cons dark blue I'm sure you will still be able to get exp in the PoP zones between levels 66-70.  It may not be quite as generous as how levels work with aa's, but I'm sure you won't have to go to just the Omen zones to get 66-70 exp.  That has not been the case for any previous expansion, no reason to believe it will happen now.<br />

It should be noted that a good deal of the text of that proposal was first written in December of 2003.  Most of it is still applicable because the issues we had pre-GoD were just exacerbated in GoD, but it is dated info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Warren Maguson Emarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I remember the days previous to Kunark when we used to be the melee priest as well with our own spell line that allowed us to 'berserk'.   I lament the loss of the spell line and deplore the fact that SOE was going to look into a way to restore the spell line to functionality, after spells that continuously drain mana were changed and consequently nerfed the berserker line of spells, but never got back to it.  <br />
<br />
Rabid bear, possibly a way to restore the idea of the shaman as a melee priest, seems a good idea implemented poorly.  Ah well.  I miss being able to smack something around with a blunt instrument of Justice.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I just hope they take a unbiased look at the class. its not always easy to step back and look at things from a new angle but its what I hope they do. telling shaman that our pets dont get innate duel weild is nothing short of insulting after giving mage pets innate armor. its the same damn thing, the only real difference is that the mage doesnt have to carry that crap around, he can summon it. hell give shaman the summon crappy dagger spell and most of us would be over joyed.<br />
minor but still, if its that minor then why NOT give it to us? there are so many little things to go with the big things. right now shaman are reminding me of my days as a rogue way back in 99. when you could backstab a mob for 1 hp of damage and steal agro from the tank, have to turn off attack and slowly back out of the fight til the mob was back on the tank again, (note by this time your bs had refreshed) step back in bs and Miss and you once again had to back out of the fight. <br />
the big difference is that rogues got regular fixes often patch after patch. so far all we have is a crappy heal upgrade and the attention of the devs.<br />
new expansions coming out when the old ones are still broken,<br />
<br />
and dont get me started on PVP. <br />
survived Lifeburn, had to heal, after one heal (a druid also healed me) I retarget the necro and hes at 74% life...***! I thought lb had a drawback...I guess the draw back is that if you happen to have a large nuke on its way when the necro LB's you might have a shot at killing him.<br />
wizard MB's and I live. to bad he did it with only 1k mana poof he insta gates to nexus...a blue zone.<br />
or the wizzy nukes you to 74% and because you dont have to wait for spell gem refresh you are dead before you can get off a heal.<br />
DT (no its not &quot;improved harm touch&quot;) yeah died to that about 5 times this week, 4 of them vrs sk's I would destroy if they didnt have it.<br />
<br />
those 3 aa's make pvp completely disinteresting. they make you zone out rather than engage, they are highly discouraging.<br />
make them pve only or give all classes a ridiculous unresistable insta kill.<br />
fix resists. shaman suck ass at endgame pvp, its truly sad when a CASTER class is in the worst 3 pvp classes in the game. (not that I care whos at the bottom but its been clear from day 1 that casters are superior to melees at pvp)<br />
meh those are issues for another thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Warren Maguson Emarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Haha, howdy Glori!  <br />
<br />
I'm afraid I'm in the current camp of, not planning on returning to EQ till I get a new video card... <br />
<br />
Unfortunately the current state of affairs of our class issues haven't given me any impetus to hurry and acquire a new card so I can sit out benchwarming while listening to my guild play in GoD or OoW.<br />
<br />
Simply not my idea of fun or a wise use of money at the moment even as amusing as beating a monster with the blunt kitty of justice would be.   :-P   I hardly think that epic 2.0 will make up for the past years of neglect our class has seen.  <br />

The fact is that Shaman have not stacked effectively in raids for a long time.  Many raid leaders have enjoy the luxury of having a Swiss-Army Shaman in each group, but this does not do the soul of the Shaman much good.  Deep down us Shaman know that if we are not the first, second or even third Shaman in a raid, we are basically deadwood.<br />
<br />
Perhaps the game play problems caused by the Five Issues should be self evident but to be clear I think that the problems should be spelled out.<br />
<br />
How do these Five Issue affect the three types of game play: Solo, Group and Raid?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">It's still a great post (Gloriana really is too good for us), and I'm shocked silly to see <br />
1) an EQ rep posting on the Crucible<br />
2) (to a lesser degree) another indication that some attention will be given to the shaman class.  We'll see if it puts the class back on the map or not.  *grin*<br />
<br />
Now the downside is that the place where the monkeys are due to fly out any minute now - really wasn't designed to be a simian passageway.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the visit, Brenlo, and good luck finding a way to make a shaman feel valued again.  It's sad to see your class reduced to buff-bot status, even after you've quit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">The effort is definitely appreciated. And it's nice seeing how much the mood seems to have lightened up on the board with just a bit of solid communication.<br />

The shaman class is a good fun one no matter what anyone says. I'm looking foreward to seeing what comes of this. I am Kind of wondering.... do you think there will ever come a day when SOE will be able to say... Ok, class balance is done once and for all.</div></div><hr />
