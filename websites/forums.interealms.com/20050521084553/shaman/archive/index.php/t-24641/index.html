But, we do have satellite way out here in the sticks and the cute red head on the tv told me that I could connect to the internet using a satellite dish.<br />
<br />
Well I did my research and it turns out that there is a half second delay between information relay and response and I was wondering if anybody else who had a satellite connection could comment on this with regards to playing online games like EQ.

Just think of it this way. You have to send the signal that you are doing something all they way up to space. The time it takes to travel there and then relay back down to earth. Then the time it takes to reach SoE. On top off all that you have to wait almost as long for them to send the signal back the same way it came to you!</div></div><hr />

Actually, outbound requests are via phone line; the return info is via satellite. But yeah, the lag is still game-breaking.</div></div><hr />

Sam, the newer systems like Pegasus and DirectWay actually are two-way satellite internet.  Since your dish is transmitting, the FCC wont let you install it yourself.<br />
<br />
If I remember, the satellites are 22,000 miles up so we're talking an extra 44,000 miles in latency before even getting to the 'net.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Excellent, that's the information I needed.<br />
<br />
The problem I have with my modem is that even though we're paying for 56k, I have never recieved over or less than a 26.4kbs connection.  I've talked to the tech people at imetweb and they said that it might be a problem with the existing wiring out here in the country.  They said that even though I'm not recieving a 56k connection, like I'm supposed to, they're under no legal obligation to fix the problem since I'm recieving over 20kbs.<br />
<br />
If anybody wasn't sure of this before, be sure of it now - living in the country sucks hardcore.  Unless of course, somebody knows something I don't about how to get around this problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You could be getting 1k a second and they wouldn't have any liability to fix it because its your phone lines and not the isp. <br />
<br />
Satallite sucks big big time. There may be land wireless in your area, something worth checking. Thats what we have to use where I work because even though we're in the middle of the city, we're in an old industrial area that doesn't get support for dsl or cable and T1 is too expensive for a small business.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Is ISDN an option, I lived out in the boonies too and I almost bought it. It is a little pricey I believe...  but your more likely to have a good connection.<br />
Also a few tricks I used to help when I had a crappy phone line to connect. Turn off data compression, and turn off error controll. Also, if you can turn off the x2(or whatever is the standard now for 56k connection) you get a better latency time, and then when you just want to surf the net turn it back on. They might make it worse but you can always turn them back on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">somebody knows something I don't about how to get around this problem. <br />

could always go wireless and buy some expensive antenna and try to pick up a signal and hyjack off someones cable  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Draconis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I have direcway, for EQ its not bad but if you want to play ANY other games (FPS most of all) forget it, its not going to work. Lag wise normally i hit a button casting bar shows up but i dont start casting till the bar is about halfway done, Im used to it by now and it has only gotten people killed on a few occasions. Although everynow and then your lat will shoot up into the 4-5k range and render playing impossible for a few seconds ~ a minute. but most of the time it is in the 200-500 range and stable.<br />
<br />
Other than the lag is the FAP (Fair access policy), if you jsut use it to surf and play EQ np but if you want to download anything you have a limit of 169 megs per 4-8 hours (Depending on current server load) or they cut your speed to a crawl, I normally cant even connect to EQ servers if i pass the limit by too much.<br />
<br />
just some more info for you, cable stops 500 feet from my house but county wont let it be run to us, so im stuck with it for a while.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We had an asynch DirectPC satellite setup years ago.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, a roommate, who was a networking engineer by day, was able to get around these problems by using WinRoute (a routing/NAT utility) to force the EQ packets to be routed via the modem for both directions.  I imagine the same thing could be better accomplished today with a linux system.<br />
<br />
It wasn't that hard to get everything working (he spent about 30 minutes on it), and it was fairly stable and effective once it was working. We could both play EQ at the same time over the same dialup connection even while downloading massive binaries from usenet groups, although it took forever to zone.  We did have to dedicate a 3rd PC to routing/firewall duties, but we had an old Pentium II box laying around anyway.<br />
<br />
If you want the satellite connection for other non-EQ stuff as well, this may be the way to go, although it obviously won't be functionally any different than a plain old dial-up connection for purposes of game play.<br />
<br />
Also, don't expect Hughes (the DirectPC company) to be at all helpful in getting this working; their customer service is even worse than SOE's.  Or at least it was 3 years ago.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats a good idea too.<br />
<br />
If you're the tweaking/hacking type, there are numerous resources out there for kicking the effective range of wireless way, way up.  There was a posting on slashdot a while back about someone that got an 802 wireless setup working out to about 3 miles by using a pringles can as an antenna booster.<br />
<br />
Assuming you have access to a high-speed connection nearby, you can also look into short-range laser communications.  Many business parks use these setups to connect outlying buildings to a main building that is well-wired, and they apparently work pretty well up to about a mile or so.<br />
<br />
Sprint also offers a wireless modem that connects to their cell network that might work for you.  (Other wireless vendors do too, but  they all charge by the minute; sprint does not, and is about 5 times faster).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I hadn't thought about wireless.  Will have to give that some consideration.<br />

Is ISDN an option<br />
What is ISDN?<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I'm pretty inexperienced when it comes to all this.  My internet provider, imetweb, is telling me it's my phone lines and that I am out of luck.  However, when I was home during college break, we had an internet provider called midohio.net which provided us with a solid 56k connection.  Midohio.net moved to a neighboring city when I went back to school and imetweb took over where they left off.<br />
<br />
That doesn't sound like a phone line problem to me so much as it does a problem on their end.  I've started asking some hard questions and they've been doing an excellent stonewall job on me.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: My house is too far out to have cable access.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>eci_shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Generally, if your phone line isn't operating up to speed, the problem is usually close to your house.  There may be an exposed line or a line that is too close to the surface.  <br />
<br />
I really think your best bet is to either: 1. tell your phone company that you seem to have horrible static and ask for them to inspect your lines &lt;lie if you have to, just to get them down there&gt;, or 2. Purchase a new 2nd phone line. (When the phone company comes over, they have to test current line conditions and should not install a new line if they wiring is bad... they tend to replace bad wiring).<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Regarding the other suggestions:<br />
<br />
A. Wireless:  If you are in an area that does not have cable, you probably aren't in an area that has wireless.  The most I have ever seen an internet company provide wireless was 3 miles from their central hub. The person that suggested wireless was probably joking if he meant to hi-jack someone else's internet also.  Judging from your description, I bet you don't live very close to another house to be able to do this anyways.  (Household wireless connections barely extend beyond 20 feet from the house).<br />
<br />
B. ISDN: Your internet comes from the phone lines basically.  If you can buy ISDN from your phone company, then they better well be able to correct your current phone issues...<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S. you didn't specifically mention if you can receive cable or not... if you can get a cable connection, your problem is solved.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Integreated Services Digital Network (run a google search).<br />
<br />
In a nutshell, its a digital phone line that relies on the same networking technology that businesses and ISPs use (e.g. T1s, etc.).  While I'm simplifying greatly, ISDN is sort of like a fractional T1 (a very small faction).  The basic connection is 64k both directions, but usually 2 lines are paired together for a total speed of 128k (about 5 times faster than dialup).  I had a ISDN setup years ago in grad school, and it was fairly stable and speedy enough for my needs at the time.<br />
<br />
ISDN service is sold by the phone company and is generally available anywhere that phone service is available.  Like DSL, it requires high-quality digital-capable phone lines.  However, unlike DSL, it does not require that specialized DSL routing equipment be installed at the local telephone switching station or office, which is why it is often available in places that DSL is not (it also has a longer range than some flavors or DSL).  I have no idea what current rates would be; the connection that I had years ago was about $100 per month.  You'll probably also have to buy a special ISDN modem, for about $200.  Lastly, phone companies are usually pushing DSL for high-speed connections today, so you may have to talk to the salesperson that deals with business accounts to get any real info from them about it.<br />
<br />
On the phone line issue: in most places, you can call the phone company and get them to come out and test the line for free.  You ISP may be telling the truth on this one.  Phone lines are generally required to provide a certain degree of bandwith capability by law (depends on the state probably, but this is the case in California). Typical phone lines provide a much better connection than they are legally required to and it is this extra bandwidth capability that 56k modems rely on.  At any rate, once you get the line tested, you can then go back to the ISP and hassle them much more effectively.<br />
<br />
Assuming the line is crap, one way around that is to order several new lines beyond those already supported in your house (homes are usually wired for 4 lines).  This will force the phone company to come out and install new lines to support your new service (usually at no additional cost to you).  Then you use these lines and cancel the old ones.<br />
<br />
Finally, assuming you have no options beyond dial-up, there is yet another way to get more bandwidth out of that, called channel-bonding.  In essence, multiple modem connections are multi-plexed together to form one virtual higher-speed connection.  This does require specialized configuration and hardware at the ISP, but this feature is commonly supported by all the major-vendor modem bank hardware that ISPs use, so there is an overwhelming chance that your ISP can provide the feature, if they want to.<br />
<br />
I ran a quad setup for about a year when I was living in a remote area around Santa Cruz, and it was reasonably effective.  We had crap phone lines that could only typically support 26k, and ISDN wasn't available (let alone cable or DSL).  We had to get a special 4-port serial card for the routing PC to support all four modems, but the software setup wasn't too bad; both Linux and BSD support channel-bonding out of the box.  The ISP (got.net) had to make a one-line config change in our account, and that was it.  Kinda kludgy, but it worked when nothing else did and was good for a fairly solid 100k connection.<br />
<br />
Lastly, if it were me in your shoes, I would start by looking at the wireless angle.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not necessarily.<br />
<br />
Older cable TV setups are one-direction; cable internet obviously has to be bi-directional and there are many places in the country that haven't yet been upgraded.<br />
<br />
That said, if cable is available in your area (even if 'available' means you have to pay $500 to get new cable strung out to your house from the street), then get that.  In the long run, you'll probably have less hassles that with any of these other approaches.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Beafly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Hey hey Howler. I've been living in the same situation as you for about 2 years now. As a city boy that grew up on a cable modem it is absolute torture. I cannot get cable or dsl and the dialup is just plain stupidly slow (28,000 line feet from nearest DSLAM and 6 repeaters in the way). I did however find another option, and it may be one for you also. Verizon (and a couple other major telcom companies now) offer a wireless service that runs over the cell phone towers. It's called CDMA-1000. In select places (you're not in them if you are having the problem you do) you can get broadband speeds of 2mb bursts and sustained rates of 200-500kb, everywhere else (on their network) you can get 144k bursts and sustained rates from 44-60kb. Verizon's plan is called &quot;national access&quot;. I'm paying about 80 bucks a month for unlimited access. I actually get the advertized data rates, low ping times, and my connection has been very solid. I 2-box EQ on this connection routinely and have had no problems on 70+ person raids. My zone times were cut by about a third when I switched from dialup (I was lucky when I got 26.4k). So find out if you can get a verizon digital cell phone signal at you home. If you can then head off to www.verizonwireless.com and check it out. It is a good bit pricier than dialup for sure, but the reduced stress from lag and dropoffs of dialup are more than worth it to me!<br />
<br />
Side note: This thing is wireless remember, I use mine when I have to travel too. So, anywhere there is a cell signal... I'm EQin!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">So I'm now living out in the boonies and trying to get an internet connection beyond a modem is next to impossible.

<br />
How far are you away from your nearest telephone company central office?  Normal ADSL runs a max of 18000 feet but IDSL reaches about 45000 feet with extremely low latency.  It's not cheap though, more than most satellite's per month.  I paid $110/month for 144/144 IDSL from MegaPath with a service level agreement.  I think I had about 2 hours of downtime for 18 months of service :)<br />
<br />
Also, how is the surrounding landscape?  Wireless services are becoming more and more popular in rural areas if you have neighbors that are willing to invest in it with you.  The hardware costs for high frequency narrow band wireless is really high (up to a few thousand dollars) but you can get T1+ speeds with a range of several miles, depending on obstructions and weather.<br />
<br />
Oh ya, and I second what everyone else has said about Satellite + real time games - they don't mix.  You would be better off with a good dialup service :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Telephone office is about 10 miles away.  Landscape is pretty much farmland with woods here and there - flat as flat can be.  There's a cell phone tower near my house - less than a mile - which is no doubt why I get excellent service out here, but I'm not sure if that would help at all with what you mentioned earlier Beafly.<br />
<br />
These are all wonderful ideas so far.  I'm making notes and doing some research to see what's possible.  Finally have time between my 2 jobs and local work on Kerry's campaign to call the phone company tomorrow so hopefully I'll get something rolling here soon.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Draconis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">beafly what type of ping times are you running at? can you play games that require low ping time like FPS with wireless internet?

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Beafly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Draconis- Ping times are consistantly in the 50-350ms range. Works fine for EQ but laggs pretty solid in a FPS. It just isn't consistantly low enough to truely enjoy a FPS. I've tried a couple FPSers (Doom3, Battlefield Vietnam) and just never been happy with the performance.<br />
<br />
Howler- If you are living in a flat area and within 1 mile of your closest cell tower, then CDMA-1000 is perfect. Take a serious look into it, I don't think you will regret it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Hey beafly, I'm looking at verizon's website and it's looking pretty interesting.  Now, it's stating that I need a wireless card for this to work and they mention a few cards, but they note that they're for notebooks.  They don't mention desktops at all.<br />
<br />
So I guess I'm curious what card you're using if you have a desktop.  They don't seem to be outrageosly priced like the satellite connection.  About a $100 to $150 after rebate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">One thing to try - move your dialup modem to the spot where the phone line enters your house.  Plug DIRECTLY into the phone company's jack, disconnecting all the phones/wiring in the house.<br />
<br />
If you connect at 56k, then the problem is in your HOUSE wiring.  There are things you can do to clean this up, but probably the easiest (if you are not having problems with your telephone service) is to install a splitter right at the spot the phone line comes in and run one side directly to your modem somehow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Beafly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Howler, You do need the PCMCIA card (or a CDMA-1000 compatable cell phone with the proper dongle), and they do run about $100 bucks after the rebate if you buy it directly from Verizon as I did. I have a laptop so I run my internet on that and use plain old internet connection sharing to spread it round my home network. There a number of PCMCIA to PCI adapters available on the market that would allow you to plug the card into a desktop though. A simple google search for &quot;Desktop PCMCIA&quot; will give you a number of options. Here are two examples of what you would be looking for:<br />

Not sure if same thing but the wireless in our area (not Verizon, local company) advertises (and people have validated) 15-50 ping times. One of their main selling points is their latency is lower than cable. Course there connections are to a couple of the widest backbones in the MidWest (at least according to them).<br />
<br />
And to the guy who had cable run within 500 ft of the house but they wouldnt bring it to the house, I have a question. You have a neighbor who has access to that cable (which I assume has broadband or you wouldnt be bringing it up)? Split the cost and setup a wi-fi broadband network that you guys can share. Not perfect but sure as hell better than nothing. Encrpyt it though or everyone in the neighborhood will be sharing it quickly (have personal experience in that).<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Beafly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Groovdog, is the wireless you talk about CDMA-1000? It's probably not. It's probably a 802.11a/b/g or one of the comercially licensed frequencies that are available to such businesses (these require equipment that is similar to, but operates on a differenct frequency than 802.11a/b/g but regardless the company has to deploy an antenna network in an area to support thier customers). Those technologies can support very low ping times, and when coupled with a very fast backbone could yield the results you describe. I do not bellieve that CDMA-1000 can support such low ping times regardless of the backbone it rides on. The main advantage of CDMA-1000 for a ISP like verizon is that it uses the same hardware that their cellular phone technologies work on, so they don't have to install new equipment in an area to support their clients. Anywhere they have a tower, they have a potential client (like me and maybe howler).<br />
<br />
I too looked for a close neighbor that has broadband to set up a wireless network. Sadly there are 3 such individuals within a mile and half (well within range of 802.11a/b/g) from my home that could get DSL but the trees in my area prevent a line of sight link. CDMA-1000, because it works off the same technology as cellular (and the tower is high on a hill) blasts right through the trees and I'm in business.</div></div><hr />
