<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Breagen Daerthe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well I have scanned through some of the recent threads here at the Glade and am somewhat confused over what point archery for rangers is at in the game.  Now before PoP came out I was grinding AA's in arch skills waiting until I could get EQ and AM3 now that I have gotten my Vet title I don't know which route to start on; with Ferocity and FoTA I am wondering whether it would be more effective to go melee AA's for the most part though.<br />
<br />
My guild mainly is a NToV/minor Luclin boss guild, so my chances at getting either uber weapons or bows are quite low.  Also a low chance of getting a primal weapon/bow anytime soon either as the other ranger in my guild just got theirs, so basically I am stuck with NToV/Luclin weapons.<br />
<br />
So assuming I maxed out either archery AA's or melee AA's which would be the most effective, archery would require EQ/AM3 plus the critical hits AA's.  Melee would be Ambix/Ferocity and critical AA's.  My current set-up is Swifty with either SBoZ or Fleshgrinder and bow is Nightmarewood from PoP.  The main thing is not so much maximum DPS I could possibly do as I understand with Trueshot I will be doing the most with archery AA's, but when you factor in XPing where archery seems to be limited to some extent whereas melee can be used always and without having to mash a key constantly.<br />
<br />
So finally in general gameplay which AA route becomes the most effective, archery for max damage but more hassle and limited usefullness on some raids or melee for easier use in all places yet lower overall damage output?</div></div><hr />
