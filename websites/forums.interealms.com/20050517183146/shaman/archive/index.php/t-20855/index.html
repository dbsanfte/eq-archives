Obviously wasn't posted to the shaman boards, and it's POSSIBLE that our pets will suddenly come with 2x 1hs/1hb/ or 1hp weapons after the patch on the 14th, but . . .<br />
<br />
Anyone wanna put odds on it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Scylding</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">LOL <br />
<br />
Never happen.<br />
<br />
&quot;What Shaman have pets?  I thought we nerfed those.&quot;  SOE</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Odds?<br />
<br />
1,000 to 0.<br />
<br />
It won't happen.  They won't even give our WOLF pets innate spirit of the wolf, let alone try and explain where they come up with a couple of rusty 1hs'rs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">He specifically mentioned mage pets, not anything else, so its unlikely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Bah, just let the tribunal quest necklace hammer be doggie equipable.  Would solve all the problems. Or give us an item to summon &quot;a decaying skeleton&quot;, which we then can slay for a rusty dagger :).</div></div><hr />

I dont think that would solve the probs for the 2% of the shaman pop that didnt choose barb :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Daekar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My bet would have to be, nope the thought wont even cross their mind cuz &quot;shaman are working as intended&quot; right? lol<br />

Mage complain that it's tire some to feed equipment to their pets.  SoE jumps right on it and comes up with a fix, pets just summon with the stuff *presto.*<br />
<br />
Shaman present argument after argument on the many BROKEN aspects of the class in the current state of the game and we get the silent treatment or if we're really really lucky a completely uneducated and for the most part hugely absured comment that translates into &quot;Kiss off.&quot;<br />
<br />
If they even touch a shaman issue in the next 3 months I'll go into shock heh.</div></div><hr />

Well , 1.5% of that 2% has a clicky snare so they dont deserve summoned weapons.  .3% of that 2%  are immune to  frontal stun, so that is their freebie.  The other .2% that were silly enough to pick Iksar, cats or toads should be forced to live with their shame and get nothing.<br />
<br />
Such a Tribunal flavored quest would solve MY problem, and thats all that matters....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Iksar are superior, everyone knows that, so no shame ;). Oh, btw, we get to fear animals and undead though  :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">What is it with all this Mage love?? As far as I see it Mages are a pretty complete class with nice fast DPS. On my server at least when a group has a couple of DPS spaces, one is usually filled by a mage.<br />
<br />
SOE just doesnt love the Shaman, I have given up expecting any changes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Haha Zodiakx!<br />
<br />
Hmm...I used to be very rare as an ogre.  Now ogres are everywhere.  The new ones are probably more likely to be ogres than anything else.<br />
<br />
Oh well, I was sorta individual at one point at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">You know, i think i have finaly reached that point.<br />
<br />
I do believe i actualy truly hate brenlo and SoE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Necros are so much more desired in GoD groups than mages for the simple reason of.... *drum roll*... fd/rez! Ok, there are other things as well. Mage vs Beastlord? Heh. Mages have been hurting for some time. These changes dont up their dps really, just allow their pets to return to their roll as offtank.</div></div><hr />

Adjusting our healing power or finding a meaningful way to upgrade us would actually require thought.  Giving mage pets weapons and armor automatically is an easy &quot;quit your whining&quot; fix.  Mages are still pissed pet canni got nerfed after it had been in the game for so long.<br />
<br />
Though I would like a summon pet kit item for shamans so I would actually have a reason to cast True Spirit.  Just take that mage dagger from powater (or poair or whatever), make it shaman and instead of summon jewelry bag, have it summon pet kit for yourself only.  That would shut me up for a week or so.<br />
<br />
Making our pets quad innately would be a better (and easier) fix.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Brenlo is what we call on Torv an asshat or an assclown. His intrinsic value is zero, and all he provides to this community is a focus item for our frustration and anger.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ok not really I mean who cares. All I want from a pet is not to get constantly smoked on enrage, either that or gimmie a clicky pet summon or at the very very least make the spet summon spell not take 2 minutes to ungrey.</div></div><hr />
