<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>niwggib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have to tell you I have been playing EQ since Beta 4. I love this game but it is becoming harder and harder to log in and a lot of this comes from WoW.<br />
<br />
I was doing good. I found a happy place in EQ. I have a group of friends who I play with on a regular basis and was having a good time in EQ. Then I tried the WoW stress test beta. To be honest I had absolutely no interest in WoW. I had long ago told myself I didn’t want to invest any time into another online game.<br />
<br />
One of our group members was bouncing up and down about the WoW beta and we have put him through hell and high water over EQ so we figured we owed him one and my wife and I signed up for the stress test.<br />
<br />
I logged in and it was instantly better than EQ. Let my give you our system specs really quick. I have a P4 3.4EE, 2gb of ram, WD's 10,000 74gb SATA HD, ASUS mb, ASUS X800 and a cable connection to the internet. My wife has a P4 1.8, 1gb of ram, maybe a 7,000 rpm hd, intel mb, and a ti4800.<br />
<br />
So here is EQ, I have every model on for EQ, supposedly my system can handle it (LOL) Yet when I go on raids I have to turn off spell effects and am tempted to turn off a few models. My wife has about half of the character models on and she runs choppy at times.<br />
<br />
Crap in WoW I logged into the newbie area and I could see at least 30 people in my instant surroundings, I back out a little bit and look around more, there are at least 100 people in my immediate area! Am I stuttering? Am I lagging out? No, it is running @#$% fantastic. So what you say, &quot;you have a high end machine!&quot; Well my wife's is middle of the road and hers is running great too! I am not talking soso great, I am saying it runs fantastic. She runs around freely there is no lag, no stutter no nothing.<br />
<br />
The next thing I am impressed with is closely related to graphics it's the world. It is amazingly detailed! It is beautiful. There are full-blown cities that look like they are lived in and used. There are auction houses to sell stuff in (kind of like the bazaar), there are banks (which I don’t like their setup (later), and more shops than you can shake a stick at!<br />
<br />
Quest - I love them. When you look at a NPC it shows their name and in &lt; &gt;'s what they sell, do right under their name. If they have a quest for you there is a ! over their name. It's not some little ! like you see here it is a large bright orange ! You click on them and they tell you all about the quest... &quot;Our family has been feuding for years but I love billybob, go meet him down by the river and tell him I love him.&quot; The quest then shows you are going to get 35copper pieces and some exp for running over and meeting billybob. So you run over to find billybob and what is that you see? Oh that is 75exp for finding the farm that billybob's family lives at (at the lvl of the quest it is about equivalent of killing 3 mobs). So you find the river and you see a man standing there but you cant read his name... You know it is him because of the big ? over his name showing that he is the next step in your quest.<br />
<br />
There are a ton of quest and you can have 20 active at a time (I believe this is the case, there is a bar that shows me i have 9/20 quest atm) Because I have so many quest it is easy to get lost right? No, just open up the quest log and it list all the active quest and you can read exactly what the quest person told you and see what rewards you have coming. You can abandon any of the quests you are on or you can share them with your group (not all are shareable, for example a multipart quest you cant just share part 5 of the quest). <br />
<br />
If you share the quest it pops up for them just like the quest did for you and they have the option to accept or decline just like you did. Oh lets say it was a soandso stole my necklace quest. You might have to go hunt down a named mob. Aside from the normal loot that the mob drops once you accept the quest that mob will now drop your quest piece. It makes it kind of cool in away that you don’t have 15million unknown quest pieces in your bank that you might use someday. Most quest pieces don’t drop unless you are on the quest.<br />
<br />
Dying - You have all been there especially those of us that like to solo from time to time in EQ. I don’t need to explain the horror that is dying in EQ. Especially if you don’t have a cleric in your group. Dying in WoW is a pain only because it stops you from killing and you have to run back to your body. My first death wasn’t until I was level 10. We were in a group killing like mad and I saw this valley and the map didn’t really show anything on the other side. I went and peeked… ouch! There were 5 invisible mobs there. One was level 15 and the rest were level 12-13. So needless to say I went down faster than a crack ho.<br />
<br />
I have this option pop up so I can release my spirit. I click ok and all the sudden the entire world is gray and white. I am looking up at this angelistic figure and I am a walking ghost (who travels at least twice as fast as I normally do). So I am free to go wherever I want to but up on the mini map there is an orange arrow pointing to where I died. So I head back that direction and nothing can hurt me. On other peoples screens if they see me I look like a gorgeous willow wisp.  No mobs can see or attack me. Once I get in mini map range my orange arrow turns into a little grave stone and once I get a little closer I message pops up and asks me if I want a rez! If I take it I am fully dressed and half mana/life! Apparently you take damage to your armor when you die but I have not noticed any real exp lose or slow down after dying. I went to the armor shop to repair the damage and it cost me like 7 copper per item so this was not a big deal either. (mind you, my highest is only lvl 12 and I have no one in anything higher than leather).<br />
<br />
Mana/Hit Points – I have no clue how many hit points I have, if you look at your character it tells you but I have been just having so much fun I haven’t been looking at the mechanics really. Anyways we are fighting and I can kill a mob that is pretty much even to me with my mage using only half of my mana. So I kill him run over to him loot him and by the time I find the next mob to kill (they are not scarce either) I am already back to 75% mana or more! To top it off if I happened to use all of my mana up I just click on a drink and in 10 seconds or so I am full mana again. Food applies for HP’s. There is almost no down time in WoW. I am non-stop killing/questing. I kind of told my wife this might be a bad thing. In EQ I could watch tv, get a drink, talk to the group, and make some popcorn while killing one mob. In WoW, it’s non-stop. I have to really pay attention.<br />
<br />
Solo – Shamans have it easy. We are definitely a class that can solo. However in WoW I have tried 5 or six different classes and every single one of them has been able to solo. How ever even if they couldn’t solo mobs, the exp from Quest is down right amazing! My wife has always played a healer type class and we all know in EQ the cleric is not going off and efficiently soloing! Even her priest in WoW can solo.<br />
<br />
Resist – Oh in EQ I regularly have a verbal bouts with my monitor about how @#$% sick I am of stuff not sticking, DoT’s, DD’s, Slows! WoW on the other hand, what are resists? They are the little message that flashes over the head of the mob that makes little difference. It is not a big deal if you don’t land a DD, sure there are partials or actual resists (maybe it’s my rose colored glasses but I remember about 12 so far) Mana regens so fast after fights it does not matter if you had to go completely out of mana to kill a mob and ended up melee’ing it to death. 15 seconds max and you are good to go.<br />
<br />
Zones - I have zoned twice in WoW. The world is massive. You can run from provience (don't know if that is the right name) to provience  without ever having to zone once. That might seem a bit scary because you cannot zone a train, but mobs will only chase you so far before they memory wipe, heal to full life/mana and go back home. The times I zoned was when I took my human to pick up my wifes gnome. I went into this massive city and found a &quot;train&quot; and I had to zone into and out of the station.<br />
<br />
The ugly <br />
<br />
Auctions – I don’t know if it is good or bad. You cannot auction stuff off in normal towns. If you try to link an item it just shows the name, you cannot click on it for any of the stats. As soon as you go into a big town you join a trader channel. In this channel you can get any link sort of like EQ’s links. You can circumvent this a little bit because you can send tells to anyone that asks you about the item or you can yell it. Like in EQ yell has a very limited range so it is not all that bad.<br />
<br />
Banks – They are only located in big cities. There are a lot of little cities that flourish with all the stuff you need to get along like trade skill supplies, armor vendors, food vendors, inns to rest in, you know all the basic stuff you need to do on a daily basis. These little towns do not have bankers so if you find uber_sword_009 that you don’t have enough skill to use quite yet, you either have to hold it or run all the way to a big city to put it into a bank.<br />
<br />
The price – $15 a month seems steep. I know it is nothing when you compare it to a night out for dinner or a movie and how much play time you get out of the game. But I sense a trend going on here, companies are slowly upping the prices and we keep paying! EQ was making money hand over fist at their original price. They sensed they could up the price and guess what, we all paid. I can’t say I know anyone who quit over the price increase. It is not like they give away free expansions. We all pay for those too.<br />
<br />
And last but not least – I am only a WoW newbie. I have no idea what the high end game is like in WoW. I have so much time invested into EQ and I know what the end game is like here! I have a sense of comfort in EQ. <br />
<br />
Incase some of you point out my recent posts about being level 61, let me give you a bit of history. My wife and I owned 4 accounts and I daily dual boxed. We were in a high end raiding guild. My wife said she had had enough and it was time to quit playing EQ. Me being the loving hubby did just that. However being totally addicted to EQ I knew the only way I would be able to quit would be to sell my characters and I did just that! So our three characters being level 61 has been a fresh start and that fresh start has been where I finally found the real fun in EQ and it was no longer the job it was before we quit! However it turns it selling the accounts wasn’t enough to get me off of evercrack, just a long vacation!<br />
<br />
I had a great time with the high end but hated when it bacame a job and not a game. I will never foget how we were the first to kill naggy on our server. God that was amazing!<br />

edit added in the bit about not having to zone for the most part</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you look carefully at the graphics in WoW, you will notice two things (1) that they use old style EQ sprites for trees and such things; and (2) the pixel count is relatively low. They can get away with doing that by placing the game in a cartoon setting so that even though the graphic detail isnt very high, it still looks good. If they made it realistic it would look something like old style antonica in EQ. That is probably the main reason why the game doesn't have graphic lag (allthough server lag is sometimes *problematic* ;) )<br />
<br />
It is fun to play though, allthough it doesn't seem to have that &quot;community&quot; feel yet. I can see that it would get boring pretty quick though once the world has been explored, unless there is some sort of progressive goals in the high end to keep people playing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Cartoony or not, the world looks AMAZING.  Look at the landscape in some of the places.  You can tell they took their time to do the artwork right.<br />
I can also throw my hat in on the &quot;this isn't lagging one bit&quot; claim.  Running EQ, even with half the models turned off and no spell effects, is like running through peanut butter.  With WoW graphics turned up, I have no stuttering at all.<br />
<br />
Currently, the server lag is only due to an issue with the client holding all server requests until it receives an acknowledgement on using an inventory slot on an item.  That's it.  The new server queue system is... annoying.  I don't know the reason behind it though, and it may just be a test to make sure it works as intended for once the game goes live.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">long term is the big question for WoW...

The game runs great and looks surprisingly good for how dated the graphics are and overall I think it's a much more 'finished' game than EQ2 but I just have a lot of doubts about the longevity of it considering Blizzards history of taking forever and a day to release anything... like expansions.</div></div><hr />

I think my whole love with WoW atm is that it is a game and it is fun at the moment!!! I am so sick of fighting with resists and a crappy engine it is killing my fun!<br />
<br />
I am not sure what I am going to do but worse case scenerio is I cancel my EQ accounts. (never selling an account again)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Long term is probably the question which is playing on my mind as well.  Apparently (and this i third-hand info, so take it for what it's worth) Blizzard have held back on putting into game a lot of the high end raiding-type stuff so that it is all fresh and new at release and there aren't spoilers out.  I have a sneaking suspicion that if this is the case, then certain guilds may have been doing private testing for them, but that is purely speculation. <br />
<br />
The thing about WoW, is that you don't have to level fast if you don't want to.  It is *very* easy to level up super fast, but I think (like EQ) you miss much of the immersion and just general 'WoW' factor or exploring new places.  The trends of everyone going to the 'best xp (quest) spots' is already developing, as people start in on the whole 'Gotta be max level thing'. As an example, after 3 months or so in Beta, my max level character is only 39, but I have explored many many places, and don't feel at all rushed to level up. This is a game where you truely can stop and enjoy the ride. I have friends who have been in the game 1 month, and are already level 60. <br />
<br />
I actually find it easier to stop and take breaks in the middle of doing something, because it is very casual friendly in that respect when you're purely questing with friends etc.  There isn't the same pressure on you to stay in the group healing/pulling/whatever as there is in EQ. If you want to complete a quest or two and then sit it out, there's no real problem. Most pick up groups are fairly transitive, moving from quest to quest and constantly changing people, and if you're playing with friends, well, that's a whole different ball game.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, the game doesn't promote the same structure as EQ in terms of people healing, understanding agro, that sort of thing, so in a random pick up group, you all too often end up with 5 people all running off killing seperate things and training the group.  I find myself steering clear of most players unless they have come from EQ or DAoC. It's amazing how easy it is to pick the veteran MMOG players after a few minutes of watching them.  This lack of guidance in terms of player roles is going to make it interesting for the non-experienced MMOG guild when they try raiding.  In groups, you can get away with not really paying attention, but raids are going to be a whole different game! I expect EQ/DAoC guilds will do quite well in the high end, with a serious learning curve for the less-experienced.  It'll be a rude shock for many to realise that doing your own thing  and not paying attention / communicating will screw things up for everyone.<br />
<br />
The higher end instances (from what I've heard) are a bit more intensive, and not as relaxed, as you have to complete them in one playing session, and they can take a few hours to clear. However, that is all second hand info as well.<br />
<br />
With regards to the graphical lag, yes, it is amazing how well it runs.  I have two systems I play it on, a P3, 733MHZ, 1GB RAM, Geforce 2 GTS, which runs with most settings around medium at 800x600. The game still looks great, it doesn't get graphical lag very often at all, and even then it's quite minor.  My main system is a P4 1.6GHz, 1GB RAM, GeForce Ti4200 128MB, and I run at 1024x768 (current max I can choose) with all settings at max, it is a smooth ride all the way. I can't remember the last serious graphic lag I had.  And they've done a great job of making the environment look good given the technology they're using.  This is a game anyone should be able to play, (hardware-wise) if you're on EQ atm.<br />
<br />
The current server lag issue is a deliberate thing as they attempt to pinpoint and optimise potential troublespots in their code before release. I think they've ironed out a lot of those bugs thanks to this latest Open Beta Stress Test :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
From what I have read, the queue system is just temporary until launch.  They are intentionally overloading the servers to test them, but some were overloaded too much, meaning that no one could play on it.  Can't test if you can't play.  <br />
<br />
Currently, 500,000+ users / 41 servers = 12k+ users per server.  But, I would bet that the blue servers have higher averages than that because people not wanting PvP.  There are supposed to be more servers at launch to spread the masses out some and ease congestion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've been playing the open beta, and it's got some pretty neat stuff.  The quests are pretty well written, from what I've seen so far, and I really like the tradeskills.  (Aside from that bit about only being able to take 2 primary ones, although you can unlearn them &amp; relearn others as you go; no idea what that does to your skills.)<br />
<br />
I really got a kick out of the death thing, the first time I died.  Note that you can't really use it to scout - you don't see any mobs until you get near your body, and there's a fairly wide range around your corpse that you can accept the rez.  From what I understand, summoning your body (instead of running to it) used to have a hefty xp penalty, but they changed it to 100% item damage on all equipped &amp; bagged items.  I did this, once.  It's pretty harsh - took all the money I had saved up at the time (about 2.5 silver, not easy to make scads of cash), and I didn't quite get my worn gear repaired.  Never do that, if you can help it.<br />
<br />
The graphics are one thing I don't really like... yeah, they're great graphics - but I don't really like the cartoony feel to them.  One that has nice graphics that I'm also messing with is the Saga of Ryzom (http://www.ryzom.com), which currently has a free two week trial (credit card needed to sign up).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
This isn't the first time I've read a comment like this.  I think during closed beta there was a &quot;community&quot;.  However, during this last open beta/stress test, how can anyone really expect anything like that to develop?  No one really even has a &quot;home&quot; server, let alone the same people running around the same areas you happen to be in.  Blizzard was doing funky stuff and shutting half the servers down and watching the mad rush of all those people to the other servers and stuff like that.  I've personally played on at least 6 different servers in the past week and haven't played most of the characters past the newbie area on any of those.  I suspsect that most people are approaching this open beta time with the same attitude.. why waste time developing a character so much (and the community and comraderie from others doing the same) when there will likely be a wipe and we all start fresh with the release.<br />
<br />
Using lack of community as a dig on WoW at this state is very shortsighted.  Not picking on Tugela in particular, but like I said, I've seen this mentioned several other times.<br />
<br />
As for longevity and content at high levels, Blizzard hasn't even released some high level content because they didn't want to spoil it.  Also Battlegrounds on PvE servers will offer a ton of variety for when you are 60 and bored.  Jeezus, it's at least as easy to get a toon to 65 in EQ these days (a tad longer to get to 70) and it isn't nearly as fun as doing it in WoW, meaning you are most likely grinding xp in PC and the rest of the progression. And guess what... if you decide not to join a raiding guild in EQ at that point, you're pretty much done with that game too.<br />
<br />
Just some thoughts,<br />

<br />
The preview they posted of the next patch will decrease the durability loss on death and spirit healer rez to 25% I believe.  That will be much more reasonable.  Not sure when it goes live.<br />

 <br />
    At lv 5 when you move to your second town, you may learn tradeskills, and everyone should at least learn a gathering skill, even if not a tradeskiller. Skinning is like free loot, almost every animial type mob (Lots of those) are skinable, and a stack of light leather sells for approx 1.5 silver to a vendor. Mining is harder, but Ores sell better, and you can find gems some times (sold a stack of Copper bars for 20.8 silver at auction house) Fishing, although timeconsuming, is also profitable (In about an hour of fishing, my mage cought several stacks of fish, 2 pairs of canvas boots (wore one, sold other to vendor for more than a silver) and a Magic Battle axe that sold to vendor for 12.5 silver) At level 12, after spending 24 silver for my new spells, the Mage had almost a gold left on her.<br />
 <br />
  She also had 4 store bought 6 slot bags (5 sp each) which I could have gotten cheaper at the auction house (if I had found it before I bought them)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Don't sell those trh8skill items like leathers and linens to vendors.  Ack!  As a leatherworker, I never had enough leathers.  Even if I had enough, I could just make some armor to sell to people instead for profit.  If you never plan to make anything with trh8skills, pick up some that will net you some cash just for your natural travels.  Skinning gets you lots of leather to sell to leatherworkers.  Herbalism isn't bad either since you pass by lots of plants out in the wilderness where you'll be spending a lot of time hunting.  Mining would be good too as I keep passing by veins of ore all the time.  You can give up your trh8skill, or just not use it, but it costs nothing to have access to 2 more forms of free &quot;loot&quot; you can sell for good profit.  I'd say skip the skinning if you want the easiest 2, as the skinning process is slow when you just want to run around killing stuff and loot rewards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>drib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">People often say to pick 2 main tradeskills that complement each other, but rather than do that, you can make a bunch of alts and master them all.  It's not that hard to skillup, and you can send items and money through the mail to alts.  I think I'll end up doing that when live comes out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">First, here's  the link to one of the high end area, a raid type of mob (movie, raid wiped on it btw :) ). There aren't many high end content revealed to players in beta, only reason for this is to keep it fresh. There's plenty of storyline in WoW and by the looks of it, plenty of room to expand. Lore is rich too and if need is, Blizzard can nicely create additional expansions as needed. If you read through WoW community site, you can find the article about raiding and high end game and can see, that Blizzard is taking that area very seriously and with great consideration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Mulkosaur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Well on the leveling I got in through the fileplanet deal and played quite a bit as I'm on a bit of vacation till my new job starts up at the start of the year.<br />
<br />
I only managed to get lvl 20 on a Warlock but I did get engineering to 115 and mining up to 120.  Didn't even have time to try a Shaman like I wanted.  Overall though I consider this a reasonable rate of progress myself.  Also in beta they patched in taking a bit more exp per level after 30 also.<br />
<br />
As for cash it's good to at least pick a gathering tradeskill or two.  I myself managed to sell some guns from my engineering tradeskill and had no problems buying all my lvl 12 to 20 spells off the limited guns and ammo market.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps out anyone who hasn't had the chance to play preretail.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">People often say to pick 2 main tradeskills that complement each other, but rather than do that, you can make a bunch of alts and master them all. It's not that hard to skillup, and you can send items and money through the mail to alts. I think I'll end up doing that when live comes out.<br />
I'd recommend against that.  Why?  A few reasons.<br />
<br />
1.  I've heard rumors that some things tradeskill stuff might be level based in order to do the combines.  Like, you might not be able to unlock, say, expert leatherworking, until you meet a sufficient level such as say, level 10.  I haven't seen this in experience yet, but it's quite feasible that it could happen.<br />
<br />
2.  It's a big hassle farming items with one character, transferring it to your alt, logging to your alt to pick up the mail, do some combines, then mailing it back to your main to use, for every combine you want to do.  It's so much easier to do the combines all on the same character that grabbed the items in the first place.<br />
<br />
3.  Get your name out there.  Items have a tag on them that say who they were made by.  It's free advertising for getting your equipment sold.  When soandso sees buys an item and sees that you can made it, why not just send a tell to that guy asking if he can make you XXX item later on as an upgrade?  Makes sense to me.  Repeat buyer makes selling crap easier, and it doesn't cost extra cash like the Auction House does.<br />
<br />
4.  What's the point of offloading the creation skill?  WoW is designed to be fun to go through even the low levels multiple times with the number of quests there are.  There's 8 classes, and 8 races to select from.  I think they want you to try out all 8 classes, each as a different race.  That's my goal.  When you go though as a new class, pick a complementary skill set.  You still have to farm up the items, and you still have to do the skill up combines on one character or another.  Why not keep the complementary skills together on the same character.  I just don't see any incentive of doing what you said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I'd recommend against that.  Why?  A few reasons.<br />
<br />
<br />
OK, I'll take the PRO side :-)<br />
<br />
Your main is going to be out and about gathering tradeskill items.  That is by far the most important and time-consuming step.  It only makes sense to have him/her be the &quot;gatherer&quot;.<br />
<br />
My wife and I are going to play together, and between the two of us we are planning to cover skinning, herbalism, mining, and fishing/cooking/first aid (since the latter three are secondaries and don't count toward your two-profession max).  On our alts we will cover the six production professions.  If that means we have to level our alts up... oh, well.<br />
<br />
<br />
2.  It's a big hassle farming items with one character, transferring it to your alt, logging to your alt to pick up the mail, do some combines, then mailing it back to your main to use, for every combine you want to do.  It's so much easier to do the combines all on the same character that grabbed the items in the first place.<br />
<br />
<br />
However, it's not such a huge deal if you have two accounts :-)<br />
<br />
In the long run, it's not even a big deal if you don't have two accounts.  Sure, at the early levels you may need stuff made frequently, but there has to be a plateau where you work toward a certain skill level so you can make a certain item, then don't use the skill again for yourself for a long time.  (You could still be using it to make items for sale.)  In my EQ tradeskilling experience, I would rather spend a lot of time gathering items and then go on a big tradeskill orgy than do it a little at a time anyway.  It's just too frustrating to get all set up and do three combines.<br />
<br />
<br />
3.  Get your name out there.  Items have a tag on them that say who they were made by.  <br />
<br />
<br />
This does make some sense, but it's not a deal-breaker from my point of view.  And there is a downside - if you're XP grinding and somebody starts sending whispers asking for a combine, you have to deal with it.  If your tradeskiller is a seperate character, you'll only get the whispers when you're tradeskilling. <br />
<br />
As far as having multiple characters go, I still believe that any of your characters that you plan to play extensively in the field ought to specialize in gathering professions, regardless of what combinations of race/class they are.  You still pass up opportunities to gather resources if you pick a production profession for those toons.  With only one account, I might choose four production professions and devote two of my characters to those professions, then pick two of the four gathering professions for each of my other four toons.<br />
<br />
Now, if someone comes and tells me that Artisan-level toons must be at least level 50 or something like that, then things would be different.  However, the level restrictions I have seen so far are pretty light (level 10 for Journeyman, I think).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ragack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">One thing I've heard but am not to familar with is that recipes are gained off Mobs as drops and that the higher recipes are not easy to get hold of. Does anyone know about this? and if this is so are the Recipes bind on pickup?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Also keep in mind, that the components that you need to gather for higher level crafted items are NOT easy to get.  You can't run your level 5 alt to get them, I guarantee you.<br />
<br />
For example, I took up mining/blacksmithing with my warrior.  Sure, copper ore was plentiful, maybe had some low level aggro mobs near it, but it was easy to get.  The next step up was tin.  All the tin ore I have run across (and a silver ore as well) were located smack in the middle of camps full of aggro mobs.  So in order to mine, you had to first clear at least part of the camp to get to it.<br />
<br />
Also, I know for a fact that higher level tailoring, for example takes 'wool cloth' instead of the bountiful amounts of 'linen cloth' that you see everywhere.  Even only getting to level 15 during open beta, I never even saw wool cloth drop off of mobs I was fighting.<br />
<br />
Anyway, your gatherer better have the power to deal with the areas you need to go.  I'd say having your main be a gatherer is a good idea.  And level requirements to progress in crafting may force you to level up your crafter alts too :).<br />
<br />
Another point to consider is inventory space.  Four 6-slot packs + the backpack get full FAST with quest items and equipment, let alone with your gathered items.  Bank space fills up pretty fast as well.  You can smelt the ore with just mining skill, but to clear backpack space of the rocks you mine, you need blacksmithing skill too :).  The advantage here is that the rocks you mine go in stacks of 10, but the finished product after smithing goes in stacks of 20 in your packs, so you may still need a primary skill just to keep your inventory space down, or else plan on frequent swaps between toons.<br />
<br />
Just some more considerations :)  We should move this to the WoW section hehe.<br />

<br />
This is true from what I have seen.  Not sure if there are recipes that are ONLY obtained as drops or not though.  I've read on these forums that a leather bag pattern is a quested item, although I'm not sure that this is not learnable from a trainer later.<br />
<br />
My personal experience was that I found a pattern for a chain vest.  The only thing this saved me was the 2sp or so that I would have needed to spend to train this.  I still couldn't utilize the pattern until my skill was high enough.  It only saved me some money.<br />
<br />
Mach<br />
<br />
[EDIT: This particular pattern wasn't bind on pickup, you could trade to another player or sell to a vendor for that matter.  Can't speak for the higher level crafting and patterns since my skill was only about 90 when beta shut down.]</div></div><hr />

<br />
I sort of have a feeling it will be this way, but obviously I can't verify it :).  I can't see them wanting someone to be that self sufficient to cover crafting with alts alone unless you put in the time to level up those characters.  That's how I'd design it at least hehe.  But I haven't researched much info on it to be honest.  I try to stay as far away from Bliz forums as possible and experience things for myself and avoid the negativity.<br />

I never knew I hated EQ until I read the forums :).  I had 3 1/2 glorious years of ignorance thinking things were working as intended until I stumbled across the crucible.<br />

/reply No.  I'm currently hunting.  I'll make trh8skill items when I'm next in town.  (which turns out to be fairly often due to the amount of travel time being done)<br />
<br />
So far every quest reward I've gotten has been soulbound.<br />
I didn't bother to check the recipe for the leather bag, but it was a quest reward, so I'm assuming it's soulbound like everything else is.<br />
Also, some patterns drop that you cannot buy.  I've gotten a recipe for a belt that needs 8 drops off of some mobs that live on the coast near Ratchet.  The same mob happened to drop the recipe.<br />
<br />
I personally hope that the tradeskill recipes worth anything at the higher levels are mostly/all quest rewards, or bind on equip loot drops from high end mobs.</div></div><hr />

As for cartooney graphics? To each his own I guess, the world, the characters, especially the animation is worlds above EQ. Try swimming underwater and telling me the graphics are not as good as EQ, I dare ya. People should not confuse &quot;colorful&quot; with &quot;cartooney&quot;. Ya EQ has every woman running around with 56 DDDDD boobs, not exactly realistic either there.<br />
<br />
Oh and the sound, yummy. When you knock somone over the head with a club, has that nice woody sound, great music, great sound effects.<br />
<br />
Oh, and did I mention warriors can actually fight? Woot.<br />
<br />
EQ was great, but it is old, and really only viable if you have 5 hour chunks of time and a core group of holy trinity classes on hand, blah.<br />
<br />
Forced grouping is a stupid concept.<br />

It's sort of a mind trick, but if you look beyond that the limitations of the graphics are pretty obvious. Also, many of the &quot;mini areas&quot; are actually identical in layout. There is a fair bit of cut and pasting going on. It's also not true that there is no graphic lag, you can see it if you are paying attention, especially in areas such as those outside Gnomergan. It's not as bad as EQ (and many other &quot;realistic&quot; games), and that is probably why its percieved as lag free.<br />
<br />
As for soloing, while you can do that easily at lower levels, I'm a bit dubious as to whether you can at higher levels, unless you are prepared to settle for very slow leveling. I got up to 14 on open beta, and by that point it was very clear that in order to do some of the more interesting activitities having a group made things an order of magnitude easier (and in some cases they were pretty much impossible to solo at that level).

In addition, its my understanding that the high end of the game is a raiding game, and not really too different from EQ. Thats pretty understandable really. If you had a game that could be soloed to the end, it probably would be pretty quickly and would have no where near the legs that a game like EQ has. There allways has to be higher goals to keep the player base playing, and setting a progression based on solo &lt; group &lt; raid is the logical way to do that.</div></div><hr />

Actually I have seen mobs drop wool but it is rare.  The easiest way to gather wool is to skin it from dead sheep.  There are usually 1 or 2 sheep around every barn/house/farm etc...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I'd like to offer my take on W.O.W.<br />
<br />
First to the TS's.  You will need higher levels of a TS to do certain things. My 23 Dwarf Paladin was DEEP in bad territory when I came across a vein of IRON.  As my mining skill was not 125 I couldn't even attempt to mine it. (and as mentioned - it was guarded)<br />
<br />
At a certain point you can no longer gain skill when doing a particular task within a TS.  For example, mining Copper stops giving skill-ups about 60-75 or so. From then on it's Tin (green in your TS box meaning (ala DAOC) you can still get a skill up but not as likely as a yellow or orange mineral) or Silver.<br />
<br />
So no, there won't be level 1's running around with a 150 in a collection skill.<br />
<br />
Note when I say &quot;collection&quot; skill I refer to Mining, Herbalism, and Skinning.  Then there are the &quot;creation&quot; TS's which work hand in hand such as Alchemy, Engineering, Blacksmithing, Tailoring, Leatherworking and Enchanting. I suppose you could go two collection or mis-match, but then you are auctioning for components or waiting on drops.<br />
<br />
Quests. Heart and soul of WoW.  There are two types - normal and &quot;elite&quot;.  Both show up in your quest box in the DAOC format of grey (trivial to complete), green (easy to complete), yellow (normal to complete), orange (difficult to complete) and red (don't kid yourself).  Note this does not apply to &quot;elite&quot; quests which require a group. (Max of five in WoW). Even when an elite quest went green it was still tough.<br />
<br />
The quest lines make sense both from a RP and risk v reward category. In addition the class questlines also make sense as well and add to the flavour of your character and the experience.<br />
<br />
At levels 12 and 20 you get special quests (sort of Epics) which have sub-quests.  My Paladin level 12 quest was for his ressurection spell and the one at 20 was for a kick butt weapon.<br />
<br />
Oh, I did a slew of quests. Never, EVER had a problem.<br />
<br />
Classes. They can all solo and with food (increases HP regen) and drink (increases mana regen) your downtime is negligible. By &quot;negligible&quot; I mean just that.  The combat engine is DAOC-ish not EQish. I saw a Priest (their version of a Cleric) soloing.<br />
<br />
Of the four classes I played (Shaman, Druid, Warlock (Magician) and Paladin) I thought all were fun, and you played each one very differently. Those of you who clamor for the &quot;true&quot; Shaman need to play a Tauren Shaman. GREAT storyline.<br />
<br />
Raids and PvP. No idea. Don't really care.<br />
<br />
EXP.  The majority of your exp will come from killing things and questing.  Approximately 10% will be from discovering new areas.  There is no &quot;grinding.&quot; There is too much to see and too many things to do.<br />
<br />
Look. Yes a barn is a barn is a barn. A tavern is a tavern is a tavern. Big whoop.  All you Dwarf fans (cough) go into Ironforge and tell me that isn't what Kaladim should look like. I was blown away by that town alone.<br />
<br />
And the side of my brain controlling artsy-fartsy crap doesn't get used much.<br />
<br />
Ambience.  Sound, look, music, combat sound - all there. Really added to the sensation that I was a Dwarf Paladin, traipsing over frozen hills in Dun Moradan (Dwarven homeland). In DAOC I would lag because of the graphics - not in WoW.<br />
<br />
Community. Quite frankly I think this term is overblown.  You can solo to 23 (highest I got) and there is nothing to suggest you won't be able to solo all the way to 60.  People are always looking and yelling to try elite quests so that won't be a problem.  My guess is the community will mirror DAOC and not EQ.<br />
<br />
Player skill. Hit or miss in OB.  Trying to explain aggro and other terms to bonafide newbs is &quot;interesting.&quot;  Mages (straight nuker) and Warlocks (pet + nukes) had a tendency to burn their mana early in a fight.  But hey, if a group doesn't work out you can go it alone.  <br />
<br />
In summation -WoW is what DOAC wanted to be - but isn't.  There is no &quot;death penalty,&quot; there are no class or racial &quot;penalties,&quot; there is no &quot;enforced downtime,&quot; because the developers apparently believe that you should have FUN playing a game and that 4 hour CR's aren't necessarily fun.  <br />
<br />
I went into OB with VERY high expectations and they were met. WoW is what I am looking for at this point and I will be playing in retail.<br />

<br />
So what if EQ has techically &quot;better&quot; graphics if what they are displaying looks like crap? I havent seen anything in EQ that looks remotely as good as taking a trip on one of the gryphons in WoW. Even the very first gryphon route you find if you are playing a dwarf looks stunning. And have you noticed how sun/moonlight reflect from certain terrainsurfaces? And the way that in WoW they use fog the way its supposed to be used (and not the clumsy wall of fog we all know from EQ)?<br />

I agree with your sentiments about raiding.  In EQ i watched as raiding went from being a fun extra for doing a few special mobs to being compulsory if you didn't want your main to be anything other than a gimp.<br />
<br />
But the problem is that the number one proponent of raiding, he who shouted loudest for its domination of all things EQ now works for Blizzard.  And it appears that he is working his poison again: WoW started as being aimed at all styles of play with none of them receiving special status.  Its now changing, and changing horribly for anyone except the raider.  At least when Furor wrecked EQ I wasn't actually paying him a salary: if I play WoW I will be.  So for this one reason alone I will not play WoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">EQ graphics are not as good as WoW, no way in hell. Ogres in Eq look like some sort of weird &quot;Blaster&quot; guy from Beyond thunderdome. the environments are worse in my opinion, the player and critter animations in EQ are lame, overall, yes EQ strives to be more &quot;realistic&quot; in it's appearance, making humans look dull, etc, but that is hardly a graphics quality issue. EQ doesn't seem to have any real &quot;style&quot; besides Frogloks.<br />
<br />
Not only can you solo all you want at any levels, but, you can get good loot, the fights are pretty quick, and fun.<br />
<br />
Quests, I have done many quests, orange and red, solo, you just have to be a intelligent person. The elite quests, for the most part, yes you need a group to do them at the appropriate level, such as Ragefire, WC, etc.<br />
<br />
Compare this to EQ where you need a minimum group of 6 of the appropriate classes, all maxed level, to do any quest that gives you anything worthwhile at all. Even years later, to get an important spell you will need to farm for weeks to buy a 60,000 damned platinum spell some uber guild farms 10 of a day, I mean, there is accomplishments, then there is just banging your nutsack with a mallet over and over.<br />
<br />
WoW is fun, EQ is not, and yes I recently tried EQ again, same old, just a little easier to get around.<br />
<br />
I just love being able to login, kick ass for an hour, and have fun. In EQ it is log in, gather a group of trinity classes, grind for hours on end, with a 3% chance of anyone in the group getting a usefull item or meaningful experience, that is just boring.</div></div><hr />

Open beta was what? 2 weeks? And you reached 47 in that time. How long to max level, about a month, and then what do you do? Without progressive group based content at the end game people will run out of world to explore and things to do pretty quickly at that pace. The high end of the game will be raiding/required grouping without question. If it isnt, I predict that the game will slowly start to die within a few months.<br />
<br />
Now, some people don't think much of raiding, but for the most part they are just ignorant fools. They say that raiding is just zerging, with little skill involved, which explains why some raiding guilds fly through to Tacvi and Anguish while others hit brick walls in pre-elemental PoP with greater numbers. Yup, its all just skill-less Zerging *rollseyes*. Content which is designed to be soloed is by nature very restrictive in how the content can be designed, consequently once you have done one of those encounters you have done them all. Group and raid content on the other hand can be designed more flexibly, and that is what gives games depth from a longevity point of view (unless they are PvP orientated games of course).<br />
<br />
Blizzard will certainly be aware of this, and with a subscription model they will want to retain subscribers. While making the lower levels relatively easy with lots of places to explore sucks people into the game, that content will be exhausted very quickly, and to retain those subscribers they have to have long term time-sink goals in place that cater to both for regular and elite players. And that means required group content and raids at the high end for a PvE game ;)<br />
<br />
I predict that if the high end is PvE, it will be very similar to EQ in style before very long.</div></div><hr />

And figuring out raid encounters takes a PhD, huh?  Oh look, mob is at 70% and we get 8 gazillion adds.  First try - wipe.  Second try, mob is at 70%, we cc, offtank, whatever the adds... mob at 50%, AE debuff.  Second try - wipe.  3rd try, etc...  Trying an encounter, wiping, then trying again by countering what you saw (yes, and usually with greater numbers) doesnt exactly imply skill that the lesser non-raiders do not possess.  Raids are not done by zerging only because someone else zerged through it the first time and figured out how to more efficiently do it, with the right combinations of people.  Success mostly hinges on people listening.  Why is this better than a solo encounter?  Because it can be screwed up by one a-hole watching tv and not paying attention?  This is fun?  This is skill?  This is challenge?  Why is being a solo character and &quot;only picking mobs off the fringes&quot; of a camp or whatever you said before constitute any less &quot;skill&quot; to figure it out?  I can figure out how best to get into the camp and mine my silver ore or loot a battered chest, without dying, etc.  And I don't have to rely on 71 or 53 other slaves to not screw it up on me.  If anyone thinks that being the first to do something in EQ is anything special, you are sorely deluded.  I'm more likely to continue a game that gives me options other than end-game raiding than one that forces me into a role that they determined was the &quot;right&quot; way to play.  F EQ.</div></div><hr />

Number of players + gear + clerics + warriors + time = PWN, that is about it for raiding.<br />

The hardcore EQ players like long time commitments, excrutiating quests for a slight increase in power, and more of the same, day in and day out.<br />

I may be wrong, but I believe he meant the closed beta, which was ongoing for several months.  Unlike EQ2, Blizzard tested the hell out of WoW.  I'm sure it will show in the polish and completeness of the product that ships next week.<br />

<br />
First of all is getting to maximum level in WoW not difficult (on my last shaman I did it in 7 days played and it could have been faster without tradeskills). As a fact Blizzard stated that this was intentional and that the majority of the content would be stuff to do when you are capped.<br />
Even in the beta we have seen some of this:<br />
You have faction quests that unlock when you get better faction (can be done solo)<br />
You have quests for epic items, also something that can be done solo<br />
You have instances that require 1 group<br />
You have instances for mini-raids (2-3 groups)<br />
You have instances for full raids (40 players max)<br />
<br />
Missing is hero classes (should be solo content), Battlezones (solo/1 group/raid), lifequests<br />
<br />
I have been at the level cap (60) for 3 months (if not more) and I still had not finished all the stuff I could do solo and I still had fun in instances and I even had fun raiding (WoW raids require (unlike the ones from EQ) players to think and react quickly)<br />

But feel free to stay in EQ and feel all powerfull and Uber. You will not be missed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">A few quotes from my guilds boards about the high end part of WoW:<br />
<br />
Went to a raid with FoH on one of the new raid zones. I don't know how they all are, but the one we went to was pretty hardcore, everything was nasty. Our 40 person raid barely made it past the entrance and killed like 10 things only (each mob was very hard with ae's etc). It was very fun, but I'm not sure how much it will differ from eq raids yet... <br />
<br />
From a guy who tests on Blizzards internal servers, relating to the high end game:<br />
The Dev's have said that WoW is meant to be played at lvl 60. From what I have seen there are not alot of diffrences from EQ.<br />
<br />
Leveling up in EQ takes you through a progression of new zones with new gear to be aquired as you proceed (or more likely bought from people who have been there before you). What happens when you reach max level?<br />

Again, how is this a better, more challenging system?  Hmm, relying on a cleric to not miss a CH since he's eating pizza and watching cartoon network, or being able actually do challenging things by yourself and get rewarded for it?  What a concept.  And just because my magelo allows you to infer my progress in the game, you have no idea how my raids were.  Yes, the first time we did an encounter it took more of us than the next few times, even with spoilers.  I find it hard to believe that anything changes later on.  Even without spoilers, you make an attempt... wipe, then adjust until you win.  You don't have an academic all-star team of guild officers that can infer how to win a fight before you ever see what the fight entails.  Is this skill?  No, I don't think so.  <br />

<br />
Taking a higher level camp with a group, versus soloing a camp your level.  Hmm, which one sounds like zerging?  You don't need to be 10 levels higher to fight at a camp, that my friend is EQ and EQ2.  God forbid someone made a game where a mob that is XX level can actually be beat by someone that is XX level.  I fought through camps of level 15's when I was level 15 (/boggle) in order to reach my goals.  I've also beating higher level camps with groups of friends.  Which is bette?  That can be debated, it's just refreshing that a game gives you that option.</div></div><hr />

The end game in EQ was for the most part main tanking with healers spamming Cheal (no clue about the current status of that but I doubt much changed). And even for the few non MT raids it all came down to a few knwoing what to do and many just doing as told.<br />

WoW (to me) is about the journey. There is a story (well multiple stories actually) that not only make sense, but tie into the &quot;big picture.&quot;  Tell me - how's the lore in EQ these days?<br />
<br />
But really Tugela (and others), I'm GLAD you're having so much fun in EQ you feel the need to question a game you (apparently) have no intention of playing. <br />
<br />
LLFM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">It's not a question of trying to convince one way or another Faern. I'm pointing out that the reasons for leaving one game are likely to be in the game you are going to as well. On the face of it WoW looks very nice, you can do quests that give you gear upgrades, xp and so on, and that is so much better than EQ right? Well, in my experience with WoW I found that the most efficient way of getting both xp and gear was NOT to do the much touted quest system (which mostly seemed to be the generic kill x mobs/gather y items type common in EQ anyway), but to rampage through lower level &quot;treasure&quot; areas. The old EQ adage &quot;its better to kill hordes of low blues fast than high blues/yellows slow for xp&quot; holds true in WoW as well. The cash you gather from selling items was enough to buy items in the auction houses that were much better than anything that dropped in the areas/quests you could actually fight in. I did most of the quests anyway, because I like doing quests, but it did strike me as contary to what most of the hypers were gushing. Once the newness of WoW fades, its probably going to have many off the same issues that (at least some) people dispise about EQ.<br />
<br />
Personally I was dissappointed with the quests that were offered, I don't much care for the collection/slaughter type of quests in either game (the task system in EQ for example is really poorly implemented in that regard IMO for example) unless they are part of some sort of continuous plot, but I didnt see that in any of the quests that were available to me. Maybe that changes at higher levels, I don't know, but as things stand they sort of suck. I think the real purpose of the quests is to guide newbs through the game as they level, sort of like a road map of where to hunt next. The quests themselves are bland and extremely simple. I think that anyone with enough smarts could probably find more efficient ways if they were primarily interested in leveling or exploring though.<br />
<br />
One thing I really did like about the game was the seemless transition when moving between most zones. The only actuall zoneline I can recall encountering was the tram thing. Gryphon travel is pretty cool too, I loved that :). The death/CR thing is an improvement on the EQ system.</div></div><hr />

All I can say is after many years in EQ I was totally taken in by WoW.  The &quot;can't sleep&quot; must EXPLORE or get to this area caused me to stay awake FAR past my bedtime.<br />
<br />
I can solo in WoW (any class can), I can group if I want, much like EQ used to be for me:<br />

There is always something to do in WoW.<br />

<br />
Two things here to reply to.  Number one, I've seen some of the biggest idiots in large scale EQ raiding guilds.  Yes even the leader of one the most successful guilds on Fennin Ro is a complete a-hole and has about zero common sense when it comes to people.  Socially retarded, power gaming people like this are not necessarily 'intelligent',  it just means that they have more time to pound thier head against the wall than I do.  <br />
<br />
As for soloing not being a challenge.  That is utter BS.  In WoW during open beta I was soloing creature that were 2 and 3 levels above me,  working my way into and out of really bad places with lots of scary things that could kill me if I wasn't extremely careful.  This is not skill?  With a group of people my level taking on the same areas it would have been so much easier, and I probably could have turned on the tv and just sit back and nuked everyone once in a while and no one would have noticed.   This is much more rewarding of an experience that it would of been had I grouped.<br />
<br />
What about taking out Hogger at level 9 solo?  He is a level 11 Elite mob, and if I didnt have any skill I definitely would not have won that fight.<br />
<br />
You talk as if you know it all about gaming Tugela, but the more you open your mouth the more I can see you're trying hard to keep your world balanced and keep yourself on top.  It's sad man, let go of EQ and join the revolution!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">That is only true at low level Tugela.<br />
Buying equipment is only an option when you have players around who offer them for sale (something that takes a while on a new server).<br />
And the fastest way to level is not to grind, it is a combination of grinding with quests. Knowing what quest to do where can combine them leads to much faster levelling then just grinding.<br />
<br />
But to each his own, I will just play WoW for 1 simple reason.<br />
The CS is so much better then the crap SoE offers as CS. I was a paying customer for SoE for years and all they ever did was nerfing my class to hell and ignoring us.</div></div><hr />

there is a sort of a substitute for skill in EQ raiding but it's not skill persay in which it's an ability derived from individual skill but more an ability of a group to logistically coordinate large numbers of people to do something<br />
<br />
in other words, unless you're at a certain level of the game, you absolutely cannot beat an encounter.  it's a limiting requirement.  but is that skill?  no it's just that you need x gear and x people and x sequence of events.  the skill to actually play the character... despite what ppl fool themselves into thinking.. can be learned in a few sessions playing.  what guild hasn't in a pinch had you play someone else's character or teach a roommate/in-game friend to run the character<br />
<br />
it's not skill, by any sort of accepted English definition of the word but it is a resource... look at it this way.  for some cultures, like in korea with lineage, the highest honor doesn't go to the best players per say but the clan leaders, people who are basically good at logistics and motivating/cajoling people to be at a certain place at a certain time and do things in a specific order<br />
<br />
as for wow raiding.<br />
<br />
i never beat onyxia but did take a crack at her and also in molten core<br />
<br />
there's been very careful thought about end-game/raiding from the very beginning... with a dedicated team working ONLY on raids and with the involvement from pre-alpha from the vp of developement and the team lead of wow.  atm they only have 2 encounters completed but the mechanics of the system is in place.  with a linear progression like PoP for a limited number of very elite mobs and a non-linear progression for others.  raids are basically divided into 40-man raids and smaller mini-raids.  so that you can START a raid with just part of your guild, and have the rest of the guys log in after a few hours and actually take a crack at the main boss<br />
<br />
the encounters themselves are actually pretty interesting... WoW is a true 3d game as opposed to eq whose guts are based off text based DIKUmud and therefore always had wierd issues with ranged etc.  the idea is that the raids should be much less dependent on a CH chain, but in effect yer still pretty much limited by the numbers of 1)warriors 2)priests 3)dps<br />
<br />
finally, EQ transplants will at opportune moments feel an odd EQ feel in wow... like my first time in strath when i ran past the Legacy of Steel weapon shop near the banshee boss lol</div></div><hr />

It seems to me that WoW's plan is to concentrate on the &quot;fun&quot; as opposed to EQ concentrating on &quot;accomplishment.&quot;  It's a different strategy that should make it's way into the high end game as well.  Hopefully especially in the areas of locked content and timesinks.  For instance, if WoW requires 3 hours of clearing crap that doesnt drop squat to get to a boss mob, I'll be a bit surprised.  Or if has content that is actually designed so that only 10% of the population are actually expected to ever even see it, I'll be surprised.</div></div><hr />

You're the one who doesnt know what he's talking about Bud. I play one of the senior warriors in my guild and as such am frequently called on to decide who tanks what, and in what order. Those decisions are based on partly on people's gear and disc state, but also on their responsibility and experience, or their need to aquire relevant experience. At our level pretty everyone knows the mechanics but are not necessarily equal when it comes to experience, making snap decisions in battle, placement or doing what is expected of them. Gear plays a role but it is not everything. I would never consider putting &quot;someone else's roommate&quot; into the tank lineup, they wouldnt have a clue what to do in a raid no matter how much &quot;instruction&quot; they have been given. Sometimes raid leaders run other peoples toons if we are short on needed classes, but those people are extremely experienced players (and even then we use them in supporting roles as backups, not as primarys). It's not unusuall for raid leaders to question the wisdom of decisions in tells, so they have opinions about various people's abilities as well. I know from conversations with other classes that similar situations exist with them, depending on how critical their tasks are. Suggesting that individual skill plays no role and that you could slot in any monkey is just ignorance.</div></div><hr />

Ah, but while discussing the high end gameplay of various games, here's one not to ignore.<br />
<br />
These are games.  We (should) play games to have fun.  If a new game offers more fun, then why should you stick with the old one just because you're maxed out?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">But the problem is that the number one proponent of raiding, he who shouted loudest for its domination of all things EQ now works for Blizzard.  And it appears that he is working his poison again: WoW started as being aimed at all styles of play with none of them receiving special status.  Its now changing, and changing horribly for anyone except the raider.  At least when Furor wrecked EQ I wasn't actually paying him a salary: if I play WoW I will be.  So for this one reason alone I will not play WoW.<br />
I completely understand your reservations.  There's a couple things to keep in mind- at least they're what my crew and I have discussed related to this issue.<br />
<br />
1) Leveling is fast(er) than EQ.  You feel like you're accomplishing something when you play.<br />
2) More time friendly than EQ.<br />
3) Dungeons and non-raid encounters are not tuned for raid gear and are being beaten by people wearing nothing but gear they earned in single group content.<br />
<br />
If the game devolves into EQ 1.5 at L60 such that there is no non-raid progression, we're going to quit on the spot.  I look back on EQ and can't believe they kept me another year after the PoP debacle.  Some of my friends that are joining me in WoW have never played a MMORPG in their life.  They will not think twice to quit if it's not fun.  I can assure you there's a lot more people like my friends than the FoH raid crowd.<br />
<br />
Given the fact that even with my time limited playstyle I will be L60 in the first six months, it won't be the long journey of 3 years only to discover how screwed I am as a non-raider.  Blizzard will either make it rewarding for the L60 non-raider or they will bleed subscribers in droves.

You mean polygon count?<br />

Anyway, wow decided to make very simple characters and environments and work more with texturing. Many people like to regard the characters ugly or simple with low poly count. I dont care though, aslong as it runs good. But maybe, just maybe, should they have used a few more polys in some of them, especially when equipping new armor.<br />
<br />
The texturing and sculpting of environment is where wow leaves me in awe. Not only have they succeeded in creating an overall feel to the game, they have also handmade many specific locations. Not at all like the farmhouses of the karanas all those years ago ;)<br />

Well one, Blizzard actually tests their games and WoW was no exception.  Two, when you are confident in your product, and KNOW that you have a superior game, you aren't worried about EQ2. (Or anyone else for that matter).<br />
<br />
Different mindset Vigdis. Blizzard =/= Sony.  A rushed to market piece of crap is still a piece of crap. And from pre-order rumours they are well-founded in their optimism.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">/agreed.  I love EQ, but it is a love/hate relationship.  I've also loved playing many Blizzard games; Warcraft, Starcraft, Diablo I&amp;II and several others, and have never felt the fustration with them that I have had with EQ.<br />
<br />
I'm not a fanboi, but I do admire the company's attitude, &quot;get it right the first time, regardless of how long it takes.&quot;  I really think it was rather pathetic the way SoE acted with the release date of EQ2.  As soon as it was public knowledge that WoW was being released on the 23rd, they rushed to release 2 weeks earlier.  Was it rushed, heck yeah, game sites and magazines were still giving out beta accounts 3 days before launch.  Also, no game guides (WoW guide is awesome and out prior to launch), why, because the launch was not properly planned out, just a knee-jerk reaction.  It is a very sad indication of their fear and desperation.  Yes, first to market is an advantage.  Some that have begun playing EQ2 will not even try WoW.  However, that does not make it a better game.<br />
<br />
I firmly believe both games are very good, and each will appeal to a different type of player.  However, there is no doubt in my mind which is a better game company and will provide the best support for their product.<br />
<br />
P.S.  In 2 years of playing EQ, I never saw 2hb working properly in game.  Spent 2 years poking mobs with 2 handed hammers.  Getting character animations right is pretty darn basic, ya think?</div></div><hr />

Honestly though Thunder, how many of those Blizzard games did you play for even 1/10th of the time you played EQ, both in terms of Calander years and total Playtime-hours? <br />
<br />
I bet if you compared those first 200 hours of EQ or so to the 200ish you played those Blizzard games, you would find you had just as much fun, without fustration, with EQ as Diablo. But you continued to play EQ, and eventually, the fustration set in. Thats because with games like Diablo, you finish them, play another couple weeks, maybe run a few other classes a bit, whatever, then you move on. People dont play EQ like that. <br />
<br />
Same situation with the new games. Of COURSE they are gonna be great in the beginning. Wonderful games! Fresh, new content! New classes to learn, zones to explore, etc etc. 200 guarenteed hours of mad fun. Lets just see where people stand with them after a year though, eh? See if theres any fustrations. See if the same issues start cropping up. <br />
<br />
I kinda view both EQ2 and WoW as &quot;be careful what you wish for . . .&quot; games. I honestly believe, at least a LITTLE BIT, the original Verant adage that &quot;The average gamer doesnt know whats best for the game hes playing&quot;. And while we're at it, lets just start admitting right now that there will NEVER be another game to put as much time on our screens as EQ, never. I see new games are 1-year to 18 month affairs, then another new one will replace them. Just a sense I get, to be honest, I have no real evidence to support such a theory, I just think thats how the market will begin to flow.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would say that 50% of my time in the game in EQ was wasted.  Wasted waiting for groups, waiting for spawns, waiting for bugged encounters to reset or despawn, waiting while recovering after wiping to untuned and broken events.  Lots of waiting and wasting time. 50% is also an lowball estimate. Compared to another soon-to-be-released game made by a company whose name sounds like a frigid weather phenomenon, EQ is just a long waste of time and SoE seems to prefer empty, broken filler to real, working content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>drib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">Personally I was dissappointed with the quests that were offered, I don't much care for the collection/slaughter type of quests in either game (the task system in EQ for example is really poorly implemented in that regard IMO for example) unless they are part of some sort of continuous plot, but I didnt see that in any of the quests that were available to me. <br />
<br />
Did you notice how every single quest you did worked without a single problem?  Did you notice how the collect items dropped with a good frequency, rather than 1 in 100, 200 or 300 mobs?  When is the last time that happened for you in EQ?  Completely working quests in EQ are more the exception than the norm.<br />
<br />
Stoicism in LoY was quested.  I did it as soon as I heard about the quest.  I believe you killed pirates in Dulak for a flask, which you gave to an NPC in Gunthak, which spawned 2 mobs to be killed and looted and you turned in those quest items for the spell.  Simple, right?  Too bad it was broken when I did it and the NPC ate my pieces of flotsam and jetsam and I had to start all over.<br />
<br />
Quests in WoW are worthwhile.  Quests in EQ are not.  For having the title &quot;Everquest,&quot; they might actually want to put some good, working quests in the game.</div></div><hr />

I found a &quot;broken&quot; WoW quest. I was told to go looking for something in the southeast and what i was looking for was in the southwest. I of course bugged it and sent it on it's merry way. The quest worked, just gave some wrong directions. I would have to say that 70% of my exp came from qeust too!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Osmodia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">Quests :<br />
I did some nice quests in EQ. When Kunark hit the shelves I was a die hard Ikky shaman slaving away on the 8-part Skull quest while my bro worked tirelessly on his equivalent Greenmist. Those were some quests worth getting up for! Now, 100plat in the bazaar buys an equivalent reward. Anyone invest infinite hours on the ring quests or the velius shawl? But somewhere after Kunark and Velius, Everquest became Evercash and the concept of questing was lost forever. Our epic is bugged so that you don't even have to do 2/3s of it, and SOE has turned a blind eye to it. The idea of the &quot;quest&quot; is dead. Quest is purpose. Plot is reason. My EQ shaman has no purpose or reason for being that I know of. I lost hope. I recently rolled some Vah Shir chars with my bro. The citizen membership quests were exciting, but due to market saturation, the rewards were downgrades from 100plat weapons in the bazaar. The only reason to do them is for self-satisfaction.<br />
<br />
WoW :<br />
I was late for OB so hope someone can answer. Once you hit 60, are you done xp'n? Does your character have ways of improving, AA or otherwise? I think AAs were ingenious as it allowed characters of the same level to group even though they were vastly different in skills and power. I think there has to be a noticable difference between a level 60 who just dinged and a level 60 who plays quite often. This is important for any MMORPG survivability. Accomplishment must be noticable among peers or WoW will be on the downward slope after everyone &quot;maxes out&quot;. <br />
<br />
I want so badly for WoW to succeed in all the ways that, I feel, EQ has failed me. The idea of the &quot;quest&quot; appeals to so many and it's SOE's fault for not nurturing it. It's the equivalent of having a money tree for 3 years and not watering it.</div></div><hr />

Apparently at higher levels you can become &quot;heroes&quot; similar to the ones found in W3 Frozen Throne. I am unsure of the specifics or implementation, but there is  something  planned for you to keep enjoying your character.</div></div><hr />

CoD, Tactics, PoS, PoV, PoT and HoH were available through single group quests, BoT could be got into with 2-3 groups of ordinary equiped toons with decent skill at the time (It can probably be one grouped now). The only zones out of reach for non-raiders were Time (which is raid only anyway), the elementals (which for the most part would have ripped apart average geared toons of the day) and ToSR.</div></div><hr />

You take 40 people from a high level raiding guild, and 40 &quot;casuals&quot;, give them identical toons and throw them into an identical unknown encounter, and I pretty much guarentee than the raiders will perform an order of magnituted better. That's what skill is bud, its being comfortable and expert with the tools of your trade, so you know what to do, when to do it and how to do it without being told.

If you take any 40 people and teach them something by doing the same thing over and over they'll be better than 40 people who havent done it before.<br />
Some of the biggest numbnuts ive seen in single group content come from Uber raiding guilds.<br />
Dont get me wrong im not saying casual players dont have their share of idiots trust me they do.<br />
I just dont like people stating that raiding always requires skill.<br />
If you are the person who works out how to kill RZ etc for the 1st time then yes that requires skill but to say that if i was to go kill em tomorrow  requires skill on my part what with all the spoilers etc out there then that is totally wrong.<br />
An example...<br />
I make a group in BoT me as healer,slower etc I know that this group will be in no trouble at all.<br />
Now we take a shaman who has just hit 65 got exact same equipment as me but never MH'd or been in BoT.He is not going to be as good as me but thats not skill.<br />
Its the fact ive seen it done,know when to heal etc and have done it countless times before.Its got nothing to do with skill its just repetitive learning.<br />

Wulf, you listed a TON of zones, and Tug already explained the 1-groupable things I mentioned. In the original EQ, players 45+ basically had TWO!!!! zones to play in for MONTHS and MONTHS. Kunark had what, 3? OS, KC and HS (which had faction issues that made them unusable by 1/4 of the players) and . . .. ?? Velious didnt even REALLY have that many, they had Kael, Velks, Maybe Skyshrine, and . . . ?? Yet these are still regarded as &quot;The Best of Times&quot; in EQ.

I am gonna call BULLCRAP on this Iz. See, your biggest problem with EQ was always the &quot;other&quot; guy. The &quot;other&quot; zones. Did you do your PoJ trial to get PoV and PoS access? Did you even bother TRYING to camp the back-door items for any zones other than Tactics? PoP offered YOU, the non-raider, a BUTTLOAD of content you could enjoy. You just got SOOOO hung up on the things you couldnt do, it interfered with the fun that was available to you.

<br />
LDoN and LoY were also very nice expansions for the non-raider, but STILL you were, and still are, totally hung up on the things you CANT do. Heard there are flags in WoW Iz, that true? Heard there are going to be &quot;raid only&quot;, locked zones too. That true? Why arent you bitching about that right now? <br />

I have a ton of respect for you Iz, I really do, but sheesh man, give me a BREAK. You played, and LOVED, EQ for a long long time. The game ran out for you. Saddly, it ran out before there was a viable alternative. THAT is what ruined it. That you were basically FORCED to play this game you couldnt enjoy anymore because there wasnt anything else even close out there. But dont dismiss EQ like piece of garbage. Whether you agree with me now or not is not relevant. When you look back, you HAVE to admit its one of the best games you played, of all time.

You are not required to group on your timezone server. Personally I think it is a brilliant idea though. Think about it. You are going to log on as similar times as those in your same time zones. It will help finding groups that are in your same prime time groupage.</div></div><hr />

I hated LDoN.  Normal was too easy for my DPS group and my group was too unconventional and bazzaar geared for hard advents (except for two elemental guildies who I sometimes had the pleasure of grouping with).

I played on a CST server, but I reside in an EST timezone.  I could play in any timezone I want.  In EQ, the servers are located in one or two spots and everyone connects accross timezones.  I think the Blizzard model is better because I can arrange a server, timezone and faction with my friends and still play with them.  There was no more noticable lag for me than others on the servers I played on in open BETA who lived in those timezones.  The lag was pretty bad until they managed to find the load balance and then it seemed to improve dramatically.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u87"><b>niwggib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p87">Blazz, I think we are leaving. I have already canceled my accounts. (all three of them) Some have 4 months left as I saw no interest in any other online game and purchased 6 month subscriptions knowing full well about EQ2 and WoW. I started this thread and I loved EQ, hell I still love EQ. Probably always will. That is not the issue. <br />
<br />
I found another game that offered a fun environment. I compared it to the game that I played for years and loved. But I am done. I am sick and tired of my game feeling like work. <br />
<br />
I came here and expressed that fact with a message board that I love, and the people I look up to, have had fun playing with, watching, and reading about. So while I still respect a lot of what you have to say, I find your angry posts about those expressing their current dislike for SoE distasteful. The title clearly states that I dont like eq as much because of wow. So I would expect some EQ bashing!<br />
<br />
I guess I would ask to keep this thread a little more civil. Those that are asking about WoW. Ask away, I will answer anything I know or how I felt or what ever I can. Those that want to bash SoE do it with a little more tact. We all know the fusterations and some people obviously can live with them so respect their opinions too. Those bashing the bashers, lighten up just a bit too, please!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u88"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p88">As to the whole WoW vs EQ 2 thing, I've decided against WoW and the deciding factor was their sytem of dividing up servers by time zone. One of the best joys of EQ has been meeting people from other countries.<br />
<br />
Well I've always gone with what somebody said:<br />
<br />
&quot;I enjoy MMORPG's IN SPITE of other people - not because of them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vis-a-vis Blizz and their servers, I sorta doubt they have one farm on the east coast, one central, one mountain and one out on the west coast.<br />
<br />
I've read they have one central location in Virginia, which is interesting because I thought Blizz and Vivendi had their HQ in California.<br />
<br />
FWIW I'm picking a role-play server NOT in my time zone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as servers being seperated by time zone, this can work to the benefit of the players. Not only can you arrange larger populations at popular hours, but you can also perform any necessary maintenance and/or patching during virtual emptyness. <br />
<br />
Looking to camp a contested mob for an important item? Just log on during worse off-hours and you may have the whole area to yourself. Want to meet people from different countries and/or cultures? Go to 7-11, because they probably won't even be awake on your server anyway.<br />
<br />
And Gunderson, if your reason for not playing WoW is because you cannot meet people from other countries, then it probably doesn't matter how blizzard arranges their servers. It seems such a minor point to totally discount the game over. If it wasn't the servers it would be some other nuance (like trees only having an even number of leaves) to cause you to not play the game.<br />

Here here.<br />
Last quote on the subject is its differing playstyles not skill.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Wulf, you listed a TON of zones, and Tug already explained the 1-groupable things I mentioned. In the original EQ, players 45+ basically had TWO!!!! zones to play in for MONTHS and MONTHS. Kunark had what, 3? OS, KC and HS (which had faction issues that made them unusable by 1/4 of the players) and . . .. ?? Velious didnt even REALLY have that many, they had Kael, Velks, Maybe Skyshrine, and . . . ?? Yet these are still regarded as &quot;The Best of Times&quot; in EQ. You listed 4 HUGE zones in PoP, you apparently didnt even KNOW about the back-door quests into the next tier, how many PoJ trials did you do again? <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Nope was flagged for CoD and Tactics so obviously didnt know about them.<br />
You were here when EQ was new do you actually remember how massive it was.Yes compared to today its tiny but after text muds etc it was massive.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Stop bashing EQ for the sake of bashing it. Just /cancel billing, and come here in 6 months, when you are tired of fetching in WoW cause you cant FIND a group cause NO ONE groups, and then tell me how you did.<br />
<br />
<br />
I dont bash EQ.I bash SoE.Spent 5 years in this game and god knows how much money so it must have something going for it.<br />
Ive got no intention of playing WoW or EQ2 no idea where you got that idea from.<br />
Billing ends 03/05 and after that im probably done with EQ and MMoRPG's just need to find another hobby that is as cheap and keeps me occupied for so long.<br />

<br />
Ummm.. Well. I did Blazz. With my small guild I had every one of em that was level 60+ flagged for tactics before SOE opened up the HoH and the rest. And they were all flagged for BoT as well. And a few of us that bothered to camp had the quest flag for Halls of Lux. We killed the Giants in storms. And got the flags that way. We got through Justice trials the hard way. And ferried in other folks to flag them.<br />
<br />
I was stuck with no progression in PoP. For a long long time. With no raid gear. Overseer was just always a little too hard. Then when he was doable By then all my guilds tanks had moved on Or had RL interfere. Now we are. I farmed piglet till my eyes bled I sold Piglet sheilds and earrings and bought others spells and upgrades. I watched as people kept leaving because there was no option but raid or die. <br />
<br />
Now of course there are some single group options. But while some of it is fun there is no heart left in me. <br />
<br />
These are the kinds of statements that send me through the roof with insanity. &quot;PoP sucked cause I didnt do the stuff that was there, and I couldnt get flagged for Time and score the really phat lewtz the raiders got, so it sucked&quot;.

<br />
But it didn't. What happened happened. And it was a strong blow to EQ. After my break I had a good time with the revamped Gates. I explored. I did alot of the things there. and I enjoyed it. But The magic has been long gone. It has been gone for me since Kunark really. And early Velious before I started to realise Raid or die was the viable mentality. <br />
<br />
Like I said in my State of the shaman. I wander the lands looking for charecter, for purpose. I find neither. <br />
<br />
I will wander other lands now. As Incandesant on the Pinnicle Server in CoH. And More than likely as a shaman and or undead warrior on some server in WoW. And While I am cancling my EQ accounts for the moment. I can always walk the lands of Norrath again. It takes 5 minutes to key in a Card number and then just download the patches. <br />
<br />
I always played to be with my friends. And now Like my friends I find that EQ is no longer the sandbox we play in. We have moved on to bigger and better things. Or maybe other sandboxes. Not better, but closer to home and heart. <br />
<br />
And much like you said in one of your posts. I am truly leaving EQ. But EQ abandoned me a long time ago. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u97"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p97">Blazz, if you are suggesting that POP was good for non-raiders, you just are so wrong it makes my hair curl.  <br />
<br />
Certainly as a major and ambitious expansion POP clearly offered some things - but on the whole, POP progression was a horrendous design and it's biting the game on the ass.  I was saying that over 2 years ago and I was right then too.  <br />
<br />
I don't know how to classify myself.  A frustrated powergamer/semi-raider/wannabe raider?  I left my very casual friendly guild because POP was killing us to join a more successful raiding guild with a casual climate.  That was great, but now our numbers have dramatically tailed off.  <br />
<br />
While I did enjoy a lot of POP raiding, I have eyes open enough to see that for way too large a percentage of the game population, it was a frustrating POS.  Lots of good, smart people quit.  It's ok to disenfranchise a percentage of the population to make the rest feel special, but if you take that too far, it's simply a bad game design decision.  SOE lost good people because of stupid design, design that was unnecessary.  <br />
<br />
POP progression was retarded.  Scales back to 8 flagging events or so, and that would be fine.  <br />
<br />
This is a really old topic.  How did we circle back to this?  <br />
<br />
Anyway, EQ is much better off now.  Blazz is clearly right that if Omens came first, then Gates, EQ would never have had the huge hiccup it did.  I still can't believe how bad they frigged up.  But they did, and it really really really cost them.  I'm amazed Smedly didn't lose his job over that.  <br />
<br />
I'm having fun and still playing when I can.  I'm not going to try to EQ2 because I don't see the need.  <br />
<br />
I might try WOW for the hell of it.  Maybe even PVP.  <br />

True.  While I enjoyed the content I had access too and I tried to get in on open raids, I had no hope in hell of getting to Elementals. I played at odd hours.  It was fun, but the limit was evident.<br />
<br />
I might try WOW for the hell of it.  Maybe even PVP.  <br />
<br />
Astaa, will you be in wow pvp?<br />
PvP in wow is quick and vicious.  I tried a PvP server (after 5 years of being an EQ bluebie) and things happened fast and furious.  It was fun and in some senses even safe.  Only contested zones are open PvP, you are warned that your tag is changing as you enter, but that's the last shred of protection you get.  In your faction controlled zones you are safe so long as you don't engage or accept duels.  Hunters are awesome in PvP, if only to mark targets.  Night elves are lethal at night as even marked, they can slip away if they disengage and stand still.  I hate night elf rogues with a passion.<br />
<br />
PvP character builds are totally different from PvE char builds and it makes for some interesting diversity and options.  There is no PvP looting apparently, at least I was never looted after leaving dozen of corpses in contested zones.  At least on the server I was on, people were happy to hunt and kill any opposing faction players.  They'd be announced in general chat or defense channels and groups would head off to kick butt.  It's an interesting experience and I'm not entirely sure I liked it, but it had it's moments.</div></div><hr />

Each and every one of us are different and each and everyone of us have different experiences.    Every single game has a certain life expectancy.  That time is determined by you or in some cases by the company shutting down the game.  In simple terms when its your time to quit walk away.  If you don't know when its your time to quit just ask yourself are you having fun anymore?  If the answer is no then there is no reason to keep playing.  I hear some people say they only play the game to talk to the people they have met online.  Isn't there another way you can talk to those people if you no longer enjoy the game?   There was no 1 expansion that killed EQ and there is nor will there be an expansion to save it.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u103"><b>Ughbash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p103">I would say that ldon added more for the non raider then any other expansion including PoP (this is only talking gear not AA).  My main is a monk so this will come from more of a melee perspectice. But LDON gave hyou a chance to plug away and get armor that was better then ornate.  Other drops off God Kills, I can not think of one item in PoP better then LDON until you get to elemental planes.  You got to add augments to your gear which was a very nice upgrade for everyone. <br />
<br />
By doing 366 ldons in the right areas your charm augment was +10 on all stats and resists and 100 hp mana end.<br />
<br />
The Everfrost armor for Shamans is better then ornate ESPECIALLY when you add ldon augmetns to it.  Flowing Thought became easier to get do to LDON.<br />
<br />
My monk picked up 2 Aura of battle augments, a vengance 4, vengance 3, and vengance 2 augment, A regen 3, and regen 2 augment, and 5 40 hp augments.  Thats +65 attack, +9 regen, and 200 hp from augments.  He also picked up some +12 and +15 hp augments and some stat or resist augments.  Finnaly in the process of earning this gear mainly in pickup groups I got probably around 200 AA.<br />
<br />
With that said, I dread doing that many ldons with my shaman and my war even though it would benefit them immensely, after about 500 ldons I am sick of them.  They can however be hugely advantagous to non raiders.  A shaman in full Ldon armor while not at elemental levels is pretty darn close.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u104"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p104">I think many of you are missing the point of my PoP comments. Of course, eventually, PoP sucked for the non-raider, just as ANY other expansion would 18 months later. I am refferring to those FIRST 6-10 months, when people were lvl 60 working to 65, when NO ONE was in Sol Ro or the EPs or Time. <br />
<br />
Eventually, when thats all there is, EVERY expansion gets old. PoPs problem was that the 2 expansions that followed it were not &quot;true&quot; expansions, but rather add-ons. LDoN was a blast and a good concept for a while, but the XP was poor and eventually the monotony of it got to everyone. LoY was aimed primarily at the lvl 45-60 player, not the 60-65 players. <br />
<br />
These two factors meant PoP was ALL there was. They tried to stretch it. They opened zones. They upped the drop rate on some of the back-door stuff. Etc etc. But it wasnt enough. The non-raider burned out on PoP. <br />
<br />
But it didnt happen right away, and it certainly wasnt like that out of the box. PoP offered the more casual players MASSIVE time saving features with centralized vendors and the &quot;One Zone Leads To All&quot; thing that PoT (for PoP zones) and PoK (for all older zones) features. PoP XP was FAR superior to every other zone in the game at first, so much so that they upped older mobs XP after a while (or adjusted the amount you received, or the cut-off for blue, whatever). <br />
<br />
Come on guys, are you gonna tell me you didnt have a BLAST in PoP the first 6-10 months playing it? It got &quot;bad&quot; in about the same amount of time as any expansion would burn out, which is why SOE has that 8 month Expansion schedule in the first place. PoP was 18 months of the SAME high end, the SAME zones for 65's, the SAME ol SAME ol for people who dindt raid and couldnt get to the EPs. But out of the box, it was OUTSTANDING for the non-raider, and the casual player who didint have an extra half hour to run to some distant dungeon to XP. Thats what I am talking about.</div></div><hr />

Having to get flags to enter content is the single worst idea sony ever came up with.<br />
I wasnt coming here regualrly during the early PoP days, I wasnt playing as much then, and when I did, I was playing a cleric with a RL friend on another server (much lower levels), not my main Shaman that I have now. <br />
<br />
However, when I came back, I hooked up with some friends, and I joined a very small, family style guild that raided once or twice a week and failed the dragon in PoI half the time we tried it. They got me through the PoJ trials for PoV and PoS access. I then camped the worm things in PoD for Torment back door and the Diaku in PoStorms for Tactics access. When that guild all but dissolved, I moved to the bigger guild I am in now, when I wasnt even 65 yet. They were making the transition to a more active raiding guild, with a definite strategy of conquest (Ssra + Emp, VT, PoP progression during, then EPs, and ultimately Time). <br />
<br />
So I guess I dont know how it was for Shaman back then, but even so, there WAS a lot of one-groupable flag content for non-raiders, and there WAS a lot of open zones as well. <br />
I would say that ldon added more for the non raider then any other expansion including PoP (this is only talking gear not AA). <br />
I will concede this point. LDoN was probably the better expansion for the non-raider, but actually, if I had to rate them NOW, I would say OoW is the best non-raider expansion in the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do. <br />
<br />
Do you remember slogging away at the tunnels in justice. Eaking out a few spectrals at the named spawns So that when you finally got a couple decent spells you were able to finally level to 63 and not be anything other than a paper tiger. Then months after the raiders got through Trials finally bootstrapping your first guild groups past Execution. <br />
<br />
I do. <br />
<br />
Blazz you are wrong with your synopsis of PoP when it was released. It was a cluster**** of massive proportions to both the casual raider, and the Casual players of all stripes. Before PoP people rarely if ever shared account info. (Except for a few clerics here and there who felt obligated)<br />
once pop flags were discovered proliferation of shareing accounts exploded. You miss a night you were locked out of progression for sometimes months due to spawn times and Cockblocking. <br />
<br />
And during that whole time I slogged away gaining power for my little guild. It wasnt a whole lot of fun. But I was still in love with the idea of EQ. <br />
<br />
Ahh well. I know better now.<br />
 <br />
<br />
Also You are a raider. You might not raid all the time but your power level was probably considerably higher than most casuals when Pop came out. You would have had the mentality of gettign through trials because that was where your friends were. I activly refused a few Trials invites from the most powerful guild on the server, because I did not want to leave my friends. Who at the time were working towards level 60 first. We had a few people get past the trials early on in pick up grousp. they quickly disbanded from the guild because we had nothing left to offer them. (Sigh_)<br />
<br />
People say all the time that as a non raider I should not speak about raider experiances or concerns. Well the reverse is also true. As a raider you have no god damned clue about non raider/ casual player concerns. <br />
<br />
I went through Pop from day 1. And I was the best damn equipped and aa'd charecter in my guild. I was the leader. And I ran the show for my guild. I can say in no uncertain terms that Pop was a piss off and die to casual players all across the spectrum. Raiders and non raiders alike. <br />
<br />
The oppertunistic thrived. And Everyone else suffered. <br />
<br />
My words. My feelings. And my Memories. So we can just agree to disagree. But from my side of things Pop was a horrable mistake. It had it's fun points. Sure. Why else play. But saying it was a boon to the casual player for giving us a few crumbs from the table while the hard core and oppertunistic reap the whirlwind and feast is an exaggeration to say the least.<br />

Edit for Blazz...<br />
<br />
Ooops i am wrong about the Raider part back then. Sorry. But if you were not at the crest of the wave back then then you don't know what people who were there went through as non raiders. Or as casual players. The later patches fixed some of it. But by then the damage was done. And yes Omens is by far the best of the new expansions as to be casual friendly. And I say new expansions because for the health of the game and player satisfaction most people who were around as Kunark was released will say Kunark was much better for the game.</div></div><hr />

I saw none of the problems you describe. I did my PoJ, I did my BoT with my small family guild (was a nice, 3 group event, farming those Postorms giants), I back-doored Tactics, I had 3 of the 4 drops for back-door Torment, and I LOVED it. It was VERY fun, TONS of fun, and I wasnt even remotely considered a &quot;raider&quot; at that time. In fact, the suckiest part of PoP came much later, in the form of the debacle known as &quot;back-flagging&quot;. Shrug, dunno what else to say. I was an average non-raider, maybe closer to hardcore non-raider, but still, I thought PoP was wonderful for me and my friends.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u109"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p109">The graphics are not as good as EQ. Period. It looks good, because it is drawn as cartoons which are inherently lower resolution than &quot;realistic&quot; graphics. It's sort of a mind trick, but if you look beyond that the limitations of the graphics are pretty obvious. Also, many of the &quot;mini areas&quot; are actually identical in layout. There is a fair bit of cut and pasting going on. It's also not true that there is no graphic lag, you can see it if you are paying attention, especially in areas such as those outside Gnomergan. It's not as bad as EQ (and many other &quot;realistic&quot; games), and that is probably why its percieved as lag free.<br />
<br />
Graphics are actually much more better for the eye then in EQ. Not to mention animations, beats EQ's weird movements by far and wide. Of course, it's all personal, and that 'period' of yours is also only your own period. Matter of taste, overall I find WoW graphics beat EQ easily.<br />
<br />
As for soloing, while you can do that easily at lower levels, I'm a bit dubious as to whether you can at higher levels, unless you are prepared to settle for very slow leveling.<br />
<br />
Wrong. My char is lvl 39 warrior and I solo just fine for my everyday XP, and I gain it pretty fast, especially since I combine questing with usual XP gaining. And know what? It doesn't feel like grinding, it's actually fun. I've played warrior in EQ too, and 'soloing' was a word unknown to me after the newbie levels. Note that in EQ I actually DID SOLO my warrior to lvl 30, but it was a nightmare, grind, complete and total fun killer. I didn't even play the char for couple of months after that grind, I was so sick of it. In WoW? I solo well, and can solo all the way to max level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u110"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p110">Blazz,<br />
PoP on release sucked butt.  There was the LAAAAAAGG from hell for openers and being run over while you exped by raiders trying to race to content.  The discovery was cool and I actually liked the shaman class spells, but loads of points from other posters cover the rest.  It's after the raiders moved on that the earlier PoP content got fun.  I was in a tiny guild, we had to get help from our raiding friends to pass the PoJ trials.  PoN was a blast if you had the right group of suicidal friends.<br />

On a GFX 5200 with 128 MB and a 2 year old PC, I gotta say, while the WoW graphics were not all that detailed, my gameplay wasn't hampered by graphic fluff and still, some graphics were breath taking.  I loved flying on a hippogriff, sometime's I'd fly for fun.  EQ graphics (can't comment on EQ2) were OK, but the 3d models slaughtered my PC performance and the odd time when I raided I sometimes had to look at the ground and use assist to find my targets.  It was more frustrating than fun.  Good graphics don't really count if all you have to look at is your feet so you can actually play.<br />

I couldn't agree more with this.  Soloing felt like fun and when I managed to catch up to some friends I had fun sharing quests and even raiding to PvP alliance chars.  It's harder to PL and twinking isn't as easy, but I consider these good points.  The lower levels are interesting.  I had no interest in questing in EQ, but in WoW it's easy, rewarding and interesting (mostly).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u111"><b>niwggib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p111">PoP at release you had 3 zones to exp in: PoN, PoJ and PoD.<br />
<br />
At lvl 60 You got pounded in any of those with the exception of PoJ unless you were a Emp Guild.<br />
<br />
So of all the places to exp in, you had PoJ for the most part. When it was released I could walk from the zone in down to the trials without seeing a single mob. PoJ eased up a bit after people got a few levels and moved into PoN or PoD but then these got crowded.<br />
<br />
It was quite sometime before the trials were common knowledge and even then the higher guilds were not letting out which trials to play and what strats to use and the pretty much sucked unless you were level 65 had you not been in an Emp guild before PoP.<br />
<br />
I remember being pretty ticked at the ammount of exp zones there were for this expansion. It was quite some time later that PoV, PoS, and PoT were opened to everyone for nothing but levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u112"><b>Jeones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p112">There were 4. PoI was a good place to exp also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u113"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p113">OK OK Lets just drop it. Obviously none of you played at Kunark release, or Velious release, where the bugs were disgustingly rampant and people had full group wipes non-stop in placed like KC and Velious was so broken that you could barely go there. Every release has had bugs in EQ. But eventually they get smoothed out. I started playing FULL time in PoP about 3 months after release with a lvl 58 Shaman, and it was OUTSTANDING. If I missed the early bad stuff, well thats EQ. <br />
<br />
So let me rephrase. AFTER the sorted out the bugs, fixed the XP factor, and people actually just checked the net for info on trials, PoP was a great expansion for the non-raider for a GOOD 6 months. PoI, PoN, PoD, and PoJ were PACKED with people. There was all kinds of new player made items to work with. There was the ease of having your choice of zone a click away. <br />
<br />
Sheesh, wake up people. You all seem hell-bent on ONLY remembering the horrible things about EQ. Why did you bother to play it so long if it SUCKED so bad? Whine, whine, whine. All I see EVERY SINGLE POST is negativity for a game that EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU has had on their HD longer than any game since you bought your first dx 486 in 1990. <br />
<br />
Half empty. This board is nothing but a pack of pessimists, and honestly, I am GLAD you are all leaving EQ, more bandwidth for me. Have fun getting to the MAX level in EQ2 and WoW in a matter if weeks, then standing around with your thumbs up your asses waiting for the expansions so you have something to do. EQ followed a line of progression that worked pretty well. First, it took TIME to level. Then it took TIME to AA. Then it took TIME to get spells and gear. After that, it took TIME to flag. TIME, TIME, TIME. Like it or not, if you eliminate any of these factors, NO ONE would be playing EQ still. <br />
<br />
I swear, most of you (and I am not talking to you, Snoww) treat EQ like your divorcee. What was once a beautiful, loving relationship has turned into bitter negativity where you can only remember the worst of every day, and you constantly forget what was good. People look back on Kunark and Velious like they were some mana from heaven, but the reality is they were SEVERLY broken for a couple months upon release. Probably similar to POP, which was eventually fixed to some degree, just like those other &quot;awesome&quot; expansions. Wanna know one of the things that made OoW one of the best ever? The smoothness of its release. But hey, feel free to rip on OOW now, so I can have a reason to keep posting on this thread. <br />
<br />
For now, all done here. Wallow in your self pity. Keep thinking the glass, and the world, is half-empty. There are still a TON of people having a blast in EQ, and you know why? Cause the petty little minor bullshizz dont discourage us to the point that our whole day is ruined by a VIDEO GAME. Wake up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u114"><b>niwggib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p114">Doh, forgot about PoI!!!<br />
<br />
Blazz I have played since Beta 4. My druid was given a server wide announcement when he hit level 50! So yes I have been playing for awhile.<br />
<br />
This was never suppose to be &quot;ah I remember the good times in EQ&quot; post it was I am sick of all the little bs that adds up to make my game seem like work now and that is why i cancelled all 3 of my accounts and that is why my wife and I bought WoW.<br />
<br />
To be honest I took off two days from work for every release up to and including PoP. I was the guy running around with graph paper and taking down locs and making maps. I would log in to each expansion the day it was release as soon as the servers came up. I was the idiot who sat there clicking the log in button over and over till I got in on patch day.<br />
<br />
I LOVE EQ. I dont know how to state that any clearer. Here I will go on a nastalgia trip for you.<br />
<br />
We were one of the first guilds to kill naggy. We were definately the first on our server. I will never forget walking into his lair the first time and being totally blown away. I had a hard drive crash but I saved pictures of every important moment in my eq career. I took screen shots of the mobs that gave me every level in my career. I had pictures of the GM events when they used to happen, I had pictures of every big even that ever happened to me in EQ.<br />
<br />
I remember when it sucked all hell to die, before anyone had 96% rez's and how much joy there was when they cut death loses in half. You name it I have been there. I remember on Kunark's relase they had to take down the servers because junk mobs were dropping high end loot. I remember the joy I had when I got my manastone.<br />
<br />
I remember getting my first epic when they were truely epics. That raid was one of my proudest moments. You can now do the same epic  with 6 people unlike the 30 it took the first time.<br />
<br />
The first time I saw the Keal i was blown away. I like to play halfings and all the mobs were insanely huge and the zone was breathtaking, that and I was scared crapless!<br />
<br />
I loved halflings so much that it was not till Luclin that I created a non halfling character so you could drop me anywhere in Misty Thicket and I would know exactly where I was with in 5 paces if I didnt already know by just spinning around. God I love the little zorro guards. I had always hoped I could get armor that would make my rogue look like that one day!<br />
<br />
So please dont infer that I dont remember the good times! I have been there and done that. I flat out have said several times that I love eq and still do to this day. EQ will always have a special place in my heart. To be honest I am a FPS kind of guy and all the D&amp;D bs is something I thought I would never get into. EQ was my first and will always fondly be remembered as such.<br />
<br />
But like I said earlier, from the title this obviously was not going to be a, &quot;I LOVE EQ&quot; thread. It was about how I am so sick and tired of all the little bs that would be so easy to fix, yet requires an act of God to change and why I am leaving for WoW!<br />
<br />
I dont see the glass as half empty or half full I see the glass as 5.5 year old stale water and it is time for a change!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u115"><b>Grobbles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p115">Obviously none of you played at Kunark release, or Velious release  actually I have been playing since pre Kurnak , and yes there were game bugs , but it was because EQ was a new , original and exciting product then , by POP most serious game bugs/flaws  had been eradicated and other games had appeared on the market . Also the original makers of the game had left and the game had started to be raped by sony's money machine . Only now have they finally realised where they went wrong . <br />
<br />
Sheesh, wake up people. You all seem hell-bent on ONLY remembering the horrible things about EQ. Wrong again , been playing game for long time , and play it because i love it . Just because two expansions were totally naff or didnt meet my criteria doesnt mean I only remember the quirkier side to eq  .

<br />
There is alot of negitive here. And I am included in that to a point. Because the frustration always tends to come through some of my posts. <br />
<br />
There is no reason EQ should feel as stale as it does. Niwggib has a wonderful point. All the little niggling annoyances are what burns me out the most. How hard it is to get something that is directly impacting game enjoyment of shaman changed. <br />
<br />
The reasoning of the developers is unfathomnable. Design by comittie is a horrible way to do something that is more closely related to an art than a science. <br />
<br />
When people would ask me why I played EQ for the first three years I awnsered Because It is fun. The next year and a half was because it was fun and I love the people. The last half a year was because it was fun and I missed the people. <br />
<br />
Yet I still After some 15 years play Dnd. With the same guys. It is still fun. Because the stories and charecters and situations are still fun. There is a feeling of advancement with this new charecter. <br />
<br />
That is what Eq has lost. The feeling of charecter advancement. <br />
<br />
I get item advancement only now. But it is seperate from charecter storyline/goals. <br />
<br />
(shrug) I know how to change it for me. I know what would keep me happily plucking away at Eq for years to come. <br />
<br />
Charecter choices that mattered. A grounding in the lore of old. Factions that mattered. With opposing choices and all that entails. The ability to keep a group alive and functioning in any location that a cleric could. But do it useing my tools as a shaman Slows, buffs, debuffs and damage.<br />
<br />
Hell I have covered it all many many times before. We all know what we want. Some can describe it better than others. Certainly better than me. But now With WoW out, well. There is a better choice for the moment for me. It doesnt have my beloved Snoww. Heyokah. Ghost walker, Spirit talker. The rock upon which armies break. <br />
<br />
But with the new world I can make a new story. A new persona. And while it will never take the place of Snoww. A new place in my heart will form. For now I fall back into Feather. A thief who is much too reckless for her own good. Who will explore where the mighty have fallen. And who will break into a stronghold to simply see what is behind the locked doors. <br />
<br />
It is a good feeling and leaving work I feel something that EQ hasnt given me for a long long time. <br />
<br />
Anticipation of a new day. <br />

Just look at how many times the idea of a pre pop server is brought up. I think people kept on playing for the hope that just pop was a mistake. You cannot deny the game changed when Pop came in.  If you can't see that, then sure thats your view. <br />
<br />
By the way, i think dismissing everyone who has a different opinion/and viewpoint than you as whiners or pessimisms is hugely disrespectful and only serves to inflate your own argument which is not actually any more right than everyone elses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u118"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p118">Come on guys, are you gonna tell me you didnt have a BLAST in PoP the first 6-10 months playing it?<br />
Yes, because we got creamed there due to lack of raid gear, not skill. My crew wanted more challenging dungeon content.  Instead we got Plane of Dreadlands with mobs that hit like a truck (at least in the 6 out of 19 zones we could access).<br />
<br />
And Snoww, you forgot one other &quot;feature&quot; of PoP at launch: the completely unnecessary demolition of the monk class' tanking ability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u119"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p119">First of all, my apologies for all the frothing at the mouth. The ONLY point I was ever trying to make was the PoP didn't suck for the non-raider. It offered more zones, with easier access to them, than any previous expansion. Lots of you dont agree, but many of the reasons are either bug related or class related. I can accept that. Speaking from my personal experience, as a casual non-raider at that time, I felt PoP was the bomb of all expansions. <br />
. . .but there is a big bunch of people that long for the eq pre pop. Just look at how many times the idea of a pre pop server is brought up. I think people kept on playing for the hope that just pop was a mistake. You cannot deny the game changed when Pop came in.  If you can't see that, then sure thats your view.<br />
Now, I am going to sound like I am contradicting myself here, but I want to try to explain it in a more linear fashion. When I first came back to the Troll, I loved PoP. Loved it for a long time. It helped me catch up (I was way behind my old friends, after taking 6-8 months off that character). LoY came out and it was PERFECT for me as well. I probably farmed as much loot and XP out of Nadox than anyone who comes here. Maybe thats why I am kinda &quot;rose colored&quot; on PoP. Cause I NEEDED it when I came back. <br />
<br />
As time went by, though, and I leveled, and I got into a raiding guild, I started to realize what was wrong with PoP. We all talk abot which expansion was the &quot;best&quot; at one thing or another, but PoP was definitely the BEST at &quot;dumbing down&quot; the game and spoiling people completely rotten. Why go to Veskar, or CT, or deep OS, when POI and POD were at your disposal? Why go camp loot that was, overall, inferior to what was available at your fingertips by hitting a Named in BoT, or buying a player made Valorium Ring of Gallantry, or something? And the Flag system, HOLY COW what a massive cluster-fart THAT turned into. <br />
<br />
Yeah, PoP changed the game hardcore. But the point I was trying, unsuccesfully I might add, to make is that PoP, once they tweaked it some, was a DAMN good expansion for the average, Joe-Schmoe, non-raiding casual player. Log in, hit 1 zone, shout LFG, and there you were. Trials were hard, but doable. I didnt feel like a &quot;6th wheel&quot; at my PoJ trial, not like I did for Vexd, anyway. I had Malo, and Torpor, and a couple new buffs, and an AE I could toss out, and root, and a heal, and I still had Turgurs. <br />
<br />
POD, POI, PON, POJ. Four DAMN solid zones at that time, for both XP and loot. There were plenty of &quot;tougher&quot; areas in them. Spells parches dropped off random mobs, not a ton, but I LIKE the game to be hard and time consuming. <br />
<br />
POV, POS, Tactics, HoH and of course, BoT. Wow, what absolutely KILLER zones for  that grueling grind from 63-65 and an IDEAL atmosphere for getting those incredible AA that came out with PoP. Mini raids doable by my small, family, 4 groups on our best day, guild (at the time). <br />
<br />
If you compare what was available in other &quot;true&quot; expansions, like Kunark, Velious and Luclin, there is no denying that PoP had content, and I am not talking about the &quot;big raid required, only&quot; zones like Sol Ro and the EPs. I honestly think that a lot of the bitterness I see about PoP overall is this idea that somehow, because you bought the expansion, you should be &quot;entitled&quot; to access to every single thing, every item, every mob, every zone, etc. I am on the side of the &quot;keyed&quot; zones. I think players SHOULD have to earn their right to access certain areas, JUSTlike many other games. I will be the first to admit that the flagging system in PoP blew chunks, and Gates wasnt much better, but still, SOMEHTING needs to be there. <br />
<br />
I dunno. WoW and EQ2 seem to be offering people some of the alternatives they have been asking for. But I will say it again, I consider both these games a &quot;be careful what you wish for&quot; situation. I will also readily admit that PoP began a &quot;letdown&quot; period in EQ that never ended for some. OoW was too little too late. Wanna know what I wish? I wish we could go back in time, and release OoW 1 year, to the day, after PoPs release. Then gates 6-8 months later. (I am one of those who belives that LoY should have been a free &quot;upgrade&quot;, not an &quot;expansion&quot;, at most, a 9.99 jobber, tops). I think if that had happened, there would be a lot more positive attitudes about EQ overall right now, even in the face of these new games. SOE butchered it all SO bad, starting about 1 year after PoP was released, that I cannot blame anyone for leaving the game.</div></div><hr />

Sorry Iz, my gear was TOTALLY sub-standard, compared to the &quot;average&quot; bazaar level geared people, and I loved the mobs hitting so hard. You actually had to be on your game to play in PoI at level 58 wearing Thurg quest armor and a couple items from Hate, still.</div></div><hr />

Maybe we define skill differently, at least what modicum of skill this game requires.  For me, a five pull in a dungeon represented a challenge that required everyone in my crew to act promptly and correctly or we wiped.  A single pull Plane O' Dreadlands mob that can 3 round the tank in bazaar gear was a &quot;challenge&quot; only to see if the healer could cast a heal as quickly and as often as possible.  This is analagous to LDoN &quot;hards&quot; only being hard in the sense that you could get 3 rounded due to lag or healer inattentiveness.  To me, that is neither particularly skillful nor entertaining. But, to each his own.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u122"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p122">Fair enough Iz, but there were plenty of more challenging plaecs in PoP.

But honestly, we cant blame the &quot;One mob at a time&quot; mentality on PoP, that was born LONG before that, in Kunark. LoIO, FM, OT, Dreadlands. Lvl 10-55 and never fight more than one mob at a time, never fight without SoW, never even zone into a &quot;dungeon&quot;. <br />
<br />
I dont blame SOE for making mobs that hit really hard.  They put a bunch of new stuff into PoP. Trying to create specific &quot;interesting&quot; content to XP grind in is something I stopped expecting long ago. I would personally MUCH rather have a few 2-3 pulls in ANY XP camp, but I cant be upset about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u123"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p123">I'm really surprised Luclin doesn't get any love in terms of game expansion for the non-raider, despite how much content Luclin also had for the raider.<br />
<br />
Luclin re-opened a lot of the older zones to smaller groups and solo play in addition to adding a many zones to xp in for &quot;current&quot; content at the time - levels 55-60.  Since level 65 hadn't been introduced yet, players level 60 could still make use of every &quot;high level&quot; zone in the game from conception, including some of the old raid zones.<br />
<br />
For example, just pre-Luclin release, at levels 55-60 you could casually (full group) xp in:<br />
<br />
Lguk, Solb, Permafrost, The Hole, Kedge, Burning Wood, Chardok, City of Mist, Howling Stones, Karnors Castle, Sebilis, Skyfire, Trak's Teeth, Kael, Skyshrine, Cobalt Scar, Dragon Necropolis, Sirens Grotto, Velks, and Western Wastes.<br />
<br />
That's 20 zones for normal grouping and many of them could support a LOT more groups than any tier1 PoP zone.  You could even go into the old city zones if you wanted to solo/duo the guards.<br />
<br />
Enter Luclin, which added not only zones but the ability for players to do a lot of the older zones with fewer people.  Luclin added:<br />
<br />
Acrylia Caverns, Akheva Ruins, The Deep, Fungus Grove, The Grey, Griegs End (YUK!), Maidens Eye, Marus Seru, Scarlet Desert, Umbral Plains.  9 zones just for casual group xp, in addition to making the older zones even easier to xp in.  Before PoP went live they also revamped Cazic Thule for another 55-60 xp zone during Luclin.<br />
<br />
When PoP hit, that basically made every one of those zones worthless - xp wise - once you dinged 61.  Technically you got xp, but it was horrible compared to PoP xp.</div></div><hr />

I agree with much of what you say, but Luclin bothered many people due to straying too far from the world of high fantasy which should be the main thing in EQ. If it wasn't for that, Im sure it would get more raves.<br />
<br />
Look at this art work on the top of this page of the WoW site: http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/classes/<br />
<br />
it looks a lot like the Ruins of Kunark art. I suspect that a good portion of the enthusiasm for WoW is a desire to get back to core high fantasy elements that EQ1 left behind.</div></div><hr />

World of Warcraft Shatters Day-One Sales Records<br />
IRVINE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 1, 2004--<br />
<br />
Blizzard's Newest Title Becomes North America's Fastest-Selling PC Game Ever, with Record Number of Accounts Created and Concurrent Players in First 24 Hours<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard Entertainment(R) today confirmed that World of Warcraft(R) has broken day-one sales records in North America, making it the most successful PC game launch ever. World of Warcraft, the company's subscription-based massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG), sold through to over 240,000 customers at retailers in North America on Tuesday, November 23, selling more in its first 24 hours than any other PC game in history.(a) <br />
<br />
In addition to shattering sales records, World of Warcraft also broke peak concurrency and account creation records for a MMORPG. Within the first day, over 200,000 players created World of Warcraft accounts. By 5:00 p.m. PST, over 100,000 were playing the game concurrently. These two record-breaking numbers made World of Warcraft the fastest-growing MMORPG in history. Within a single day, all original 40+ World of Warcraft servers were filled to capacity, and by the end of the Thanksgiving weekend, more than 40 additional servers were deployed to meet the rapidly growing player base, as the number of new accounts and concurrent users continued to grow. <br />
<br />
&quot;We were all extremely pleased with the success of World of Warcraft on its first day of launch,&quot; said Mike Morhaime, president of Blizzard Entertainment. &quot;Once we saw the numbers for the first day, we knew that we had to immediately increase capacity to accommodate the huge numbers of players joining our game. We're glad so many people are enjoying World of Warcraft, and we are dedicated to supporting a fun and smooth game experience for everyone.&quot; <br />
<br />
Retailers across North America reported that the World of Warcraft launch was unequivocally their biggest day-one sales in PC gaming history. Leading industry retailers, such as Wal-Mart, Best Buy, EB, and GameStop, all reported that hundreds of their stores sold out of World of Warcraft within the first day. <br />
<br />
&quot;World of Warcraft has once again shown that Blizzard consistently delivers the best games in the industry,&quot; said Robert McKenzie, vice president of merchandising at GameStop. &quot;It sold better than any other PC game this year -- in fact, World of Warcraft enjoyed the best day-one sell-through GameStop has ever seen on a PC title!&quot; <br />
<br />
Over the Thanksgiving weekend, players continued to buy World of Warcraft in record numbers, with a total of over 350,000(a) copies of the game selling through. Blizzard Entertainment and its retail partners expect the remaining supplies of World of Warcraft to sell out soon. Blizzard is currently evaluating its ability to ship additional games to retailers, given the unexpectedly high demand on the servers. The company continues to increase server capacity to accommodate the growing number of players connecting to the game. As the additional servers are brought online and proven stable, additional copies of World of Warcraft will be made available at retail. Blizzard will announce the availability of those additional games as soon as they are on shelves.</div></div><hr />

<br />
God, I love it when I'm right.  Sorry, but had to share.<br />
<br />
IRVINE, Calif. - January 10, 2005 -Blizzard Entertainment® today announced that World of Warcraft® has sold through more than 600,000* units to customers in North America, Australia, and New Zealand. The fastest-growing massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) has also shattered all previous concurrency records in North America, achieving over 200,000 simultaneous players during the holiday period. <br />
<br />
Korea went online this week, with Europe in final beta now.  The rest of Asia will be next.  I wonder how far past 1 million subscribers they will get by the summer?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u132"><b>Haxot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p132">Truthfully speaking, initial numbers do not count.<br />
<br />
The number of copies out shows how many people have 1 free month.<br />
1 single free month.<br />
<br />
The number of people who get hooked and keep playing, however, will never be the same as the number of copies sold<br />
<br />
Sales means nothing.<br />
Retention means everything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u133"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p133">Haxot,<br />
<br />
Obviously you are not in Sales and Marketing.  Retention is the key, however, initial sales are EXTREMELY important.  If people don't TRY the game, you will never get them to STAY in the game.  Ask any crack dealer, the first hit is always free, the trick is getting you to take that first hit.  :)<br />
<br />
As far as retention, all I can say is I don't know anyone, by that I mean any of the 100+ folks in my guild, who has left WoW.  Even with the server issues and downtime (annoying but not excessive), everyone who has joined my guild is still playing.  On the other hand, my 3 RL friends that tried EQ2 all quit, 2 of them are now playing WoW, 1 still plays EQ on occassion.<br />
<br />
Now, that's just my experience, so your mileage my vary.  IMHO, looking at the sales numbers and current server populations, they will have over 1 million steady subscribers by this summer.  No problem.<br />
<br />
Not an argument, just some follow up info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u134"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p134">You also have to take &quot;top selling game ever&quot; with a grain of salt, realizing that as time passes more and more gamers enter the market, and so very few of us leave it.<br />
<br />
  Within a decade easily, numbers like that will completely fail to impress anyone for opening sales most likely.  But yeah, it's top for now so that works fine for me (rooting for a small decline in popularity of the PvP at least so the server my friends use gets less crowded).</div></div><hr />

This is exactly what I am following closely.  How are they going to address end game content for non-raiders? How about for those who don't want to PVP (i.e. battlegrounds)?  How fast will they release expansions and for whom will they be tailored? What do we do after we've hit 60 playing both Alliance and Horde? It will be interesting.<br />
<br />
In the meantime the game remains everything I hoped for and more.  Dungeon crawls feel like EQ raids, at least the first few times.  The scripted events are insane.  Last night we did Uldaman for the first time and putting the staff in the model city in the Map Room to trigger the script was something right out of Indiana Jones, unbelievable.  The boss mob fights all require incredible strategy and coordination (we wiped) to beat within the proper level range.  We get awesome content, difficult (but fun) encounters and scripted events- and we're able to go after the best non-raid loot in the game w/ no locked content.<br />
<br />
I heard a rumor that one of the raid encounters when completed will unlock a new zone but (get this) instead of it being only unlocked for the raid guild that beat it, it will open a new zone for the entire server.  How cool is that?  And since the raid/dungeon portions of zones are all instanced, what's not to love?<br />
<br />
Damn I sound like a fanboi and I'm really not- I still hate the server issues and the insane travel time. :)</div></div><hr />

Sure you dont take long to med but to run to a quest npc might take you 5 minutes across west karana sized, nearly empty zones.<br />
<br />
But as to its effect on EQ, something is sure affecting EQ1. About 150 people in Brell bazaar on some nights lately. Used to be packed to near full 6 months ago.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not really sure what you are talking about Gunderson, since there are multiple forms of very fast and efficient travel in WoW.  Yeah, as a level 1 newbie you have to hoof it around the newbie zone.  But as you explore you pick up flight path points for the various flying creatures that will take you to specific locations.  Ships work the same way, and provide a way to get between the two continents very quickly.  You also have trams (trains) between a couple of cities, and two types of mounts.  At level 40 you can get a base mount that has 60% speed increase and at level 60 you can get a 100% speed increase version.<br />
<br />
Finally, most caster classes have a speed buff, 30% for hunters (single and group), 40% for druid and shaman, etc.  Mages have teleport ability to every major city, both single and group, and Warlocks have a &quot;Summon Hero&quot; spell that can transport you anywhere in the world.<br />
<br />
So, in actuality, travel is very easy and quick.  In addition, as in EQ2, flying over the terrain is a great way to see the zones, mobs and discover places you have not been to yet.<br />
<br />
Down time in WoW is almost non-existant for all classes.  However, like anything else, if you don't take advantage of the travel modes, food, bandages, potions, etc., then yes, you may have some down time due to lack of effort.<br />
<br />
And yes, some of the zones are HUGE, it's great.</div></div><hr />

Blazz, interesting theory.  What exactly is this based on?  I actually believe the opposite.  WoW is the most anticipated and well developed MMORPG in history.  With Korea, Europe and the rest of Asia coming online this year, the subscription base is going to explode.  Hell, the American base has been limited due to the demand exceeding their expectations, which forced them to suspend sales.  Every retail copy of WoW has been sold, and the collectors edition is now going for over $150.<br />
<br />
Your suspisions aside, I'll base my predictions on actual sales figures and by the number of players in beta.  Oh, and what is the next &quot;shooting star&quot;?  Nothing on the radar has 1/100th the anticipation that WoW had.  And if you say Guild Wars, I doubt it.  Vanguard?  Years away.  EQ2?  Already lost the battle and war.<br />
<br />
As far as I can see, WoW has no competition for most mainstream players.  EQ will keep the hard core raiders (or at least I hope so).  But WoW is a better fit for the large majority of folks that wish to play a social and fun D&amp;D style game online.</div></div><hr />

?  OK.  Yes, if you want to &quot;group&quot; with both Alliance and Horde, you have to have two characters.  However, you can &quot;play&quot; with anyone, you just can't share exp/quests with them.  If it were any other way, you could not do group PvP.

The age of an mmorpg is mostly related to speed of levelling. By which I mean one of the reasons EQ1 lasted so long is that for most people it was a slow and difficult slog to level, which they may have complained about but it kept there being lots of anticipation for them for when they are higher. With WoW's fast levelling, content is burned up a lot faster and in 6 months the game may well be top heavy with levels the way it took EQ 2+ years to get that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u147"><b>Styantiss Sarnakslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p147">I used to work at Blizzard in QA, so I can tell you these people know what fun is. I also worked on WoW for a few months and I saw everything there was to see, up to that point. I cant get into specifics still, but let me make a general comparision and what stood out to me about WoW.<br />
<br />
 First, the graphics are obviously low poly, but they are beautiful because they have personality and style. This game is extemely system spec friendly, you would laugh if you heard the systems I have played it on. Anyway, to me the best part of WoW is the quest system. I saw many quests that were just awesome, even compared  to EQ2. The way some quests unfolded just dropped me to the floor. Im not going to name names, but a certain quest in a certain instance was a riot to see unfold. Its awesome to feel such a personalized feeling that I got with some quests.<br />
<br />
 I have high expectations for WoW, I have no doubt the expansions will be awesome. The game just isnt hard-core like EQ. When I play EQ, I play it because I want a more complicated experience. This is why I played EQ2 only for a month, even less. EQ2 was alot like EQ, but dumbed down to the point of absurdity.<br />
<br />
 Anyway, there is my bit on WoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u148"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p148">I've been playing wow for a while, yet recently returned to eq.  The quests were endless kill 20, gather 10 or assassinate x.  Pretty much an endless, boring, solo ldon.<br />
I'll agree it would be nicely playable on some very marginal systems, but at the same time, it just wont be for everyone.  Brightly colored, low poly graphics definately have a look all its own.  Its just not pleasing to my eyes.<br />
Theres nothing hard about leveling in wow, but theres nothing hard about leveling in eq.  People level quickly or slowly in either game, some people powerlevel in both games, etc.<br />
I'm the kind of person who must have some goal to be working towards, leveling alone just isn't something I care about.  Wow simply does not provide this at all.  After only a month playing, I dont feel like there is any point to continuing.  I'm a non-pvp kind of person, and there just isn't much else to accomplish in wow.</div></div><hr />

I'll agree it would be nicely playable on some very marginal systems, but at the same time, it just wont be for everyone.  Brightly colored, low poly graphics definately have a look all its own.  Its just not pleasing to my eyes.<br />
Theres nothing hard about leveling in wow, but theres nothing hard about leveling in eq.  People level quickly or slowly in either game, some people powerlevel in both games, etc.<br />
I'm the kind of person who must have some goal to be working towards, leveling alone just isn't something I care about.  Wow simply does not provide this at all.  After only a month playing, I dont feel like there is any point to continuing.  I'm a non-pvp kind of person, and there just isn't much else to accomplish in wow.<br />

I agree with jdthomas here.  I played WoW for a while, and at first its newness made it fun but I quickly got bored of the quests. There is a huge amount of solo play in that game, and while its nice sometimes to be able to log in for a bit and not have to LFG/create a group it gets really boring playing by yourself. Yes you can group up with friends but it is usually at a detriment to your xp gain. Elite quests are  the exception but they are a minority. <br />
<br />
Traveling in the game is a pain, sure there are gryphons and trams between a lot of locations - but when there is not the zones are absolutely huge.. some quests require running between npcs across zones and when you have to do it it feels like running across the karanas snared. You might like it if you are one of the people that hated pok books in EQ.<br />
<br />
PVP is lacking (tho I cant compare it to EQ pvp).  With no benifit to killing someone, and virtually no death penalty (running to your corpse), pvp battles come down to which group gets bored of it first and leaves. My PVP experience comes from early Ultima Online and nothing has really come close to that.<br />
<br />
There is a lot to WoW that is fun (the instanced elite quests are great) but I would have to say the biggest fun killer is all the solo play. EQ has is fair share of problems but over all I like it much better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u150"><b>Hagle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p150">Todays version of EQ doesnt even compare to WoW. On a scale of 1-10 its at least 6 points behind WoW. If you havent tried it do. Its way more fun. I had 5 years into EQ and the only thing that was holding me back was the time it takes to lvl , i thought it would be the same in WoW. I already have 5 classes above 20 and one above 40, and i dont play all the time. PvP rules in it, its based on skill not equipment.</div></div><hr />
