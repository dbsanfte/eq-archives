<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey everyone, I've come to the decision I need to quit eq. Long and short of it eq is just too much of a timesink so I want to do a few things fun/challenging before I go. <br />
I am a shaman of the 61 season been around since about the middle of kunark with mass canni no epic I have torpor/malo mostly bazaar equiped 2.8k hp fully self buffed. My monk is mostly bazaar equiped as well about 3.5k hp with my buffs.<br />
I haven't done much so far, I've killed a cliff golem in ot.. a few times actually. I ventured in Dragon's necropolotis, I haven't killed any dragons in Western waste yet, but it's on my list. I figured next would be a greater wurm in in SF. Maybe venture in the vampire castle in Tenebres mountains. I don't really care about loosing exp/faction so I can pretty much piss in the wind sorta speak. I duo with a 60 monk as well so I can pull singles pretty easy and have an extra 80dps with me or so.. :) I would also like to say it has been a pleasure being amongst all of you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chulain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Don't forget to kill King Ak'Anon.  Now with PoK books it's easy to jump in and kill the gnome whenever I am bored.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Try:<br />
<br />
Fungi King in Sebilis<br />
Dragons in WW<br />
Vampire castle in TM is rather easy to be honest, but can be good fun ;)<br />
Feeling brave? Try breaking into fear on the last day (no worries if you loose corpse then!). The new ireblind imp will add to the challenge.<br />
Arena in Kael<br />
Inner Acrylia</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Oh yea, did Arena surprisingly not too tough giants just have a ton of HP Manage agro right it's cake I can even handle a add or 2! I've toyed around in Inner Acrylia a bit, it was fun. Killing king Ak'anoon sounds like fun I just might have to do that, maybe even get some gnome illusion potions for the ocation! Breaking into fear does sound like a bit much though. :) I may decide to come back some day so I might want my stuff back.. :)<br />
Thanks for the ideas everyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">solo a GW, frog slaughter fest in lower guk, kill a PoD, kill guards in heavily used newbie grounds and charm newbie zone animals, buff them up and break carm, return and watch newbies try them on :)</div></div><hr />

That's so cruel......but funny as hell :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">you think that's funny... do it with a druid and give it a 40 point DS...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hehe, sadly enough I have done that before, the DS seems too cruel, they have no chance, I just gave the animal a mage summoned belt focus, and a few other misc buffs, enough for them to go *** I am sure. &gt;:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">UP has some fun critters for a 61 shaman.  Nothing like a mud-splattered monkey-man in teh face to give you a big smile.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I love buffing mammoths in everfrost while waiting on my next ldon adventure. ;)  The damage shield seems cruel though. Funny though, in an evil sort of way. :D</div></div><hr />
