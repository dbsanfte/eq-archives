03-02 18:56 Changed Mana cost from 220 to 225 <br />
03-02 18:56 Changed Slot 1 from &quot;Increase Hitpoints v2 by 360 per tick&quot; to &quot;Increase Hitpoints v2 by 370 per tick&quot; <br />

<br />
I have to ask; why bother making this change?  I think at this point they just want to see the shaman twitch.  An extra 10hp per tick?  Wow.  Thanks.  Tell you what, why not just lower the healing from 360 to 350?  I still won't care, and neither will anyone else, because this spell is just so pointless.<br />

But we are fine Giac, We have Shamans doing Tipt in ornate so we dont need extra healing power.<br />

I might CONSIDER to buy GoD if they boot up our new spell with a heal over time 500 hp per tick for 6 ticks. The healing power still behind Durids due to the fact that its a healing over time. Or at least a 2.5K+ direct FAST heal. Nothing really interesting at this moment.<br />

1700ish would be reasonable when you combine it with the fact that we do have Q/Breath to augment.  Druids would still retain a solid upper hand in healing when you consider their 2.1k fast heal and their 5k? Incomplete heal.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Dev_00: /auc Buying a clue...<br />
<br />
Under present changes (Mar 2 2004 - 11:46p ET)<br />
<br />
Paladin: 1000hp for 430 mana = 2.33hp/mana (Cast = 1, Recast = 5)<br />
Ranger: 515hp for 195 mana = 2.69hp/mana (Cast 3, Recast = 2.25)<br />
Druid: 2100hp for 550 mana = 3.82hp/mana (Cast 3.75, Recast = 2.25)<br />
Cleric (excluding CH): 3275hp for 650 mana = 5.04hp/mana (Cast 3.75, Recast = 2.25)<br />
Shaman: 1480hp for 225 mana (Over 24 seconds) = 6.58hp/mana (Cast 6, Recast = 2.25, Over time = 24 seconds)<br />
<br />
Now, let's see what that would be over 24 seconds (see: duration of Breath of Trushar)... barring fizzles, lag, and taking chain casting into effect...<br />
<br />
Paladin: 4 casts - 4000hp/1720 mana<br />
Ranger: 4 casts - 2060hp/780 mana<br />
Druid: 4 casts - 8400hp/2200 mana<br />
Cleric: 4 casts - 13100hp/2600 mana<br />
Shaman: 1 cast - 1480hp/225 mana<br />
(Let's switch things up and swap out Breath of Trushar for Tnarg's - 1300hp for 450 mana - 3.75 cast, 2.25 recast - 2.89hp/mana)<br />
Shaman: 4 casts - 5200hp/1800 mana<br />
<br />
Now, let's calculate cleric CH into it (make it fair - 7500hp/400 mana - 10 sec cast, 2.25 recast - 18.75hp/mana)...<br />
<br />
Cleric: 2 casts - 15000hp/800 mana<br />
<br />
Now, I'm going to do a little comparison, using self buffs only, for mana regen (yes, more math). This does not include any FT or MC effects.<br />
<br />
Cleric: 8/tick (Armor of the Zealot)<br />
Druid: 8/tick (Blessing of the Nine)<br />
Shaman: 0/tick (No mana regeneration buff)<br />
Shaman with Canni4: 81-82/tick, but cannot cast ANY other spells in this time.<br />
Shaman using Canni5 only: 31.23/tick (but all at once, and 3 minute reuse, that's taking the mana returned, dividing by 30)<br />
Combo Canni5 + Canni4, by rights = 112/tick<br />
<br />
However, our heals do not take into effect the mana cost of slow, Malo(*) in the same 24 second period. While clerics and druids get 8/tick passive, the shaman 112/tick calculated (it's late, my math may be off, I am open to corrections) also neglects to take into account that hitpoint regeneration is also necessary, be it via regen buff spells (max 25/tick - Replenishment) or heals over time (Quiescence/Breath of Trushar), to ensure that being a constant thing, but, again, chain casting cannibalize spells prevents ANY other spell casting.<br />
<br />
If someone feels like doing the math, including heal time and the like, and figure out a better &quot;mana per second&quot; number, more power to you. However, I think the devs at SOE neglect to factor in the fact that, with Malo (just Malo) and slow, shamans have already spent 550 mana (with Malos, 600), and I can attest personally that I will not have that mana back in full by the time (insert mob here) dies, unless it takes more than 60 seconds (which is rare).<br />
<br />
Sure, shaman mana regen is high for &quot;endurance fights&quot;, but for &quot;quick fights&quot; (like is the case anymore, as I wait for EverQuest to formally name change to EverDPS) in succession, shamans fall way behind because they cannot chain cannibalize (thus dropping to 0/tick, and actually -300/tick during the Malo/Slow period), unless on horseback or enchanter/bard/beastlord/druid mana regeneration spells are in effect.<br />
<br />
There's a lot of numbers above, and for those not worried about the gory numbers, my apologies. <br />
<br />
Disclaimer: For those interested in the numbers, be aware that my &quot;shaman mana regen&quot; numbers do not factor in, as I mentioned, healing the hitpoints taken away to regenerate mana and the mana subtracted associated with that. The numbers above are also based upon data from the Test server, pulled via lucy as of the time listed above. As always, data on Test can and does change constantly. Spells as listed currently on the live servers are not too much different than those given above, but should give an overall interest to those curious. Furthermore, due to time of day of this posting, some numbers, or words, may not be 100% coherent, or even spelled correctly.  The sampling I used was small (24 seconds). If you take the data, extend it to, say, 30/60/120 minutes of 60 second chain pulls (requiring Malo*/Slow), the numbers would be more true to form</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Edit: Nevermind. Grizlor is right about the cast time change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">they changed it from 3.5 to 3.75 in addition to the increase in HP  healed.<br />
<br />
Breath of Trushar really needs to be like 500 a tick for 300 mana. That'd actually be a downgrade in efficiency from where it is now<br />
<br />
I don't want damn efficiency, I want to be able to keep someone alive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I don't think they realize how Shaman heals will compare to Druid heals by the end of the expansion.<br />
<br />
Tnarg's is 1547 with every healing AA you can get. Add a 40%(might be 45, but let's stick with 40) healing focus and it will heal for 1864 on average.<br />
<br />
Sylvan Infusion is 2499 with HA and AHA. Add the same 40% healing focus and you have an average heal of ~3011.<br />
<br />
1864 to 3011. Druids will be healing 61.9% better than a Shaman. So basically even if you disregarded resists, cast time and recast time, mitigation, aggro and whatnot, you'd have to land Slow for full on every mob to be on par with a Druid in healing ability. This doesn't even adress the inability to regain mana during this, granting the Druid a even higher advantage due to their higher mana regen(self buff in a raid setting, self buff + PoT9 in a group or solo setting), nor does it adress the overall efficiency of the 2 spells which would again clearly show the Druid as the winner.<br />
<br />
How many mobs fall under these criteria? You ****ing morons called Devs, fix this **** now!<br />
<br />
Edit(what is this my 3rd in this thread?):My numbers were a little off, because I assumed that a fully AA'd Tnarg's was 1560 and based my math on that(the result was actually favorable to Shamans). <br />
In reality, though, a fully AA'd Tnarg's is only 1547(1560 is the min heal with any sort of healing focus, thus my mistake), so I had to change the numbers accordingly. <br />
The result is a net superiority in healing power of 61.9% for Druids(40% healing focus).</div></div><hr />

HINT: The druid heal is only 2.1k.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I must have missed that 2.5K in the somewhat 'official' proposal. Maybe because it is not there? <br />
<br />
Just theoretically spoken, would it really be that bad, when shamans got a 2.5K fast heal?  Druids being secondary main healer (one of the ONLY 2 possible) and good patch healers, while shamans being superior patch healers (for appropriate high mana costs of course) sounds fine for me.<br />
<br />
Druids would still retain a solid upper hand in healing when you consider their 2.1k fast heal and their 5k?<br />
<br />
I still miss ANY valid reason, why druids should retain a solid upper hand in healing to begin with. I agree, that we probably just have to accept that change in class roles - i just find it slightly funny, that we take this change suddenly as a given and use it to base our arguments on.<br />
<br />
SoE fix that crap or leave it alone completely. That fooling around and ignoring the core issues behind our complains makes people angry. Is anyone really believing, 10 hp/tick does help on a GoD or PoP mob? Maybe against an infested rat in PoD, but i am not sure here  :rolleyes: .</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I don't know if I should laugh or cry. Torpor was a heal when we first got it in Kunark. Torpor was a sorta-heal in Velious. Torpor was an ok heal after we got a MOB slowed in Luclin. Quiescence was a bandaid in PoP (a cheap bandaid, true). Then we get Trushar, which is a bandaid on top of a bandaid.<br />
This makes the version on test a bandaid on top of a bandaid on top of a bandaid I guess.<br />
<br />
What did the big experience MOBs in Kunark hit for? 150? If that. and we heal for 300 a tick.<br />
Now we fight MOBs that hit for 1200 with single groups. These MOBs also mitigate slow if they are not outright immune. And we heal for 370 a tick.<br />
<br />
Somehow a 23% increase in healing power is supposed to keep up with a 700% to 3100% increase in damage? It is not like we can stack Trushar like you can chaincast spot heals.<br />
<br />
If anyone from SOE reads this: Quiescence is not a heal. Torpor was a heal back in the days, Quiescence is not. Even it's use as a means to slow down damage is questionable. Basically the single heal shaman have is Tnarg's and it is in dire need of an upgrade. If we have to pay for our superior mana regen(which is not all that superior nowadays) let us pay by having more expensive spells, not more expensive spells with longer cast time, lesser effect and(in the case of damage spells) lesser resist adjustment.<br />
If we have to pay for our slow, please consider that we are the only class to pay for our 'power spell' in that way.<br />
We do not buff HPs - we are tied for last place with rangers for that. We do not buff stats - stat buffs are obsolete. We do not nuke - our nuke damage is the worst of all casters, both in damage per second and efficiency. In a lot of situations we get outnuked by hybrids. We do not DoT - in groups the MOBs die too fast for even Bane, on raids we cannot survive the aggro.<br />
We literally only have cannibalize, slow, malos, tnarg's, avatar, quiescence and haste going for. Situationally our pet I guess. Every other healer and every other slower has a lot more 'power spells' then we do.<br />
<br />
If for some reason you do feel that shaman are balanced at is, post it, here, on the official boards, whereever. If you are currently reviewing shaman and are not sure of the outcome, post it! If you are trying to review shaman but do not know where to start, for god's sake, please post and this board will give you an unimaginable amount of help.<br />
But So far the single 'official' statement we had was 'What is a shaman?'.<br />
And this about sums up what a lot of people feel like right now. We feel like noone even knows we are there, much less what issues we have. At least let us know what you intend to do with us shaman - one way or another we will know what we are at. Even if you come out and say shaman will not receive any upgrades. At least then some of us could go and level up a Necromancer or Beastlord or Cleric instead.</div></div><hr />

     Bahhhhh  ,sure Q/breath is so good in god ,well it's great for heal riposte dommage ,it's true. Healer balance is totally bust. Having a cleric in the groupe is an obligation ! If not the group is really weakened.</div></div><hr />

A very good advice  :D . Use it on my previous post please next time before commenting.<br />
<br />
I was referring to our OFFICIAL PROPOSAL, not to a random post in this thread.<br />
<br />
With all respect to Wing - everyone is entitled to his opinion -, the post in this thread is for a start just his opinion as a single shaman and does in no way reflect the majority opinion of shaman or if we are viewed as whiny or not as community. Every post works that way, except you sticky it and ask for wider agreement of more shaman - which was done via the proposal.<br />
<br />
In that proposal the community did NOT ask for a 2.5K heal, so Scieks conclusion was flawed.</div></div><hr />

Um, because if druids didnt have decent healing, they would have ZERO desirability in groups at all. <br />
<br />
Sure I would like a better heal, a better nuke, etc etc, but lets face it, we arent clerics or wizards. We are a utility class, and offer a lot of different functions in one package.

<br />
A utility class needs to be good at what they do - it is not like we can fulfill all of our possible roles at once. We can either heal X damage or deal Y damage, but we cannot do both. We can slow and heal, but we cannot do both at once. When you have a couple possible roles, being dead last in most of them does not cut it.<br />
Buffing (HPs) - tied for last with rangers<br />
Buffing (Haste/ATK) - third (of four classes)<br />
Healing - tied for third with paladins<br />
Damage - last<br />
Debuffs (resists) - tied for first with druids<br />
Debuffs (slow) - first<br />
Mana regen (self) - second<br />
mana regen (group) - none<br />
<br />
The above is all we bring to a group. The only thing we are really good at is debuffing, mainly for purposes of slowing, which is mitigated in way too many zones. We are a passable backup healer and we can haste.<br />
<br />
Now lets see how other classes stack up<br />
Enchanters<br />
Buffing(Haste) - second after bard. First for long term buffs<br />
Buffing(mana regen) - second after bard. First for long term buffs<br />
Damage - first if charm is possible. Slightly above shaman otherwise<br />
Crowd Control - tied for first with bards<br />
Pulling - tied for second with clerics<br />
Slow - second<br />
Debuffs (resists) - third, first if all you care about is magic<br />
<br />
Bards<br />
Buffs (haste) - first<br />
Buffs (spell damage) - first<br />
Buffs (mana regen) - first<br />
Damage - bad, still above shaman damage though<br />
Pulling - first <br />
Crowd Control - tied for first<br />
Slow - fourth<br />
<br />
Beastlords<br />
Slow - third<br />
Buffs (HPs) - pretty crappy, above shaman though<br />
buffs (mana regen) - third<br />
buffs (haste/ATK) - fourth, just after shaman<br />
damage - situationally tied for third with a lot of classes (correct me if I am wrong here)<br />
<br />
Clerics<br />
healing - first, by a huge margin<br />
buffs (HPs) - second right after paladins<br />
Pulling - tied for second<br />
Rez - first<br />
damage - pretty crappy, a bit above shaman<br />
<br />
Druids<br />
Healing - second<br />
Buffs (HPs) - third<br />
Buffs (mana regen) - third<br />
damage - best of the healers, behind all true damage classes<br />
debuffs (resists) - tied for first with shaman<br />
<br />
Paladins<br />
Healing - tied for third with shaman<br />
Buffs (HPs) - first<br />
Damage - pretty bad, solidly above shaman<br />
tanking - second<br />
rez - second<br />
<br />
Now, looking at the above - why do shaman get penalized for being the best in a category that is heavily mitigated and for having a situational mana regeneration?<br />
Utility and versatility just does not cut it when all it does is let you choose between five equally crappy options.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nice druid propaganda here, zero desirability in groups at all?? Give me a break.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, i would never deny, that druids needed some tweaking in their group role. But your statement is pure exaggeration with no base in reality. While their healing needed upgrades, they still had 3rd best nukes, 2nd best hp buff and one of the best set of utilities of all classes (snare, root, evac, track, sow, ports, DS, invis, mini pet). All that are minor tertiary advantages of course,  but it adds up and utility IS desired in groups.<br />
<br />
To be clear, i was never opposed to druids getting decent healing. I AM opposed to the uncalled and not justified (game-wise) massive widening of the gap between druid and shaman healing.<br />
<br />

That might be true up to PoP tier 3. But we are have GoD now. The mobs tripple for 1200 + bash + kick + 600DD proc + metigates slow(random_trash_mob_01 in Kod). And we have a 1300 heal (about 1800 with AA / gear) + 360HoT...<br />

If you simply nod along with those sorts of requests, then you are implying that you too think that's a good and balanced idea.  In which case, you lose credibility as someone who can evaluate the situation objectively.<br />
<br />
I stand by my original proposal regarding healing.  We SHOULD have gotten a 1600-1650hp fast heal upgrade to Tnargs in addition to this trivial upgrade to Q.  If the heal changes on test go live, I'd up that shaman heal another 100hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">The argument for druids getting such a massive gap in healing to us by using the reason of &quot; they bring nothing else to the table&quot; is so invalid.<br />
<br />
Druids bring ALOT to the table, just cause you or someone else doesnt realize it, doesnt mean it doesnt exist. Lets talk about the ability to port your group out if a mess is coming, one that will certainly over power your poor enchanter. Them and wizards are the only classes in the game with a group &quot;get out of death free&quot; card. They have solid nukes, they have the longest lasting and highest movement reduction snare in the game. They have awesome damage shields, that even if the mob is slowed its still going to make a significant different. They also have a charm ability that when in certain zones can bring significant mana free DPS to a group. Now they have very good healing power to boot.<br />
<br />
Now im not trying to make a argument on why druids shouldnt have great heals like they do now, the point im trying to get is that using a excuse like &quot; they bring nothign else to the table&quot; is completely invalid.<br />
<br />
So with the words above me let me say ...<br />
<br />
I am a guildless shaman, i do not have a uber mind. You all know me pretty well and know that im not after the biggest best loot, i dont care about healing and slow or casting summon bread in time or such. Knowing all that and how different my shaman world can be from some of you I have to also agree that whats going on with us is SICKENING. I let alot of things slide that SoE does lately cause i would rather play the game then waste time arguing. I would rather be the voice of reason and calm, not aggitation, but...<br />
<br />
<br />
What what hell are they thinking ?  10 extra healing for 5 mana ? You know, i seriously have to wonder if we are being phased out or something. The level of neglect and mis-understanding for what this class needs from SoE is beyond infuriating, im not mad at this point, im simply confused. I cant understand how they can have a resource like this board at their disposal and still have no clue on what we need.<br />
<br />
Back in kunark we were powerful. Ok i admit it, we were VERY powerful, maybe too powerful, i can understand you leaving us behind for a while, cause for a while we were solid and other things needed attention. But this is not kunark. This is not even PoP, the mobs in GoD at the lowest level are slamming you as hard as the higher end PoP mobs but our healing upgrades still remain largely unchanged. This gap that keeps getting wider and wider between us and druids is not acceptable. <br />
<br />
You wanna make druids better healers, fine, give them the direct heals, the big bombs and a nice set of quick heals. But our quick heals should be exactly the same as a druids, infact in anything ours should be BETTER.  Why should it be better you ask?  Druids main healing power is the big bomb they dropd, they heal a huge amount of HP in 1 cast ( compared to ours ) Its obvious that SoE impletmented a fairly decent balance structure to priest main healing, we got HoT's they got Direct Heals. Ok, this is good, this is how we like it. But the HoT we have now is far too little to mitigate any damage of even a slowed mob in GoD or upper PoP<br />
<br />
Our healing should be as effective as druid healing in our own way. They heal with a big Direct Heal and occasionaly hit a quick heal, then we should be able to main heal with out HoT with only having to quick heal once in a while. Heck maybe we should even have a better HoT then a cleric, i mean its out main source of healing right ?  Let the clerics try to complain, cause they have a CHeal that will blow the doors off anythign we get.<br />
<br />
But i digress. The point is, right now we are a broken class. Period.  At 65 our buffs are if nothing else null and viod cause almost everyone i know has maxed all relivant stats to our buffs or are so close they they only want our buffs so they can just see the number rounded off. Our healing can not keep up with the mobs they have put into the game with this new expansion and throwing us a bone with a extra 10 hp a tic is not the answer.<br />
<br />
SoE you really need to sit downa nd listen to us now. You have done it with SK's BST's and Druids and at the time they were the most troubled classes in the game.<br />
<br />
You have broken us now. Its now time for you to come and listen to us and help us become a worthy priest class again, cause right now, not joke at all, we are not needed in the game.  BST can take our place and so can a enchanter and both of them offer so much more to a group then we can in our current incarnation.<br />
<br />
I wish you could just come here and talk to us. <br />
<br />
<br />
I have a idea. Come here and talk to a mod/admin and have them make a stick that is locked a where you can have your replies posted. Together in the rest of the forum we will make a post like the proposal thread and decide what we want to say to you, then the mod with approval will post in your thread where you can respond at your will. This will set up a none combative way to interact with us. Come on. You have to know we need some serious attnetion at this point.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">This notion that Shaman do not have to be good at anything because they can do everything poorly is ludicris.<br />
<br />
Ok Tormac can slow, heal, dot, debuff mobs, and has a bunch of handy spells like lev, Bhili, invis, root, enduring breath, and hp/stat buffs.  Oh yeah and I can turn myself into a bear.<br />
<br />
Druids have heals, nukes, dots, debuffs, tracking, evac, porting, manna regen buffs, DS buffs, hp/ac buffs, and a bunch of handy spells like SoE, invis, enduring breath, snare and root.  Oh yeah and they can turn themselves and others into wolves.<br />
<br />
What is this overwhelming &quot;utility&quot; that I have that Druids do not have?  Slow is nice, but shamans are certainly not the only class that can slow.  Evac, tracking, and porting are also handy.  Druids bring as much to the table as shaman do.  The truth is almost every class has as much &quot;utility&quot; as the shaman does.<br />
<br />
Rangers can root, snare, heal, nuke, harmonize, sow, invis, lev, cast enduring breath, cast hp/ac buffs, ds buffs, attack stat buffs, track, hide, and still have good dps.  Sure rangers are not as good at healing or slowing as shaman are, but then shaman are not as good at snaring, harmonizing, or casting DS buffs as rangers are.  <br />
<br />
Tormac has never been invited to a group because of his &quot;utility&quot;.  The reason my shaman gets invited to groups is because he can slow and patch heal.  However with the fast pace of fights, and the continual mitigation of slow, slowing is becoming less important, and Tormac's superiority over BL and Enc is becoming less and less distinct.  And of course Tormac's healing ability is also diminishing in comparison with the other healing classes.<br />
<br />
Do Druids have inefficient heals, dots, and nukes, because they can evac, snare, and root, and thus not likely to never be hit by a mob?  Do druids have the least efficient heals, dots, and nukes of the priest classes because they can cast Pot9, and help regen manna for them selves, and the rest of their party? Or do they have all this, and better healing than shamans, and nukes that are strong enough to make mages complain?   <br />
<br />
Seriously what “utility” does my shaman have that is not likely to already exist in a typical group of say a warrior, cleric, necro, rogue, and enchanter?  What ability does my shaman have that is not likely to be in a group twice over?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I emailed this to Alan this morning:<br />
==================================<br />
Alan, I don't know who to send this to, but at least it feels better to vent.  I feedback in game but to my knowledge we haven't heard anything from SOE acknowleding us - or even telling us to sit down and be quiet, we're exactly what SOE wants us to be.<br />
<br />
Shaman have issues.  We excel in the slow game, and SOE keeps speeding the game up.  Less downtime, faster pulls, mobs with fewer HP but hit harder.  All these things take away from the entire shaman utility.  Our mana regen REQUIRES us to stand still, and be constantly casting - therefore unable to cast anything else while regenning mana.  (Granted, the new cannibalize spell is nice to help us hit Cann once instead of over and over.) Our heals are best suited for mobs that hit slowly - giving us time to recoup mana between hits - our entire class is based around slowing the game down.  Slow down the mobs hit rate, regen mana between hits, heal over times that offset the mobs damage enough that our other heals can make up the difference and we can keep a group alive.<br />
<br />
As it stands now, with trash mobs hitting for 1200+ and mitigating slows, we're totally unable to keep up at all - and we're one of the 3 PRIEST classes.  When I rolled my shaman back in 1999 I did so with the understanding that I was a healer and something akin to a tribal witchdoctor - but still one of the 3 main healer classes, and the only healer class for the ogres/troll races that I liked.  Now with things like slow mitigation and pull/kill speed per mob, the difference between enchanter, beastlord, and shaman slows is effectively nothing, the speed of the game in groups today renders my dot spells useless, because by the time I'm able to get a mob malos'd so the chanter can slow - it generally only has 20 seconds to live anyway, if that.  Shaman nukes are the worst of any caster - behind even clerics. Larger stat buffs are useless when people at the high end either have capped stats or are within 20 points of capping them and our focus spell line is the least HP add of any of the priests. Shaman are the ONLY priest class (inclusive of the paladin and beastlord melee classes) without some form of group heal.<br />
<br />
I don't want to make any recommendations because the crucible has already done a bang-up job talking about our issues, but if slows are the justification that shaman heals are so far behind the other priest classes, please consider that both the other priest classes is seldom in a group without some sort of slower also, and as a shaman, just the act of taking time to malos / slow a mob means we're unable to keep the groupmembers alive without another priest, and now even adding a second shaman strictly for heals while one shaman slows/debuffs now is not a solution for keeping a group alive.  We simply cannot spam heal fast enough - even 2 shaman as healers in GoD to run a party.<br />
<br />
Gameplay in EQ has sped up.  Faster mana regen for all mana classes, higher DPS from melees, larger nukes from high nuke casters, etc.  Shaman in comparison have the worst burst DPS of any caster or priest in damage output and efficiency, and the same duration 42 second and 120 second DoTs, and a new 30 second Magic DoT. But we're still playing the slow game. The game has sped up around us, and our best offering is a resist debuff, 925 pt. nuke, and downtime/patch heals so the real priests can save their mana.  None of which is a shaman truly required or really desired for.</div></div><hr />

And lo and behold I see lucy with some changes to the Gates heals that all the healing classes received (well to be fair BST didn't get a heal upgrade with Gates).  <br />
<br />
I think, great they are reevaluating heals that is something they should've done during beta considering the shear amount of whoopass Gates mobs can deliver.<br />
<br />
CLR 65 - Holy Light <br />
03-02 18:56 	Changed Mana cost from 660 to 650<br />
03-02 18:56 	Changed Slot 1 from &quot;Increase Hitpoints by 3050&quot; to &quot;Increase Hitpoints by 3275&quot;<br />
<br />
DRU 65 - Sylvan Infusion <br />
03-02 18:56 	Changed Casting Time from 3.5 seconds to 3.8 seconds<br />
03-02 18:56 	Changed Slot 1 from &quot;Increase Hitpoints by 1925&quot; to &quot;Increase Hitpoints by 2100&quot;<br />

<br />
So to summarize everyone else either gets an increase in the total amount healed (7-10% increases) and/or a decrease in mana cost (1.5-2.3%).  While the sucker shaman get a 2.8% increase in total healed and an 2.3% INCREASE in mana cost. <br />

Of course a Necromancer will outdamage us twice over while giving the group mana. With snare, FD, charm, invis, invis to undead, Harmshield and succor they also have a pretty strong utility set, especially for pulling.<br />

Actually that is not true. HoT upgrades need to scale to direct healing upgrades. That is Torpor -&gt; Trushar should equal Superior Healing -&gt; Tnarg's, including focus items and AAs.<br />

Flabbo you're gonna bust a gasket if you really think that shamans are a priest class.  I've accepted it.  We're a necrco-hybrid &quot;utility&quot; class. You need to find a friend that can solo most places, but would find it useful to have you around every now and then.  I'd suggest a necro, as they solo at a pace we can almost keep up with. Then like Robin to Batman, you can be the necro's sidekick, err I mean “support class”, slowing mobs and taking the necro's light work for him.  Maybe casting our heal over time on your necro master so he can lich all he wants.  If our HoT can keep up with the damage rate of a Lich form necro, we’re balanced for our role as a support class.  Maybe summon food for your necro so he does not have to be bothered with buying any.  We have lots of utility, you need to find little ways to help your master, err I mean non-utility friend.  You're expecting way too much out of your shaman if you expect to have all our utility (hey all the women in my guild love how cute I am when I'm in double shrunk bear mode, what more can I really want?) and have the ability to have critical roles while fighting the real mobs.<br />
<br />
You've read all the posts explaining that we are a utility class.  You just have to understand that what &quot;utility&quot; means is we are a sidekick class.  Like Robin we can handle the other classes light work, when they are too bothered doing critical jobs.  We can over slow mobs after BL's get them slowed.  We can off tank weak adds, keeping them out of the way of the way of the important classes, just like Robin can fight the underling while Batman goes after the real crime boss.<br />
<br />
(Sorry if I sound cranky today, for the second time recently I had a bad time in Bot last night, SK puller bitching at me over how long it takes me to slow two mobs when the BL can slow them both near instantly, but I'm coming to accept my side-kick, err I mean &quot;utility&quot; role in the game nowadays.  Every now and then I remember back to the good old days when shaman could heal almost as well as clerics, and our E-bolt was a damage spell to envy, but that kind of thinking just makes me bitter.  That and I'm lvling my BL.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Actually that is not true. HoT upgrades need to scale to direct healing upgrades. That is Torpor -&gt; Trushar should equal Superior Healing -&gt; Tnarg's, including focus items and AAs.<br />
DoT spells need to scale to fight duration and to nuke upgrades.<br />
None of the above happened - thus our HoT spell is not a heal anymore and our DoTs do not get used.<br />
<br />
<br />
I dont see how you can say they need to be the same % upgrade. Increasing the % of a direct heal or nuke has a much larger impact on raid balance/encounters than a heal over time/dot, because they can be chain cast. Since you can only have one HOT on someone at a time, giving a larger % upgrade on those is less of a balance issue. Over 24 seconds, a cleric can cast their blast heal a good number of times, for considerably more HP restored than we can with our lame HOT upgrade. Throw in multiple spot healers on a raid, and you begint os ee how the balance issue is even further compounded, and why instant upgrades need to be smaller. EQ is a game where it pays to do stuff NOW. Would you rather have mob dead now, or 24 seconds later? DO you want the tank healed now, or in 2 tics? Mob has 1500hp, and begins to cast a heal. Do you want it dotted, or dead from a nuke? Instant spells are more powerful, pure and simple. Mana efficiency flies out the window when the mob wipes the raid or group. Think about mana burn/lifeburn, and why they can be useful. If dots and hots stacked with themself, it would be different.<br />

If trushar stacked with quiesence, it might actually fix a good deal of our healing issues.</div></div><hr />

Quies and Trushar stacking would be 660/670 a tick. It would require 2 buff spots, and 2 spell gems. Furthermore, it would take a tick for the 2nd spell to kick in, so its only marginally better than a cleric HoT. Take 2 casts to achieve too.

&quot;Of course a Necromancer will outdamage us twice over while giving the group mana. With snare, FD, charm, invis, invis to undead, Harmshield and succor they also have a pretty strong utility set, especially for pulling.&quot;<br />
<br />
Well yeah, I suppose I necro will do more damage than us.  But you can't expect a support class with as much utility as shamans to be able to do everything can you? <br />
<br />
Sure necros can twitch, FD, have better pets, can snare, have passive manna regen, life taps, dots, fear, group heals, slow undead, succor, better damage, cast DMF, etc. But they are still not the utility class that SHAMAN are!  After all we have canni! With canni we can have a near unlimited amount of manna to ensure that we can keep the regen buff on our necro so they can Lich all they want.  Oh yeah I’ll always be welcome in groups because of my utility.  Oh and we can summon bread and water!  Ha I bet druids everywhere are wishing they had the utility that shamans have!  (Huh, what’s that?  Other classes can summon stacks of food at a time?  Bah well I'm sure they will run oom summoning stacks of food, where we will never run out of manna summoning food one at a time because I can canni then qui myself!  Just imagine the balancing issues SOE has to deal with because we can canni and summon food.  Its no wonder why shaman can’t have the ability to summon stacks of food, with canni it would be insanely unbalance.)<br />
<br />
Really some of you just want everything! As long as our healing is enough to heal my canni damage, so I can keep up with my utility role and serve as a good sidekick I'm balanced.  I can keep up haste and avatar on my necro’s pet, keep regen and hot on him so he can lich, and summon food and water for him, and never go OOM with canni.  Now that’s a power utility class there.  All the druids wish they could be sidekicks the way shamans can.  That is why druids are always quading, they are jealous because they only have 9’s and not canni like me! Sure they claim that they are getting great exp soloing, but trust me, Druids wish they could be side kicks the way shaman can.  All the uber necros want shaman as sidekicks instead of druids.  I’ll never be left in PoK wondering what my guild is up to as long as I can serve as a sidekick, err I mean utility class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Yeah, but I see that having one class able to continuously heal 670 points per tick, on themselves, AND on a couple extra group members if need be with a few AAs and keep it going indefinately ... that's just extreme.<br />
<br />
And the versatility there of being able to maintain a solid 400+ pts a tick with regen and Trushar, and upping that up to 700 a tick for &quot;crisis&quot; times - that just seems like too much to be able to keep going all the time as desired.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't mind seeing 500 pts on Trushar non-stacking, but I think 670 pts/tick (plus regen = 700+/tick) for the duration of most mobs in camp is extreme.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't mind the idea of a line of shaman only curses that actually depower a mob by nn%.  Something like the warrior damage absorb ability - maybe give shaman a line of fast cast spiritual &quot;shell&quot; group spells that really help with absorb or reverse absorb castable on the mob that makes it hit for truly less... not just stat reducers like cripple.<br />

Maybe my sarcasm meter isn't working, but anyway, not really the point of my reply here:<br />
<br />
When we canni (Cann 4), we aren't doing much but just that... standing there chewing up time and not doing anything else.  Which means we ain't doing any healing nor dps.  With mobs these days doing enough damage to kill someone in seconds, spending the seconds canni'ing for mana, can mean death for someone.  Can5 is good, but I barely get a bub of mana these days, and Tnarg's eats that up fast, not to mention sometimes (not too much of the time) sudden drop in my hp can invite agro.<br />
<br />
Can4 is slow at getting mana in a fast paced world these days.  Chaotic Pain (believe that's the name of the new canni) looks nice, but I'm pretty sure the general population of shamans won't be getting it.  You just can't base a game for a class on rare to get spells.<br />
<br />
Canni has been turning into a myth like our ability to slow mobs, in justification for lack of healing.</div></div><hr />

Ciccero, I think you have a great idea!  Any spell that does two things at once would be great for shaman, since our problem (at least my problem) is dealing with time factors..  A curse that was a debuff and short lived dot would be very useful I think (of course that is assuming that SOE would give us one that I could cast in place of cripple or turgurs, instead of one that I would have to &quot;over&quot; cripple or &quot;over&quot; turgur after initialy castign it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with this 100%, but I think Sony has finally recognized that trivializing previous content with significant relatively easy to get spell/item/aa upgrades is not a good thing.  I think this is exactly their mindset with GOD.  The fact is, not only did each expansion trivialize the previous one, but the expansions themselves have been considerably more trivial than its predecessor.  Look back at the old expansions.  How many people were even level 60 when Kunark was finished?  At the end of Velious, a few guilds were done with NToV but not many had killed AoW.  When Luclin was finished, quite a few were in VT and were ready to continue to PoP.  Now at the end of PoP, there are many many guilds farming plane of time.  Each expansion took less time to finish the the previous one.  If the Rathe Council event had been working probably from the start, PoP would have been beaten in 3 months or so.  Also imagine how fast people would have completed the expansions had the progression content been instanced instead of contested, but that's another story.<br />
<br />
Sony recognized that that they didn't want GoD beaten and put into farm mode in 2 months this time around.  By providing modest ( at best ) spell and aa upgrades, they still keep PoP relatively challenging for those that haven't completed it yet, while turning up the difficulty of the new expansion so that it requires some actual effort to progess with the tools that people already have.   I know I don't want to be farming the same content for 10 months until the next expansion comes out.  This is a progression based game, and so it shouldn't be easy to skip content like it was with PoP.   I want a challenge not to be spoon-fed. <br />
<br />
That said, I do agree with the concerns that our healing is not up to par with druid healing.   I think alot of the expansion was tuned around making CH somewhat obsolete ( which is a good thing ).  With that in mind, I really think that if other classes got a fast heal upgrade, we should have been provided one as well. I don't like the larger seperation in abilities. A HoT upgrade is very insignificant.  It's definately not usable for anything other that AE healing or patching up a few errant hits before a tank gets aggro.  A fast heal upgrade really the only upgrade I would have cared about.  But you know, the same result could be accomplished by providing an item/augment upgrade that offered say a 50-60% heal increase to tnargs specifically.  I thought the idea of focus effects working on specific spells or class of spells ( like the mask that works on poison dots only for example ) was a pretty good one.  It lets you make the effect  a bit more powerful than the one that works for a more general category of spells without going overboard. I do think the &quot;gear up to get to the next level only to gear up and do it all over again&quot; formula is pretty much the name of the game.  It's a proven winning formula, and probably the thing that keeps most people playing the game.  It's a good way to control progress, so if that's the way they want to do it, I'm totally fine with that.  <br />

Except for the simple fact that its not.  However, even if it was, you cant really maintain it on a group. Assuming max spell haste/quick buff, and bearing in mind theres a spell gem greyout for 2.5 seconds after you finish each spell...<br />
<br />
You begin to cast Breath, 5.25 sconds later, you begin to cast Quies.... 5.25 seconds later, you beging to cast Breath on group member 2. 10.5 seconds per member, assuming you have no lag in between casts, no fizzles (yeah, right!) etc. Wow... I didnt know those spells last over a minute. Oh wait, they DONT. <br />
<br />
Hmm, only 2550 per group cast. A bargain! Oh, have fun keeping this up with no canni either. Since despite what every other class will tell us, we dont have infinite mana, since theres an opportunity cost to regaining it. Oh, and thank god you brought another shaman to slow.

There was a time when shaman where much much better at taking a beating compared to other (caster and priest) classes, now we need alot of top end gear to do it and still die in 5 secs. <br />
<br />
what we really need is to come up with  real ideas that can be impilmented.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">There was a time when Pallies and SKs were &quot;spot tanks&quot;... many people didn't take them seriously until they got some upgrades.<br />
<br />
The upgrades were slow at first I think, and then turned them into the desireable machines of today.<br />
<br />
LDON had a lot to do with the ultimate desireability I think... snap agro in those faster paced adventures.<br />
<br />
Pallies and SKs came a long way... and were actually the desired tank of many for awhile.<br />
<br />
The warriors complained for a long time... mainly about agro issues, but also about just tanking power in general.<br />
<br />
They finally got agro discs of their own, plus a minor mitigation increase by default for being a warrior.<br />
<br />
I would say that all the tanks are pretty equal now in my experience, for experience type groups... warriors tank a bit bitter, have a few more hp... pallies / sks can still do the agro a bit better, and offer some extra utility.<br />
<br />
Healing never got this sort of balance.<br />
<br />
For a long time... it was purely the cleric's domain of healing... you can think back as long as you want... remembering that it wasn't till well into Kunark did our healing start to settle in.<br />
<br />
Chlorblast and the Incomplete Heals actually helped a lot... then there were further PoP upgrades... but even through that... the cleric remained (and still is) the undisputed number 1 healer.<br />
<br />
Druids are actually a distant second when you consider all the heals a cleric can do... and Shamans are 3rd by a good measure to the druids.<br />
<br />
Balance is a big word.... it means so much to so many people... when in reality i think it means people want a group without waiting for hours... they don't want to can a whole night of playing cause they can't find a cleric... etc...<br />
<br />
I have not played WoW... I'm not in the Beta... I'm *only* going by what's said publicly by them...  in a question asked about the priest classes... they said all priest classes woudl have the same &quot;raw healing power&quot; but that clerics would  have either better or more useful healing abilities... they'd be the better healers.... but everyone could do the job.<br />
<br />
That's what I think we need in EQ.<br />
<br />
We need a complete healing overhaul... plus whatever else goes with that.<br />
<br />
Complete Heal... for better or worse... is a big factor in healing power.   It's not the ONLY skill clerics have... but its' a big one... and I believe still used quite a bit.<br />
<br />
I don't have all the answers... and even if I did, I doubt everyone would agree... <br />
<br />
I was just getting comfortable with the fact in LDON, that I could main heal if I wanted to.   I'd rather have a cleric do it... but I could handle the job, even with slowing... Druids definatly could handle the job.<br />
<br />
I can't really handle LDON hards... but I could do xp grounds like BoT (I have no idea about Sol Ro or Ele's since I'm not there)... <br />
<br />
Now GoD... I can't do frick all healing.<br />
<br />
The problem is... what do you do with clerics if &quot;raw healing power&quot; was the same between Druids - Shamans - Clerics. <br />
<br />
I played a 61 clerics for the longest time, and now a 65 shaman... everyone has a favorite class, and has their reasons... there's no way I can say &quot;x is more fun than y&quot;... that's up to the person... but in playing my low level druid, my high level shaman, and my past with the cleric... all the bells and whistles of druids/shamans are much more fun than clerics.<br />
<br />
Hardships like no self invis for clerics... hell not even &quot;See Invis&quot; for clerics... no levitate, water breathing...  sure there's potions and items, but all take time, money... whereas with shamans and druids, we just &quot;get it&quot;.<br />
<br />
Druids and Shamans have MANY more soloing options than clerics... and we can even replace a cleric in these not high dps mob groups.    When's the last time a cleric replaced a shaman?     Sure... you can do it... you just have to heal 75% more unless you have an alternate slower.<br />
<br />
Give every class CH... 400 mana for the clerics, 450 mana for the druids, 500 mana for the shamans (assuming you want to keep their tiers there)... give each class a direct heal which is VERY fast, the &quot;remedy&quot; line from clerics... best efficency on the cleric, then druid, then shaman... but fairly close.   Now also add in a big heal... like the &quot;light&quot; series... same deal.<br />
<br />
Clerics can retain  their great group heals, heal over times... Shamans can retain Qui line, and druids... whatever else they have... some high regen spell or something don't they?<br />
<br />
Sounds pretty simple... but what to do with the clerics... overnight they'd lose groups... that's hardly fair this late in the game... to add so much extra flexibility to druids and shamans, and leave clerics going '***?'<br />
<br />
I dunno... <br />
<br />
Please don't tell me or anyone else to go play a cleric if we wanna be a healer... been there, done that... I'm where I want to be... but it sure does bug me a lot that I have to wait on my ass for certain classes if I want to try and play in the new expansion... or hard ldons.<br />
<br />
My hope is that for WoW, they realize that not every healer wants to be a cleric, and not every group wants to wait around for a cleric... let them be the best... but let others be in the same ballpark.</div></div><hr />

Healing for shamans is now a roll of the dice, better hope you have max AA and get a lucky crit.  Otherwise your heal will barely heal 1 single hit in GoD beyond the front of the sewer trials.

It sure is a nice little spell, everytime I cast it I think about how badly I need something like it on Henora.  As a person who actively plays a level 65 shaman, cleric and druid I am very familiar with the healing abilities of each and shaman are very very far behind.  Necro's can crit heal off taps for more than I can crit heal off tnargs.</div></div><hr />

The problem is... what do you do with clerics if &quot;raw healing power&quot; was the same between Druids - Shamans - Clerics. <br />
<br />
I played a 61 clerics for the longest time, and now a 65 shaman... everyone has a favorite class, and has their reasons... there's no way I can say &quot;x is more fun than y&quot;... that's up to the person... but in playing my low level druid, my high level shaman, and my past with the cleric... all the bells and whistles of druids/shamans are much more fun than clerics.<br />
<br />
Hardships like no self invis for clerics... hell not even &quot;See Invis&quot; for clerics... no levitate, water breathing...  sure there's potions and items, but all take time, money... whereas with shamans and druids, we just &quot;get it&quot;.<br />
<br />
Druids and Shamans have MANY more soloing options than clerics... and we can even replace a cleric in these not high dps mob groups.    When's the last time a cleric replaced a shaman?     Sure... you can do it... you just have to heal 75% more unless you have an alternate slower.<br />
<br />
Give every class CH... 400 mana for the clerics, 450 mana for the druids, 500 mana for the shamans (assuming you want to keep their tiers there)... give each class a direct heal which is VERY fast, the &quot;remedy&quot; line from clerics... best efficency on the cleric, then druid, then shaman... but fairly close.   Now also add in a big heal... like the &quot;light&quot; series... same deal.<br />
<br />
Clerics can retain  their great group heals, heal over times... Shamans can retain Qui line, and druids... whatever else they have... some high regen spell or something don't they?<br />
<br />
Sounds pretty simple... but what to do with the clerics... overnight they'd lose groups... that's hardly fair this late in the game... to add so much extra flexibility to druids and shamans, and leave clerics going '***?'<br />
. . .<br />
<br />
Well maybe I'm misreading your what your saying Sariss, but I agree that it would be unbalancing if shamans/druids/and clerics all had equal CH rates, just with druids, then shamans paying more mana.  I can't recall anyone ever saying that shamans should heal at the same amount of hp as clerics or druids here.  But I for one, really wish that <br />
<br />
1) shamans healing ability was at least scaling at the same rate as clerics/Druids/and Pallys.  As fights become faster and faster, with slow mitigation a common thing, shaman healing is falling far behind.<br />
<br />
2)that the notion that shamans have some kind of uber utility not be used as an excuse for why we deserve to have the least of everything. I've commonly played monk alts, but have also played Enc, Clr, and currently BL alts.  Sure when I played my monk I hated not being able to sow my self, or not having gate, lev, or invis, the same is true with my cleric.  At the same time there are things that I could do with my cleric that I could not do with just the shaman because of paci.  And every time I've died playing my cleric, enchanter, or shaman, something in the back of my mind yelled feign death!  Not having invis is annoying playing my cleric, but invis potions are not that expensive, and unless you are soloing or in a very small party its unlikely that no one in you party does not have an invis of some kind.  The notion that Shamans have a lock on utility and druids and clerics bring nothing but heals is just wrong.  All three classes have many viable talents besides the archetype &quot;healing&quot;.  I've seen tanks refuse pick up groups where a druid and myself were the two healers because we could not rez.  <br />
<br />
As far as &quot;fun&quot; goes, I an sure envious of the cleric I regularly group with, as he can melee, while I'm continuously canning.  Canni is just no fun to me, but it seems necisary if i'm to keep up with the group.(shrugs) <br />
<br />
No one here that I have seen is asking to have a complete heal that equal to, or close to a clerics complete heal.  But a lot of shamans do want our healing to at least scale upwards at the same rate as the other priest classes.  Me being a competent patch healer will not lessen the desirability of clerics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">Thank you Henora for helping me realize I am not the only gimp here. Tipt was grand fun and all... praying my maxed crit/heal % aten legs would kick in and save the elemental tank who was spiking all over the place on hp %. Our healing is bad in elementals, and friggin GOD AWFUL in GoD. I was grateful my guildmates took my sorry ass along to loot a bracer from the boss, but really, damn near anyone (except possibly a berserker lol) would have been a better choice. Another warrior to page tank, chanter to charm pooka for a billion dps, beast to slow just as well and dps/buff, more healing, more dps, etc.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">Yeah, I wasn't really asking for CH as such, or suggesting that's what shamans want... I was more thinking along the lines of what I've heard for WoW... where the raw healing power would be about the same.<br />
<br />
In the case of EQ (okay, for that matter... we don't have any specifics about WoW either), this just isn't the case.<br />
<br />
With pansy stuff, a shaman can be a great healer... but as the mob dps scales up, shamans just don't have the healing power scaled up to keep in line.<br />
<br />
It's not even close... it's not &quot;harder with a shaman&quot; it's damn near impossible with a shaman as a healer.     I'm sure there's examples where so and so , from here and there, did something hard as the main healer... but in general, and for most of the population, being a healer on non-trivial stuff just isn't practical... whereas clerics easily fit in... and druids... it depends.<br />
<br />
I think it's too late to re-balance this in EQ... just think of the bitching that would go on... any significant healing upgrade for druids and shamans would be met with &quot;outrage&quot; by the clerics... in fact, if any of us got a significant healing upgrade, the other two would probably complain... and if all 3 got an upgrade... the clerics would be against people getting closer, or if they got nerfed, whatever...<br />
<br />
I apologize for the minor rambling in a thread that talks about a healing upgrade... but  that's what got me going... this heal upgrade is a joke... and means very little, even for those who can actually get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">I honestly think they added the 10hps to distract from the increase in cast time.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Banuddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">Sorry, but I just really don't see the problem with healing.<br />
<br />
I can, and do keep up with heals on trash in Vxed, Tipt, Kod Taz, and Ikkinz, without any problems as the group's only healer and slower.  On named, my heals make a huge difference- to the point where I can't even take a second to pause and hit canni V, because I know if I do, it could mean the difference between the tank living and dying (and thus the group winning or losing).<br />
<br />
I think the main problem is probably just that people tend to overestimate the current healing powers of clerics and druids.  Yeah, they can heal for a lot of once... but the difference is, they have to be efficient about their healing, whereas we can cast a lot more heals and not have to worry about running out of mana.<br />
<br />
Cheal takes 10 seconds to cast.  With the amounts that this stuff hits for, clerics have to start their cheals very early.  And even if they start cheals early, they often have to cancel their cheals if the tanks take some unlucky rounds.  And given the fact that to keep up with mana, most clerics need to use horses, this presents a huge problem, and is a definite drawback to cleric healing.  Same goes for druids, just moreso, since their heals arent even as good.<br />
<br />
Shaman healing, on the other hand, tends to keep the tank topped off, which offers so much more flexibility and security.  Seriously-- except for things that require spam SLs, I find it MUCH easier to keep groups alive healing on my shaman than botting a cleric.  With a shaman, I can just do my thing and heal the group as necessary, but with classes that have to use long casting heals for efficiency, it's a constant guessing game to try to keep up with heals without wasting mana needlessly.<br />
<br />
I think a lot of people just look at the numbers, without considering how the different classes actually put those numbers into action.  A bigger heal doesn't mean much if you can't use it due to efficiency problems (over a long term, at least).<br />
<br />
And yeah, I realize that enjoying my class's abilities is unpopular, but oh well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can't fathom how you think mandated-chain-casting of a heal proves the heal is useful -- it does not.  It proves the exact opposite in fact.  Our heals are worse than druids and clerics -- Far worse -- however they are &quot;justified&quot; by our mana regen and our added utility.  If the new zones don't allot us the time to use our mana regen, or our added utility (to say nothing of the fact that the mitigation reduces our utility drastically), then we are essentially worthless.  In these situations there is 0 reason to choose a shaman over a cleric or druid.  0.  That is not balanced.  Eliminating an entire class from the end-game utility is plenty of reason to complain.  Doing it with such articulate justifications as &quot;what is a shaman&quot; is reason enough to strangle SOE.  I respect that your happy with your class.  Respect that there is plenty of reason for me not to be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you are busy spam healing, and don't even have time to hit Canni5, where is it that all this mana comes from?<br />
<br />
We are double penalized in situations like you describe.  Not only are we unable to use our ONLY METHOD OF MANA REGEN, but our heals are innately less efficient than those of druids and clerics.<br />
<br />
As the most recent entries in Lucy<br />
CLERIC - Holy Light, 3275/650 = 5.038 hp per mana<br />
DRUID - Sylvan Infusion, 2100/550 = 3.818 hp per mana<br />
SHAMAN - Tnargs Mending, 1300/450 = 2.889 hp per mana.<br />
<br />
Other classes have no need to use their long casting heals to have better efficiency than shamans.  Their fast heals are already much more efficient than ours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">Yeah, but I see that having one class able to continuously heal 670 points per tick, on themselves, AND on a couple extra group members if need be with a few AAs and keep it going indefinately ... that's just extreme.<br />
For CH to continously heal 670 per tick, assuming it lands for 5K it needs to be cast every 45 seconds. CH costs, what, 320 mana after spec? A cleric will regain about 60 mana per tick with full FT; decent buffs and a horse and can thus cast a CH every 32 seconds forever, healing about 940 damage per tick.<br />
<br />
A shaman will need to keep up 2.5 Trushars for the same effect. At no extension AAs/focuses that takes 450 mana every 24 seconds, as well as 21 seconds of casting time. In those 24 seconds the shaman will regen 280 mana, plus a single canna. Clearly this shaman, who already has SCM3 over the cleric cannot begin to keep up.<br />
<br />
If you give the shaman a mana preservation IV item, a spell haste item and a buff extension item he will start to outheal, over time, a cleric with less gear and about 50 less AA who times his CHs conservatively and who does not use Divine Arbitration, if the shaman can find enough people to constantly require healing.<br />
<br />
And even so, 670 per tick will not even make a noticeable dent in the damage output of a GoD MOB.<br />
<br />
I can, and do keep up with heals on trash in Vxed, Tipt, Kod Taz, and Ikkinz, without any problems as the group's only healer and slower.<br />
So you never had the yellow con archer that resisted slow after malos? Just how do you keep your group alive against that?<br />

On named, my heals make a huge difference- to the point where I can't even take a second to pause and hit canni V, because I know if I do, it could mean the difference between the tank living and dying (and thus the group winning or losing).<br />
The fact that you have to spend your time chainhealing is not an upside. Any time you chainheal and the tank does not die a druid or cleric could have kept up with more.<br />

If I tried to heal half as much as a cleric I would run out of mana much much sooner. We cannot even pretend to keep up over time, much less on emergency heals.<br />
<br />

Are you aware that CH will heal more damage in those 10 seconds then 3 Tnarg's will, for less mana then one Tnarg's?<br />

<br />
With a shaman, I can just do my thing and heal the group as necessary, but with classes that have to use long casting heals for efficiency, it's a constant guessing game to try to keep up with heals without wasting mana needlessly.<br />
That is called class knowledge I think. Ducking or moving out of a heal is not that bad, even on a horse.<br />
<br />
I think a lot of people just look at the numbers, without considering how the different classes actually put those numbers into action.  A bigger heal doesn't mean much if you can't use it due to efficiency problems (over a long term, at least).<br />
We do not regen that much more then clerics, not if you insist on making up at least a 3 to 1 deficiency in heal efficiency. And that still does not take into account emergency healing.<br />
<br />
If you had argued we can outheal druids over the long run you might have had a case. Arguing it is easier to keep a group alive with a shaman then with a cleric is silly.</div></div><hr />

I'm afraid I just can't really see how I can be a main healer on the double-triple 1300 hitters ... without :<br />
<br />
a) slow landing ASAP ( i try to do this anyhow, regardless of the mob )<br />
b) No slow resists (so far, with malos, not a huge problem, but I have had resists)<br />
c) chain casting my direct heal, hoping for some crits to balance it out a bit.<br />
<br />
If a mob does a double 1300 (yes I know, not max all the time, and they will miss a few too) and then throws in a bash/kick, or a 500 pt proc that some of them are doing... it's really hard to keep up with that, with a 1300 pt heal.<br />

Maybe for time tanks with good gear, and time shamans with the best focus / passive mana regen in the game...  but even then, I gotta see it as definatly not easy, and highly subject to death.<br />

<br />
And what about multi pulls... they're hard enough to begin with, but even if you have a skilled bard/enc who locks down pretty quick, they may get some pot shots in... or they get resists... etc...<br />

At almost 4 seconds (pre-focus), that's a slow healing game.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u82"><b>Banuddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p82">Keep in mind that there are two different healing circumstances, random trash clearing, and then named fights.<br />
<br />
For named fights, you're gonna have to spam.  Obviously, for this, clerics and druids are the superior choice, I'm not debating that.  However, my point IS that my heals DO make a big difference on those fights, even if not as much as a cleric's would.  Shaman are great healers over the long term, but not so much for short term healing, which makes sense, considering all the other stuff we can do.<br />
<br />
Henora- in named fights, my mana comes from my base.  The reason I don't canni 5 is because there's really no need to, since I never run out of mana on those fights anyway.  If mana was an issue for me, I'd hit canni 5 and hope the tank held up, but under the circumstances there was no point.<br />
<br />
veeshanMurtak- Yep, the yellow cons can suck if slow resists, but in a group where I'm gonna be main healer I'll have a bard pulling so it won't resist anyway.  And in the case that it does resist, it's not gonna be much easier for a druid or a lot of the time a cleric to keep up alone.  Another healer is always preferable, i'm just making the point that it's doable if you know how.<br />
<br />
In regards to what you said about needing to chainheal not being an upside... if you weren't aware, on the tough named fights, ALL healers have to chain heal, not just the shaman.  You just can't keep up with DPS otherwise, unless you have a ton of healers or one extremely strong tank.<br />
<br />
It is possible to keep up with heals over a long term for these things, if you have the right gear and a good tank.  You don't have to spam your heal, as some of you seem to think -- it's not going to get in max rounds every time (in fact, except on the high conning stuff, most of it very rarely gets in really large rounds).  With quiescence or trushar going all the time, and heals when necessary, it is not hard to keep up with healing and not run out of mana.  And don't tell me you can't do that, because I can, and do, regularly.<br />
<br />
The problem with cheals in GoD is the variability of damage.  In kod taz, for instance, some areas are full of casters.  This means that the damage is either none (while they are casting), or a lot.  As a result, it is difficult to judge when the tank is going to need heals with enough precision to make it nearly as simple as shaman healing.  Obviously, someone who has played a cleric for a long time will have an easier time of estimating this, but it really is difficult, which is why secondary healers are usually preferable in GoD (which shaman does very well, might I add).<br />
<br />
It seems like a lot of you are underestimating the value of cannibalize.  It makes SUCH a huge difference in mana regen, and although you can't always canni IV mid fight if you have to heal (though you can, if you time it right), there are plenty of opportunities to use it to improve mana regen.  Clerics are always going to have an easier time keeping up with heals than shaman if there is a shaman slowing, but my point is that the shaman CAN do it.  And i'd guess we're about equal with druids in terms of keeping up with heals over time, though I haven't grouped with any druid healers in GoD so I haven't had a chance to see.<br />
<br />
Sariss- It's not as hard as you think, with a few exceptions (like certain mobs in Vxed/Tipt, and the yellows in Kod Taz).  Multi pulls do suck, and obviously a secondary healer is preferable for that, but a lone druid or cleric will have the same types of problems if you don't have a good puller or mezzer (though admittedly to a lesser extent- shaman aren't meant to be the best for these types of situations).<br />
<br />
Gwaeron- GoD trial named are just difficult.  I haven't encountered any yet, with the exception of the final Ikkinz mob, that is not doable with a cleric + shaman healing, though.<br />
<br />
To everyone-<br />
<br />
I'm not saying that shaman are the best healers.  In almost all situations, druids or clerics are preferable for it.  HOWEVER, what I am saying, is that in the current stage EQ, if appropriately geared, a shaman can function just fine as a healer, and is the perfect choice for a backup healer for a group (a shaman is much easier to incorporate into a group than a druid is).  Obviously, healing alone isn't going to be a walk in the park, but neither will it be for druids or even clerics.  It's one of those things you can do when necessary, but try to avoid.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying a better heal upgrade would be out of line, I'm just saying that our healing abilities are not as gimped as many of you seem to believe.</div></div><hr />

You make very little sense here. Yes compleate heal is the most efficient heal clerics have still but even they are using it less and less. 10 seconds is just way to long for a heal that isn't even a compleate heal anymore. Of corse i think thats what verant wants.<br />
<br />
As far as cann goes it is a nice ability but our healing is still way to weak to make up for it. The problem is the more we need it the less of a chance we have to use it. IE the more mana we're using, the more we're casting the less time we have to cann. You wanna talk about fast heals lets do that.<br />
<br />
Tnarg's for a shaman since its the only one we have.<br />
1300hps in 3.75 seconds for 450 mana<br />
<br />
Clerics there are a number of options.<br />
Supernal remedy<br />
1450 hps in 1.75 second for 400 mana- Substantially faster base and faster than you can get tnargs even with max haste, including cleric buff, and yet still heals for more and is cheaper<br />
<br />
Supernal light<br />
2750hps in 3.75 seconds for 600 mana- Same cast time, Over double the healed and slightly more expensive.<br />
<br />
Holy light (current live not improved version on test)<br />
3050hps in 3.75 seconds for 660 mana- A bit more hps and a bit more mana over supernal already more efficient than supernal by a little but and getting tweaked even futher up on test.<br />
<br />
Now lets try running some senarios<br />
<br />
We'll say a tank is taking 1300dmg every 10 seconds. That ends up being 130dps.<br />
<br />
Our shaman is going to have to cast 1 tnargs every 10 seconds taking  ~5.5 seconds cast time and refresh and 450 mana.<br />
<br />
Our cleric will use supernal light and has to cast 1 ever 20 seconds and spends the same ~ 5.5 seconds casting and 600 mana.<br />
<br />
Ok bringing the shaman up to 20 seconds he's now cast twice spending ~11 sec casting and 900 mana. He now has to cann back 300 mana to match the cleric. That will take between 3 and 4 casts of cann 4 to make that up, we'll round down to 3 casts. That 3 casts takes ~15 seconds to cast but we only have 9 seconds so we'll have to settle for only 2 casts. That puts us at 164 mana gained so we're still 146 mana behind the cleric and we've done nothing but chain cast heals and cann for 20 seconds and the cleric has cast one spell.<br />
<br />
I'd hardley call 130hps a high dps mob in fact thats probably closer to a slowed mob in most of those zones considering the mobs can easily do that much dmg in a hit or 2. <br />
<br />
Even if you want to throw a q in there we still fall behind. Assuming you cast q at the start and it's always able to heal the tank he's gonna get 3 ticks if your lucky for 900hps healed and is behind the rate of healing needed and you've still spent more mana than the cleric.<br />
<br />
Just for giggles the hps healed per mana on the sells<br />
Tnargs- 2.9<br />
Supernal remedy- 3.625<br />
Supernal light- 4.6<br />
Holy light- 4.62 (5.0 on test)<br />
Obviously it costs shaman ALOT more mana to heal every hp of dmg.<br />
<br />
Now hps healed per second<br />
tnargs- 260hpss<br />
supernal remedy- 828hpps<br />
Supernal light- 733hpps<br />
Holy light- 813hpps (866hpps on test)<br />
Clerics obviously heal in ALOT less time.<br />
<br />
Ok so shaman take significantly longer to heal any given amount of damage, we are significantly less efficient at doing so and the reason it's ok is because we then get to spend what remaining free time we have canning so that we have the mana to keep healing?<br />
<br />
Yes I know we can slow but that takes time, mana and is increasingly less effective as mobs mitigate more or just become flat out immune and hardley limited to shaman and we aren't even substantially better at slowing than other classes. Now by no means am I asking to be equal to a cleric in healing abilities or even a druid but there has to come a point when people realize that we are too far behind in every aspect of healing to be an effective healer.<br />
<br />
I won't even look at our ICH spell cause it's just to sad to even consider spending the effort on showing that. Every shaman out there knows it already.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just for laughs, if you want to call it that, lets look at light of order a pally's top heal.<br />
Light of order<br />
935hps healed in 1 second for 440 mana (1000hps for 400 on test currently)<br />
Thats 2.125 hps per mana, actually less than shaman but 935hpps, significantly better than shaman. So a paladin is a bit less efficient, a bit lower amount healed but significantly quicker healing. The current version on test pushes it up to 2.5 hps per mana and 1000 healed closing the gaps on both area where they where behind shaman.<br />
<br />
Everyone remember we have slow and cann so it's ok that paladin's heal almost as well as us in 2 out of 3 aspects and significantly better in the third.</div></div><hr />

Banuddar,<br />
I see what you are saying.  honestly i do.  there are many places i can fit in as healer and get away with it.  Anyone that says our heal is worthless is out of their damn minds...i have saved tanks on about every major raid encounter we have done thus far using a nicely time quick heal when the clerics forget how to count.  <br />
however, i slow groups down when i play healer (in EP+ situations), and we live on the edge a lot.  a few bad rounds and the tank is toast...  we have near zero room for error if we play healer, and in many cases, which have become farm more prevelent, we don't have the healing power to play healer.<br />
Corbane's &quot;blue rapist&quot; pic gently reminds us how prevelent mobs are that can /pwn our group if we are the only healers.  (especially with mobs that don't slow or have heavy midigation.)<br />
<br />
even keeping tanks healed against some ep trash is tough to hard.  Our ability to keep tanks alive against some trash in GoD has turned out to be hard to get your lucky rabits foot out before you roll the dice...<br />
i am not saying we can't heal against some mobs, i am saying the situation with our healing ability has become dire for those who don't XPing with the guild's MT (but instead chose the third tank).<br />
<br />
to be honest i would be perfectly fine if SOE put in a shaman heal that covers a half a round of attack against from god mobs instead of a heal that covers 1/4 a round of attack...it would allow us the slight safety net we are looking for (the same small safety net we had in PoP).</div></div><hr />

They should be able to, and they should be able to do it significantly better.<br />
<br />
You know what the difference between a cleric spamming SLs and a shaman spamming tnargs is?<br />
<br />
The difference is that a cleric doesn't need to chain cast SL's when a shaman is chain casting Tnarg's. Since they both have the same cast time and SL heals over twice as much a cleric only needs to cast if half as much and the end up spending less mana to sustain it. Sure while the shaman has blown 6k mana keeping the tank up the cleric has only spent 4k. If you step it up to holy light it just gets worse. Five shaman heals to every two cleric heals. Shaman spending 2250 mana to a clerics 1320. Not to mention what happens when the cleric does actually need to chain cast SL. If you had a shaman healer your tank is dead no question about it. You can't just compair a shaman chain casting heals to a cleric chain casting heals and say well the shaman will can his mana back faster so it's ok. Simply put if a shaman is chain casting Tnargs a cleric is casting a Holy light every 10-15 seconds and if a cleric is chain casting Holy light or supernal then the shaman isn't casting for long since thier tank is quickly died, promptly followed by the shaman.<br />
<br />
I even said I didn't expect to be an equal to a cleric but when a cleric is 60% more efficient with his heals and can heal at over 3 times the rate that a shaman can yes there is something wrong (thats pre Holy light improvements on test). Thats not even touching the instacast Divine arb and group Hot combo that a cleric can use to get threw a situation no other healer could.<br />
<br />
Honestly I can live with the efficiency difference more than I can the rate. Even with max benificial spell haste tnarg's isn't big enough or fast enough to effectively heal most of todays content. It doesn't matter how efficient or inefficient your heals are if you can't keep a tank up. Personally I'd be more than happy with a 1750+ base heal with a slightly better efficiency. Call it tnarg's big bandaid. 1750hps healed, 3.75 cast time and 540 mana. Druids and clerics would still have a noticable edge and but shaman would not be so pitifully far behind. 3.2 hps per mana and 466hpps on the new shaman heal. Still well bellow a cleric or even a druid (sylvan infusion is 3.5 hps per mana and 550hpss currently, 3.8 hps per mana and 560 hpss on test)<br />
<br />
<br />
At the end of the fight, the cleric needs 5 minutes to med, and I'm ready to go in 30 seconds.<br />
<br />
THAT is my point.<br />
We're both shaman here so lets be honest. You and I both know that theres no way that any shaman with any sort of mana pool is ready to go in 30 seconds from oom, much less FM. 30 seconds is enough for a cann v, a q and about 4 casts of cann 4. Thats 1394 mana minus the cost of torpor, we'll say 150 after some mana savings, so ~1250 mana. Thats a hair over a bubble of mana for me and probably 3 casts of tnargs max. That isn't ready to go by any means.<br />
<br />
There's no question that a shaman would go from oom to fm quicker than a cleric with the same buffs but you can't convienently forget that the shaman has had to spend 60% more mana than the cleric. So lets assume that they both have the same mana pool the cleric is at about 40% instead of oom. Odds are you'll both be fm at about the same time depending on buffs of corse.<br />
<br />
If you assume a 6k mana pool for both, 100 mana a tick passive regen (about right for raid buffs on a horse with ft 15) and call cann 4 50 mana a tick to account for time and mana lost casting q to heal it. It would take the cleric 3 3/4 minutes to med back to full from 40%, ~3800 mana spent to our 6k, and 4 minutes for the shaman to cann back up with out cann 5 and about 3 minutes with cann v used.</div></div><hr />

Truly you have a dizzying intellect sir. I cant believe with statements like &quot; i think you are all under estimating the power of cannabilize&quot; and &quot;  I can't even take a second to pause and hit canni V &quot; that you have a full understanding of the point of our distress. BTW, i do say OUR distress cause if you look around you dont have alot of backing in this thread which helps me to belive you either are blinded by the drive to be right or your simply not listening. But thats my opinion and it could be wrong...<br />
<br />
In one statment your talking about having to chain cast tnargs so much that you cant even can5, but then once its brought up that its a bad sign, suddenly you have time to cast it ? I think maybe your just missing the point in general so let me spell it out.<br />
<br />
<br />
Its fine that you can heal trash mobs in low end GoD content, but thats NOT the arguement. The argument is that since the dawn of time we have been a viable option as a MAIN HEALER.  Not only is this becoming less and less a option but beyond that it is looking like a trend of things to come, does it not?<br />
<br />
<br />
Shaman since the dawn the start were right with druids on healing, we were not as good as clerics but where a  suitable second and a true preist class. Now we are 3rd rate healers, significantly behind druids not far above a pally to boot, we can no longer ATM be a viable main healer for all available content. Period.  There is many places where a druid as the main healer is plenty sufficent, but a shaman would be foolish. <br />
<br />
<br />
 I know this probably doesnt help you see anything clearer, but atleast its infront of you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u92"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p92">For named fights, you're gonna have to spam.  Obviously, for this, clerics and druids are the superior choice, I'm not debating that.  However, my point IS that my heals DO make a big difference on those fights, even if not as much as a cleric's would.  Shaman are great healers over the long term, but not so much for short term healing, which makes sense, considering all the other stuff we can do.<br />
What is this 'other stuff' we can do again? Is it more then snare, evac, stun, harmony, track, charm? Is it more then rez, pacify, stun, Divine intervention?<br />
<br />
Henora- in named fights, my mana comes from my base.  The reason I don't canni 5 is because there's really no need to, since I never run out of mana on those fights anyway.  If mana was an issue for me, I'd hit canni 5 and hope the tank held up, but under the circumstances there was no point.<br />
And every time you have no time to cannibalize a druid/cleric would have outhealed you while providing better buffs and lessened the need for healing by using harmony/pacify.<br />
<br />
veeshanMurtak- Yep, the yellow cons can suck if slow resists, but in a group where I'm gonna be main healer I'll have a bard pulling so it won't resist anyway.<br />
I like those bards that magically make MOBs not resist anything.<br />
<br />
And in the case that it does resist, it's not gonna be much easier for a druid or a lot of the time a cleric to keep up alone.<br />
If you think twice as much healing (druid) is not going to help, how about supernal remedy, holy light, divine intervention and divine arbitration? Are you seriously saying that these spells would not help?<br />
<br />
Another healer is always preferable, i'm just making the point that it's doable if you know how.<br />
Especially in Ikkinz, eh? I see how one might get away with a shaman healing in Vxed, given a very beefy tank and someone pulling only singles, as long as you avoid nameds. But I cannot see a shaman healing on the tipt boss and much less on the things in Ikkinz.<br />
<br />
In regards to what you said about needing to chainheal not being an upside... if you weren't aware, on the tough named fights, ALL healers have to chain heal, not just the shaman.<br />
Well, apart from the fact that you can keep up a warrior with CH + shaman/druid spam heal on Ikkinz nameds - If all we do is chaincast our spot heal the druid and cleric will heal much much much more then us. In fact, to replace a shaman a cleric could chain CH instead and put out the same healing per second.<br />
<br />
You just can't keep up with DPS otherwise, unless you have a ton of healers or one extremely strong tank.<br />
Clerics having to chain holy light does not make shaman heals look better.<br />
<br />
It is possible to keep up with heals over a long term for these things, if you have the right gear and a good tank.  You don't have to spam your heal, as some of you seem to think -- it's not going to get in max rounds every time (in fact, except on the high conning stuff, most of it very rarely gets in really large rounds).  With quiescence or trushar going all the time, and heals when necessary, it is not hard to keep up with healing and not run out of mana.  And don't tell me you can't do that, because I can, and do, regularly.<br />
Thats nice, and a cleric could do so with a third of the mana, heal ten times better in emergencies and still have mana left over for nuking.<br />
<br />
The problem with cheals in GoD is the variability of damage.  In kod taz, for instance, some areas are full of casters.  This means that the damage is either none (while they are casting), or a lot.  As a result, it is difficult to judge when the tank is going to need heals with enough precision to make it nearly as simple as shaman healing.  Obviously, someone who has played a cleric for a long time will have an easier time of estimating this, but it really is difficult, which is why secondary healers are usually preferable in GoD (which shaman does very well, might I add).<br />
Well, if you are saying a botted shaman is better then a botted cleric, provided you refuse to pay any attention to him . . . *shrugs* I guess you might be right, but that hardly affects class balance. I am pretty sure an afk bard is better then an afk warrior too.<br />
<br />
It seems like a lot of you are underestimating the value of cannibalize.  It makes SUCH a huge difference in mana regen, and although you can't always canni IV mid fight if you have to heal (though you can, if you time it right), there are plenty of opportunities to use it to improve mana regen.<br />
In fights that last 20 seconds total, with a good puller, I do indeed have trouble finding time to cannibalize. I have trouble to get rid of my mana, but so does everyone else, and given near limitless mana cannibalize is worthless. About the only way a cleric runs out of mana anymore is chain emergency heals and groups heals - circumstances where a shaman will just have to let people die instead.<br />
<br />
Clerics are always going to have an easier time keeping up with heals than shaman if there is a shaman slowing, but my point is that the shaman CAN do it.<br />
Actually a cleric heals better on unslowed MOBs then a shaman does when he has to slow himself.<br />
<br />
And i'd guess we're about equal with druids in terms of keeping up with heals over time, though I haven't grouped with any druid healers in GoD so I haven't had a chance to see.<br />
So, given that all priests should have the same desirability in groups, where is our edge? Clerics just outheal us left and right, druids outheal us when it counts and are equal otherwise. I am not content with being tied for second best under ideal circumstances and being dead last after paladins in the worst case.<br />
<br />
Sariss- It's not as hard as you think, with a few exceptions (like certain mobs in Vxed/Tipt, and the yellows in Kod Taz).  Multi pulls do suck, and obviously a secondary healer is preferable for that, but a lone druid or cleric will have the same types of problems if you don't have a good puller or mezzer (though admittedly to a lesser extent- shaman aren't meant to be the best for these types of situations).<br />
And how exactly do group heals, divine arbitration and divine inervention not help on multi pulls, not to mention vastly better heals?<br />
<br />
Gwaeron- GoD trial named are just difficult.  I haven't encountered any yet, with the exception of the final Ikkinz mob, that is not doable with a cleric + shaman healing, though.<br />
Is this the same expedition you were the slower and only healer in?<br />
<br />
I'm not saying that shaman are the best healers.  In almost all situations, druids or clerics are preferable for it.  HOWEVER, what I am saying, is that in the current stage EQ, if appropriately geared, a shaman can function just fine as a healer, and is the perfect choice for a backup healer for a group (a shaman is much easier to incorporate into a group than a druid is).<br />
How the heck are shaman easier to incorporate into a group? Are we more likeable?<br />
<br />
I'm not saying a better heal upgrade would be out of line, I'm just saying that our healing abilities are not as gimped as many of you seem to believe.<br />
Or maybe we are not content with healing as well as paladins, as you seem to be.<br />
<br />
Once priests were rebalanced under the premise that &quot;all priests should have equal desirability in groups, raids and soloing&quot;. Well, soloing is still unbalanced but grouping experience is a lot better now and clerics seem to have quit complaining about soloing. Could be better I guess.<br />
Shaman now have one thing to bring to a group, slow, which is mitigated way too often. We also stack horribly on raids. All we want is to be balanced, and I prefer not be known as a priest with palading healing, beastlord slowing and ranger buffs.<br />
<br />
Are you seriously trying to tell me that it's a bad thing that clerics can heal more per second than shaman can?  They should be able to, and they should be able to do it significantly better.<br />
<br />
You know what the difference between a cleric spamming SLs and a shaman spamming tnargs is?<br />
<br />
At the end of the fight, the cleric needs 5 minutes to med, and I'm ready to go in 30 seconds.<br />
<br />
THAT is my point.<br />
And my point is, the cleric healed 5 times as much as you, he deserves his med time. Without the cleric you would have died 5 seconds into the fight, without the shaman you might well have won anyways. Especially if you subbed in a paladin. Heck a Mage with a stunning pet would probably have made up for shaman healing nicely.<br />
You say &quot;hey, i healed for 2 minutes straight and now look how fast I get that mana back.&quot;. I say &quot;You healed for 2 minutes straight and are still not matching the cleric's 20 seconds of healing.&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There was a similar situation that arose where I was grouped with a druid, who died on the pull of one of these golems, and I was able to keep one of our better warriors alive, but chaining tnargs his HP didn't move up, it stayed where it was and fluctuated some. If I had been able to toss in a quiescence that would have averaged more HP per second overall, but I couldn't afford the lapse in spam heals to cast it.<br />
<br />
Tnarg's is just not sufficient for this sh*t. We need something around the lines of a 1750 heal for 525 or so mana. The ability to slow means absolute jack when I'm trying to heal on raids, and how can cannibalize be an advantage when I have zero time to actually cast the spell?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can't discount the value of replacing a healer with another DPS class.  The faster a mob is dieing the less total damage it is doing.  Going from three DPS to four DPS classes means that each mob is doing 30% total less damage.  So it is very easy for Banuddar to see that he is doing OK as the only healer in a group, especially with slow.<br />
<br />
On the other hand this observation has nothing to do with the fact that if he had been replaced with a druid/cleric the group would have been probably been better off if there was a different slowing class (Bard, Enchanter, Beastlord) in the group.<br />
<br />
Another way to put this is assuming that there is a healer in the group already, I would suggest that replacing the shaman in a group with another dps character would improve your group's performance in Gates trials and zones.  This might work because mobs are dieing significantly faster than they would have if you had the Shaman in the group.  Anecdotally my guild's A-team 6 man group was composed of CLR, BRD, PAL, ROG, ROG, ROG.  This group composition was able to defeat all the trials in Kod'Taz within a week of Gates release.  I just don't see how replacing one of the Rogues or the Bard with a shaman would have helped improve on this group.<br />
<br />
Our healing is almost so marginal that replacing us with a melee might very well be a good idea for many groups irrespective of the loss of backup healing for the group.</div></div><hr />

On the other hand this observation has nothing to do with the fact that if he had been replaced with a druid/cleric the group would have been probably been better off if there was a different slowing class (Bard, Enchanter, Beastlord) in the group.<br />
However shaman do not benefit from shorter fight times at all - unless each single MOB lives at the very least a minute a cleric will heal better then a shaman, without having someone to slow. If the group contains a slower a druid will heal better then a shaman, do more damage and give the group more mana regeneration. Accelerating the kill rate harms the shaman in a way, since the mana spend to slow each MOB stays the same, but the slows per minute go up and the average MOB DPS goes up (since the MOB spends less time slowed).<br />
<br />
The only way for a shaman to outheal a cleric is to be the only slower and to fight a non-mitigating MOB and to have the fight run several minutes and to have the MOB DPS be low enough to not have the tank die in case of a slow resist, in which case a cleric could keep up in the first place.<br />
<br />
With our current spell set there is not one situation in which we could heal where a cleric could not.<br />
<br />
There are situations, though rare, where we can contribute adequately, by slowing, tossing the occasional heal and still do some damage, but even those are becoming more and more rare each expansion.<br />
But as is, we cannot outheal a cleric even in the most favorable circumstances, not even factoring in slow.</div></div><hr />

I agree with you completely.   <br />
<br />
I was just trying to account for Banuddar's observation that he was doing OK in as an only healer in a Gates group.  Though he was probably just getting by, not being particularly efficient nor exceptionally fast.<br />
<br />
One thing in your analysis is that you have to account for tank hps and mitigation.  If a tank can live through that fight with a low chance of dieing especially if the mob is slowed before it is actually engaged a shaman can actually work because they can heal up the tank inbetween fights.<br />
<br />
The problem is that THIS isn't a good situation because the minute you are replaced by a druid or cleric the group is much better off because of their efficiency.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u101"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p101">Just another thought:<br />
<br />
Shaman strengths are slow, decent DoTs, decent heals, good mana regeneration.<br />
So shaman should be good in two kinds of encounters - long fights, where our mana regeneration shines, but only if the fighting is not too intense, so we have a chance to actually cannibalize. And we should be good in any encounter involving heavy hitting slowable MOBs.<br />
<br />
So far this entire expansion should have SHAMAN ROCK written in bold letters above every zonein. With the exception of a couple nameds everything is slowable, adventures take a long amount of time, making our mana regenration stand out, depending on group makeup we can even use DoTs. This entire expansion favors shaman. The very zone design caters to shaman strengths.<br />
<br />
Yet we have issues. Huge issues. In an expansion where we should shine. How will we do in an expansion featuring MOBs who do most of their damage via spells? How will do in an expansion with more slow mitigation? How will we do in an expansion where you have MOBs that need to be nuked down as fast as possible?<br />
<br />
If we do not feel like we do well in an expansion that plays to our strengths, how can we be balanced?</div></div><hr />

That was a rude awakening.  I had barely experienced slow mitigation other than BoT named and on some mobs in Tactics.  In LDoN normals, the only healer in the group is me (on 2nd box no less), and half the time I don't bother to slow but just chain velium strike, it's not like my sk is getting hurt, and if she is, go go lifetaps.  <br />
<br />
LDoN hards are another story- even slowed the tank is taking the asskicking of a lifetime.  Slowed or not, Tnargs hasn't a prayer of keeping up, I'm relying on crit lifetap heals or it's game over.  Even as is I had to harmshield multiple times to save a death.  I didn't bother to buy GoD as it holds nothing for players like me, but if it's worse than LDoN hards (which it sounds like), I think I've reached the limit on my shaman.  <br />
<br />
As it stands now, after talking to my friends I'm only going to be playing my shaman on LDoN normals and borrow another friend's 65 cleric for the hards (still on 2nd box).  Cheal, awesome fast heals, rez, divine intervention, bulwark of vie, etc... allow even a bazaar sk to tank reasonably well.  Slow will be handled by the enchanter henceforth- what does 5% difference matter when all mobs mitigate anyways?  I'll just Fo7 the group before the adv and call it good.<br />
<br />
I guess my rambling point is I can't believe I've hit the end of the road on my shaman as a bazaar player, I honestly thought this day would never come since we don't raid and normally he's a great addition to the group. :(<br />

However, my point IS that my heals DO make a big difference on those fights, even if not as much as a cleric's would.

<br />
&quot;Shaman are great healers over the long term, but not so much for short term healing, which makes sense, considering all the other stuff we can do.&quot;<br />
<br />
What other stuff do we do?  If a group asks a shaman in, it’s for slow and heal.  There is nothing else that a shaman can do that more than half of the rest of the character classes can do.  WE DO NOT have any great &quot;utility&quot; gap compared to most other classes.  Other classes can also root park.  Many other classes can lev, invis, cast EB, or what ever else is this &quot;utility&quot; stuff that some would hold shaman are the master of.  <br />
<br />
There is however a reason why shaman are doing this &quot;other stuff&quot;.  Its because we are becoming unable to fulfill our two main roles, and have a hard time adding any meaningful DPS.  Maybe I was not clear enough with my Batman and Robin analogy. If a mob mitigates slow, or resists it twice, then we are dead weight on the group.  We might as well be the designated root parker, because a wizard or a ranger or a druid root parking is a loss of DPS to the group.  If we root park its not a dps loss.<br />
<br />
You have hit the nail on the head Banuddar when you wrote that we are good in the long term, but not the short term.  I’d say this is true not just for healing, but everything we do.  If I can slow a mob and load dots on it, and then root the mob, or drag the fight out for a long time with qui, I can do a lot of damage.  This is the situation where shamans really shine.  Long term, with canni and qui, I do have a better manna regen than most any class.  However this perceived long term superiority is meaningless if in the sort term my party is wiped because we do not have enough dps to kill a mob quickly.  If I cannot use a long-term advantage because I die in the short tem, is there a real advantage?  EQ is becoming faster and faster paced.  This fast pace makes me useless.  If I have to chain tnargs I have no great utility.  I cannot slow a mob if I am chaining tnargs.  I cannot root park, or hit canni V.  I can’t get a slow casting damage spell off.  Truth be known I have far less “utility” than either a druid or a cleric, because both of them are more capable at healing and adding DPS.</div></div><hr />

As a memebr of a small &quot;family&quot; guild, it was hard Ldons that made me understand what all the uber shaman were complaining about.<br />
<br />
The whole modern shaman is built on the idea that we can canni and slow, to the point were we get poor quality heals and damage spells to make up for our superiority with slows and canni.  It seems pretty obvious to me what is going to happen to the shaman class when you put then in a fast paced situation where most things mitigate slow, and shamans do not have a chance to canni.<br />
<br />
In reality I do not even mind the fact that it cost me more manna per hp of healing done or damage done.  But when this is coupled with the fact that my damage per second and heal per second is also poor, so I can not take the time to canni to make up for the manna ineficency. . .  well all I can say is boy I can't wait till I get paragon for my BL :-)<br />
<br />
If there were new zones where the superior healing of clerics and druids were consistently mitigated, Druids and Clerics would start to get concerned (well maybe not druids, but if druids could not kite in these zones as well, it might bother them).<br />

<br />
Yes, and if they remove mitigated slow and increase my max slow percentage to where it is SIGNIFICANTLY better than a chanter's, bard's, or beastlord's, I will stop complaining.  Until then... slows were useful because they WERE heals... they prevented damage to the tank.  By thius stupid slow mitigation, Sony has made us worse &quot;healers&quot; without providing a heal spell to make up for it.<br />
<br />
We are equal to druids on heals until the early 50s.  Make us equal to them throughout, or fix the slow situation.  No one wants me in a group but they want 2 clerics for each Kodtaz trial.  That pretty well sucks.</div></div><hr />

So far this entire expansion should have SHAMAN ROCK written in bold letters above every zonein.<br />
<br />
Actually the sign should probably read BEASTLORDS ROCK.  <br />
<br />
I play a 65 shaman, 65 enchanter, and 65 beastlord (all from level 1, no powerleveling -- so I have some perspective on the differences between these 3 classes) -- and the beastlord is by far the best suited to GoD despite having the weakest gear and the least AA of my three characters.  The beastlord slows faster, can generally avoid more damage, provides excellent mana regen, provides essentially equivalent HP buffs and stat buffs to a shaman, and provides huge DPS to offset the slight difference in slow percentage.  The only thing the beastlord cannot do is heal, and root -- and of those two, the only thing the shaman CAN do to any useful degree is root.  <br />
<br />
The enchanter is a close second; better mana regen, better haste, PACIFY, better crowd control, theoretically charm though I haven't charmed yet in GoD, along with fun illusions that people really seem to like for some strange reason.  <br />
<br />
I guess the point I'm making is that when I play my beastlord or enchanter in these groups, I feel like a contributor.  When I play my shaman, I feel inadequate -- just along for the ride.  The reason for that lies in the general neglect of the shaman class, I feel.  I wish that werent the case -- my shaman is my main, after all.  Unfortunately with things being the way they are, my enchanter and beastlord have been seeing the light of day more and more often (ie: all the time that I'm not raiding).<br />
<br />
Sony has decided that shaman need nothing.  I disagree.  Since they write the game, though, and don't much care what we as a community think (hello Brenlo the Uninterested) it seems pretty clear that we are simply expected to live with things the way they are or spend our time in other ways.  I'll spend my time in other ways --- my enchanter needs some AA anyway, and theres a really cool pet summoning augment I can get for my beastlord that will give him a stronger pet.</div></div><hr />

Just curious, did the chanter that died actually tash the mob?  And if so, why would you consider that any different than if a shaman had malosed and then landed slow.  Oh, and if the beastlord did land slow after the seventh try, considering the casting time difference between ours and theres, and the fact that we have to malos to start, that 7 times would have lasted the same duration as if the shaman would have had only ONE resist.

<br />
EVERY GoD trials group needs a slower.<br />
EVERY GoD trials group benefits greatly from a secondary healer.<br />
DPS is easily replacable.<br />
<br />
Druids are, for the most part heals + DPS.  Yes, they can do other things, but so can shaman, and those two are the main reasons to get a druid.  Shaman are heals + slows (and can do DPS that is similar to a druid if necessary).<br />
<br />
Shaman are the only class that can fill the roles of slower + backup healer in an experience group.  As a result, except for big named fights, shaman are almost ALWAYS preferable to a druid.  Druids need a significant advantage in heal speed to have the desirability of a shaman for a group.<br />
<br />
And I don't really care if you believe me or not that a shaman can heal the trials.  I'm not saying it's fun, or desirable, or preferable, but it is doable.  I don't go into trials without a cleric, but when the cleric needs to afk, or if the cleric dies, I have no problems keeping my group up for extended periods of time.<br />
<br />
By &quot;stuff,&quot; i'm referring mainly to slow, but also our far superior mana regen, haste, malos, etc.  Yes, druids can do some other things in addition to healing also, but saying that they are anywhere near as useful as slow is just a joke.<br />
<br />
You guys can complain all you want, but the bottom line is that our abilities to slow, as well as our decent healing abilities make us very desirable for groups.  Being able to fill two vital roles in one spot makes us extremely easy to incorporate into a group setting, and it's no coincidence that I've been highly sought out for trial groups since the beginning of GoD, while other, more one-sided classes (like druids, and just about any DPS) are so easily replacable that they are not most people's top choices.  Yeah, clerics are highly sought out too, but EQ has always revolved around clerics, so it's a little late to be unhappy about that now.<br />
<br />
Edit: BTW, I never claimed to be able to heal for entire trials.  I said I could heal for the TRASH on the trials.  For the named, you're gonna need a cleric, but even clerics usually have trouble solo healing for the really tough named.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u120"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p120">beastlords can't slow for **** in this expansion.  Why.. unless they have someone in the group debuffing the mobs mr, they have a tough time slowing.<br />
<br />
Actually, not really.  Since I play both, I think I can safely say (without visiting another class forum) that I have had very little difficulty slowing with my beastlord.   As with evreything, though, its a question of situation.  In LDoN (easy or hard) the beastlord is a wonderful character.  It is, honestly, easier and faster to slow with the Beastlord.  You do not need someone else to debuff the mobs for you in advance.  In GoD, I've had little trouble but I've only done trial #1 with my beastlord so its hard to say how likely I would be to expereince problems later on.  I will agree that life is significantly easier if you have an enchanter, bard, or mage in the group (they all have debuffs) but they are by no means a necessity. <br />
<br />
Regarding your group wiping, there may have been many factors involved.  Maybe the enchanter did or did not tash, maybe the beastlord had an unlucky streak with the RNG, maybe that particular mob had very high resists...  there are alot of factors.  If you had an enchanter, though -- and the enchanter was on his game -- then that slow should have landed fairly easily.  Howl of Tashan is, after all, -50 to MR.  <br />
<br />
I think the new slow (balance of the nihil) does open the gap between shaman and enchaters as slowers, and improves slightly on shaman vs. beastlords, but in the end both of those classes really bring alot to the table that a shaman does not.<br />
<br />
What we need as a class has been discussed to death -- sony doesn't care.  They have their idea, and they're not even remotely interested in our ideas (though I'm sure Brenlo will be more than happy to say &quot;thanks for the feedback, we're very interested in your ideas&quot;).  Ultimately, I think the shaman class is reaching the point where people just arent interested in playing it that much anymore.  I see alot of shaman leaving the game, or switching classes.  I can't really blame them.  I love playing my shaman on raids -- you get to do important stuff and really help out.  Outside of raids though?  I feel pretty worthless outside of raids; there are plenty of other classes that can do my role almost as well as me, but they can also fill other roles really well.  <br />
<br />
Theres a role for shaman out there; though -- its the role where you build your own LDoN group and mow through.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, whatI want for the shaman class is to be able to do something unique.  Something that other classes can't do, or can't do as well.  It doesnt need to be healing, or nuking, or DoTing, or any of the standard stuff.  How about curses?  Let me make it so that mobs miss more frequently, or hit for less.  Or give me enhancement buffs that let me increase a players chance to hit, or dodge, or SOMETHING.</div></div><hr />

Just an idle point, but I think that snare, evac, protection of the 9, spirit of the wood, and large, hard to resist, and fast nukes are worth alot more than you realize.  Lets not short-change the druids, here -- they have an exceptional set of utility functions quite seperate from their role as a healer.<br />
<br />
I don't think anyone is arguing that you would prefer a druid over a shaman in a group with no slower, though.  If you had another slower, though, like an enchanter or a beastlord, you might want to consider the druid.  I would be willing to live with slightly less efficient or reliable slows to gain all those other abilities.  Wouldn't you?</div></div><hr />

EVERY GoD trials group needs a slower.<br />
EVERY GoD trials group benefits greatly from a secondary healer.<br />
DPS is easily replacable.<br />
<br />
Druids are, for the most part heals + DPS.  Yes, they can do other things, but so can shaman, and those two are the main reasons to get a druid.  Shaman are heals + slows (and can do DPS that is similar to a druid if necessary).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I really can't get past this paragraph.<br />
<br />
You've not grouped with a mage and a druid at the same time have you Banuddar?<br />
<br />
Shamans are nowhere near the DPS of a druid.<br />
<br />
All I can think is you don't know how much DPS druids are capable of.  I've seen the druid in my guild get lucky and out nuke the mage.  I know most people underestimate druids.  We are nowhere near the DPS of a druid.  Sure over a long time Shaman can stack dots and do a lot of damage, but that is not damage per second now is it?  <br />
<br />
Check out the mage tower page.  There is a reason why mages claim druids nuke too much.  Its because druids can hit hard and fast if they want to.  Unlike Shaman who nuke slow and hit like kitens.  Or rain posiosn, only to see 2/3's of it resisted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u125"><b>Banuddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p125">Going without a slower is like going without a cleric... it's doable, but really, really hard.  There is almost no circumstance where a group would take a druid over a shaman if the group had no slower.<br />
<br />
And Tormac, again, you're underestimating shaman mana regen.  Yeah, they can do more burst damage than we can.  Over the long term though, we can sustain pretty good damage consistantly (and don't try to get into the passive vs active argument, because shaman can get the same passive mana regen too if that's really an issue).  I never said we'd be able to match a druid, just that we'd be able to do damage in a similar ballpark, assuming that was our main role in the group.<br />

My point was, to have tash and BST slow, you need BOTH a chanter and BST.  To land Malos and 75% slow, you only need a shaman.  And, if the shaman has Balance of Nihil, he is adding a -40 MR check on top of the -55 Malos does.  Not even the combo of chanter and BST can do that.  So, my point, is that a shaman is the best class for reliably landing slow, period.  <br />
<br />
Cast times may be a factor, but with spell haste and aa's, the spell casting time difference is not that great, a factor, but not overwhelming.  If I have to have slow land reliably, I'll get a shaman.  If I can do with less dependable slow because I want more dps, then I'll call a BST.<br />

<br />
All I can think is you don't know how much DPS druids are capable of.<br />
<br />
This is totally true.  Even if you force druids to do DPS the same way a shaman would, probably gimping him quite a bit, a druid going all out burn with rains and nukes can do 253 dps versus 178 for shamans (not including focus items, specializations, fizzles, or crits) over a 1 minute fight.<br />
<br />
Shaman could cast malos + 3 tears of saryrn + 3 torrent of poison, where the druid with shorter casting times and no need for malos because his best rain has a built in -50 resist adjust could cast 3 winter's storm + 3 blizzard + 2 winter's frost.  And I'm fairly sure a druid could actually do better than that if he ditched the second rain and just used more single target nukes.<br />
<br />
If we're talking &quot;sustainable dps&quot;, the difference is admittedly less, but druid is at least 30% better dps than shamans at full burn.</div></div><hr />

/shrug, I guess because I disagree with the masses, that makes me clueless.<br />
<br />
I honestly haven't posted anything here that hasn't been backed up by my own, personal experiences.  Most of the posts that are going against me are based on theoretical data, rather than actually putting it into practice.  Remember how many people got so angry at Thott because of the theoretical data he posted that made shaman look like some sort of &quot;God&quot; class?  Realize it or not, this is exactly what the majority of you are doing, except with the opposite goal-- to make shaman seem worthless.  Obviously, if you only look at specific factors, it's easy to make it seem like a class is horribly off.  The problem though is, that there are just far too many factors to take into account.  These theoretical calculations are essentially meaningless, simply because of the complexity of the various situations.<br />
<br />
As a result, all that really makes a difference is what happens when you put it into practice, which is what I am basing my observations on.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u138"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p138">EVERY GoD trials group needs a slower.<br />
Why? You need enough healing and damage mitigation to get by the MOBs. Slow is just one of the ways. Pacify, FD, Mez, Stuns, more DPS and straight healing power are other ways.<br />
<br />
DPS is easily replacable.<br />
How? By adding more DPS classes. You can make up for healing with more damage, you can make up for less damage with more healing. This goes both ways.<br />
<br />
Druids are, for the most part heals + DPS.  Yes, they can do other things, but so can shaman, and those two are the main reasons to get a druid.  Shaman are heals + slows (and can do DPS that is similar to a druid if necessary).<br />
Shaman do not out DPS druids. Also in a lot of situations harmony will prevent more damage then slow will ever mitigate.<br />
<br />
Shaman are the only class that can fill the roles of slower + backup healer in an experience group.<br />
As we are the only class that can both cast slow and heal . . . yes. Necros are the only class that can rez and FD. Warriors are the only class that can /disc defensive.<br />
<br />
As a result, except for big named fights, shaman are almost ALWAYS preferable to a druid.  Druids need a significant advantage in heal speed to have the desirability of a shaman for a group.<br />
So in a group that does not have a slower and also needs an additional healer I might be preferable to a Druid on part of the MOBs. Nice. Of course another Cleric would outheal me by so large an amount as to make slow completely unnecessary.<br />
<br />
And I don't really care if you believe me or not that a shaman can heal the trials.  I'm not saying it's fun, or desirable, or preferable, but it is doable.  I don't go into trials without a cleric, but when the cleric needs to afk, or if the cleric dies, I have no problems keeping my group up for extended periods of time.<br />
I do not like to be balanced on the premise that the Cleric will be afk.<br />
<br />
By &quot;stuff,&quot; i'm referring mainly to slow, but also our far superior mana regen, haste, malos, etc.  Yes, druids can do some other things in addition to healing also, but saying that they are anywhere near as useful as slow is just a joke.<br />
Harmony. Evac. Snare. Stun. 9.<br />
<br />
You guys can complain all you want, but the bottom line is that our abilities to slow, as well as our decent healing abilities make us very desirable for groups. Being able to fill two vital roles in one spot makes us extremely easy to incorporate into a group setting<br />
We have one real ability, slow. Our heals are in the same tier a Paladin heals, our nukes are in hybrid territory, our DoTs are too slow, too resisted and too much aggro. We get outbuffed by Beastlords.<br />
<br />
BTW, I never claimed to be able to heal for entire trials.  I said I could heal for the TRASH on the trials.  For the named, you're gonna need a cleric, but even clerics usually have trouble solo healing for the really tough named.<br />
Yep, and while your extra 10% healing (cmpared to the cleric) may be  enough to keep the tank alive it does not necessarily mean that you are the key class in that encounter. Odds are a stunning class or mage pet would mitigate more damage then you heal.<br />
<br />
And Tormac, again, you're underestimating shaman mana regen.  Yeah, they can do more burst damage than we can.  Over the long term though, we can sustain pretty good damage consistantly (and don't try to get into the passive vs active argument, because shaman can get the same passive mana regen too if that's really an issue).<br />
Our spells are balanced under them premise that we regen mana several times faster then anyone else. If you do not have time to cannibalize and cast more of our inefficient spells we fall behind. We need that extra time to do our share.<br />
Even if we do somehow manage to get that time we are still off worse. If we can cast spells over a timeframe totalling the same effect as Druid or Cleric (insert other class here) we are balanced in the long run, in the short room however those other classes have the option to unload their mana, both for handling an emergency and to use downtime efficiently.<br />
<br />
A shaman manadumping is just sad - a Wizard or cleric unloading is a lot more noticeable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u139"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p139">The enchanter is a close second; better mana regen, better haste, PACIFY, better crowd control, theoretically charm though I haven't charmed yet in GoD, along with fun illusions that people really seem to like for some strange reason.<br />
Depending on the zone and group makeup charm is unusable, outdamages rogues or outdamages the rest of your group. Charming 1200 hitters that proc 650 DDs is fun. I won't say it is risk-free, but the payoff is in many situations worth including extra people just so the Enchanter can charm.<br />
<br />
My group wiped last night on the tipt final named because the beastlord tried to slow the mob 7 times before it stuck, and got himself and the chanter killed while they attempted it<br />
You do not need slow on that MOB, he mostly mitigates it anyways. Dispel in case of a wandering shaman buffer however is essential.<br />
<br />
Needless to say, whenever I use that warrior in the ikk trials too, the beastlord always takes agro quickly off of me attempting to slow, and they almost never do it first shot.<br />
*shrugs* resists all over GoD are not that bad, Ikkinz or elsewhere. A tad above LDoN possibly. I have not parsed it but on multiple pulls I generally malos, slow the first, slow the second MOB without Malos. I would estimate I do not get more then half resists without Malos. With even a bard pulling with their debuff Malos is hardly necessary to land slow.<br />
<br />
Me, on my shaman and I really don't have a problem slowing mobs in there, it's the backup healing part that affects me.<br />
Oh, noone complains they should slow better - we complain that slow alone does not cut it and we want another role. At this part it does not matter to me if its CC, damage, healing, tanking, whatever.<br />
<br />
Common sense would dictate that in GoD, you don't take a BST for slow, you take him for dps.  Now, if you have a chanter, then yes, in many cases the BST slow will land, however, once again, you are using two slots to do what the shammy can do by himself.  Yeah, we all bring other things to the table, yada, yada, yada.  But when it comes to landing slow reliably, which is vital in many of these zones, there is no doubt that the shammy can do it best.<br />
Actually to land slow reliably you want an enchanter with their slow stick - he takes less time to cast Tash then Malos takes and their stick casts as fast as our stick does.<br />
As to your argument - a Beastlord will need a Bard, Enchanter or Mage to land slow as reliably as a Shaman. If he is content with slowing some MOBs way faster then the Shaman and a few not at all he does not need any support at all. Why all this talk about being able to do stuff on our own anyways? We are buffers and healers. This is a team game and our very class description says we have spells to heal others.<br />
<br />
At any rate, its ONLY in this new expansion that is the case. I can STILL easily be main healer in LDoN normal, can SOMETIMES handle it in LDoN Hard (if theres another slower-debuffer) and I can STILL keep a solid group alive in Fire slowing and healing. None of this changed. <br />
And in any of these casy any other healer would improve group performance.<br />
<br />
Yeah, we arent as good as we were. Yeah, we been getting the short end of the stick for quite a long time. But overall, we don't SUCK.<br />
See above - there are only a handful situations left where the Shaman is the optimal class for the job, such as a melee heavy group without an Enchanter, Beastlord or Bard that already has someone to pull singles.<br />
Sure, we can make do in a lot of situations, but then again you can have an Enchanter tank that Tipt boss with enough clerics.<br />
<br />
and since kunark its come in a stik that peocs it ...<br />
almost all classes useable. sickening<br />

That is the nature of &quot;Backup healer.&quot;  We're the ones that help out, and can take over when necessary.  You're choosing to focus on one specific instance of backup healing.  Notice how i also said in that quote that we help out when the cleric dies.  (you conveniently skipped over that)  Druids fill the same role though, so I don't really understand what you're getting at (druids are never going to be taken over clerics as main healers).<br />
<br />
Harmony. Evac. Snare. Stun. 9. <br />
Right, those would refer to the &quot;other abilities&quot; i was referring to.  None of those can come anywhere near the contributions that slow makes for a group, though.<br />

I don't really think I need to point out that 10% is an exaggeration.  And no, stuns won't do anywhere near what our heals will.<br />
<br />
Our spells are balanced under them premise that we regen mana several times faster then anyone else. If you do not have time to cannibalize and cast more of our inefficient spells we fall behind. We need that extra time to do our share. <br />
Sure, we've always excelled over the long term, nothing new there.  There are plenty of opportunities to cannibalize during fights, with the exception of named fights (which I agree we aren't as good at).  Also keep in mind that our ancient spell will eliminate this problem for the most part, since we will no longer have to chain canni to have that same amount of regen.<br />
<br />
Some classes are good at mana dumping, some aren't, and never have been, and IMO, shouldn't be.</div></div><hr />

Lets not short-change the druids, here -- they have an exceptional set of utility functions quite seperate from their role as a healer.<br />
<br />
I don't think anyone is arguing that you would prefer a druid over a shaman in a group with no slower, though.  If you had another slower, though, like an enchanter or a beastlord, you might want to consider the druid.  I would be willing to live with slightly less efficient or reliable slows to gain all those other abilities.  Wouldn't you?<br />
<br />
It all depends on the group makeup and what you are doing. If your tank is dropping to 20-30% on every heal cycle, then you need the best slow you can get, even if a BL or chanter is present. Otherwise you are going to lose him sooner or later. The difference in slows has a large effect on the dps of the mob. A tank will take 40% more damage on a BL slowed mob than he would take on a shaman slowed mob for example. That narrows somewhat with mitigation, but you need a high level of mitigation before the differences become insignificant.<br />
<br />
Personally when looking at group composition in places like GoD, I preferr to see as much redundancy as possible in the group, ie 2 healers (preferably more), 2 tanks, 2 CC, 2 snarers, 2 slowers, 2 rezzers etc. If you only have one of those functions, and happen to lose one (which happens all too easily in GoD), you are frequently pretty much pooched. As often as not it means start again from the beginning. I think looking at one class or another as powerful or useless is stupid in the modern game, all bring one or more of those redundancies to the team. You have 6 spots to fill in the group, and ideally one would take a cleric/warrior as the core and then fill up the remaining spots with classes that complement each other in those function.<br />
<br />
Regarding druids, I would say that most groups invite them to be snarers and secondary healers. If they have time to do other things (and they can do other things), thats great, but they need to focus on their two primary functions first. Same deal with shaman, we are invited to groups as front line slowers and as secondary healers. We can do other things but we are not invited to groups for that, and never will be.</div></div><hr />

Using your algorthim, a tank will take *60%* more damage if the SHM uses Nihil instead of Turgurs.  <br />

You would be using Nihil instead of Turgurs when you were expecting resists, or had to slow quickly and didnt have time for malos, so the difference between the two is a non issue. [Slowed mob] &gt;&gt; [Unslowed mob].<br />
<br />
It's not a question of how much mana it's saving a cleric, its a question of whether they can keep up with the dps being done at a particular point in time. In GoD (the stuff I fight anyway, my warrior drops dangerously close to 20% health routinely if the cleric uses CH. That is just not acceptable. Fully raid buffed she is just under 10400hp, on adventures typically around 10k or so depending on what buffs I have at the time. Even relatively small differences in the % slow can have a significant effect on the comfort level for healing.</div></div><hr />

Let me show you a few numbers. On a MOB that mitigates just a little and a group that takes 30 seconds to kill said MOB.<br />
Malos = 4.5 seconds<br />
gem refresh = 2.5 seconds<br />
Slow = 2.5 seconds<br />
Slow percentage = 75% (base) x 0.75 (mitigation = 56%<br />

Which is equivalent to a 38% slow. <br />
<br />
Why do you think it is so hard to make up for a 38% decrease in MOB damage?<br />

And Wizards are the only class that can spellshield and evac, and Druids are the only class that can track and nuke and so on . . every class has a unique combination of abilities.<br />
 <br />
I said shaman would do DPS similar to a druid when necessary.  And harmony really doesn't mean much, since there are so many other classes that can do the same thing just as well (including a cleric, which you'll almost always have.<br />
If by similar you mean half, yep, that might be right.<br />
So a real good ability is not worth taking someone for because other classes have similar abilities? Like, say, slow? And what about track, snare, stuns, evac?<br />
<br />
That is the nature of &quot;Backup healer.&quot;  We're the ones that help out, and can take over when necessary.<br />
I have no chance whatsoever of taking over for a Cleric. I may be able to keep the tank alive for a while but if a Cleric was needed the tank will die sooner or later<br />
<br />
[QUOTE='Banuddar']You're choosing to focus on one specific instance of backup healing.  Notice how i also said in that quote that we help out when the cleric dies.  (you conveniently skipped over that)  Druids fill the same role though, so I don't really understand what you're getting at (druids are never going to be taken over clerics as main healers).<br />
But shaman are taken over clerics as main healers?<br />
 <br />
Right, those would refer to the &quot;other abilities&quot; i was referring to.  None of those can come anywhere near the contributions that slow makes for a group, though.<br />
Harmony is huge. Snare is huge. Stuns are huge. Charm is huge, though I have not yet seen a charming druid as we needed them healing. Does anyone know where and what druids can charm in GoD?<br />
 <br />
I don't really think I need to point out that 10% is an exaggeration.  And no, stuns won't do anywhere near what our heals will.<br />
A mage pet will, if the stuns land, have the MOB stunned for about 15% of the time. Given that a MOB can attack right after the stun wears off the actual mitigation percentage will be a little off, but 10% is a conservative estimate.<br />
<br />
Sure, we've always excelled over the long term, nothing new there.  There are plenty of opportunities to cannibalize during fights, with the exception of named fights (which I agree we aren't as good at).  Also keep in mind that our ancient spell will eliminate this problem for the most part, since we will no longer have to chain canni to have that same amount of regen.<br />
When do we have plenty of time to cannibalize? In the fights I have been in I am constantly casting and so is everyone else. If you do not cast twice as many spells (not counting cannibalize) as everyone else you are not doing your share.<br />
I find that is rarely the case for me. And counting on the ancient spell to fix that seems foolish. I still do not have one of my Luclin ancients and these spells will be just as rare as the devs already confirmed.<br />
<br />
Some classes are good at mana dumping, some aren't, and never have been, and IMO, shouldn't be.<br />
Yes, but if we are worse at mana dumping and just equal in the long run, why take a shaman?</div></div><hr />

Oh and nerfing it while boosting the cleric spell is just classy.  Throw some salt in the wounds and maybe some broken glass too, huh SOE?  I think this has gone on long enough without some comment from Brenlo or a dev.  It makes me furious that they just ignore our concerns.  It's like we are being mocked, we complain that the increase to Breath of Trushar is not enough to fix the current problems, so they nerf back the whole 10 point upgrade and jack up the mana cost by so much.  I just don't know what to say.<br />

Quies = 300 hp for 200 mana (x4) = 6hp per mana.<br />
BoT =  360 hp for 285 mana. (x4) = 5hp per mana.<br />

Shadowknight? A group that needs a tank that can snare.<br />

<br />
I agree we have gotten shafted here, but people are going WAY WAY overboard in these analysis's and equations and picking out 1 or 2 particular instances where we are NOT effective.

<br />

If your primary healer is a Druid, a Shaman can out DPS them pretty easily. Are there better choices for DPS? Sure, but I dont see many Wiz, Rog, Mage with heals and slows. We are about utility. Yeah, there is only ONE thing we do best, and that ONE thing is becoming less and less important in CERTAIN SITUATIONS, but overall, BLs and Chanters cant heal, FA and Malos are still very nice spells in MOST situations, and we can take a punch a lot better than a Chanter.

1)f u c k LDON noone cares. old content and easy to begin with. yea a shaman will do fine there you know i am pretty sure people can do it with a  paladin as only healer.<br />
2) Druid as main healer for god trials? you EVER been past tipt ? serious you have been? then i ask you if you use a druid as primary and a shaman as secondary healer you better have a paladin staying out of combat and unagro to res your pity group when(not IF) they wipe.<br />
there is only one healing class left thats clerics. the other are bandaid at most. there is NO OTHER role being dominated by one class as much as healing is. lots can pull . few can CC . alot can dps. and few can slow. but serious only one can reliable heal. never mind that this class also has best hp buffs ,rez ,DA/DB , DI , Divine ARB (hey thats the single most powerful AA in game) stuns etc.. and we cannot even touch their healing SPELLS ( not factoring in their AAs and other nice stuff) to 60% of their efficiency. our &quot;canabalize advantage&quot; gets totatly destroyed by their efficienz. i know i know now you tell me but we have slow... but just LOOK at their &quot;utility&quot; it puts slow into shame . Divine arb is so much better then slow especialy since you dont even need slow to begin with when mobs die sooo fast like they do in the groups i have been.<br />
so back to the topic no i am not asking for same healing ability then clerics even tho you might even consider that if you factor in all of their stuff. but we and druids should atleast touch their non ch heals  to 80% or something.<br />
3) i dont know how often it has been said but the stuff before ikk trials is a complete joke compared to them. and if you keep in mind the last changes to that trials (hint they kind of REQUIRE an ench now(or a super optimal group)) there is besides having friends and stuff no reason to get a shaman for it.<br />
4) yea we do fine as healers at orc 3 in sro i agree with you.<br />
<br />
On BoT issue : i dont realy care any more the spell in its original version wasnt interesting enough to realy look forward to. i have no faith in that sony even understand the problems or even cares. any HoT below 500 per tick isnt even worth the buffslot on our tanks . i dont want HoTs anyways they dont fit into todays EQ wich went to superfast combat. my groups kill a mob faster then the duration of one HoT anyways. if i get the mob slow before it hits 70%(if i have to malo i try to avoid that) then thats pretty fast. the damage reduced by my slow is meaningless on non bosses due dps and those bosses after tipt are imune to slow . <br />
I dont remember who said that without slower you are going to kill slower etc but from my experience i can tell you : you are sooo wrong. replace me with another dps and you will do much better , or if you REALY need more heals then one cleric can do(ikk trials) get a 2nd you are MUCH better off with that.</div></div><hr />

I can heal an xp group in Barindu without much of a problem. However, Shaman are not backup healers in GoD expeditions. <br />

Cleric goes down in Vxed or Tipt, it's really rough on a Shaman with multiple mobs in the area.<br />
<br />
We are NOT asking to be primary healers, but a base 1300 heal just does not cut it, period. I had the fortunate experience of being a 'backup healer' in Tipt where the group pulled the named out of his room.<br />
<br />
I can tell you with certaintly that you will be VERY lucky to keep a tank up with a cleric and a Shaman in that situation. Unslowable.<br />
<br />
We kept up ok for awhile, but then he got a few max hits in and tank drops like a rock. Then it was dominoes: Cleric, Shaman, Bard, Mage, (Necro FD'd).<br />
<br />
If it had been a Druid, the fight probably would have been won. Do you see the problem with Shaman healing now?<br />

Shaman were possibly overpowered during Kunark. Shaman were fine in Velious. Shaman were fine in Luclin. Shaman were doing pretty ok at the start of PoP. Shaman still weren't all that bad at the end of PoP. Shaman started having real issues in LDoN. Shaman are seeing these issues getting larger at the start of GoD.<br />
Do you see the pattern? This is getting worse with every bit of gear upgrade, with every new spell, with every bit of slow mitigation, every time fights get another second shorter. Some of us would prefer to fix it before we are completely obsolete. The current situation is bad enough as is.<br />
<br />
I see talk about Druids being healers AND DPS, like they are gonna be dropping bombs all fight instead of healing. Guess what folks, heres a clue. If your primary healer is a Druid, a Shaman can out DPS them pretty easily.<br />
If a druid is healing a shaman will not be able to do anything but heal, trying to match them. Slow barely makes up for Druid's superior healing power on short fights, and does not make up at all if those MOBs also mitigate slow.<br />
<br />
Are there better choices for DPS? Sure, but I dont see many Wiz, Rog, Mage with heals and slows. We are about utility.

How is this not pulling our weight?<br />
Slow alone does not cut it. An enchanter can slow to within a hair of us, provide amazing buffs, pull, crowd control and in a lot of zones be the main damage dealer.<br />
Beastlords slow pretty close to us and are one of the top damage classes.<br />
To match that we would need to slow and be one of the best healing classes. There are 4 healing classes, and we are tied for last place.<br />
<br />

PS: I'm not sure that a 450 hp / tick trushar would be adequate.  This is something that actually needs to get tested by players not gamed out on the back of an envelope.<br />
<br />
At 285 mana, the heal would have to be 428hp/tick to be commensurate with the upgrades other classes received.<br />
<br />
<br />
Changing in Trushar isn't as upsetting as http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spellhistory.html?id=2247&amp;source=Test though.  A change like that makes me think they were playing April Fool's a little early this year.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u164"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p164">Actually, if we want to be precise at 285 mana this should be healing for 555 HP/tick. <br />
When they upgraded Q they upped the mana cost by 10% and the healing by 20%. 285 mana is a 42.5% increase in mana cost for a 85% heal upgrade compared to Q. 300 x 85% = 255. So 285 mana for 555/tick...in theory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u165"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p165">Unless they are truly incompetent - and able to make 2 typing errors on one spell without noticing - my guess is that since they changed both mana and the amount healed that they were actually trying to make it 460 hitpoints per tick for 285 mana.<br />
<br />
If that is good or not doesnt really matter to me since I will never get it unless they also make spells tradeable or make them drop somewhere easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u166"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p166">Once again, you seem to be missing my point. You are basing our entire class on ONE OR TWO very specific situations. How bout we take this a step further. <br />
<br />
Paladins, SKs and Monks may as well give up their class, because on large scale raids, they are useless. Pallys and SKs cannot tank like warriors, and monks arent even close to Rogues in DPS. Pack it in fellas, your classes are no longer needed. <br />
<br />
Yes, there is a HUGE healing issue right now with a lot of the game. Cleric is (and almost ALWAYS has been) the single most &quot;required&quot; class in the game. Thats a big problem. Our heals have not kept up with the content in some cases. Thats a big problem. But are you seriously trying to tell me that groups with a shaman cannot function in GoD? Adjustments cant be made? <br />
<br />
My whole point of bringing up LDoN was that I remember back when it first came out, the Shaman community whined about not having enough DPS to be desirable. LDoN was a pure DPS fest, period. Shaman sucked. Well lets look now. 6 Shaman can easily smoke an LDoN Normal. The content has been SOLVED. Adjustments were made. Faster cast nukes (like SoT, which I use quite a bit in LDoN) and Bane make up a large part of that adjustment. This isnt &quot;old old&quot; content, it was the last expansion for gosh sake, and the EQ community SOLVED it. 5 Shaman and an SK. No &quot;DPS class&quot;. Collect 28 in under 40 minutes. With ease. We didnt even bother to FD pull, we just ganked 5 or 6 and smoked em. Don't you think that eventually adjustments will be made to Gates? You want to be a super hero right this second and just solve the whole expansion by the end of the week? Come on, PLAY THE GAME. Adapt, adjust. <br />
<br />
Yes there is a healing problem. Sure, go ahead and complain SOME. But don't dismiss our entire class based on 2 or 3 trials at the highest end of the newest expansion. You just stated that Shaman were fine through the entire game so far. GoD has been out for what, less than a month? <br />
<br />
Gosh, I am so sorry you dont have the patience to work with what you have, and just see the FIRST answer as &quot;Give me more or I QUIT&quot;. I swear everyone wants to trivialize every expansion the day it hits the shelf. <br />
<br />
300 more on my fastest heal. 300 more on my fastest nuke. Any more than that is just stupid. The game SHOULD be this hard at that level. <br />
<br />
Yeah, maybe a few shaman will get passed over for groups. Boo Hoo, welcome to the world of what 3/4 of the EQ classes went through for a LOT longer than we currently have been, and that some classes STILL have worse than us even now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u167"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p167">Going without a slower is like going without a cleric... it's doable, but really, really hard.  There is almost no circumstance where a group would take a druid over a shaman if the group had no slower.<br />
<br />
And Tormac, again, you're underestimating shaman mana regen.  Yeah, they can do more burst damage than we can.  Over the long term though, we can sustain pretty good damage consistantly (and don't try to get into the passive vs active argument, because shaman can get the same passive mana regen too if that's really an issue).  I never said we'd be able to match a druid, just that we'd be able to do damage in a similar ballpark, assuming that was our main role in the group.<br />

Banuddar, a group has choices for slowers that are just plan better than a shaman.  If shamans were far and away the only choice for a slower, you would have a valid point, because we would be need for that one role.  But we are not the only slower.  <br />
<br />
Enchanters bring insane DPS with them in the form of a charmed mob, and better CC in general, plus KEI.  BL bring good DPS with them, and the glory of paragon.<br />
<br />
We bring gimpy a heal, and almost no meaningful DPS.  Why would a party want a shaman when an enchanter has almost as good a slow and much better DPS?  A druid makes so much more sense than a shaman does as a patch healer, because they also have meaningful DPS.  We need improved heals so we can function as a back up healer.  Or we need improved nukes so we can contribute some DPS.  Before anyone claims that I am asking to heal like a cleric and nuke like a wizard, let me stress that I am not.  I am not asking for a CH to match the druids, nor a nuke that can match a druids.  I would like a fast heal that is close to the druids, OR a nuke that is close to a druids though. <br />
<br />
The passive versus active manna regen is the whole problem.  Even though you seem to revel in canni, and do not see that it is behind the times.  Yes I can get PoT 9 cast on me as well. That is a reason why Druids are more useful to a group than a shaman is.  I still do not get where you claim that I underestimate canni.  I’m pretty sure you and I have the same cani V aa and canni IV spell.   I NEED canni to make up for the fact that all my spells are very manna inefficient.  Canni is not an extra blessing, it is something that makes up for a deficit.  Canni is one of the reasons I find it hard to do any DPS, I have to choose between a slow casting nuke, a rain that will brake mezes and be resisted, a dot that will nto run its course, or canni. <br />
<br />
There was a time before every class had their own passive manna regen when canni was &quot;tha bomb&quot;.  It was in the year 1999, when I was proud to have finally earned a last name on Tormac.  The cleric I play with rarely ever runs out of manna on hard Ldons.  He has time to melee and nuke.  I have to choose between damage or manna regen.  By the time I get a mob maloed and slowed I do not have time for both. The druid I play with can heal and nuke and needs no more down time than I do for manna. <br />
<br />
Banuddar you're not looking at the group as a whole, but merely looking at yourself, and assuming that because you are constantly almost out of manna from spamming tnargs, a cleric or a druid would be in the same place after they healed.  They would not be.  They are not penalized by the inefficient heals and nukes that we are.  Druids have Pot 9's that helps every caster in the party, not just me.  They do not have to choose between manna regen and doing something useful for the party.<br />
<br />
I’ve read your posts.  I understand what you are saying Banuddar, its just that you are wrong.  Like when you claim that shaman can do near the DPS of a druid.  You are not looking at what a druid can actually do.  We cannot sustain more damage over a longer period of time then a druid fighting in a typical dungeon setting.  Mobs die too fast for us to do much damage at all. Almost no dps extented over 50 mobs in a Ldon is not good longterm DPS.   And if you honestly thing that when fighting a big mob our dots are better than a druids, all I can say is you must never group with a druid.  Go to the PoS and watch a druid kite frogs there.  They chew mobs up in that zone and never have down time.  In the long term situations when we can do lots of damage with our Dots, druids can do it just as well, if not better, especially if there is a charmable animal near by.   In the short term out burst dps is embarrassingly poor compared to a druid.  As I said before when I’m partnering with a druid I will usually heal, even though my heals are gimpy, because as bad as my heals are my nukes are pathetic, and my rains are worthless 2/3’s of the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u168"><b>Ciele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p168">Actually, if we want to be precise at 285 mana this should be healing for 555 HP/tick. <br />
When they upgraded Q they upped the mana cost by 10% and the healing by 20%. 285 mana is a 42.5% increase in mana cost for a 85% heal upgrade compared to Q. 300 x 85% = 255. So 285 mana for 555/tick...in theory.<br />
<br />
My methodology was just to take the mana to hps healed ratio of quiessence and scale it to 285 mana.  For all we know eqlive will just drag the number out of their asses like we are and say its all ok.</div></div><hr />

LDoN was a pure DPS fest, period. Shaman sucked. Well lets look now. 6 Shaman can easily smoke an LDoN Normal.<br />
Take any 6 classes, as long as you have one healer among them you can do a LDoN normal. 6 Paladins would have been a lot faster. 6 Beastlords would have been a lot faster. 6 Necros would have been a lot faster. A Paladin/Cleric/Bard/Wizardx3 group would leave you behind by a factor of at least 4.<br />
<br />
The content has been SOLVED. Adjustments were made. Faster cast nukes (like SoT, which I use quite a bit in LDoN) and Bane make up a large part of that adjustment.<br />
Wow, you can have a Bane last for it's full duration in a LDoN normal? Oh, I forgot - a 6 shaman group.<br />
<br />
This isnt &quot;old old&quot; content, it was the last expansion for gosh sake, and the EQ community SOLVED it. 5 Shaman and an SK. No &quot;DPS class&quot;. Collect 28 in under 40 minutes.<br />
The last time I did a normal LDoN collect we took 12 minutes. (Yes, even with a shaman - I was the puller. Pretty much anyone could have done it, but no harm in letting a shaman pull and I would have been utterly useless on the damage side.)<br />
By the way - LDoN might have been the last expansion but it was not a raiding expansion. LoY was &quot;solved&quot; pretty fast too. Neither were raiding expansions.<br />
<br />
With ease. We didnt even bother to FD pull, we just ganked 5 or 6 and smoked em. Don't you think that eventually adjustments will be made to Gates? You want to be a super hero right this second and just solve the whole expansion by the end of the week? Come on, PLAY THE GAME. Adapt, adjust. <br />
I want to be as good as everyone else. Why does the Cleric, the Bard, the Enchanter, the Beastlord, the Warrior get to be the hero and not me?<br />
<br />
Yes there is a healing problem. Sure, go ahead and complain SOME. But don't dismiss our entire class based on 2 or 3 trials at the highest end of the newest expansion. You just stated that Shaman were fine through the entire game so far. GoD has been out for what, less than a month? <br />
This is a trend. It has been going on for a while now. A few of us might have spotted it in advance. Then some of the better equipped shaman started to feel it. By the end lf LDoN most &quot;end-game&quot; shaman felt it. Now it trickles down into to most 65 shaman. This is not going to get better, and thus the complaining will get louder.<br />
<br />
Gosh, I am so sorry you dont have the patience to work with what you have, and just see the FIRST answer as &quot;Give me more or I QUIT&quot;. I swear everyone wants to trivialize every expansion the day it hits the shelf.<br />
We do not want to finish/trivialize/solve the expansion. We want to contribute as well as everyone else.<br />
<br />
300 more on my fastest heal. 300 more on my fastest nuke. Any more than that is just stupid. The game SHOULD be this hard at that level.<br />
This has nothing to do with how hard the game is and everything with how zone design, itemization and class balance play together to make shaman obsolete.<br />
<br />
Yeah, maybe a few shaman will get passed over for groups. Boo Hoo, welcome to the world of what 3/4 of the EQ classes went through for a LOT longer than we currently have been, and that some classes STILL have worse than us even now.<br />
So, according to your logic, just because someone got kicked in the balls we should not complain when it happens to us?</div></div><hr />

Paladins, SKs and Monks may as well give up their class, because on large scale raids, they are useless. Pallys and SKs cannot tank like warriors, and monks arent even close to Rogues in DPS. . .<br />
<br />
Yes, there is a HUGE healing issue right now with a lot of the game. Cleric is (and almost ALWAYS has been) the single most &quot;required&quot; class in the game. Thats a big problem. Our heals have not kept up with the content in some cases. Thats a big problem. But are you seriously trying to tell me that groups with a shaman cannot function in GoD?

<br />
<br />
Blazz, a couple things.  First off the knights, while not being able to tank raid quality mobs as well as a warrior, are far and way still superior to warriors in almost any exp situation because of their agro control.  I’d take a knight over a warrior in a hard Ldon or Bot camp any time, if I have a choice.  <br />
<br />
As far as the healing situation, you are close but not quite correct.  There is a huge difference between the priest classes, but it is not that Clerics are irreplaceable.  My guild has a shortage of clerics, so we’ve welcomed druids with open arms.  WE use druids to replace clerics.  They can do it.  Druids can do CH chains.  Druids can main heal in almost any situation.  The problem is not that clerics are “required”, but that shamans heals are becoming worthless. <br />
<br />
I’m sure that a shaman may be squeezed into a group in GoD.  I squeezed a lvl 55 druid in a golem group in PoV last night, and things went just fine.  However the reason why I did it was not that the lvl 55 druid was a strong contributor to the group.  He was clearly too low a lvl, but he was a guildy and I wanted to help him lvl to where he could get his CH.  If I could have taken him on a Bot group, I would have, for the same reason. With a strong group he would have been just fine.  I do not want shamans to become the gimp class that guildies will drag around out of pity.  If content is continually scaled upward, and shamans continue to receive less and less of an upgrade in comparison to other priests, we will become dead weight.  <br />
<br />
As far as a party of shaman being able to do a normal Ldon, well, sure.  A party of almost any class can do a normal Ldon today.  Once a person gets enough gear and aa’s normal Ldons are trivial.  Maybe God will become trivial too in an expansion or two, once everyone collects more gear and aa’s.  I do not want Tormac to be a character that can only handle trivial content.  I do not want Tormac to be dead weight.  I do not want my BL to replace Tormac.  I’ve played Tormac since the beginning of this game.  But if spear of torment is Tormac’s prime dps nuke, then I will be the first to admit that he is dead weight, and for the sake of my small guild’s advancement I will drop him in favor of my BL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u172"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p172">Shaman need an upgrade to Tnarg's, the Ikkinz trials need to be fixed.  That sums it up.<br />
<br />
We don't need to heal as well as a cleric, but we should heal fairly close to as well as a druid.  Yet at the moment we can only heal about 60% of what a druid can heal.  Neither a druid or a shaman is going to be able to main heal much in GoD without a slower and a shaman isn't going to be main healing and slowing in the trials, so that kinda puts the whole &quot;we can slow&quot; argument out the window as far as a reason for us not getting an upgrade to Tnarg.<br />
<br />
Ikkinz trials are broken, plain and simple.  There's NO reason for single group encounters to require you fill 1/3 to 1/2 the group with 2 or 3 classes, respectively.  That is NOT balance.<br />
<br />
The raids, from all accounts I've heard, are easier than the trials.  what the hell is that?  RAIDS should be hard and balancing them around having the BEST tanking class and BEST healing class is fine.  There are a lot more than 6 slots in a raid, hence it's ok to make them require at least one of every class.<br />
<br />
Hell that's good design if you can make a raid require at least one of every single class.  There is room for at least one of every class in a raid.  When there are only 6 slots to go around, there needs to be some sort of flexibility.  i.e. If you have a super uber tank, then you should be able to get by without a cleric.  If you have a cleric, you should be able to get by with a less than perfect tank.  If there are adds, you should be able to CC them with more than just an ENC.  <br />
<br />
It's not just shaman feeling the pain in GoD, it's pretty much everyone outside CLR WAR ENC, because they are truly the kings of GoD right now.</div></div><hr />

Sorry to break this to you my friend, but you don't need any LDoN spells or equipment to 'smoke' an LDoN normal.<br />

My definition of smoking an LDoN Normal is doing a 'slay 60' in 25 minutes or less.<br />
<br />
Collect 28 in under 40 minutes? Try under 25.<br />
<br />
Put that same group in Tipt and watch how well the group does. You cannot compare LDoN zones with Elemental/GoD Vxed and above.<br />
<br />
I can easily be the main healer in an LDoN normal, along with slowing and FAing. No way in heck can I do that in Vxed and above, not even close.<br />
<br />
Your problem is that you are ignoring what the Shaman here are saying. The Shaman at the level of PoTime/Ikkinz trial stage of the game are being left behind in almost every category. The new Canni is nice, although no one to my knowledge has seen it yet. The slow spell is situational, and Trushar? While it is an upgrade to Quiessence (at the moment), it is a far cry from receiving heal upgrades that are comparable to what other classes have received.<br />
<br />
I seriously don't understand why the Shaman has not received some kind of upgrade to their direct heal. it boggles me.<br />

I'll keep playing my Shaman, I enjoy playing the Shaman class. That does not mean I am happy about what SoE is doing to the Shaman class though.</div></div><hr />

veeshanMurtak- Again, fancy calculations, with no real basis.  You honestly take 10 seconds to get anything slowed?  I doubt it.  I'm sure by now you've realized that you can cast Malos while the mob is inc.  With Time's Anithesis (no recast), mobs are usually only in camp maybe a couple seconds before slow is on.<br />
<br />
Maybe you never plan to get Ancient canni, but I do, so yeah, I do think that a spell that I'm very likely to get soon is important in class balance.<br />

And btw, I agree that the changes to Breath are stupid atm, but I doubt they'll stay that way.  Probably, they're going to raise the healing to a similar proportion to the mana.  We'll see though.</div></div><hr />

I don't think you can really use an ultra-rare spell (which it will be -- thats the point of ancients) as a class balance tool.   That would be the same as saying warriors were just fine because the Avatar Of War dropped an agro-inducing weapon.  At best (even if that spell drops from every 3rd mob in the end-game zone) there will be a limited number of shaman that ever obtain it.  I intend to be one of them, but at the same time I wouldn't call the class balanced just becauseI had that spell.</div></div><hr />

Well Bannudar you have my apology if I put words into your mouth.<br />
<br />
You said before that you thought I was underestimating Canni.  It seems to me that that implies that you are running LOM often.  I for one would still trade more efficient spells and passive manna regen for slow inefficient spells and an active manna regen.<br />
<br />
As far as dps goes, I just don't see the same thing you do I guess.  Maybe because my guild does use druids often, we have a collection of uber druids.  I know I've seen druids out nuke the mage at times.  I did not believe it, (a rl friend of mine is a mage, and he complains all the time that druid's nuke too hard), until the mage started tracking damage in groups and proved it to me.  The mage proved it to me.  Sure it does not happen all the time, but occasionally the druid will out nuke the mage, and the druid is consistently close.  There is no way I could do the damage a druid could in any given situation, long term or short term.  <br />
<br />
I was certainly not talking about named mobs when I pointed out the difference between long term druid and shaman damage.  The PoS exp areas that I was referring to are not full of named mobs.  They are common exp zones.  Mobs are harder than Ldon mobs, but certainly not named mobs.  Druids and wizards exp there all the time.  I picked that spot because I've experience with it, and have seen druids kill non stop there.  The druid I was with had no down time.  He is not ep equipped with FT 15, but is a well equipped bazaar druid.  He has no down time, and certainly does not take brakes in dps over the long term wishing he had canni.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u179"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p179">Shaman were possibly overpowered during Kunark.<br />
<br />
You know, I see this bandied about more and more, but it's not true.<br />
<br />
Shaman really struggled early in Kunark because the spell set was horrible until 60.  People back then actually leveled very slowly to 60.  Folks now have no idea what it was like when a hard-core evening would net you maybe 2-3 blue bubbles on your experience bar (when they introduced that so you could at least see some movement there).  <br />
<br />
Superior healing was a level 54 spell, Chloroblast didn't exist, Kragg's didn't exist, Canni 4 didn't exist, Stoicism didn't exist and Torpor and Malo were very difficult to obtain.  Even after the healing changes the spell set was weak until 60.<br />
<br />
It's not like shaman were gods in that period, in fact the 50s were a huge struggle.  There was some payoff when you hit 60 and actually got your spells, but the idea that we were overpowered then I don't think is really true.  <br />
<br />
It sure didn't seem that way at least.  Of course, then Nixx soloed Yeldema and did show there was real power there when everything aligned.  That was true for a lot of classes back then.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, that's a bit of a derail.  I have no opinion on GoD at all so I'll shut up now.</div></div><hr />

I'm not talking about soloing, I'm talking about inflicting long term damage.<br />
<br />
Druids can sustain long-term damage in groups; they can continue to damage mobs far better than shaman can.  They have very nice lure dots that make inflicting more damage easier for them over time.<br />
<br />
Banuddar you had explained that maybe in burst DPS druids were better than shaman, but in the long term druids could not continue to damage mobs, where as shaman could because we have canni.  I'm trying to point out that long-term druids can keep the damage flowing.  There is no damage gap where we clearly outshine druids.  Quite the opposite, druids are the best dps of the priest class.  Improving our fast heal to be close to the druid's will not make druids obsolete.  That is what I've been trying to show in my comparison of the two classes, because druids can contribute meaningful heals and meaningful DPS, where as shamans can contribute slows, but our healing is becoming meaningless, and our dps is already meaningless.<br />
<br />
 I’ve read in many posts that shamans have such a strong utility that it would be unbalancing to give us anything.  This is just not the case.  We do not have any more “utility” than druids do.  If fact we have far less because the one thing we really shine at (slowing) is often mitigated to where it is not important.  Healing is always important.  DPS is always important.  Slowing is sometimes important.  I do not want to see shamans be this one trick slowing pony, because there are many places where slowing is nerfed or not needed.  We either need a lesser role as DPS or healing.  Right now we have a spot as patch healer, but EQ is taking that away from us and giving it to the paladins.  The gap between druid and shaman healing is growing.  The gap between paladin and shaman healing is shrinking (and already gone in some places).  <br />
<br />
Druids can contribute two desirable things, where as shaman be loosing our second trait, healing.  And our slowing is becoming marginalized in many areas.  This is why I feel that shaman either need to have our quick heals improved to where we can still patch heal, or we need faster burst dps so we can contribute that way.  I am not asking for the druids CH.  I am not asking for a nuke equal to the druids best, let alone a mage or a wizard.  I am asking that either our healing scales upwards in an equivalent manner to the other priest classes, or our damage per second is scaled upwards.  What we are being given is a meaningless HoT that apparently was still to powerful in EQ’s eyes and a disease dot that offers very poor damage per second.<br />
<br />
edited to add-maybe I need to explain, I was in particular, recalling times when me, a mage, and a druid would trio there. Or just me and the druid.  We would agro kite non summoning mobs, and I would tank the summoning ones.  There was no need for me to stop and let the druid and the mage med while I sat on my thumbs.  With Pot9, KEI, mod rods for the others, and canni for me the three of us seemed to be about even.  If anything I was the one who would need to take a half minute brake to hit canni V then let Qui run its course.  I do not have enough hp to try canni V while tanking a bear in the PoS.  I am not talkign about watching druids quad or charm kite, I am talking about being in small groups where I had to stack poison dots to hold agro becasue the druid and mage started taunting each other about who nuked harder, and were getting careless.  There was no great manna superiority in my camp because of canni.  Yes I'm sure that I spent more manna over the course of the nigh than the druid and mage did, but that is not because I was doing more than they were, it is beacuse my spells are over priced for their effect in comparison.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u183"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p183">Enchanters usually like to have another slower with them when they're using a charmed pet, simply because of how many things that they have to keep track of with a charmed pet.<br />
And once again, even if you do want a second slower, that class is not a shaman. If you want added security take a Bard or a second Enchanter along.<br />
You can pretty much just do without slowing if you have a charmed pet though. It will not be worth it for the 10 second fights.<br />
<br />
When have I ever said I'm constantly out of mana?  Just the opposite, actually; with our mana regen, I can sustain my mana easily, except on named fights.<br />
And you do this by healing less then a Druid. Shaman simply can not match a Druid's healing, let alone a Cleric's, cannibalize or not.<br />
<br />
Sure, Po9 is nice.  But not as nice as slow.  And it's not like you cant have Po9 if you don't have a druid in your group; buffs are rarely an issue for trials, you'll probably have a few LFG druids outside the trials at any given time anyway.<br />
Let me tell you something about slow. On paper we reduce MOB DPS to a quarter. In reality, thanks to slow mitigation and short fights we reduce MOB DPS to between two thirds and half.<br />
A Cleric or Druid can easily cover this virtual amount of healing and then some.<br />
<br />
I'm not talking LDoN.  Sure, in LDoN our DPS isn't that great because the fights are really fast.  In GoD though, theres usually enough time to get a full bane off and a couple nukes, unless you're in a really good DPS group with a charmed pet or something.<br />
I have yet to be in a GOD group where I have Bane run for full, let alone get off additional nukes.<br />
<br />
Druids aren't going to be chain nuking in a fast pulling group, because they just don't have the mana for it.  This is where we make up for it, somewhat.  You're not going to do &quot;near&quot; the DPS of a full DPS druid... just somewhere similar.<br />
Even over time we cannot match Druid DPS. The only way we can do that is with DoTs, over a timespan of an hour or more, and DoTs do not run for full.<br />
<br />
Nope, on named fights, druids are going to be healing, as are we.  It's really not even worth comparing our damage on named fights, because neither class is going to be doing much of it.<br />
And thus we are back to comparing healing, and spam healing at that. A Druid will easily outheal a Shaman and still find time to nuke.<br />
<br />
veeshanMurtak- Again, fancy calculations, with no real basis.  You honestly take 10 seconds to get anything slowed?  I doubt it.  I'm sure by now you've realized that you can cast Malos while the mob is inc.  With Time's Anithesis (no recast), mobs are usually only in camp maybe a couple seconds before slow is on.<br />
Even if you slow a MOB before it takes it's first swing, slow mitigation, just a bit of it, will half the effectiveness of slow.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ps: the latest version on lucy's has got to be a joke... they are bringing it back down to 360hp healed, but upping the mana cost by 55 (from the live version).  So basically a nerf, for what, the overpowering heal of 360? give me a break =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u185"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p185">tonight's change to breath of trushar on Lucy makes me sick.  Even more than those of you who stand on your soapbox and proclaim everything is okay make me sick.<br />
<br />
Oh and nerfing it while boosting the cleric spell is just classy.  Throw some salt in the wounds and maybe some broken glass too, huh SOE?  I think this has gone on long enough without some comment from Brenlo or a dev.  It makes me furious that they just ignore our concerns.  It's like we are being mocked, we complain that the increase to Breath of Trushar is not enough to fix the current problems, so they nerf back the whole 10 point upgrade and jack up the mana cost by so much.  I just don't know what to say.<br />
<br />
Quies = 300 hp for 200 mana (x4) = 6hp per mana.<br />
BoT =  360 hp for 285 mana. (x4) = 5hp per mana.<br />
<br />
The only thing our Heal over Time line had going for it was it's very strong mana efficiency.  NOW EVEN THAT IS TAKEN AWAY.  How many more things will they take away before some of you take off your blinders?  It is better to get NOTHING than this ****.<br />
<br />
what other class got their healing abilities NERFED in GoD?<br />
<br />
<br />
Forcing your customers into a position where they feel helpless and ignored is bad business.  Flat out mocking them is even worse business.  I'm a rational person, I doesn't make any sense for SOE to do this to their customers, but really, what else am I supposed to think here?<br />
<br />
It would appear that they adjusted Trushar to be the same mana/hp ratio as the cleric HoT. Remember that when GoD came out most &quot;improved&quot; spells were basically 10% increases over existing versions. So the cleric HoT went from 500 to 550/tick, or a 10% increase. The shaman version went form 300 to 360, or a 20% increase. The recent changes on test have basically adjusted both HoTs to be 20% improvements over previous versions, which is reasonable enough. The problem is that Q is more mana efficient than the old cleric HoT, whereas the most recent changes in mana cost have made the GoD versions have the same mana cost. This is probably an oversight, remember that these changes are on test and are in the process of being tweaked. I'd suggest contacting the devs and pointing this out. The proper mana cost for Trushar should be 240.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u187"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p187">My contribution isn't related to our problems in GoD, but more SoE's lack of foresight and effort.  Last night in an LDoN normal group of brd,pal,bst,wiz,nec,me (shm) we finished two lowish collect adventures in 30 minutes each.  All of us were very far from uber (the pally using narandi's lance and the elite steelslave blade that dropped was an upgrade for the bard, bst didn't have 65 spells, etc)<br />
<br />
The entire span of the two adventures I didn't cast a single direct heal, not one, and only used Q on the bard maybe twice and the pally maybe once.  The pally used a group heal maybe twice the whole time and no direct heals that I noticed.<br />
<br />
I did very little direct damage, one velium strike (with mage bracer,earring, and ring) once every couple mobs or so but kept FA up on 6 targets religiously along with all the usual buffs (actually nothing faded before the adventures had ended lol) and malod every mob that was incoming.<br />
<br />
The ML reported that not a single coin dropped through both adventures and the xp was barely an AA (both coin and aa xp have been noticably nerfed in LDoN).<br />
<br />
This all might not seem to relevant, but what I want to reiterate is that SoE may think we are overpowered for much of Everquest's content (anything outside of GoD, Elemental+, and LDoN hard) and have began to nerf some of that content such as LDoN normal.<br />
<br />
The problem is that SoE failed to include anything inbetween while quietly pushing us out of the realms we excel in!  They expect slight upgrades to Shaman will be enough to cover a disproportionately larger increase in difficulty of content and that is what seems to be frustrating most of us.  It's either: a) excel in *REALLY* easy encounters or b) barely play second fiddle to half the majority of other classes.  Where is the LDoN medium?!  Why didn't they create GoD zones like Plane of Tactics, Halls of Honor, and Tower of Sol Ro?<br />
<br />
Ah well, I'm still bent outta shape from their decision to make Chaotic Pain an ancient :)</div></div><hr />

I posted earlier in this thread as a casual bazaar shaman about running into this now that my friends and I have just started LDoN hards.  As an update, last night I borrowed my friend's L65 cleric, geared worse than my shaman, and on my 2nd box successfully kept my sk up the entire hard adv last night.  Note I had never played a cleric before in my life- I had to read up on eqcasters about what spells they got other than virtue/cheal. My sk died repeatedly in the past with shaman healing, slow or no slow.  <br />
<br />
The power of cleric fast heals and cheals was amazing to me as it's been months since I've had a cleric healing me.  We don't raid, so clerics generally waste a dps slot for us.  My experience now that I'm doing more difficult encounters, esp. since my friend boxes a chanter, is that Izmaill is about to be put to pasture other than doing LDoN normals. I knew cleric healing was good, but I was seriously blown away.  What a rush.  Maybe I can bring Iz along to loot the NO DROP shaman stuff in hards if we get another cleric, that would be about the extent of his usefullness in an LDoN hard w/ a chanter/cleric already in the group.<br />

I keep hearing Galadriel's voice in my head from the beginning of Fellowship of the Ring:<br />
&quot;...but the power of cheal could not be undone.&quot;<br />

With cleric hot at 600, that puts 360 at 60% of a clerics heal over time power.  Mana cost now reflects 60% of clerics as well now.  This is not 60% of a clerics healing power, just of one part of healing.  A part which was the domain of shamans once.  If we were 60% of a clerics healing in total, we'd be fine.  Our 'big'(no snickering) heal is 29% of clerics.  Our 'fast'(please stop laughing) heal is 40% of clerics.<br />
If this is the dev's vision of shaman, we're just in for more trouble.  As mobs hit more, they up heals more.  If we're going to get 40 or 60% of clerics, then we loose out more and more each upgrade.</div></div><hr />

What is this some kind of joke? Did you not read any of my posts, you just basically saw people reaming me and assumed I am thinking Shaman are the &quot;kings&quot;? Gimee a break, buddy. <br />
<br />
I readily admit there are balance problems with our class. I admit freely that we are getting hosed. I am just not going to sit here and moan and groan non-stop because of some poorly designed content that actually hoses a LOT of classes, not just us. <br />
<br />
This game is trivial enough now. It is super butt-ass simple, in fact. I would rather not see us made into some super-being again, that what started this mess in the first place. Adjust and adapt, or find a new class. Sure, moan and groan a little, but some of this thread is ridiculous.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u194"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p194">Blazz.<br />
<br />
Shaman have never been a super being.<br />
<br />
At one time we were powerful yes. In kunark. At the end of kunark. At the height of shaman power. Guess what.<br />
<br />
Shaman died left and right. It happened. Alot. Sure shaman were strong. but so were other classes that attained the gear and playstyle and skill to excel.<br />
<br />
I was not playing Snoww at the uber game then. I had a little thief named Feather. Snoww was stuck at level 45ish. Angry at the world because all I was ever told was shut up. Sit down. And heal. My playstyle as a shaman was mocked and told That I was a fool. I had at the time a 111 Wisdom. And wore AC and hit point gear. And 99.9 percent of the shaman Wore Wisdom gear and crowed about 200 wisdom and how powerful they were. <br />
<br />
The overbalance that people always talk about with shaman was started when Nixx soloed Yedelma. He did this at the beginnings of the shaman revolution of Hit points and AC. And he had the some of the best gear in the game at the time. (Gasp) he even had the holy trinity of shamanhood. A JBB, a Fungal, and a Spear of fate.<br />
<br />
Give me a blinking break. Were shaman strong back then. Yes. But at the time bards were quietly soloing everything in sight through a exploit. A chanter killed Yedelma solo not to long after. And now even warriors (With proper gear and support items) Have soloed the damn thing. <br />
<br />
At one time. Rangers were laughed at and Ranger gate jokes were all the rage. They did have issues. But you know what hurt them most. The perception of other players. Thier perception of the game. And the constant moral destroying melding of the two.<br />
<br />
Shaman are worse off now than the rangers were ever at. Because when SoE put slow mitagation in the game. They took away the primary ability of the class. And we have never been given any sort of way to make up for it. <br />
<br />
Shaman have been gods of the sustained fight. Of the energizer bunny battles. Wave after wave of tough monsters humbled before us. Slowly nicking away at them until we stand above thier corpses. Tired but backs unbowed. <br />
<br />
Now. Shaman look for something to slow. And the beastlord has already slowed it. The enchanter has already charmed it and killed three things with it. Or the warrior is inciting and beating it to death all while screaming at the top of thier lung, Take that you damned paladins and Shadowknights. !!1!!<br />
<br />
The game has passed us by  and runs now in a zone where shaman are at thier weakest. The sprint fights. We are distance runners. Not sprinters. We always have been. With Damage over time. And heals over time (Both regen and Torpor/Q) With mana regen over active time spent. With the wonderful ability to slow TIME itself via slow. (Grins sorry had to)  Shaman have always had the ability to outlast certain things. Now that ability is obsolete. And in fact in the current game of sprint fighting and any one mob can kill someone in an instant we are actively hurting groups with our skill sets and spells. <br />
<br />
A group in GoD needs two strong healers. A slower. A tank, and fast damage. That is covered much better by Druid, chanter and Cleric. Can a shaman fill in for the druid. Maybe. But you know what. we do less burst damage. Have longer start up times, and weaker heals. <br />
<br />
We are a slower. And a slow healer. And slow damage. And sadly in many group layouts better suited to be a buff bot then play another better suited class. <br />
<br />
And that ****ing pisses me off. <br />
<br />
I played in beta. I have the blinking T shirt from the first day of release. I have played the game a ton over the last five years. It has been one of my primary forms of entertainment for a long long time. And now the developers of the game are screwing with people like a 13 year old GM in a PnP game who are drunk on power. <br />
<br />
And just like that game there are personalities that toady up to the developers and coo in thier ear.&quot;this is great! I love my 7th level fighter with the Vorpral Sword!&quot; &quot;Can we go kill a god now I want to level!&quot;<br />
<br />
All while ignoring the other people who are leaving and muttering to themselves. &quot;What a ****ing waste of my time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Guess what. All those images of RPG geeks over the years. Well some of em are true. The malajusted, malcontents are alive and well. And sadly as long as they get thier pound of flesh they will be happy with whatever **** SoE floats thier way. <br />
<br />
I am not in the uber game. I lead a small group of friends. And we go places and have fun. But because I am not in the super duper trials of GoD getting my nuts kicked in every ten minutes all while knowing my teamates would be better served with some other class beside them. doesnt mean that I am blind to the fact that SoE has dropped the ball. And it is frustrating that the ball is the hopes of people who pay them to play.<br />
<br />
And even more disturbing is you can't tell any more if the ball was dropped a few times or is being maliciously dribbled and kicked anymore.<br />
<br />
I play the game to be with my friends. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u196"><b>Geal Icehammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p196">I was thinking about the history of changes to healing the preist classes have gone thru. The reason that druids and shaman got the incomplete heal spells, late in the Luclin era, was to decrease the dependancy on groups requiring a cleric. Groups wouldn't form unless there was going to be a cleric. Shaman still got groups as slower but not as healer. Druids just solo'd. <br />
<br />
      As compensation, clerics got there nuke tweeked a bit, recieved the bash skill (damn them  :mad: ), and got new summoned hammers with an unresistable proc. This allowed them some (feeble) soloing skill to make up for that they were no longer the heart of every exp group.<br />
<br />
      All well and good, for the Luclin era and even low end PoP. As many have pointed out on these forums; high end PoP, Hard LDoN, and GoD require more healing than a shaman can provide. Reports about the GoD trials (I'm not that far along) make claims that not only is a cleric required but bringing 2 is a damn good idea. <br />
<br />
       I find it ironic that we have come full circle (and then some) in roughly 2 years. Shaman can't preform the roll of primary healer, clerics can't solo worth a damn. Druids did make out well .....</div></div><hr />

To be honest, I'm not a bit surprised that Sony doesn't have a clue about our class, or any class for that matter.  I mean how are they supposed to have the finer points of class balance down when they can't even put out an expansion that doesn't take weeks, or months to fix once it is released.  These ass-clowns are barely able to make the game mechanics work, let alone think about balance.  I'm surprised that they haven't accidentally forgotten to patch a whole class during one of these brain dumps.  I'm to the point that if I get through a whole night without the game crashing, I'm happy.  <br />
<br />
I mean really, if they didn't put enough time into it to make it physically work, do you really expect much in the way of how stuff will balance and work vs the mobs?  Really, even if they are slowed and the mobs are hitting for doubling for 1200 and some procs in there.  They would have to have a round every 7 seconds or so for us to even keep up with our piss ass heal if we were chaining it.  Doesn't that flick a switch somewhere?  One of the 3 priest classes is not able to even keep up with the damage output if the mob was fully slowed....Isn't that wrong somehow?  It shouldn't be easy, but it shouldn't be impossible either.  It should be harder for us..but this is absurd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u201"><b>Ulver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p201">Well here's my take on shaman healing in GoD.<br />
<br />
On any mob that is slowable, except a boss, I've been able to heal without real issues. I've healed Warriors. I've healed Knights. Tipt, Vxed, Kodtaz, even Ikkinz. Sewers? Those slow immune golems beat the crap out of me and I shunned the zone.<br />

My role in most groups is is slim. Slow. Debuffs. Some heals. The buffs? Thats all gone. The buff bot is too entrenched in the high end game. Everyone has access to them. Even Ferine, one of our best buffs, I've had people say don't hit me with it. I'm out of slots and I need more important things. Thats without going into the use of buffs since day one. People like them, I enjoy making people happy, but I can't even bring that to the table. Buffs are dead.<br />

Debuffs. I wish I could feel better about this. It seems like I'm usually tossing Malos on anything that moves just because its a liability if slow doesn't stick on mobs. I think myself fairly equipped, but I lack a TA. I also lack the new GoD slow. Maybe things will change with either item, but usually this just means I am either on the pull, or having the group buy me time to do debuffs. Buying time can be done in most situations, but it is non optimal, in terms of damage.<br />

Heals. Well here's the point of contention. With our mana pools, canni, and everything else Tnarg's in big fights serves as a decent patch that we can provide in a long duration fight. Is a cleric better? Yes. Is a druid better? Yes. Are you better off in most situations with them using their CHs if time is bought? Yes. Can a shaman buy that time? Well usually. Spamming patch on Ikkinz trials is one of the few endevours where I can empty my mana bar totally and not be done with a fight. Breath of Trushar? See earlier comment about buff slots.<br />

The picture is different on trash mobs. If I can slow a mob, Breath is a great spell to help with healing. Toss it on someone who got ramp. Toss it on someone who's getting Ripostes. Toss it on a maintank and use Tnarg's to help cover the 101 proc types that mobs have now. We aren't the fastest at doing it, but in a non boss fight, when you mostly control the pacing, a shaman's regen of mana and ability to distribute heals really makes them useful. I've done Kodtaz trash duo'd with an SK for a while. I don't know how well any other healing class can do that. This one role, hey I feel good about. But is that the whole picture?<br />
<br />
For trials, I feel like a weak link. A lot of classes do. In fact I think the only classes that feel that they aren't threatened in some ways are warriors and clerics. Thats more of the issue here. The design of the expansion has hurt everyone. We're included. Do I enjoy that I've heard almost every member of my guild say in frustration that this expansion makes them want to quit? Has this ever happened to me in any other expansion? No<br />

Sorry if I didn't agree or disagree with the healing bitching going on. Just felt another voice could be used here.</div></div><hr />
