<br />
I am sorry.<br />
<br />
Yesterday, the Canadian government debated a bill to condemn the acts of last Tuesday. To the shame of all Canadians this bill was an empty mouthing of platitudes and cliches, while preaching &quot;restraint&quot; and &quot;caution&quot;, instead of dedicating the resources of Canada to aiding our friends in the USA in their struggle against terrorism.<br />
<br />
To our shame, the rhetoric of the Canadian Government and Prime Minister Chretien, distances us from other members of NATO, such as Great Britain (our historical parent nation), who have pledged to do whatever is necessary, and placed us along side countries such as Libya, Syria and Egypt, who have also condemned the attack but don't wish to commit to any action about it. Instead Mr Chretien has stated that he will not cave into the &quot;panic&quot; caused by the attack and even increase security on points of entry into Canada. He has stated that he will take requests from President Bush and the U.S. Government  &quot;under consideration&quot;.<br />
<br />
Last Tuesday, I cried tears of shock and horror, today I cry tears of shame. I say proudly, that I did not support the government in our last election: I supported the opposition. But that is of limited consolation when I see the disrespect  my country's government is showing our closest friends and allies in their stance.<br />
<br />
The latest estimates are that around 75 Canadians are believed to be among the dead and missing in the attacks. Obviously the Canadian Government feels that to be insignificant enough to warrant supporting our largest trading partner and the other civilized nations of the world in taking action against such an attrocity (beyond what is demanded by NATO treaty... assuming of course that they even possess the capablility of fulfilling their obligations to NATO... which is highly in doubt).<br />
<br />
I am shocked. I am angered. I am ashamed.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry.</div></div><hr />

I have faith that the Canadian people will be very quick to let the Canadian government know their displeasure with the stance the government has decided to take.<br />
<br />
I have had the pleasure to meet many Canadians in the trips up there and they are all friendly and hardy people. Canada has a gritty and proud history of supporting freedom and doing more than their fair share in halting aggression. I have no doubt they will once again step to the plate, as they have always done and I am sure the PM will have some negative feedback from his statements.<br />
<br />
We also have our own cross of shame to bear with a single member of congress voting no in a measure that authorized our President to do what it takes to win this war. I feel for the people in California in this person's district and perhaps they will make their voice heard in the next election.. Thanks Barbara Lee for sending the wrong message..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Halbarad Dunadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't think any apologies need to be made yet.  Although Chretien is excercising a characteristically large degree of caution, he isn't quite saying we will do nothing.  When you distill all the political waffling and get down to the actual content, he took a fairly strong position on the issue.  He said in his address in the House yesterday:  <br />
<br />
&quot;The world has been attacked.  The world must respond.  Because we are at war against terrorism, and Canada - a nation founded on a belief in freedom, justice and tolerance - will be part of that response.&quot;<br />
<br />
Our Defense Minister was even more blunt.  He said something to the effect that in the upcoming conflict Canada will play a front-line role.  <br />
<br />
Historically, Canada has been stampeded into participating in war efforts without making the decision through proper parliamentary debate.  Chretien is simply following the Liberal tradition that William Lyon Mackenzie King started in 1939 - that is, allowing the decision to commit to military action to be made through the parliamentary process.  Mark my words, Canada will stand with the United States in the upcoming war.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am trying to hide from the media these last few days, but I've heard France took a similar stance.  Never liked the frogs much anyhow :P<br />
<br />
Canada is a great nation, always among the first to help in world crises.  I am sure that this time will be no different.</div></div><hr />
