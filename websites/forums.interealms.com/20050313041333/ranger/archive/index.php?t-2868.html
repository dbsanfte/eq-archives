Congrats to Osprey of Triad Continuum for making it. I gotta add though, first, sorry all you Karana folks :/  Second, if they're gonna rub Karana noses in it, they could at least give the bow a name other than Thunderbolt, though I guess Cloudburster for the 3rd one was kinda fittingly ironic.  Hope you all find yours soon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I understand the concept of cultural item making, but a whol line of nice bows, up to a  30/38 Bow to one deity and screwing the other is kinda sucky. <br />
<br />
If there is no Karana similar items, VI is basically saying there is one deity choice for Rangers, IMO.<br />

I am gonna chill, I am sure that the Karana items are coming...</div></div><hr />

WHY DID I CHOOSE KARANA!?!?!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tymoria Brightblade</div><div class="date">05-12-2002, 01:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well I popped these sugestions at the dev corner the other day but I can honestly say I forgot about Karana specific rangers.  I AM Karana, but also half elf so that particular aspect concerning gods of worship escaped me hehe, heres what I sent, and I'll add more to it in a minute concerning the need to add Karana fletching.  Although I think my ideas could easily be applied to this. . . <br />
<br />
&quot;To the Dev corner, <br />
<br />
<br />
Tymoria Brightblade, a Proposal for Fletching<br />
<br />
First of all I believe I should explain myself here.  I am a level 41 ranger; this was my first ever character and really didn?t know anything about what I was doing when I created Tymoria.  In most books I liked the half elven image, part of two worlds and none at the same time, holding some of the cultural mystery of each side. . . it really rather appealed to me.  Then I chose my God, Karana since Tunare worshipers were described as fanatical hehehe. <br />
<br />
 It was after struggling through quite a few levels (to me at the time anyway lol) that I ran into a ranger who said I needed to begin fletching.  No ranger worth their salt would not fletch their own bows and arrows.  So ok, I got started, I found web pages and found info.  From my husband's talk and these sites I discovered that only one ?tradeskill? could be taken past the 200 mark.  I also learned that most of the skills had some form of cultural that half elves could have no part of.  Well, fletching doesn?t have one, so I decided to start fletching.  It was the one skill I could master and still be able to make anything another fletcher tried to make.  I hold great pride in the fact that I raised myself to 205 skill before I hit level 35.  I had a thriving business for a short time even.  <br />
<br />
But then the rumors of cultural wood elven fletching began.  They were denied  by Sony/Verant at Fan Fair events so I didn?t worry.  Now, however, I worry.  I see the recipes are live for this mis-planned venture and frankly. . .it made me more than a little mad.  No, I am not going to turn this into an irrational flame note, I?m sure your getting more of those than you need right now.  What I would like to do is propose what should happen to fletching instead.  Or even, what should happen to half elves excluded from any kind of cultural crafting.<br />
<br />
First off, fletching.<br />
<br />
When one considers the AA skills that were invested into the ranger class as a whole.  Then consider what other races and/or classes can do with those same bows, it seems to me that it would make more sense to do one of two things.  Give the wood elves, halflings and humans cultural fletching.  In this way not even half so many people are left out.    Here are some recipe and product ideas just for examples sake, I wont presume to suggest stats since I don?t know what would be better where, or more reasonable.<br />
<br />
Antonican Longbow<br />
Made in the same manner as the new wood elven cultural bow only in the human culteral manner.<br />
Perhaps with some stats appropriate for human bow users<br />
<br />
Antonican bladed arrows<br />
Same deal with higher damage on them perhaps, with a low range<br />
<br />
Vale Imbued Short Bow<br />
Average dmg/delay, certainly good but not amazing, with stats appropriate to our halfling bow users<br />
Vale Imbued Darts<br />
For our rogue halflings<br />
<br />
I think I make my point here really.<br />
<br />
Another idea would be to make it not cultural specific, but class specific.  I realize you ran into some problems when proposing AA skills for specific classes and skills, and I appreciate that problem.  But I am pretty sure if people were asked which made more sense, wood elf only or ranger only, then ranger would come out on top.  We as a class have more use for this skill than any other class.   Any other class as a bow user merely needs range; delay and ratio are no real issue for them since they mainly pull with the bows anyway.  A ranger however uses them far more often and in more situations.   We have disciplines and AA skills devoted to archery.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The half elf issue.<br />
<br />
Really I suppose the idea I had has been hashed over before and you don?t want to hear it due to repetition.  This could apply to incorrect deity choice or mistakenly GMing the wrong Tradeskill.  I suggest giving half elves quests to do to make them eligible to use the cultural materials of their hometown race.  In Qeynos they would have quests to give them an amulet of some sort, working much like the Shadow Haven faction amulet that would tag them as capable of using the Royal Antonican Forge.<br />
<br />
Half elves residing in Kelethin would have quests to get them in on the wood elven cultural skills.  I would suggest one quest per cultural skill.  One for fletching, a different one for smithing, then tailoring ect.<br />
Obviously they could only be eligible for one race?s cultural in their lifetime.  Once they do the first quest there would be no turning back.<br />
<br />
I suggest this because I know I am not the only person to take this game in its original spirit.  Many people start out for the first character blind to what ?should? be done.  Tymoria is what she is.  She does not have the capability of re-creating herself as a wood elf so as to make great things.  Perhaps she could have a sister or daughter take up where she has to leave off, but she herself cannot.  Many others would say ?oh! Well it?s just a bunch of pixels! Start em over the way we want em!?  Well if I had wanted that I could have deleted the minute I found out about the Helm of the Tracker.  <br />
<br />
Tymoria has friends, clients and a reputation to uphold.  all of this would be changed if she were to re-appear as a level one wood elf.  Besides that, you don?t get resurrected for suiciding.  Which, in a role-play sense is what she would be doing, suiciding over a tradeskill.  She?s too smart for that.  ;)</div></div><hr />

Why not have it so that, the tradeskill you Grandmaster (Go over 200) with, allows you to ignore cultural checks?  Sure, you can master a skill, but to be a true Grandmaster at something, wouldn't that bypass culture?  Maybe have Cultural items only attempt at a skill of 200?<br />
<br />
Just a random thought.<br />
<br />
We seriously need people to try Imbued Plains pebbles and such.  Or at least, non-imbued bows.</div></div><hr />

There are no imbued emeralds in the components for these bows, by the way.  The imbued emeralds go into the Blessed Arrows (same stats as the non-imbued currently, except Tunare only).  The non-imbued arrows are 12 Damage, 150 Delay, all dietys, all races, all bow-using classes.</div></div><hr />

And even if there were uber Karana only items, why would &quot;payback be hell&quot; for the Tunare rangers?<br />
<br />
They've had their items for quite some time now, and the other ranger diety has been completely ignored.<br />
<br />
Had I been designing some quests, I'd make it so Swiftwind was Karana only and Earthcaller was Tunare only =p.  But hey, I'm bitter.</div></div><hr />

It's not exactly hard to figure out why Verant has taken this step, and I consider it entertaining as well as appropriate towards the classical fantasy woodelf heritage. <br />
<br />
The problem with EQ nowadays however is that everyone wants an equivalent. There is no 'you get that, I get this, we're balanced', it's all about 'you get that, I want it too'. So you didn't pick woodelf... that's your grief really. Your race *should* matter in this game. Your diety *should* matter. Now, in the past that hasn't been the case. But obviously that's where Verant is heading.<br />
<br />
Don't ask for equivalents. Ask for something else. There's a human culture just as much as there's a woodelf one. Human cultural skills will most certainly show up in the future. Half Elves... well... that's a toughie. Outcasts and bastards (as in: illegit and unwanted child) rarely develop a culture of their own. On this point I'd simply go with 'you can use the skills of your deity'. If you picked Tunare, you fletch. If you picked Karana, you do something else.<br />

<br />
How is the Helm of the Tracker justified?  How is VI's disregard of all deities other than Tunare and Innoruuk justified?  Yeah, there are small quests for other dieties, but nothing on par with helm of the tracker, and most certainly nothing for Karana on par with that particular quest.<br />
<br />
Why wouldn't Half Elves want to partake in the cultures of their breeding?  <br />
<br />
Also, telling us to hold on for Human Cultural and Half Elf Cultural tradeskills is ridiculous, it's been a very long time since the dieties became important.  And the only dieties that seem to matter are Tunare and Innoruuk still.  Plain stupid.<br />
<br />
Yeah, your diety should matter.  However, on March 16th, 1999 it did NOT matter.  It became important about a year after that date.  I and many others that play this game made their characters with this in mind.  Only to have the rules changed, as is often the case with any dynamic ORPG, and to find out that the diety they chose was one that gets NOTHING.  No benefits, no penalties, just nothing.</div></div><hr />

what a load of self satisfied drivel. <br />
<br />
where are wood-elves the greatest archers? In the hobbit it was a human whom killed smaug with a bow, a wood-elf was best in LoTR. so what?<br />
<br />
Balance isnt done by equivelents but alternatives. There are no reasonable alternatives and for a game which actually requires good weapons and good resists this is a very nice weapon, If Karanans had an alternative armour or weapon or somethign then ok but there is no sign of that at all. Karana's plane needs winning back so I can see justification for no or very few karana items as he's lost his power base but this loads on to many un-judgeable detriments to karana worshipers, many of whom are half-elves and chose way before dieties where more than a name you chose on the set up screen. Also if LoTR is the justification why are half-elfs low wis? Wasn't Elrond the wisest of the wise?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tymoria Brightblade</div><div class="date">05-12-2002, 04:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK folks here we go, the definition of Culture as found in the dictionary accesed from encarta.<br />
<br />
Cul * ture<br />
<br />
1.  The behavior patterns, arts, beliefs, institutions and all other products of human work and thought, especialy as expressed in a particular comunity or period.<br />
2.  Intelectual and artistic activity and the works produced.<br />
3.  Development of intelect through training or education.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok so where do half elves stand in this here. . . . . . <br />
I would say any inteligant being has some sort of behavior pattern, we can certainly create art.  In EQ this would equal to Jewel craft, tailoring or other tradeskills. . . .. . . . .beliefs? well we follow either Karana or Tunare, unless we pick agnostic, those are beliefs, heck even agnostics have a belief, they beleive in no Gods or believe following just one is folly! . . . . .institutions?. . .our guilds! ranger guilds and such to be precise. . .. . community? well lets see, Surefall glade is full of half elven NPCs, but even if it werent, the half elves as a whole form a community of people just as in RL we can refer to groups of people supporting an issue as a community.<br />
<br />
intelectual and artistic activity. . . I dont see anyone denying we can be as artistic and intelectual as the next person. . . development of said intelect through training. . yeah, we learn to work our skills better over the length of our &quot;lives&quot; ,  we train with our guild masters, we learn our skills out in the world. . so lets see.<br />
<br />
We fit every criteria here for having a culture of our own.  NOBODY is cultureless.  It is simply and anthropologicaly impossible.<br />
<br />
So unless somebody can come up with a real reason for no half elven culteral, or the exclusion of half elves from the culteral crafts of thier parent races through quests, the &quot;no culture&quot; argument; wether from players or from Verant,  holds no water at all.  ;)<br />

edit: it seems like no one's mentioned this, so... half elves actually get the widest selection of cultural armor.  if i recall correctly, they can wear human, dark elf, and wood elf cultural armor, so shouldn't this bow be half-elf usable if they worship tunare? <br />
and i like the idea of specialization... human rangers being more melee based, wood elves more archery based...  i wonder if they'll incorporate any of that into EQ2?</div></div><hr />

Um, no, unless by &quot;throughout fantasy&quot; you mean &quot;since D&amp;D and its derivatives&quot;.<br />
<br />
This is outrageous.  It's bad enough that I can't make these new bows, being human, but I can't even USE them because I chose Karana 3 years before these bows were added to the game?  That bow is better than a Wind Saber, which is what I'm currently using!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, its a very nice bow, however, in terms of DPS the Double Recurve from DN is better, compars favorably to the Bow of the Huntsman, and probably costs considerably less than what you will find these new bows selling for, if you can find someone with the skill to make a Thunderbolt.  There is also the Bow of Doom which is easily within reach of higher level guilds in the small to medium size range.<br />
<br />
If you are thinking about it as a range slot item, there are tons with better stats, some of them bows as well.<br />
<br />
IF this were the hands down best item for its slot/purpose, then I think there would be room for this complaining.  However, its not, and in the end, there are easy and less expensive items to replace that are far cheaper.<br />
<br />
The Helm of the Tracker I can see as a valid complaint since a guild capable of taking down the Kael giants isn't always up to the task of Tormax, Dain, THO, etc, where the upgrades are found.<br />
<br />
Helm of the Tracker? yes<br />
This bow? no<br />
The new arrows? no, unless the blessed versions are upgraded when they fix them.</div></div><hr />

also its not trivial at 250 fletching.<br />
AND you need a total of 11 combines or so to make it. all of which can fail costeing you extra time and money.</div></div><hr />

Yah, so it's not the best bow in the game, so what?  Don't be so greedy and selfish.  Why can't we have something to compare it to?  I have no tradeskill culture, I have been denied the use of the HoT, and now these bows.  And god only knows how much more.<br />

The last one is really nice - pitched just right for the level of effort it'll take to make one, and something a dedicated fletcher can take genuine pride in using right into the end game. <br />
<br />
Even though I'm a Tunarean woodie, I'd love to see either Karana equivalents of these and/or a new tradeskills type quest which is ranger only and involves upgrading the Raincaller to something comaparable with the 4th cultural bow. Personally I think a new Ranger only Bow quest might well be on the cards - this Rich Waters guy seems full of good ideas and enthusiasm for tradeskills. The new druid cabbage spell quest seems a great model that could be adapted for every class...</div></div><hr />

There's a reason they call it modern fantasy you know. EverQuest wasn't written by Tolkien. Deal with it. Then again, this negates my claim towards woodelf heritage.

A while ago Verant said the reason Half Elves do not get there own culture is that: <br />
<br />
A) They are not pure blood.<br />
B) They are supposed to be able to use the results from both Human and Elven Cultures.. (Key words, supposed to, I'll agree that Verant has messed this up, but that is what they said)</div></div><hr />

<br />
To the people who said congrats: thanks. It was very exciting to have this work.<br />
<br />
To the people asking about the imbue: there is no emerald, and no imbue. The bows come out Tunare only just because. This bow uses a branch of planar oak foraged from PoG, from which you can draw your own conclusions.<br />
<br />
To the people unhappy about the karana thing: sorry, I can't help you there.<br />
<br />
To the people who said how much: No idea. There are, to my knowledge, two of these things in all of EQ now. (Someone else posted they had succeeded also). Hard to set a price. But yes almost every ranger I know wants one.<br />
<br />
The thing _I_ happen to like about this bow is that it's for me. As a rogue, I don't get chances at any good bows. And frankly, nor should I. Yes the Bow of Doom might be rogue equipable, but who in their right mind will give this to a rogue over a ranger? Nobody, and rightly so.<br />
<br />
This however is a fantastic bow for me. I can replace my idol of the thorned, my runed bone fork and my old bow (Talisen) all in one shot, and always have a ranged weapon ready. It makes me glad I went with Tunare rather than being an agnostic, arguably a smarter choice for a rogue.<br />
<br />
If you want one and start looking, realize this bow will probably never be trivial, and failures are to be expected so be nice to your fletcher if it's not you.<br />

I belive that humans can worship tunare.  Why they would want too, I do not know.   Your opinions seem off base as you are trying to start a race related topic when race doesn't matter, just religion.  Sure some races have to be a certain religion, but i chose karana on my second ranger after helm of tracker came out.  I could care less about tunare only equipment.  It's a nice bow, I would like one like it, but I don't have to have it or an equivalant.</div></div><hr />

I'm sorry but this definition to me would not help Half-Elves getting their own culture.  To me this would mean Half-Elves share whatever culture they were raised in.  Tunare Worshippers Wood-Elf, Karana Worshipers Human.  I still think that any sort of cultural Fletching should have been class specific not race.  <br />
<br />
All rangers should be able to make these bows and not Bards. Rogues, Druids and warriors.  To me there is no way to justify that a class that can not even equip a bow can make them better than a Ranger.  (Who Verant has proclaimed Masters of Archery by AAXP skills)<br />
<br />
It doesn't matter if wood-elves in other games get bonuses to Archery attacks.  In D&amp;D 2nd edition (Never Played 3rd)  Wood Elves didn't get a bonus to Archery RANGERS did.  Besides like I said above Verant has proclaimed Rangers the masters of Archery not Wood-Elves.</div></div><hr />

As for being Tunare only, thats fine but it would be nice if they added something for Karana worshippers too.  As a half-elf Ive been hoping for a long time that they would eventually add something for us too, but it doesnt look likely....<br />

Why should wood elves be THE choice for a ranger?  Hardly promotes character individuality does it?  When I created Meecham over 2 years ago I liked the idea of a rough woodsman type who worshipped the god of storms.

<br />
I can remember seeing only one archery range in Norrath... and that was in Surefall Glade (where my Halfelven Karana Ranger started out).  Other than line-of-sight, race plays no part in archery.  In that case, humans should be the best archers.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying I should get Woodelf cultural (hey, I could be half Highelf or half Darkelf too).  However, Verant should've considered Karana Rangers when they made these bows.  Especially after implementing the HoT.  <br />
<br />
All epic'd Rangers helped Tunare AND Karana.<br />
<br />
To anyone who thinks that this is fair: &quot;What downside have you seen from your choice of race/religion?&quot;  Anyone playing a Woodelf Tunare Ranger has seen only benefits (tailoring/fletching/HoT) to their choice of race/religion and no drawbacks.  When you talk about 'consequences' regarding character choices, please bear in mind that you have paid none of those consequences.  Also bear in mind that since I started playing in April of 2000, these 'consequences' were unknown and not warned of at character selection.<br />
<br />
Finally, I know that there are better dropped bows.  Part of the benefit of these new crafted items is that they will be good for improving skill.  If I want to become a Grandmaster Fletcher I have a severe drawback compared to Woodelves.  Of course I shouldn't be surprised since I'm facing the same drawback in tailoring.</div></div><hr />

Well if Half elves are looked at as outcasts wouldn't they strive to creat their own means of survival? Armor, weapons..etc<br />
Choosing a Ranger and living through the you suck period was hard enough, now they reward Half of the Rangers with things like Helm of the Tracker, really nice Fletching items, Cultural smithing is fine because well it's like family recipes passed down by a goddess Tunare right?<br />

Really disappointed in the between race bashing. I can't believe that amongst the members of the class that has been put through the balancing ringer over and over again that there would be those who would fail to see that an inequity might exist. Using fantasy fiction in order to try to justify an inequity is at best self-serving justification, and at worst in-your-face-I-want-to-be-better-than-youism. I'm sure that somehow fantasy fiction could have been used to justify our defense being left at 200, our offensive caps left at 240, and our mana costs left double penalized. For the 95% of rangers out there without a primal bow or bow of doom, Tunarean worshippers just had 5 str/agi/dex/wis 50 hp/mana 10 fire/cold/magic added to their stats, while Karanans were left unchanged. This bow is soon to become standard equipment - the expense may be atrocious, and the failure rate as well, but these things are still going to be selling for 5k in two months. Pretty much if you could afford a DN bow already, you're going to have this.<br />
<br />
I'm a wood elf, and it's embarassing to see this attitude from other wood elves. When the Plane of Storms comes out, I'm sure Karana worshippers will get theirs, and if they get theirs x10, I sure hope you Tunareans aren't going to come here looking to discuss the inequities of all items you can't use, because you're going to be preaching on deaf ears.<br />
<br />
When you have more than the next guy, you look for ways to share; didn't anyone teach you guys that?</div></div><hr />

Just a point of curiosity:  would the Double Recurve have a higher DPS?  I think the DEX modifier on the new bow could make it slightly better.<br />

<br />
It seems to me, however that the real issue here is not one of every race/class having the same access to the same items, but of BALANCE.<br />
<br />
Using LoTR as an example:<br />
<br />
One can argue that Aragorn and Legolas are both Rangers.  Legolas is very obviously MUCH better with a bow than Aragorn is.  However, Aragorn is FAR superior to Legolas with a sword.<br />
<br />
Quite frankly, I would have NO problems with these bows being Tunare or Woodelf only were there a SIMILARLY powerful weapon that was able to be made by Human or Karana worshipers.<br />
<br />
Just as there is an obvious niche advantage for being a Tunare Ranger, there should be a niche advantage for being a Karana Ranger.<br />
<br />
However, there is not, and therein lies the problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wow, Verant's attempt at adding roleplaying is met by whining, bickering, arguing about how it's not fair.  I'm &quot;surprised&quot;.<br />
<br />
Please, choose the character that fits you and what you want in the game.  If a human following Karana fits you, then play one.  You'll be blind, but it's part of the choice.  You won't ever use this bow or a Helm of the Tracker, but you wouldn't be jealous of it .... and you wouldn't blame your diety for not having something like it for you.  That would be ludicrus.  Stop trying to reduce EQ to a numbers game and start playing to have fun ..... that in itself will end this argument.  <br />
<br />
And stop trying to compare EQ to all other fantasy.  If EQ needed a basis outside itself for it's interpretations of it's own world, then it would be &quot;Lord of the Rings Online&quot; or something similar.  It's EQ.  EQ has it's own set of cultural definitions and racial definitions.  If Verant decrees that it feels half elf, human, and halfling rangers to be the bastard children of the EQ world, then they are.  And that seems to be the definition they're going for.   <br />
Tunare spends more of her time on Rangers than Karana does, it fits perfectly into roleplaying ........ and all you can do is complain.</div></div><hr />

Seriously, having deity only items is good thing as long as it has some kind of balance.  And there is simply no balance between Karana's worshiper's and Tunare's with respect to deity only items at this time.<br />

Be happy that VI is paying some attention to the ranger class and the poorly thought through fletching trade.  (I personally think that exceeding 200 in fletching shouldn't count as a penalty--much like tinkering doesn't count against gnomes).  Sure, this creates somewhat of an aftermarket, but honestly, the trade has so little economic value.</div></div><hr />

Aeril, hiding behind the RP flag is cowardly.  I'm all for RP and I think a lot of people would have more fun if they stopped parsing and started emoting.<br />
<br />
But don't sit there from the high ground and tell me I should just RP my way out of this deficit.  Tell me how a WEF Ranger who is KOS in Kelethin from PoG raids is more entitled to this bow than I am.  RP that for me please. :mad: <br />
<br />
If this were truly a RP addition, there would be quests and faction checks and the like.  Instead it checks against a decision many of us made over 2 years ago.  If my faction check with the goddess herself comes back as ally, I still can't use this bow.<br />
<br />
Ivandyr's Hoop notwithstanding (who wants to trade their HoT for one?) there is no benefit right now to being a Karana ranger.  A rich RP environment (and non-RP environment also) would have pros and cons to different races and classes.  Right now all the pros are for WEF Tunare and the cons are HUM/HEF Karana.</div></div><hr />

The mightril arrows I was referrnig to you dont have to farm anything for just buy the components and run back and forth between Felwhite and Kelethin alot. The failure rate stinks and so does the skill up rate.<br />

The arrows trivial over 200, yes?<br />

Then they're a better avenue for skill gain (to their trivial point) than anything available to non-elven fletchers.</div></div><hr />

You are required to work on your smithing first. Once done, you require  a lot of extra combines per 20 attempts on the arrows. The small bricks of mithril cost 7pp each(20-25 per 20attempts at an arrow). The large bricks cost 28pp each(10-14 per 20 attempts at an arrow). Failure rates approach 95%, skill increases come maybe once per 120 arrow attempts, and arrows sell back to vendors for 1silver. I have found it is both cheaper and much much faster to skill up on darkwoods, and sell the results back to vendors.<br />

Neither choice is really viable compared to the condensed arrow option.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Osprey_luclin</div><div class="date">05-14-2002, 08:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some personal experience regarding skilling up on mithril arrows:<br />
<br />
Frankly, I found it impractical, at least in the 202-230 range. <br />
<br />
First, you have to do a LOT of legwork running around getting mithril and doing the smithing combines. I already had more than enough smithing skill so that wasn't the issue, but if you don't that's one more factor to work in.<br />
<br />
Second, it's expensive. You're blowing in the range of 15-18pp per combine. Compare that to doing rough darkwood bows, where I was blowing 25pp per combine on success (and 225 on failure). Yes, it seems like less, but it's a time vs money thing. I can stand in Shadowhaven and do darkwoods like mad, but it takes a couple hours to set up for some stacks of mithril.<br />
<br />
Third, I found the skill up rates to be terrible. No I didn't keep statistics. But the failure rates were very high, and the skill ups few. I have heard (but not confirmed) that you stand better chance of a skill up on a success than a failure, so these are not a good idea from a skill up perspective for low 200's fletching.<br />
<br />
Last night I did a run of arrows because endless-quiver rangers were asking.  And at 231 with Geerlock, my success rate was around 25-40%.  This _might_ be a viable option once you're over 235 and looking at Shadewood, but I don't think it's good until at least then.</div></div><hr />

I chose Tunare at the time, because of 1)my first character was a dwarf and grew up in the butcherblock/greater faydark area  2) I was so sick of all the rain in the Karanas, there was NO way I was going to be a Karana ranger<br />
<br />
I'm feeling like a minority here ; And yes, if there are no Karana ranger usable bows, that is lame ; But, as was pointed out earlier, half elves get a broad choice of armors and weapons, including other race cultural stuff , I assume it may be discovered that there could be another bow out there, not made by wood elves that is on par with this latest bow that Karana rangers can use (?) ; It probably has just not been found yet</div></div><hr />

<br />
Regarding the comments about elves getting a bonus for archery in most RPGs.<br />
<br />
Daegan Quistfeather states - &quot;In D&amp;D 2nd edition (Never Played 3rd) Wood Elves didn't get a bonus to Archery RANGERS did.&quot;<br />
<br />
Actually in 2nd ed. Advanced Dungeons and Dragons, elves got a +1 to hit when using any bow other than a crossbow, even if they did not have it as a weapon proficiency.  This bonus also included the use of the longsword or short sword.  The only weapon based bonus rangers got in D&amp;D was the free ability of two weapon use (dual wield in EQ) without penalty if their armor was studded leather or lighter.<br />
<br />
Ventrue here's a list.  2nd and 3rd ed. D&amp;D, Torg, Rifts, Middle Earth, Record of the Lodoss War, Ars Magica, DragonQuest, and Crestfallen.  It seems to be a default &quot;racial ability&quot; given in nearly any RPG that incorporates elves as a player race choice.<br />
<br />
Andric d`Regor states - &quot;where are wood-elves the greatest archers?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dennis McKiernon's novels indicate that elves were unmatched archers in the realm of Mithgar.  This is also the case in Elizabeth Moon's Paksenarrion series, in the Forgotten Realms timeline (Those novels all use the same continuity even though they're by different writers.) it was the elves who taught humans magic and archery.<br />
<br />
And  &quot;Wasn't Elrond the wisest of the wise?&quot;<br />
<br />
Elrond embraced his elven heritage and classifies as elven for all intents and purposes.  Half elves who worship Tunare could be said to claim their elven heritage whereas those who chose Karana selected their human side.<br />
<br />
Zeyk states - &quot;How is VI's disregard of all deities other than Tunare and Innoruuk justified?&quot;<br />
<br />
Check again and this time try looking beyond the &quot;elven/dark elven&quot; viewpoint.<br />
Ogres, barbarians, and trolls who worship Rallos Zek start non-KoS initially in Kael. That's a nice little bonus in Velious, a pity bards who worship Veeshan don't get the same consideration in Skyshrine or Temple of Veeshan, but I don't hear them complaining about it.<br />
Dwarves, gnomes and halflings get Brellium armor which buries most of the other cultural armors. (As it should from a traditional role playing perspective.)<br />
There is Karana only armor also for halflings, short races and rangers/druids of other races.  Ogres and trolls get Zek armor, Barbarians get Zek or Tribunal worshippers only armor and weapons.  In fact there's armor that is deity specific for nearly every god that can be worshipped in EQ.  There's even Prexus and Solusek Ro worshippers only jewelry.  <br />
<br />
Shiphro states - &quot;there is no benefit right now to being a Karana ranger. A rich RP environment (and non-RP environment also) would have pros and cons to different races and classes.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Draeven states - &quot;Come look at it from our side?&quot;<br />
<br />
If you role play in EQ and/or care about your standing with other groups enough that you make a point to try not to ruin faction, you will NOT have access to every item to your class, period.  If you choose a race/class combination based solely on the items that combination can use, eventually you're going to see some combination you like better that you can't have.  While I do role play in EQ on occasion, you won't hear me claiming Verant encourages roleplaying much in EverQuest beyond the course and scope of playing the chosen roles Verant has deemed for a class (I don't like the fact that level 60 rangers are currently being pushed into turning into an archer.) but they are at least making a decent attempt besides being perma-KoS in some places, albeit slowly.  There are some racial abilities that make those races better suited to some classes and activities than others.  For instance, ogres cannot be stunned from the front and start with the highest strength and stamina, this makes them, on average, (not always the case though) better tanks than most other warrior allowable races.<br />
<br />
For all you people whining about how much half elven rangers are screwed over in the game by Verant...  When the cultural armors and weapons (restricted by race not deity) first came out half elves can use dark elf, high elf, wood elf, and human armors and weapons.  That's an extensive selection considering half elves are not derived from the high elf or dark elven bloodlines per Verant, you are hardly screwed out of anything.  Being able to walk the fence is an advantage in most cases and one that half elves do in general being both human, elven, and neither.  I always considered it one of the advantages to selecting half elf as a race, but once in awhile its going to come around and prove to be a detriment.  <br />
Since we're going to discuss specific items -- let's continue with Ivandyr's Hoop, an item useable by half elves and human rangers but not wood elf rangers (or halfling now).  Wood elves were left out because originally the earring was meant for dark races only (Dark elf, troll, ogre) and later changed to included all non-good races.  So wood elves were excluded based on religion.  It was one of the best earrings (and still is a nice one at low-mid levels) in the game for a long time and there was no comparable alternative available to wood elves.  Oh well.  Honestly I find this whining about not being able to use the Helm of the Tracker as moronic as the thought of me complaining because I can't use the Staff of the Serpent even though my one hand blunt skill caps higher than an enchanters, it has great resists, hit points, and I'd love the right click haste.  Just like Ivandyr's Hoop, the Helm of the Tracker does not give anyone some power or ability to make them far and away a superior ranger to a nearly identically equipped human or half elven ranger of the same level.  <br />
<br />
Yzen Danek states - &quot;Using fantasy fiction in order to try to justify an inequity is at best self-serving justification, and at worst in-your-face-I-want-to-be-better-than-youism.&quot;<br />
<br />
Most people I've encountered play human or wood elf rangers for role playing purposes or the challenge of not being &quot;super choice&quot; with a given race/class.  I really can't make that claim about half elves I've encountered since almost every half elf ranger I've met chose half-elf  to see in the dark but didn't want the &quot;sucky strength and stamina&quot; of elves.  Yes there's an 'in your face I want to be better than youism' attitude here but it's not just coming from the wood elf side.  It sounds to me like the half elf Karana worshippers want everything but don't want the drawbacks associated with those choices.  Except for one enchanter who makes such comments to deliberately provoke my ranger in character, (Hi, Val.) the numerous remarks to the effect of Tunare being a skank whore/slut/tramp etc. I hear don't come from people playing worshippers of Innoruuk, Cazic, Bertox, or agnostics, but Karana worshipping rangers who are jealous because they can't equip a helm.  Odd but that doesn't quite strike me as a fitting attitude for a Karana revering ranger to take about a deity allied with their god.  It sure doesn't inspire me, as a player, to petition Verant to introduce more Karana ranger only items, as I'm not one to encourage obnoxious behavior in-character or out of character.  I also don't see any Karana worshipping rangers have to take a faction hit in their home town if they decide to participate in killing Tunare to get the sap encrusted branch or braid of golden hair.  Again, a tangible benefit of being able to select someone other than Tunare for a deity.<br />
<br />
Gilagon states - &quot;Some play for other reasons. And creating imbalances between members of the same class like this deity specific stuff does is just out of line.&quot;<br />
<br />
For those who don't role play, aside from having a wider armor and weapon selection than humans or wood elves, here's the another advantage half elves have on a day to day basis, your pros and cons.<br />
<br />
Base Statistics<br />
Humans   Str- 80   Sta- 85  Agi-   85  Dex- 75  Wis- 80  <br />
Half Elf     Str- 75   Sta- 80  Agi- 100  Dex- 85  Wis- 65  <br />
Wood Elf  Str- 70   Sta- 75  Agi- 105  Dex- 80  Wis- 85  <br />
Halfling     Str- 75   Sta- 85  Agi- 105  Dex- 90  Wis- 85  <br />
<br />
Every race has at least one highest stat in the ones most relevant to rangers, well except wood elves who are tied with halflings.  But ruling out halflings on the grounds that they are a recent addition to the ranger class, wood elves got agility and wisdom.  Overall the &quot;worthless stats&quot; wisdom only being of benefit for tradeskills and agility's impact on armor class extremely limited, stamina and strength being the important stats as far as mob killing for raids and XP/AXP harvesting, which is what the majority of the game revolves around and be honest, most of you made your choice and assign points with that fact in mind.  And yes I say choice, if you make a half elf or human you can choose to follow Tunare if you want, wood elves don't get that option.<br />
<br />
Half elves got the BEST of all possible worlds from their elven and human sides, the highest or second highest base starting stat on everything except wisdom but that's okay because you got your kicks for 55 levels by picking on the &quot;physically weakest ranger race.&quot; (Did you have a memory lapse and forget that Tunarean rangers can't obtain that helm until then?)  I can't speak for other servers but there aren't many &quot;high level&quot; wood elf rangers on mine.  The number of half elf Karana worshipping rangers is percentage wise, on par with the percentage of halfling druids most often selected by what I call &quot;min-maxers&quot;.  Half elves got the strength and stamina of humans and the night vision of elves that humans didn't.  <br />
<br />
Andric d`Regor states - &quot;Balance isn't done by equivelents but alternatives.&quot;<br />
<br />
Exactly, wood elves started with some of the lowest physical stats and higher &quot;mental&quot; attributes and its only just now starting to pay off in game now that Verant is getting around to expanding the tradeskills.  Wood elves are reaping the benefit of their highest base statistic.  Again this comes back to some races being better suited to certain activities than others.  And this kind of fits with a role played image of elves being artisans and craftsmen of the finest quality weapons and armor.<br />
<br />
Tymoria Brightblade states - &quot;So unless somebody can come up with a real reason for no half elven culteral, or the exclusion of half elves from the culteral crafts of thier parent races through quests, the &quot;no culture&quot; argument.&quot;<br />
<br />
While I personally agree that half elves are not completely  cultureless they live in one or the other, it is arguable that the reason they cannot make the relevant cultural unique items due to the fact that members of said culture would not agree to teach someone not of their race how to make the items in question as they would view a half elf as a member of &quot;the other race&quot; for such intents and purposes.  Humans would view a half elf as an elf and elves would view the half elf as human in determining whether or not they'd deign to impart their cultural secrets.<br />
<br />
Insofar as Planes of Power introducing Karana worshippers only items in the game, so long as the items are not game breaking or grossly unbalancing, I don't care.  As a weapon, the Blessed Faydark Thunderbolt has a decent damage delay rato;  good but there is better.  For a range slot stat enhancer, again nice but there is better.  Insofar as game balance is concerned, I hope they do toss in a few Karana ranger only recipe items for humans and half elves of equal quality as well (Halflings already have some.) and honestly expect they have already but have yet to be found or have it in the works to be out soon.  The cultural armor recipes were not originally released en-masse for all but race by race as I recall.</div></div><hr />

I don't know about you, but to this day I have not the funds to either do this quest or purchase the earring outright.<br />
Your argument on half-elves being able to use other races cultural armor is pitiful at best, considering the stats on said peices (not including the latest patch), and I would happily trade you whatever stat you want for added wisdom anytime.<br />
This is my first character. I had no extensive knowledge of the game, then. Had I, things would be different today. I believe that the disgust that you hear in all my half elven, Karana worshipping brethren's voices is not so much envy of what one gets over another.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tymoria Brightblade</div><div class="date">05-14-2002, 05:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tymoria Brightblade states - &quot;So unless somebody can come up with a real reason for no half elven culteral, or the exclusion of half elves from the culteral crafts of thier parent races through quests, the &quot;no culture&quot; argument.&quot;<br />
<br />
While I personally agree that half elves are not completely  cultureless they live in one or the other, it is arguable that the reason they cannot make the relevant cultural unique items due to the fact that members of said culture would not agree to teach someone not of their race how to make the items in question as they would view a half elf as a member of &quot;the other race&quot; for such intents and purposes.  Humans would view a half elf as an elf and elves would view the half elf as human in determining whether or not they'd deign to impart their cultural secrets.<br />
 <br />
<br />
amd in a previus post in this thread I sugested a way around that.  Just because half elves dont start out being trusted enough does not make them irredeamable.  Highly Difficult quests for the correct faction or perhaps an amulet such as that from Shadow Haven to make a half elf capable of the culteral skills of one of thier parent races would make perfect sense.  Only one race choice possible and no turning back once you had done the quest.<br />
<br />
Insofar as half elves being able to wear all sorts of culteral armor?. . Personaly, I would be tottaly willing to dump that in favor of being abel to MAKE culteral.  A large part of my character is a tradesmans heart.  Being barred from this facet of her chosen skill is like being barred from the gods, she would much prefer to be able to craft great things than wear the great things made by another's hand. ;)</div></div><hr />

Cant think of one? didnt think so.&quot;<br />
<br />
You're right, I can think of several range slot items that give in or about that range of 50 hit pts, the Bronze Statue of Bathezid, Tiny Velium Gargoyle, Goranga Idol, Transient Idol, Herb sandwich, Idol of the Thorned, and the Ornate War Totem.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paldaan</div><div class="date">05-14-2002, 05:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Grrrrr.  Posts from people like Millikin sure piss me off.  The major question is why are major items introduced for Tunare deity in the first place without any apparent consideration given to Karana worshiping Rangers.  As a Karana ranger, I don't mind if I don't have access to everything that a wood elf has access to, but I would at least like some items of equivalent power.  I didn't make the Ivandyr's Hoop, but I think Woodies should be able to wear them.  But that bow totally kicks ass, as does the HoT.  What is there for Karana rangers?  An earring with WIS on it that most Rangers would never wear.  Big whoop-de-do.  They're creating an imbalance between different deities of Rangers which was not there 2 years ago when a lot of us created our characters.  If they're going to make a bunch of stuff specifically for a certain deity and introduce them at this point, then they should introduce items for all deities or give us a mechanism for changing our deity if we see fit.  It just seems like all Karana rangers are now being penalized for decisions we made 2 years ago.  This is pretty much the point you made at the end of your message, but the first 90% of it just seems like an imaginary justification of why things have been done they way they were (Half elves and culture.  We'd have just as much of a possibility to learn BOTH cultures as to not learn any.  The fact is we would have a culture of our own instead of none at all.  Surefall Glade is our home, and we would have cultures in our home).<br />

Insofar as Planes of Power introducing Karana worshippers only items in the game, so long as the items are not game breaking or grossly unbalancing, I don't care.  [/B]<br />
<br />
so basically as long as your not screwed its ok huh? you spend all that time saying how its right and proper that your fellow ranges get screwed and you can't countenance the possibility having the boot on the other foot?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am not impressed with the rest of your post.  (BTW, white space is your friend.)  It is nothing but a self-serving attempt to justify an inequity with weak rationalizations.<br />
<br />
Yes, there are benefits and consequences to all race/class choices.  But right now, Wood Elf/Tunare Rangers are getting the benefits, and Human-Half Elf/Karana Rangers are suffering the consequences.  Somehow I doubt you would be quite so accepting if the situation were reversed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Toshiden Satori</div><div class="date">05-14-2002, 07:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Altho as a Karana worshiper I wish I could use this bow also, the last post I saw by Millikin in regard to the 50hp ranged item comment.....I would agree. If all you want is 50hp in your range slot, go buy a goranga idol. Now, if you want all of the stats this bow has, as well as it being a bow to use, then yes, Karana rangers, and probably low end rangers are a bit screwed. *shrug* Nothing we can do about it tho. <br />
<br />
Also, to the person who commented on the platinum dragon totem, its primary/secondary only, so in other words, if you are thinking of farming one for your range slot, you will be severely disappointed.</div></div><hr />

I personally found some on the ground there running around looking to see if this was true for myself. It doesn't look like a bag on the ground like I thought it would, but rather it looks like a lighter green clump on the ground. Kinda like how when you drop slush water in Velious it looks like a darkish blob, this one is a lighter green and is in the grass. Only found one, but was only there for 10 minutes running around before I had to go somewhere else. The loc for where I was standing when I found the piece was neg 1893, neg 1023 - if it actually spawns in the same spot all the time. ;)</div></div><hr />

I'm currently lvl 60 and shooting a Bow of the Huntsman.  I'm still having loads of fun.  My idea of fun does not include being loot hungry, having to be uber and whining for things i don't have or cant get.  I would rather spend my energy hunting with friends and helping guildmates.</div></div><hr />
