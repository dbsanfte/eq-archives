<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Word is that the Int casters will now be able to research some of their pre-LoY, formerly drop-only, rare spells.  Graffe's has gone so far as to post the complete list of requirements for the Wizards.<br />
<br />
Anyone heard anything similar for us?  I know we don't get research... but c'mon... someone throw us a bone, here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Seems it invovles spells up to Luclin.  Some folks that were clearing jails in PoJ, acquired some new types of pages.  This was on Thursday's patch day.<br />
<br />
As far as priests being able to gain some sort of alternate way to acquire spells... dunno.</div></div><hr />
