<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>phileepae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I did this with my monk and it worked, so i thought, why not try with shaman?  I got my shaman to 29 and decided to head over to ds.  The only things you want to solo now are zelniaks and shrooms, but i talk about zelniaks.  First, they are not that great at magical resistance, i usually land a malise anyways for a backbone.  The regular zelniaks can con from dark blue to yellow to a 29, and the large ones are always red.  Now that we know what to hunt, we gotta knwo the best place to find them, and there is one spot that i have found.  When you leave netherbian lair, you take a right and follow that wall allll the way to the shroom temple place, pass the temple, but stop in a small area beside the temple against the wall.  Pull the zelniaks onto the rock wall, and just run back and forth along the wall using root/affliction/envenomed breathe.  I don't bother with slow, cause i never melee, psh :P.  With the yellow zelniaks, i would get a full blue when i killed it, evens gave me a little less, and blues would give me half a blue.  You can stay in this small little area until 40, but at 40 the regular zelniaks will be almost all light blue, but you can stick with the large ones.  Hope this helps out you fellow shaman, I konw i'm going to stay here till 40, tiz great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>DarkSidhe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You're missing out on so much more there...the temple is full of tasty shrooms. I'm still finding about 30% dark blues there at 39, and best part is I don't have to go run through lightcrawler-infested fields to find a zelinak that isn't being smacked down already.<br />
Also, the tribals just a bit farther along (near GE and ME) are still mostly dark blue, and just starting to LB out at 39. As a bonus, you can get weapons worth up to 4 plat and acrylia drops. (Note: none of this information is accurate on Drinal...leave the tribals alone, there's nothing to see here...these aren't the neanderthals you're looking for, you don't wish to detain me any longer. Hehe.)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>robert135</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">warning, DO NOT  try to fight any &quot;blood thirsty&quot; wolves. They suck! They are around lvl 32-33 and have over 2500 hps, Yes the same hps a HG has, at a much lower lvl, so if one aggro's you just hit the zone.<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW when I got my monks butt handed to him by one of these, I had done about 500-600 dmg, and was like HUH 1 bub gone? FD.<br />
<br />
One of the few times I have actually had to scroll up and recount in disbelief.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kenlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">So...what is the exact loc of this place? <br />
<br />
I was at some sort of house with only 2 spawns. It was near a similar house that contained 4 (quest?) npcs. I killed 5 shrooms and 1 zelniak before I got chased off by 2 wolves. Nasty little buggers.<br />
<br />
Was I at the right place? Sure doesn't seem like it....EQAtlas doesn't have anything marked Shroom Palace :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zoulen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Kenlaan, you can't miss it if you turn right out of the Netherbian Lair zone and follow the wall.<br />
<br />
Robert, maybe you found a very improved version of the blood thirsty wolf, but I just took one down today that was red to me. They have a good amount of HPs, but nowhere near 2500. More like 800-1200. And not very resistant for a red con.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">the Blood thirsty wolves undercon by quite a bit. They hit for high in the 70's and 80's and have a crapload of HP.<br />
<br />
And look out for the tenacious Zelniak... that thing is WAY underconned... I attacked it at level 38, conned blue to me. I lead with a slow which it resisted... then another slow was resisted, and so was my attempt at a scourge AND a root(I didn't have Any malise line spells mammed becuase normal zels almost never resist). This whole time it was attacking my puppy for about 90 damage each hit and by the time I had sat down and memmed Malise my dog was down to 1 bubble of health. So I malised, rooted -resisted, again, resisted, again finally stuck... for about 5 seconds... and then it ran after me and I had to zone. I was kind of embarassed having to zone becuase of a Dblue monster while I had KEI.</div></div><hr />

<br />
your not a druid that root/dots yrou a shaman, get up in that grill, let dog dog out, and rip up some ****!</div></div><hr />

Heh heh  yup, get your self a nice 2hander, and bash things to puddin'; and if after getting whatever is whackin' you good n mad, you are still getting pwnd, pet kite it... no reason to zone.  ;)   You're not a druid, and dogdog isnt a tank...remember that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Auraura_H</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Where did you get the Intel's Hammer? That is awesome, I want one... Hehehe!<br />
<br />
I want a different shield. I have my shield of falsehood from the beginning of my epic but it drops my charisma and my dexterity down, and I've noticed a performance change in my character as a result. Any suggestions?<br />
<br />
My shaman is in DIRE need of re-outfitting on weapon and shield, and possibly her footgear but I'm so freakin poor I can't buy anything, not even spells. =P<br />
