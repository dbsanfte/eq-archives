<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>raburr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok Kitty shamaness here...............<br />
<br />
I click off Vah Shir models in options loffing in hoping to see a different kitty and maybe some less frame rate intensive areas of the game...................<br />
Well &lt;grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr&gt; I get to char selection and what does miss kitty see????? A FRICKIN NAKED HUMAN ! ANd to boot once I reselected kitty model and reloged I had no pants and my bottom half was a bengal tiger look and top half was my spotted cheettah look I selected as my skin color. Im looking a bit freakish.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok so basically what I'm wanting to know is.......Has anyone gotten this pre-luclin Kitty model to work? And if so what option do u have on and off to make it so?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">VI stated the new 'low poly' models for Vah Shir have been loaded, but they would have to issue another patch to allow you to enable them...it's in a different section of code apparently.<br />
<br />
So right now they don't work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">They screwed the patch.<br />
<br />
Also, while we’ve included the new ‘old-world’ Vah Shir models in the patch, you won’t be able to turn them on yet. We’ll have to patch another file to allow you to choose to turn them off in the interface. That should happen soon.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>raburr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">thx i misread that to mean u couldnt turn them off yet, as-in still greyed out. Saw that u could deselect so thought they had patched.<br />
 Thanks guys ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I just unselected the luclin vah shir models and the new old vah shirs show up fine.... :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Go into your eqclient.ini, and fine the lines that say &quot;Showvahshirmale=true&quot; and &quot;showvashirfemale=true&quot; and switch them to false. Worked fine for me.<br />
<br />
The only thing the patch didn't do, was allow you to turn the models on or off from inside the game itself at the options screen.<br />
<br />
Word of warning though: The old models, while less memory intensive, are FUGLY.</div></div><hr />
