<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Maddcovv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I keep seeing posts about what verant said and thought i would set it straight. <br />
<br />
I asked the guys in the developers meeting what about a group shrink? <br />
<br />
they looked at me like i was joking...<br />
<br />
I said no Im serious, how would you like to be the shaman who runs from group to group in a raid shrinking everyone and when they die or are turned to a bug in griegs you have to get out of your group make someone get out of their group and shrink em again... and again<br />
<br />
they then said..  well that would take a confirmation box we dont want shamans running around shrink other groups<br />
<br />
to witch eveyone replied ok sure no problem!!<br />
<br />
THEN THEY SAID....  well I dont think we can do that . We are supporting 2 interfaces right now the new and old one and it would require too much coding to add a confirmation box<br />
<br />
<br />
so.. there ya go. I just wanted to clear that up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sounds like an off-the-cuff remark before they had really thought about it. <br />
<br />
The real problem is that the ability to pop up 1 to 80 pop-up boxes simultaneously is that someone could grief a raid with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>molgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">let's start a mass mailing campaign...<br />
<br />
everyone send mail (through the www.everquestlive.com developer's corner form perhaps), asking for a TGB'able group shrink (and you don't need a confirmation box, just a buff icon!)<br />
<br />
keep pestering them. it can take a long time to make verant fix things... ask any vocal (not whiny) druid... but sometimes they actually do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Maybe we should ask for a long shaft to stick up our collective asses.  I think they could pull that off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Group shrink? How about petitioning making it an anywhere spell, like its counterpart grow.<br />
<br />
I wanna be able to shrink in the great outdoors, sans potion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Solution:<br />
<br />
shrink idol pattern (50pp) + block of clay + platinum bar + h2o in a pottery wheel and then fired  = Idol of Shaman Sanity (trivial = 20)<br />
<br />
<br />
Idol of Shaman Sanity<br />
effect: shrink<br />
targetable, group only<br />
all/all<br />
<br />
done.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That would require too much coding. Anything that requires any sort of work at all is too much work to do. Like say, logging a GM on to any server but Stormhammer. Too much work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">/agree Uggok<br />
<br />
Or how about a pottery made idol with a right-click self-only shrink effect, min level 51?  I know it would mean making one of our spells available to everyone on an item (*cough* primal *cough*) but I think it'd be a fair trade for the convenience, and by making it min level 51 you'd keep some utility for lower level shaman and shrink potions.  Or just make group shrink, with a confirmation box that is turn off-able (the way you can turn of confirmation box for looting no drop items, and just auto loot them instead).<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">LOL Jing.<br />
<br />
On the more serious side, on most of our raids:<br />
7 warriors with about 3 Cobalt Bracers total.<br />
3 shamans.<br />
1 Beastlord with quest boots.<br />
Many AoNs, SK skellie spell gizmo and whatnot<br />
<br />
We never have this insane shrink problem. Always have at least 5-7 different sources of shrink. I fail to see how group shrink is such a needed spell that will ease so much tedium.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Get rid of group focus then.  And make it a requirement to be grouped in order to cast focus on someone.<br />
<br />
Then you can feel my pain!!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Annoyance, but hardly grief.<br />
<br />
First of all, I doubt even a group shrink would be MGB-able, so 80 people wouldn't be hit at once unless multiple shamans did the act.<br />
<br />
Second, while running around, get a TL. Don't click yes. Notice that you can keep running around. Keep casting spells. Open up your inventory and switch around items. The only thing I don't think you can do with a confirmation box up is mem spells. Under the new interface, a confirmation box is just another window.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tailen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">WTH?  Too time consuming to code the conformation boxes?  <br />
Huh?  Last I heard they had this for Translocate.  Just how hard would it be to use that as a template, copy and paste some, and steal the subroutines?  Haven't programmers been doing that since the dawn of transistors?<br />
<br />
Howabout just adding conformation boxes to shrink, so we don't have to regroup?  That should take, what, 8 man hours at most?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Forget this worthless spell, we need Ancient True North!  Imagine the POWA of a spell that could simultaneously point an entire raid north at the same time!  All our worries would be gone!  Send in your petition today!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ghorharth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">but there is a first version of grp shrink allreadz ingame, isn't it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Ghorharth, please please make me a cool signature like that!  :)<br />
<br />
I have Ulead something or other I bought.  Are there like 5 basic steps to do in make sigs like these?<br />
<br />
I r dumb and can't seem to get going.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>mift atchou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">yes there is already grp shrink, its an item click from vex thal. called the umbracite swarm orb(sp?) and its not targetable so you have to be grped. i think its actuall an AE shrink but will only work on people your grped with. when its cast and your not grped you get the soandso tries to cast a spell on you but your proctected msg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ghorharth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">perhaps it will work like AE shrink when the /army command goes life?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">out of group shrink in any form is very much needed. to those who dont understand, be only shaman on raid when you need to shrink EVERYONE.  not only do u have to jump groups 5+ times but yell at the fools who forgot etc, and theres always the few who bitch like no other.  also the comment about making shrink a buff i dont htink is a good idea, i know i dont want to have to waste a buff slot on shrink, and how would that handle being shrunk twice like all the shaman classes aside from lizard?  but yes we need an out of group shrink, and confermation box is the way to go<br />
<br />
go go verant screwing us</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">but there is a first version of grp shrink allreadz ingame, isn't it? <br />
<br />
Yes, the people you talked to apperantly have no idea of what its like to be a raid shaman.  They also are completly unable to think outside of the box.  Im pretty annoyed by this, perhaps we should ask for c heal or manaburn.  I guess asking for an, in no way unbalancing spell, is far to annoying to be dignified with an intelligent responce.  Instead we get this trash about supporting two interfaces where click boxes are already prevelant.  Im sorry your supporting 2 interfaces now, life is rough.  Why dont you whine about it, better yet use it as a crutch excuses every time you dont want to do work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Ghorharth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">i know what it means to be a raid shaman<br />
but i don't understand your problam....if i am the only shaman on a raid i shout that i am shrinking for 15 minutes before we move and all the guys who are sleeping and don't get a shrink have to use the cobalt bracer from a war in their group or have to buy shrink potions from me</div></div><hr />
