<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wobbs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi. Long time lurker. First time poster.<br />
<br />
Back last sept unfortunate circumstances involving access to a credit card forced me to retire my lvl 40 shaman by the name of Wobblies. This really made me angry as not only did I lose everything I had worked SOOOoOOooO hard for, but I also wasn't able to log on and say goodbye to all my friends and guildmates. Feeling really cheesed off, I decided to cut all my ties and sold my account to an associate for a token fee. <br />
<br />
So naturally, some higher force decides to have some fun with me and Verent releases gamecards, the savior of all EQ addicts without access to creditcards! So here I am back in EQ, restarting my beloved shaman and naming him Wobbs in honour of my departed other half (although he's still running around with someone else behind the wheel. GRRRR!!! did that ever cause chaos with my guildies) flailing around with my leather armour pieces and worn greatstaff and all I can do is Lament about the stuff that I had given up. Apon quitting my former toon had:<br />
<br />
Fungi <br />
Poisonwind sensor<br />
Spinechiller<br />
near full set of JB (minus bp bracer)<br />
random pieces of quested totemic<br />
and upwards of 20k plat in bank saved for a jbb.<br />
<br />
I gritted my back molars down to stubs after seeing an auction last night of a JBB being sold for 15k. UGHHHHHHHH!!!!! I also uttered a few profanities when I learned that the Fungi drop rate was changed and they now go for 60k, 4 times as much as I had originally paid.<br />
<br />
Just a lesson to any of you fellow lurkers out there that have quit. Don't sell your account for a can of beans, because you will be back someday. =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't think they changed fungi drop rate... and if they did... fungi's are for barbs anyways!!<br />
<br />
Sounds lame, you need to relax.. have some pudding.. don't be obsessed with equipping.. friends can help right? You're a shaman so you're uber no matter what you do.. as long as you don't equip or book or key lime BP.. I got banned and lost my 2 year old account and when I came back 6 months later all I got was a spine chill spear and JB arms from friend.. Course........ I was lucky and snagged a JBB at 45 behehe. Try to have fun being ghetto shaman and hang out in oasis with the gimps.. hehe :) Don't get too stressed.. It makes the pudding upset :(<br />
<br />
Edit: spellz0ring<br />
<br />
Edit.. Strike 2: Ohhh yeahhh.. funny story, I was offered 200$ for my account 2 weeks before I got banned too.. :( .. Conspiracy?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wobbs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">LoL. That was hilarious.<br />
<br />
Alot of why I was so peeved had to do with the fact that items and stuff really was my favourite part of the game. While Some shamans took pride in dinging 60, in about the same amount of time played, I took pride in having better equipment than some of them at 40. I was an ec nut, I got a thrill out of snagging a certain vaunted item at a great price, I dunno maybe I was born to be a stock trader. heh.<br />
<br />
I also find it completely histyrical that you suggested I go ghetto and hang out with Gimps in Oasis when that is EXACTLY what I've been doin all today. Lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It was all true! Especially the pudding! FEAST! *waves paw enthusiasically!*<br />
<br />
edit: BTW what server are you one, someone here might give ya some pp for spells and some ... well you know</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yes, fungi was changed from the common drop to the rare drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jilariz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Robe -&gt; Common.<br />
Fungi -&gt; Uncommon.<br />
Staff --&gt; Rare.<br />
<br />
At least that's my understanding.  Most Kunark mob loot works that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Slimetooth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I too am having Credit Card issues.  What are these game cards?  Where do you buy them?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You can buy them from the Station web store, using your credit card!<br />
<br />
Hmm, not very useful? I think that normal retail outlets sell game cards too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You violated your agrement with SOE when you sold your account anyway.<br />
<br />
Suck it up and grow up.<br />
<br />
Perhaps if you where a little more honest you would also have a credit card.<br />
<br />
*burp*</div></div><hr />

<br />
You were well equipped and wanted to brag about it.<br />
<br />
I miss anything?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Heh welcome to the Crucible Now please LEAVE!!<br />
<br />
(sheesh)<br />
<br />
I think the poster has a good point though. In this day of people retireing till PoP comes out, selling your charecter is a foolish choice.  Selling off all your items is also not the wisest thing to do.<br />
<br />
If you are retiring then retire with a little class. Go somewhere that means something to you, and log off staring into the sunset. <br />
<br />
Don't hawk your wares on the side of the east commons tunnel, to try and &quot;get something back&quot; for all the time spent in game. Because to be honest, if you were not having fun playing then why were you playing.<br />
<br />
When I retire from EQ I will do exactly what I said above. I will camp Snoww in the center of the Paw area outside of Infected Paw and Bid farewell to norrath.  (Or maybe standing on the Whitebridge in North Karanas looking out at the spires. Dunno )<br />
<br />
The game to me is one of friends and memories. Don't sully both in the foolish attempt to make a little plat (or RL cash) to make it all worth while. It should have been worthwhile for its own sake.<br />
<br />
My two copper at least. Flame if you will but I would expect better from the crucible.<br />

I really hope that wasn't too obscure a joke.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">That was too obscure :p but it was still cute.</div></div><hr />

Hmm mommy or daddy cut off EQ and wouldn't pay for it anymore. <br />
<br />
Actually, yes, my parents did cut off use of their credit card and I me not having any line of credit did not allow me to get one of my own.<br />
<br />
Guess because I'm a teenager I'm not deserving of your respect huh?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Chtiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The issue is not you age, or your gear, or how you play the game.  People just dont take kindly to people who ebay.  You cant expect to come here and get sympathy for ebaying your character and needing to start over.<br />
<br />
You started with nothing once when you started the game, now you get to do it again.  Price you pay for ebay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Actually, if you were a long time lurker you would know we don't normally get this rowdy.<br />
<br />
EDIT: didn't catch the part where you said you sold all of it to a friend.<br />
<br />
You would also know that we don't give a warm shoulder to selling gear/chars for real money.<br />
<br />
Guess you can chalk this one up to experience.  Welcome to the Crucible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Wobbs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Well I'm not looking for sympathy of any kind, I was just trying to contribute something back to these boards because they have helped me much over the years, and since I don't know too much about ssra temple and what not, I thought that those that read these boards but no longer play could do with not making the same mistake I made.<br />
<br />
Its not like I'm looking for handouts or anything, my friends have helped me ease back into the game. I just thought that the moral of my story could be passed on to others. <br />
<br />
Chtiz, I didn't ebay, I gave it to a friend and he gave me lunch money. Of course, I'm not going to ask for my stuff back after already giving it to him.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
<br />
selling account for money = ebay<br />
<br />
Wether or not you know the person irl or you sold it on the website.  You got money, he got and account.  That account is now considered Ebayed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Tragik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">He gave his account to a friend for lunch money and you call that ebay, Chtiz?<br />
<br />
Your comments are assinine and full of presumptions.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Chtiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">he sold his character, I dont care if it was for $5000 or for $1.  I dont care if it was because he is greedy and wanted money, just wanted out of the game, or needed the money to buy lunch.  The account WAS sold.  That = ebayed account.<br />
<br />
Moreover, I never gave him crap about selling his account.  People make choices for whatever reason.  I wouldnt sell my accounts, they will retire with me.  That doesnt mean that you cant sell yours if you want, for whatever reason you want.  But, like it or not getting money for and account is ebaying in its most simple form....at least in my opinion.  You dont have to agree with me, I will still sleep tonight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Kullann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I feel for ya Wob I don't give rats if its Ebayed or not, It was perfectly understandable move(VI's fault that their Billing is screwed up). And to losers who shout Ebay!!, Ebay!! like rats on 4th July, just shut up and refrain from posting here :)</div></div><hr />
