<br />
Then every shaman applying to a guild would be accepted just like clerics are.  It would suck to be a CHC person, because that's what we would become, and it would free up the clerics to patch heal and group heal at which they are way better that us.<br />
<br />
3-4 shaman on a raid and 4-6 on the guild roster means the guild is 'full' of shaman, and the addition of any other class would strengthen the guild more than a shaman.  <br />
10+ clerics on a raid and 15+ on a guild roster means that the guild would like more clerics</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Up to POP stuff, shaman are quite fine.<br />
In POP and beyond, CHeal isn't much used in all honesty.<br />
There are some fights where it's totally needed, but for the most part, Cheals are generally for xp groups.<br />
The only times in raids I see cheal being used are when there's no mob in camp, or when it's in a cheal rotation for very specific mobs (like Time gods or Fennin Ro or Xegony).<br />
I wouldn't want CHeal, I know that.<br />
I'd rather have a bigger fast heal that will save someone's life.<br />
Watching the person die because you have 5 seconds left to cast your complete heal is pretty crappy.</div></div><hr />

Shaman / Enchanter / BL slows a MOB for X %.<br />

Second (or the first one again) Shaman in guild / group tosses on a NEW SPELL (NOT ANCIENT, call it  Curse of the Heyokah ) and the MOB slows an additional 10 (debatable, not mitigated value) %.<br />
<br />
Now Shaman are wanted in groups AND raids because not only do they slow MOBS but Shaman STACK.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">LOL, funny thing is that even if ALL of our requests in Gloriana's post were implimented we would still have raiding issues.  Certainly less than now, but still a little bit since multiple shaman are not essential to a raid unless their dps or utility was essential to a raid.  Dps speaks for itself and utility could possibly be answered somewhat by MGB Q and the new expansion buffs. <br />
<br />
I look at raids - warriors have a great place as do clerics, wizzys, rogues, rangers.  Nothing to say about that.  Mages, Beastlords and Necro's have good dps so they are fine even with situational pets.  Druids are pretty decent in raids, DD's damage shield and heals - they stack fine.  Berker's are fine for dps and probably will get better when they are fixed<br />
<br />
SK and Pallys don't lay out a bunch of smack but they don't hurt the raid either.  They are in a bit of the same situation as shaman although they contribute significantly more DPS.<br />
<br />
Bards stacking is below average but there are not too many of them so no biggie.<br />
<br />
That leaves Shaman and enchanters frankly as the least stackable classes on raids IMHO. If chanters were not so godly in exp groups they would be yelling so hard we would be hearing it all the way to the crucible, lol.<br />
<br />
So, where is all this going?  Well, I look at raids and see that we should be balanced a few ways.  Maybe 80% of dps of SK and Pally since we have a few buffs that help the raid.  Or the same dps as a druid since they have better heals now.  Without parsing anything I'm guessing that a full nuking druid is packing about 80% of SK or Pally.<br />
<br />
Anyone believe that we have the same dps on a raid as a druid who is not in a healing cycle? Anyone believe that we have 80% of the dps of a Pally or SK?  Anyone feel that even if Gloriana's shaman suggestion post ideas were all implimented we would be at these respective levels?<br />
<br />
Well, I think it's pretty clear (at least to me) that our nukes should be exactly equal to druids to balance things out.  Anything less than that I believe is not balanced  Easy fix, easy answer.  I would, as many peeps agree rather do dot damage as kind of a shammy &quot;roleplaying thing&quot;, but I can't see the agro problem being fixed so nukes must be the answer.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>m970456</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The DPS on a raid thing is kinda a double-edged sword...<br />
<br />
I'm sure if they increase our DPS, it will be bigger DoT's..<br />
<br />
Right now, it isn't so hard to put out 200dps/tic if you stack a few dots and have BAIV.  I say dps/tic because we can do 200dps once we get our DoTs going, but that takes a little time.  The problem is agro, so if they increase our DPS so we can get 300 or even 400dps with DoT's, how long are you going to see them fire for?  2 tics?<br />
<br />
I currently can't : 1) Stick the DoT's I have consistently on raid mobs 2) live through the agro if they do stick.<br />
<br />
Fix our current means of DPS and then add more.  If they don't fix what is broken now, adding more just won't help on raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tikothepally</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Pally DPS on raids is laughable (points to name). Unless you get uber-super highend weapons, then you are going to be hurting on the DPS (unless it is undead). Paladins get no nukes to speak of DPS-wise. SK easily out damage us.<br />
<br />
We are just good for a spot heal, emergency LoH, etc. I would say if you could drop a few of your dots, and a few of your nukes without getting aggro you could beat the DPS. Then again ,there are some cool shaman weapons that would rival us for dps especially with a few nukes added :)</div></div><hr />

I've been calling tank line ups on raids long enough to make a few comments about this. If you have 3 decently geared warriors, you have the tools to take care of allmost any situation. So its not really true to say that warriors &quot;stack&quot; fine. They dont. Their situation is much like shaman in that respect, you need 3, anything beyond that and the extra's are going to be sitting around &quot;feeling useless&quot; because they are not doing the job they were intended for. I remember my younger days when I was the 6th or 7th ranked warrior in the guild. I believe I was in the guild for about 18 months before I got to tank anything significant. Before that I was a poor dps class that offered &quot;faint hope&quot; if the **** hit the fan. Most classes experience this, exceptions being pure healers such as clerics or pure damage dealers, such as wizards. Focussing on damage dealing capacity in the case of shaman isnt really fair since we have healing capabilities too, and I dont think the role of a secondary healer can be so lightly dismissed.<br />
<br />
It is not as glamorous, and I think that is what bothers people more than anything else. The only useless people on raids are those who sit around and do nothing, and basically follow the raid around until it reaches the named. Someone with lower dps and a good work ethic is worth infinitly more than someone with high dps who sits on their ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">We're by no means an uber guild, but I can easily out dps our paladins.  I know their dps will rise as we progress, while mine is largely stuck with that 925 nuke.  But... I can hold down 100dps easily on a raid mob just with bane and velium strike, assuming its not resistant to both.  Our paladins cant do that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I dont know if you guys know what happened in the recent patch.  <br />
Mobs that cast AE spells in the #4 KoD raid trial, Qvic, and Inku`Ta, all seem to have had the resist check on the AEs changed to be almost irrisistable,  even when the bard gives everyone max resists.   Now the chances of the AEs hitting for full seem to have been reduced, but it still hurts.<br />
<br />
I was the only healer in my group, and even with my new quest armor http://everquest.allakhazam.com/pgfx/item_669.png http://everquest.allakhazam.com/pgfx/item_526.png, I was only able to keep me and 2 other people alive in my group. (Inku`Ta raid)<br />
There is now, no possible way a shaman can fill the role as the healer of the group.  That role is now left up to clerics, druids, and paladins (which seemed to have keeped their groups alive just fine).<br />
<br />
The only possible way for us to be desirable now &quot;high end&quot;, is to have some type of group heal (since it looks like a larger single heal is out of the question).</div></div><hr />

I agree.  Why do druids and beastlords get MGB HoTs, when Shaman have the original HoT?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Lohknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">If they could only fix DoT aggro that would make us much better DPSers on raids.  I have SCS3 and still can't stack on more than 2 <br />
DoTs on any mob.  If I don't get summoned right away, I'll die on rampage.  The only other class that really stacks on DoTs is a necro and they have FD to control aggro.<br />
<br />
In exp groups, if I stack on more than 1 DoT, I can steal aggro from a tank.  That's just not right.  You don't see other DPS classes stealing aggro that easily.</div></div><hr />

This is a joke right ?<br />
<br />
Ill have to stand strongly opposed somethign like this cause i dont want to be in a CHeal rotation, i dont want to be a main healer in the group. I want to fill my debuff/buff role and add some DPS through buffs to the melee and my own nukes/DoT's/Puppy.<br />

We aren't getting cleric's CH. The original poster was being ironic. I said i'd take the druids 3k heal. I wouldn't get put in the rot, just like now we don't put druids in rotations. Doesn't make sense when clerics heal for 7.5k, and druids half that amount.<br />

although i agree with the warrior part to some degree, the shaman dps cant be high cause we heal i dont, druid have the 2nd best nuke in game and they can do high sustained damage, their heal is better than ours, second best again? are you saying that cause they heal so well they should have their nukes, dots , ds, snare teleports removed? or that the fact they have these they shouldnt heal so well?<br />
<br />
i see no reason why we cant do the same dps as a druid without dying. specialy now that slow has been countered fairly well.<br />

(btw i think druid if not healing would easily outdamge a pally or sk)</div></div><hr />

Maybe cause we dont offer alot to a raid beyond initial buffing as it is and you can never have enough healers?<br />

Druids are in the CHeal rotation as it is, they dont nuke usualy, they are asked to heal, so basicly this line of thinking is asking to put us in the same boat.</div></div><hr />

Shaman stackability on raids sucks.<br />
Shaman desirability on raids sucks after 3.<br />
<br />
Clerics are infinatly stackable.  if you don't have enough clerics you don't raid.  if you don't have enough shaman then you log the bots on to buff and have other people slow/cripple.  <br />
<br />
Sucks.  Big Time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">The point is simple, right now, I pad with tnargs as necessary, Keep my group alive when I'm not slowing and slow/debuff/rebuff the rest of the time. Even when we had 7 shaman present at raids I was never bored. If you're going to ask for a heal, then a better tnargs and Hot are something I'd love to have because it would make me better at the kind of healing I like to do. Someone needs to heal the groups while the clerics keep the tank alive. <br />
<br />
We don't need to become watered down clerics to be usefull on raids, or even to be stackable. We don't need ch,  we don't need rez. We just need solid spot healing with exellent Hot to complement our slowing abilities and buffs because as a class we're already pretty well rounded. It's just a question of tweaking our existing abilities and developping them to the fullest. If anything, a second line of Hot that stacks with the existing torpor/quiescence lines would be infinitely more interesting from a gameplay perspective than a new CH. Or do to quiescence what they did to dots... Make them stack if multiple shaman are casting them. The more you have, the better the Hot pad heal. The others can cast group Hot's, we could stack 2-3 of them to heal 700 - 1050 hp/tick continuously. Abilities are already too farmed out and the differences between classes already blurred enough as it is.<br />
<br />
Personally I think the 10 second complete healing spells that are so unbalanced that they could not afford to let it be affected by focus/AA are an abberation that should removed from the game altogether and replaced by a completely new line of spells that are balanced for their levels and affected by focus and AA. It would require tuning and rethinking of a lot of strategies but clerics everywhere would probably breathe a collective sigh of relief once they got over the initial shock and cries of nerf.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think those are excellent points and certainly it depends on how your guild is set up and run, how egalitarian it is on tanking and just basic raid tactics.  I have found as my guild has progressed and our melee have gotten significantly better that spot healing has taken more of a priority also so I agree with you there.<br />
<br />
But anyway, frankly 2-3 shaman do not suck on raids and the buffing, slowing, malos, cripple and spot healing is very valuable and dps is not an issue at all.  If you have 4 or more that's the stacking issue and most real raiding guilds carry 6-7 shaman.  When they all show up thats the issue.  Most guilds (except the super uberific) have tons of druids because there are more of them than any other class.  They are put into groups as spot healers (unless there is a shortage) then the shaman are asked to do it.  How many times have you been in a guild group with a druid and 4 others and the druid says &quot;shaman spot heal so I can nuke&quot;.  Exactly 0% for me.  They can spot heal better than we can. Period.  So, what's that excess shammy to do? NUKE I SAY, lol.<br />
<br />
My point regarding dps is more from a balance standpoint (compared to druids for example).  Druids no longer suck in experience groups so the argument that shaman are better in exp groups so Druids should be better in raids IMHO does not hold water.  So, what is unbalancing about letting us dps the same on raids. <br />
  <br />
Just as an aside, regarding Pally dps...I don't know about your guild but all our Pally/SK's have excellent weapons and thats the stuff that rots all the time.  Many raid mobs are pretty darn resistant to shaman spells so I don't know how a shaman can out damage them currently (no puppies allowed on our raids so that big whopping 20dps is gone). And I don't know how you can cast more than 1 nuke on trash mob (probably 1/2 that) while a hard working SK/Pally can get a round or two in.  Obviously it would be a completely different story if we could safely stack our dots.<br />

There is no denying that the 4th + Shaman on a raid becomes a placeholder.  MGB of Charisma is funny the first time, but that is about it.  Clerics don't appreciate the humor of VP pinball either :(<br />
<br />
There are only 2 viable ways to make Shaman desireable for Guilds and Raids.  Give us worthwhile DPS without massive aggro, or give us the healing capability to take care of an &quot;off group&quot; in a raid.  I personally don't see a light at either of these tunnels.<br />
<br />
Right now, we aren't even desireable for pick-up groups.  Baby steps I tell you...baby steps.<br />

<br />
Because having a 10 sec cast big heal means you're going to be plunked in a rot.<br />
Why do you think even guilds with bloated rosters still look for more clerics?  Why are so many raids called off because of lack of clerics?  Why are so many raids consisting of 15-20% cleric?  Because thats the way the game is built.  Ch chains have been in existance a long time, and raid content is designed around its usage.  Not enough ch casters is probably the single biggest limiter around for guilds of all sizes.<br />
Forget shamans, give ch to a wizard and you bet your rear they'll be plunked in a rot.</div></div><hr />

We've had kraggs for a while now and i've never been asked to take part in a rot. It's not big enough i guess.<br />

<br />
So giving another class a CH-type spell would allow more raiding.<br />
<br />
And if shamans had a bigger CH-type spell it would allow more stackability and more raiding.<br />
<br />
Except some shamans don't wanna join a rotation.<br />

<br />
Also, i haven't done much in GoD, but the expansion appears to have been built around an encounter model that prevents the use of CH. Intentionally, i'd guess. So CH chains may be a a thing of the past, anyway. Could be wrong there, though.</div></div><hr />

I have, many times. But i find that shaman healing is better in the quick healing if we are to heal the MA, situationaly ofcourse. I tend to spam blast tnargs when the tank is low to help the CHeal chain recover. So thats what i do, i make sure a HoT is always on the tank and blast quick heals when he is getting low as just a saftey net for the CHeal chain. Cause sometimes it can get out of sink and when it does im there providing the shoulder to lean on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">I'm not quite sure how you could classify kraggs as a 'big' heal.  Sure its got a 10 second cast time...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Tnargs + aa and focus = 1840 hp heal fairly regularly. 2.5 sec casting time. (also with focus) 450 mana<br />
<br />
Kraggs + aa + focus + whatever since it's not affected = 2300 hp last time I tried it. 10 second cast. 400 mana. <br />
<br />
I haven't memmed kraggs unless specifically asked to forever. The low hp doesn't justify it's obscene cast time. 2300 hp would be an acceptable blast heal (pre AA and focus). Calling it a CH is an abberation.</div></div><hr />
