<br />
I finaly pointed out of my job today and filled out my paper work, handed in uniforms, gaming license and sledge card.<br />
<br />
On the way home I was on the kife edge of tears of joy or whooping and yelling like a lunitic out of sheer delight at my freedom from the casino industry!<br />
<br />
I literaly was wondering if I could fly if I tried to. . . .I wanted to just keep driving untill I didnt know where I was and keep driving further after that. . . .I'm not a drinker, I HATE how it tastes. . but rightthen I wanted to go to a bar and get a shot  of Irish whisky to knock back just to say I had finaly done it!<br />
<br />
! ! ! ! !FREE AT LAST ! ! ! ! !<br />
<br />
*runs off screaming and crying and jumping and skipping her way into the sunlit and beutifull day*<br />
<br />

<br />
I guess you can explore your options now. I'm glad you feel good about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My job goes by such an arbitrary point system tht they cant contest unemployment claims really, so I intentionaly got 9 points so I would get fired, LOTS of people there do it, then after an extended vacation they go back.  Me, I MAY go back, MUCH later, but only for weekend/holidays and on the EARLY morning 5-1 shift.  In the meantime it's off to school I GO! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jorana</div><div class="date">04-30-2002, 03:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Grats!  Let those unemployment checks roll in.  Me personally, I let my husband do the working.  He told me to quit my job which I did.  He wants the happy little homemaker and after years of working, I am more than happy to give that to him.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The casino I work in goes by the point system also, but unfortunately they are very watchful on what you get canned for. I think ive only heard of a handful of people that have recived unemployement from them :(    ..........<br />
<br />
otherwise I might have done that very thing lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tymoria Brightblade</div><div class="date">04-30-2002, 09:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">nah, these guys are VERY arbitrary on points.  My appartment building was ON FIRE, I was tripping over fire hoses in the parking lot watching smoke pour out of the appartment window next to my own, using a stranger's cell phone to call in since I was obviosly not allowed in even if I wasnt already blocked in by the fire trucks. . . still got one point for it lol  Thier excuse?  Well another lady's house burned to the ground and SHE got the point, so what makes you special? hehehe they even said at the exit interview that I was perfectly welcome to return in six months lol</div></div><hr />
