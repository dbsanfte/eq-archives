<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lyam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am looking to upgrade some of my armour and was wondering about the cost of Articifer's Armour on the 7th Hammer.<br />
<br />
Could any GM Smiths from the 7th please let me know the current rates on Articifers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm not on 7th but I'm one of the few I've found that sells artificers on any server.  I don't know that you're going to find a current rate because it's just too rare.<br />
<br />
The thing to keep in mind is that the margin of profit on this stuff is very slim given the comparable drops you can get.  Blue diamonds alone go for 2k on Karana (if you shop around and refuse to indulge the gougers).  At maxxed skill I usually assume 3 attempts per item, which means for a bp or legs (3 bds per try) you're looking at 18k just for the blue diamonds.  Then you have to add in the costs of the other ingredients (velium, coldain tempers, essence of winter, ivory, ice goblin blood, leather padding, vendor materials).  That stuff adds up quickly when bought in the Bazaar, or can take quite some time to collect oneself.  THEN you have to actually add on the payment for the skill and services of your smith.  Artificer's is expensive stuff.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't scare you then it might still be worth your while to keep looking. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lyam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks folks,  Looks like I will be hitting the Ulthorks to get a few Blue Diamonds yet again.<br />
<br />
And doing a lot of collecting before I finally find my GM Smith.  <br />
<br />
Cheers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just an FYI, early reports from PoP indicate that the prices of blue diamonds are likely to plummet in the very near future.  It may be worth your while to hold off and see if smiths will be able to provide the armor more cheaply.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lyam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Great news thanks Dandi</div></div><hr />
