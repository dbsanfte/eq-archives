<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Doma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />
I am currently patiently waiting for the european release of WOW (NOT) :P<br />
<br />
I was wondering if any euro's had purchased a copy from the US and were playing already and if they were having any connection problems. I think I read somewhere that in order to keep people connecting to regional servers that they may implement some way of stopping europeans etc joining US servers at least initially.<br />
<br />
I just dont want order a copy from the US only to find that I cannot play/connect.<br />
<br />
Anyone know or play from europe?<br />
<br />
Cheers</div></div><hr />

A RL friend of mine here had to purchase his copy from the States AND furthermore had to have it registered there as well, but he is able to play on N. American servers with no problems.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your problem is that if you want to play with your local european friends, they need to order the american version aswell.<br />
<br />
With the European version still a month into the future, im disturbed by the possibility of them using segregated server parks. I want to play with my fellow europeans, but i would at the same time be disappointed with not being able to play with my american friends from my EQ days.</div></div><hr />
