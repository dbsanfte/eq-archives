<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aridor1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">hi all, i been looking for an alternative to camping GW's for my torpor/malo copy since a shamy in my guild camped them for 2 weeks and got zip.. my guild has a fairly decent force able to kill talendor on at all times pretty much, i decided to setup some gimp scout there to keep an eye on him.   where is the best place for him to be/find out if and when talendor is up.<br />
thanks in advance<br />
ps: whats talendors respawn timer?</div></div><hr />

Good Luck :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">We used to pull Talendor to the BW zone.  His dot is nasty and must be annulled, encourage people to create an empty buff slot at the top before they engage.  Kill him fast, then start annulling the dotted people or they'll start dropping like flies.  Nothing worse than killing Talendor without a single death and then losing more than half your raid force to the dot after he dies!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Talendor down last night, I can confirm first hand that torpor dropped.<br />
<br />
However, his fire ae was kind of weird, I never annuled it and it didn't do any damage to me that I could see.  I was constantly cann'ing too.:confused:</div></div><hr />
