<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>SurfinShammy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I couldn't find this in the list here but I just got the nice fuzzy boots. And I wanted to know how hard it is to take down ghiosk kirn the king and queen<br />
<br />
I mean I have read the spoilers but I know that not every spoiler is exactly head on. Can I do any of the above mentioned with a good group of 50+ or do I really seriously need more than that???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">&quot;A good group of 50+&quot; can mean different things to different people.<br />
<br />
If you and your friends have similar equipment to the people I hang out with (eg kunark armour, not many epics, no Kael / Skyshrine / ToV gear at all), then a single group is going to have problems doing the next stages of your epic.<br />
<br />
The Hole you can probably do with 2 groups. Same for Lord Ghiosk. Neh Ashir takes quite a raid to get to, 3 or 4 groups I'd guess. Rak Ashir takes 2 mages and a cleric, but a minimum of 2 groups to actually get to him and kill the reavers in the way.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, I've heard about all these encounters being &quot;possible&quot; for a single goup. But probably a single goup of level 58+ people in ToV armour.<br />
<br />
Also, players with exceptional skill can obviously do things with less forces. I don't count myself in this category :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shekina Wolfhowl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I took out kirn with one group of friends who are 60 hp, 60 sk, 58 drui, 60 chanter and me the lowly 54 shm.<br />
<br />
It was a blast, and incredibly easy. Kirn never had a chance. I slowed him, and the sk beat the begeebers out of him. lol<br />
<br />
<br />
Ghiosk: 2 full groups of 50+ friends.<br />
<br />
Haven't tried Neh or Rak yet, but they r next on my hit list.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Kirn:  Hits a bit hardish but a 54+ group with Cleric, Monk, War and Chanter can do this (add one other besides you to this).  I believe that was wrote during Kunark when most still had old world gear.  We owned him with 1 group.<br />
<br />
<br />
Neh Ashiir:  You NEED to have at LEAST a 56+ group and I'd recommend going with 2 50+ groups instead.  She isn't that tough but the way up has a LOT of mobs and TPWO's aren't out of the question.  That and the reaver can spawn upto 7 reavers and that's a LOT of mana for the cleric to use.<br />
<br />
Rak:  Bah, 2 clerics, 2 mages and you can do t his if you clear the room first.  Very easy IMO.  Was a severe disappointment.</div></div><hr />
