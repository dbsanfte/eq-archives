TOFS is a fun zone. I can't write a complete guide at the moment. Maybe some day. But I will give you a bit of information about it.<br />
<br />
Level 1 - To play here you need to have a decent group from levels 25 to 30, 34 max.  Generally the lower level you are, the more people you need, and a chanter is probably nessasary.   The key to the next level tends to drop from a spawned shadowbeast who appears randomly after killing the skeletons who frequent the various rooms.<br />
<br />
Noteworthy items - The skeletons drop shadowbone earrings.<br />
<br />
Level 2 - This floor has a similar level requirement to level 1. However mind yourself of the mob types. This level is full of ghosts.  It's fairly annoying because they are all casters.  Wizards and enchanters mainly that I can recall.  The occasional necromancer pops in for fun too.  This is not a great level to Xp on due to the large DD&quot;s and DOTs etc.  I recommend staying here as short as possible only to acquire the key for this level.  Be vary careful of pathing here, since they fixed it large numbers of adds are common now. So bring some crowd control again or a paladin (paladins are great in this zone anyhow).<br />
<br />
Noteworthy items - teachers sylabus and students homework both drop from the randomly spawned upon any kill on the floors key holder.<br />
<br />
Level 3 - This level is great! You probably need to be about 30 with a party of 6, and can stay here up to level 48 and still get decent XP.   There are very few if ever adds except in a few rooms where 2 mobs are together. Its basically a bunch of corridors with bedrooms. You can really milk this zone for xp and minor items.  Just wander around in a path and backtrack the same way over and over and this floor will level you fast. Armored knights,  Skeletons, Shadowbeasts, Zombies are amongst the residents here. Occasionally a hag spawns in the place of a random mob instead, but she doenst drop anything special. She just nukes hard.  And as prior the keyholder spawns randomly and drops a couple decent items such as a ring of velium, a SK 2hander, and I think thats it.<br />
<br />
Level 4 - Levels 40+ depending on what your trying to do. If your moving through BOOO This place stinks.  A very confusing maze of pitfals, fake walls, nasty nasty adds, including some invisible mobs you can barely see or target who nuke for insane damage.  This place is best to skip unless you have a full group with an enchanter and some heavy hitters to soak a lot of damage.  Its hard to even keep up with the waves of mobs you are attacked with. There are some nice items that drop here, a SK shield (goes well with the sk sword *pfft*), a caster bowl and various other goodies.  From what I've been told and from experience (or coincendence) the keyholder spawns by killing mummies. <br />
<br />
Level 5 - Great cashcow level.  Level is quite similar to the difficulty of level 1, if not easier.  Mobs here do not seem to add.  They drop a lot of velium blocks and bits and such.  Apparently some undead decided to get married and this is the wedding party.  Runed Wedding ring and its counterpart the band.  A nice helment and beer stained shirt also drop from the keyholder who spawns randomly out of the mobs on this level. A lot of the mobs are green and lb by the time you can get to this level.  Enjoy the parkwalk while you can.<br />
<br />
Level 6 - Levels need to be around 45-54 max, I dont know as much about this level except that it at one point was a great place for paladins to solo. I dont know if they ever did fix the pathing but if you can fear here your get great xp.  It basically consists of a few corridors of mobs in cubby holes. Getting out can be quite diffcult.  The door is guarding by about 5 or 6 spectres and there is a trap in the room that removes invis. So watch out dont go the dirct route t othe exit door.</div></div><hr />
