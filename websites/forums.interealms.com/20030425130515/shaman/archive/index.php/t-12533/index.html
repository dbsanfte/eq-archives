<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kiisekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all, new here.  Actually, this is my first post heh.  Just wanted to post my magelo and see if anyone had some suggestions for upgrades, don't have a ton of cash but I love to quest and could prolly raise some pp if I needed.  By the way, I plan on replacing my shield with Tae Ewe very soon and also the 7th shawl with the 8th soon as I get smithing finished up.  So, besides those two slots... any ideas?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dubarnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i hate you for having better gear then me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kiisekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, I suppose compliments are the next best thing to advice :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, I suppose compliments are the next best thing to advice :).<br />
<br />
<br />
You have exceptionally good gear for level 54.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure that theres much better stuff out there which isn't No Drop. <br />
<br />
I can't think of any, anyway.<br />
<br />
Also, could you update your Skills, And stick your current defense in, so I can see what your AC adds up to?<br />
<br />
I'm sure theres bound to be a couple of people out there that can give you much better equipment advice than me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kiisekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Okie, thanks for replying.  Maybe one of these days I'll stop being lazy and put some of the more important info into my magelo as per your suggestion.  Nice to know I'm doing fairly well though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Get a lizard (or a horse),  you won't regret it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'd lose the wis and get some hitpoints and ac.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Extremely nice gear for your level, so I guess you have some cash. As Schpleef says, you need to work on your hp and ac, and don't worry about wisdom (assuming you are gonna level up towards 60 soon)<br />
<br />
1. Horse/Lizard thingy. This really really should be your next purchase, no doubt in my mind. ~8k<br />
2. Tae Ew chain tunic. ~10k or get the bits and find a smith to do combine to save pp<br />
3. Dusty Sorriz boots. &lt;1k<br />
4. Swap out the Lodi shield for Heiro cloak unless you are raiding HoT or similar all the time. Better yet have both and swap in Lodi when you need resists :)<br />
4. Swap in a Barbed Rubicite Bracer for the spiritcharmer one.<br />
<br />
Not sure where you stand on spells, but unless your guild will help get them then you will want to reserve about 80k to get your level 55-60 spells. (Prices will vary hugely between servers though).<br />
<br />
After that, you're mostly looking at no-drop bits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kiisekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks for the suggestions.  Funny thing is, I don't think I've ever had more than 5k in the bank at any one time.  I've been wanting one of those lizard things for a little while now hehe... I'll see what I can do about making some cash and looking into the rest of those upgrades too.  Thanks again for your insights.</div></div><hr />

Umm Schpleef, I'm also a strong advocate for AC/HP, but you must not have looked at his equipment.  He has no 'straight up' wis gear, it all has solid hp and/or  ac and/or mana. Plus his AC setting is obviously not up-to-date.<br />
<br />
He's doing just fine and has some really solid pieces of non nodrop equipment.</div></div><hr />

Hello, wis gear!  Not knocking Kiisekai's gear (it's about what my gear was at that level, give or take a few items), just saying that it's not all hp gear.<br />
<br />
Edit:  yeah, lodi shield has a lot of AC...but since it's comparable in price to the 75hp 4 sta heiro, I think it's a piece of turtle crap.  Figured I should explain that before someone pointed it out.<br />

Tried to list gear for same slot in cost/ease of attainment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Phinger Bang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I hear ya Gwain and understand what you mean.  And like I said in my post, his 'wis' gear in most cases has solid ac, hp or mana.  The first three items you've listed are solid ac and yes, come with wisdom.  And as far as his shawl, that's a no-brainer, considering the work that's put into it (I'll never do it, too lazy).  <br />
<br />
I love these posts though, they really open up a lot of equipment combinations that you don't always think about.  There's always something better and we all work within our limitations, but it always cool when you can get more bang for your buck :)<br />
<br />
My final thought.  If I find an item that has great ac/hp I sure won't turn it down cuz it has 10 wis on it just because another item has 2 more ac and less wis.</div></div><hr />
