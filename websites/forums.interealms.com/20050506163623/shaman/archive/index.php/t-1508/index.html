<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">New mobs around.<br />
Fought some black raveners in Swamp of No Hope, blue to 60, didn't drop anything.<br />
<br />
Also, group sow and regen now overwrite single targetted versions.<br />
<br />
*edit typo no=now*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hmm, maybe I was missing something, but group SoW has never overwritten normal SoW for me. It is very annoying, as I have to tell everyone in the party to drop any prior SoW effects they have on, and inevitably I'll get a couple spell-did-not-take-hold messages because a couple people weren't listening to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes. It did not previously overwrite it.<br />
<br />
Now it does.<br />
<br />
What you were missing is called a 'patch'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ah, hehe, I think I spend too much time having to contend with the poor grammar skills found on message boards. When I read &quot;Also, group sow and regen no overwrite single targetted versions&quot; it didn't occur to me that &quot;no&quot; was simply a typo. My mistake, Darjeeling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Not at all. Was my error.<br />
<br />
Those two changes, minor though they were, are pretty useful i think. Always a pain to have to say to people &quot;click off sow/regen&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Very nice.<br />
<br />
Would it be safe to assume that you tested our other group buffs and they've remain unaffected since you never mentioned them?<br />
<br />
Not playing 'til tomorrow night else I'd just check when I got home. :)</div></div><hr />

Please tell me they didn't stick them along the wall path between the FoB and Trak zone lines or in the tunnel to Trak zone. That's all I ask</div></div><hr />

Not sure what you mean. Group stat buffs seemed the same, except for the HOS stacking stuff covered elsewhere.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please tell me they didn't stick them along the wall path between the FoB and Trak zone lines or in the tunnel to Trak zone. That's all I ask.&quot;<br />
Heh. Invis when going through the tunnel.<br />
Score for the VI sadists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">That is in fact EXACTLY where they put them. Dugroz (or whatever his name is) has been moved over to froggy town, so people can still get their HS keys, his tunnel is filled with the things, and there are another 5 in the cave where the iksar outcasts used to be.<br />
<br />
They are level 55 (conned by a 55), hit for 260, and out of 5 attempts to slow, only 1 stuck. Resisted 4 malosinis. Look like black sperms. Fortunately, they cannot see invis, and if you stay on the left side of the tunnel going to TT, that is out of aggro range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If you can get through the tunnel on the left side without aggro then I guess it'll do.<br />
<br />
Trak is so underused except for the cycle and getting medallions, right at the ledge at swamp zone-in and along the walls near there are fantastic exp spots for groups of low-mid 40's doing everything that shows up. Even at 49 my Warrior fights there doing ghosts in a groups.<br />
<br />
Let's all go back to OT&amp;DL for a good time.<br />
<br />
Sheesh VI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Mukka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">A minor change to our epic sow boot also, u can only click it when no sow on u.<br />
Bah, i love the old times, clicking the boot all the time<br />
VI Sux</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yeah, I saw one of them black sperms while helping a guildie complete his HS key quest.  I thought, its blue, I should easily be able to duo this with a 57 warrior.  LOADING PLEASE WAIT ...  <br />
<br />
They do not see invis and they are in the cave and where the iskar were.  Lvl 55 and hit like cement trucks, resisted the 2 casts I tried.<br />
<br />
ALSO, rage line no longer stacks with HoS.  This makes the self buff pretty much useless.  Thanks VI /rude.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Finally something worthwhile in Swamp of No Fun..what a waste of a zone.<br />
<br />
Camped that damn froggie repairer for FAR too long..every time I have to pass through that empty gods-forsaken zone I shudder.<br />
<br />
Finally a change that doesn't involve beating down shamans!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Also, group sow and regen now overwrite single targetted versions <br />
<br />
<br />
Ah finally ! that great ,i hope they'll do same for stat buff</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is this verified? If it is I maybe outta here, my best and only &quot;toy&quot; nerfed, I always click it before it wears off. I'm NOT waiting for it to wear off or clicking it off to re-apply.<br />
<br />
I've been looking for an excuse to dump my characters, I don't play them too often anyway, now this may be it.<br />
<br />
Not bitter or anything I've been looking for a reason to drop this ordeal. Maybe this is it, maybe not, but this nerf is not needed especially to an item that really can't be abused. Probably going to have to pay extra to get fully functioning toys from now on. VI really knows how to make a game &quot;unfun&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I think what happened was he had a higher level sow on, which the boots have never overwritten. Used to hate druids ninja-sowing me. No i hate myself for ninja-group-sowing me. <br />
<br />
Pretty sure you can still spam click the boots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Darn, maybe, I ain't looking to spam I just don't want to end up hash. haha:D <br />
<br />
That's what happens when you've been around forever, you know you want to quit but you know you won't unless some good excuse pops up, so you grasp at straws thinking that maybe the server will crash and your character will be deleted forever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Mukka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Fixed after the second patch<br />
*click**click**click**click**click**click*</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just quit friend. If i remember your posts correctly you already conquered something far heavier. Take a vacation, you will probably forget about EQ in 3 days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">and then you always come back in &lt; 3 months ;p</div></div><hr />
