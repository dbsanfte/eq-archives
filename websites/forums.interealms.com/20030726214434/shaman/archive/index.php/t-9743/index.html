<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">well basically I'm wondering about CoM. I've started hunting there now (at 49) and I have no idea where I'm supposed to go to solo. I heard that the temple was good, but the only thing I can single-pull is the mob on top of the temple stairs on the left side. If I go inside the temple and try to pull something I get the whole darned building after me. I havn't tried the catwalk things yet, can you single pull those? How about the stables.<br />
<br />
two somewhat unrelated questions...<br />
any other suggested places for 49-early 50's?<br />
Can I solo the Spectral courier to get my 6th CoM report (It's the only one I need now) or do I need a group or even a raid to take him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The spectral courier didn't seem any harder than the standard mobs there in the area he spawns. I would think you could solo him if you can catch him up. If you're having trouble single pulling, things could get hairy, but he's not any harder. I've always seen him in the stables area in one of the buildings. IMO, the hardest part will be single pulling him, from what you're saying. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well how are you supposed to single pull? Why are they all going after me when they dont all go after other folks? am I too low of a level?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think 49 is too low for temple and stables. Just pull the entrance stuff, the 3 at gate , the two sets of two up above and if that's not enough the 6 in the courtyard. At 51 the temple is easier but you'll still get doubles a lot, not a problem if you are kei'd and have alpha dog. At 52 the temple is much easier but you still get doubles sometimes. At 53 I moved to the gazeebos. I didn't try the stables till 54 and by then most were light blue and very easy to single pull :) Took a long time though to get that damn student's log to drop. <br />
<br />
It's kind of hard to remember the exact details since it went by so fast. Man I miss that place for soloing :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">aww but the stuff in there is so easy. I just slow, ebolt, and sic my 49 pet (alphad) and I&quot;ll root and sit down. Should I just wait until the higher levels to come here? Should I keep killing plaguebone thieves (pleeeease don't tell me that, the people in DL are terrible, It's near impossible to hold the camp for more than 30 minutes, and the camp dies way too fast and spawns way too slow with ebolt now) or what?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Seefar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">At level 49 I don't think you are too low.  I went there at level 52 and a lot of the stuff in that area was light blue so that should not be the problem. I have sometimes had the same problem there and I've had no luck at all in the stable area.  <br />
<br />
I keep hearing people talk about what a great zone for soloing COM is, but I guess I never got the hang of it because I spend a lot more time zoning than hunting when I go there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">No real suggestions as to how to single pull, except to maybe try pulling with one of the &quot;cancel magic&quot; spells while staying at maximum range away from the mob. If that doesn't work, you're too low level to single pull, even if the mobs are somewhat easy for you. In that event, I'd suggest you duoing or something to get the spectral courier. If that doesn't help, sorry.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Exp'd (solo, duo, group) in CoM from 39 to 51.  The key to CoM is using the fact that mobs give up agro after a certain distance to your advantage.  There are a LOT of places you can root 1 mob, get his friend to follow you, then run just far enough back where the rooted mob won't come.  Finish one off, med/canni back up, and grab the other one you agro'd.  Pulling the courtyard mobs back past the goo house is the best spot for that, though there are others.<br />
<br />
At 49 you should be able to single pull the right side of the stable pretty easy.  Sometimes the mobs get linked together when they've been up for a while, nothing you can do about it, you're going to get 2-3.  The left side of the stable is a little higher level, I wouldn't recommend trying to pull it solo, it can be tough.<br />
<br />
Great practice for root crowd controlling mobs though, get 2-3 and solo them all, you've got to keep them separated enough while dots + dog work at it.<br />
<br />
Best bet is to get a monk or 2.  At 47 or 48 (pre-ebolt) I had a 49 and 44 monk with me and we were able to clear out both sides of the stables.  Courier spawns a lot more often that way.</div></div><hr />
