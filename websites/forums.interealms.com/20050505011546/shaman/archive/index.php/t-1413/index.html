<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Czakoriah2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am getting close to my 34th season, and would like to know what Level is our initial pet, and how Leveling occurs with them?<br />
<br />
Thanks <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think it's all kinda random on what level the pet is. Between lvls 34-38 I could cast a pet that was green to light blue at random times at random levels. But overall I'd say it was between the lvls of 23-27.<br />
I would say he had about 700-800 HP's not including buffs and he hit for 29 max. I have a better pet spell now and he hits a little harder and has many more HP's. So I think its all random. But I believe the first pet spell is between lvls 23-27.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">to answer the second question - your pet doesn't level.  Once you summon a pet, it stays the same level until it dies or is 'released'.  Sometimes, people will immediatly summon a new pet if the old one is obviously a low level pet (a greenie).  But at 350 - 400 mana per pet that is pretty expensive.<br />
<br />
You will 'release' your pet if you go invisible, or zone, or use '/pet get lost'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well they changed this awhile back if I remember.<br />
<br />
I think sub 50 pets can range by 5 levels. Post 50 pet can range only by 3 levels.<br />
<br />
As for leveling with them...<br />
<br />
If your pet does &gt;=50% of total mob dmg they get 50% of the experience from the kill. If they don't then they get 0 exp. <br />
<br />
Rule of thumb, if you don't want to lose exp always outdmg your pet.<br />
<br />
Also since you are a new pet user...If they haven ot fixed this yet. You can do the mag focus item quests in the lavastorm quest zone thing (forget the name). These staffs are no drop with an affect of reclaim energy.  You can't equip them but you can use the right click effect. Always nice to get mana back from your summoned pet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
or if you reclaim energy with a mage focus item, in which case you get back some of your mana.  I use the shovel of Ponz, it was easiest to get.</div></div><hr />
