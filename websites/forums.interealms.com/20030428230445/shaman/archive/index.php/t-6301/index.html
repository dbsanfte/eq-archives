<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Blackdust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone else not been able to buy Titan potion ingredients lately? The vendor, thats in the room next to the Shadowhaven soulbinder, has been missing for days. This happened before and he somehow managed to get out by the water and a GM kindly trained him back to his store so I could buy components.<br />
<br />
This time though, he's just gone. I can't find the bugger anywhere. I thought maybe someone killed him so I would wait a day or two on repop but its been almost a week and no vendor.<br />
<br />
Anyone know what's up with this ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Yathandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i have noticed that on Stormhammer some days he is gone as well.  I believe this happens when someon KOS ports into Shadowhaven, and he is moved or killed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That's happened twice that I know on Rodcet, with Staeton out by the teleport pad.<br />
<br />
Stinks, but not much that can be done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">For what it's worth, if you petition it then the GMs will (eventually) put him back.  I wouldn't recommend sitting there and waiting, although occasionally it will get done right away.  But if you do it whenever you notice him missing then at least he'll be back when you're around the next day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Karadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">hehe I know what happens to him , watched this for myself..A shaman/player goes to buy something from them. they hit attack key or another key to argo him then they run to EC or Nexus (closet zone),, If you look by the EC/Nexus/bazzar zone you will find him..however he will say he is buzy (<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I saw him by the zone to echo and was able to talk to him.  I didnt try to buy from him though. I believe he gives out a quest for haven faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I don't think he has any quests.<br />
<br />
Just alchemy supplies.<br />
<br />
Besides Katta, he's the only vendor for titans potions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">He does give out one of the quests for Haven faction.  You get a sewing kit from him.  Take the kit to the gnome in the Bazaar.  Get gems from the gnome and return them to Steanos.  Two faction increases per round trip.  It's how I got my SH faction maxed.</div></div><hr />
