I dont do much net stuff so I dont really know how too &quot;link it&quot; or anything .. guess im stupid :)<br />
Just thought my fellow shamans might be interested .<br />
<br />
I wont quote everything exactly but at one point he did imply SoE was &quot;By no means through looking at the shaman class&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
I may need to check my facts, but I was under the impression that Shaman saw a few significant changes recently.  Now this in no way implies that the team is done looking into shaman, however I do think that it shows that SOE does not in fact hate shaman.<br />
<br />
I would ask that you please show a little patience as you have recently seen some changes, however many other classes have not. <br />

I find it odd that he'd choose a post like 'BRENLO, mind telling us why SOE hates us?!? =)' to respond to, but at least it's something. ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zorash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Greetings,<br />
<br />
Honestly, I'm less worried about the fact that he thinks we've gotten &quot;significant upgrades&quot;, and more concerned with the fact that he's SPEAKING with us on our forum.  That's the first, most important step in getting things resolved.<br />
<br />
The upgrades we got were nice, though not enough.  If he'll keep an open dialogue, and continue talking with shaman on their forums, we'll have a MUCH better chance of actually getting things tuned/fixed/tweaked than if we all jump on him for calling the upgrades significant when we think they're not.<br />
<br />
If all we do is yell and complain about everything, even the way he tries to communicate with us on our boards (the way we've asked him to), then we'll more than likely end up convincing him not to do so anymore...which is not what we want.<br />
<br />
We DID get some attention, even if it didn't fix our class.  We're at least a tiny bit better off than we were, even though it IS only a tiny bit, not the changes we need.  The biggest point is, he's talking with us.  I'd say, have a little patience, let the man breathe, and let's see if we can get an open discourse going.  There are lots of other classes bitching too, with just as much right to complain as us, and he's probably awfully busy.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the link :)<br />
<br />
Be well,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well at least he seems to know what shamans are now.<br />
<br />
Although he certainly has a different idea of what the word &quot;significant&quot; means than I do.<br />
<br />
But I guess its better than nothing, not much better as he gives the impression that SOE already made meaningful changes to our situation.  I hope that he is just trying to placate the gullible, and does not actually believe it himself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Our upgrades were...<br />
<br />
Correcting a spell imbalance that should have been fixed before live. Can we count the spells every other class got in gates as &quot;upgrades&quot; too?<br />
<br />
And upgrading HoT's spells, which he admitted at the fan faire they did because it was a bone they could throw us that didnt matter.<br />
<br />
So we got... the same upgrades every other casting class got (just a month or 2 later), and an insignificant change. WUWU!<br />
<br />
Perhaps fixing our crappy pet aa also counts as an upgrade.<br />
<br />
Quick, nerf berserker mitigation, remove double attack, and then return them a patch later. OMG, look at all the massive berserker upgrades they got! Class balance a go go!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">What he basically said was &quot;hush, you're fine, we basically fixed you, and other classes need attention more&quot;.  This isn't encouraging, it basically supports the concern we had that our class is going nowhere fast.  They consider a heal I can't get and a slow I won't use to be a fix.  (yes, I've tried and tried to get to GoD to get that spell - and the few people who've done their research and DO want to go, do NOT want a shaman taking up a slot in their group, though I'm welcome to buff them beforehand).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">That turtle guy .. he is just determined to keep shaman from being upgraded.  He thinks that being a powerful character in BoT and LDoN is the end of all be all.  And to top it all off he just posts these endless drivel posts that make your head spin with his stupidity.<br />
<br />
My advice to you who are posting over there on the shaman class board: ignore him.  Don't ever reply to anything he says, no matter how much he baits you.   Just take a look at his avatar (hint: it says TROLL) and you get the picture. <br />
<br />
Take him out of the loop by never replying directly to him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I wrote this in response ... shock of all shocks: it would not post on those forums (yes I was logged in ... 3 separate times.)<br />
<br />
I do not buy this &quot;he is talking with us&quot; crap. Pardon my hardness in stating it that way. What is clear is he has no concept what our problems really are. SOE has no concept what our problems really are. If this is not true, then what becomes clear (if they are aware) is that they do not care. At this point Brenlo and SOE need to get off the pot. Let him post here and just say: F SHM. At least it would be a definitive answer. This tap dancing around us nonsence is just ... friggen ... old.<br />
<br />
That folks are grasping at straws of hope based on both patronizing and condesending comments from Brenlo is sad beyond belief.<br />
<br />
<br />
Brenlo, with honest respect for your position and recent reaching out to the communities, I have to point out that your comments here are another slam to the shaman community.<br />
<br />
We know you have been kept up to date on the general shaman condition via email (well, we know the emails were sent.) These significant changes you mentioned shaman have received, as pointed out in those emails, are not significant nor do they change anything in any way, shape or form that benefits either shaman or the groups they are in ... none of which, btw, are in GoD.<br />
<br />
I am responding directly to this not because of the first paragraph, but rather the second. Essentially you have asked us to be patient because we received changes, regardless of the simple fact that those changes do nothing to fix shaman role problems since PoP. We are being asked to be patient because the focus is on other classes that have not recieved changes - or so the implication of your comment suggest. For the record, I am not against SOE addressing other class problems. GoD introduced quite a few to a number of classes. Regardless of your notes, however, shaman have not been given anything that any shaman would ever consider a fix to our current state. Basically, whatever changes that were made are not &quot;significant&quot; nor do they help with contributing to a group in the game zones we need to be able to contribute in.<br />
<br />
Visit the Crucible, Brenlo. Check out the notes from the fanfair. First (from the Devs): shaman healing will not change because, combined with slow, better heals would be overpowering. Second (from the Devs): mitigating and immune mobs are the solution for heavy hitting, low hit point mobs &quot;because the community wants faster encounters, not longer.&quot; Third (from the Devs): shaman are in  long term fights extremely effective damage dealers/mitigators ~ there is no need to address their damage output.<br />
<br />
Does no one really see the interweaving and conflicting lack of both vision and class understanding in statements that singularly contradict and collectively totally obscure any sense of knowledge about either the class, groups or encounters themselves?<br />
<br />
Re-read the email sent you by Chutoi and others that address shaman problems logically or come to the boards and look at the threads that provide even more solid, parsed evidence documenting facts of the game regarding shaman problems.<br />
<br />
Patience is something the majority of shaman came back to when we saw the &quot;significant changes&quot; you referenced. Not because they were &quot;significant changes&quot; but in consideration of your having come to the Crucible and opening a dialogue with the community. Now that the changes are in the best you can do in response is: &quot;I need to check my facts ... &quot; Once again, I am disappointed to see you have not grasped the gimp class shaman have become. Surely there is someone at SOE/EQ that doesn't have to &quot;check their notes&quot; to describe what a shaman is, what a shaman contributes, the current value of those contributions as well as problems that shaman have as a class! Surely there is someone at SOE/EQ  who can do this for each and every class ... and this is not just one single person tucked away in a corner pre-beta testing content!<br />
<br />
Patience has passed. Some is now fuming tolerance. Some is resignation - both to accepting the lack of game knowledge by those making, adjusting and planning the game (as it appears) and true resignation .... account cancellation. SOE has burnt out serious and commited EQ players with the direction and lack of knowledge of the effect that has had on players to the point they quit. Left. Translation: customers lost, decreasing bottom line profit. It isn't just shaman.<br />
<br />
Patience is not a concept, as the customer, we need to be asked to embrace. If and when we are patient it is our choice. Check your notes. You are on the wrong end of the business model to be asking us to be patient. Walk down the hall and talk to the boss. Ask him why players are leaving due to frustration and why no one has communicated an vision on either classes or the direction EQ is headed. Ask him &quot;what is a shaman?&quot; or &quot;what is a cleric?&quot; and see what the reply is. Manage the community by supporting the community. Supporting SOE taglines to feed the community has not worked for any of those who came before. They will not work for you. The major difference now is the level of frustration is at the breaking point. Tolerance is a short lived path that leads to resignation.<br />
<br />
Then again, who knows. This may be the goal to wrap up an old, old game and have all migrate to EQ2 ... then again, not many businesses are that stupid. You have a captive audience in EQ. Captive as long as captivated only. SOE/EQ is losing its ability to captivate. Given SOE's game history since EQ, a lost customer is not likely to purchase the next attempt at an online game. EQ is your success ... build on it, build through it.<br />
<br />
Again, I have directed this to you personally as the SOE/EQ point of contact. Beyond that there is nothing personal. Don't take my comments as personal attacks - but do take them serious. You have a job to do. The best job that you could do is actually become a liaison between the &quot;office&quot; and the &quot;customer.&quot; The only way to do that job effectively is if you &quot;are on our side&quot; and getting folks moving, working, focusing on making EQ viable game play for all classes equally. What is going on now is not working.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Brenlo has stated it 2 times now off the top of my head that we suffer from class envy and now he has stated that we just recieved &quot;significant upgrades&quot;. I really dont believe there is any hope of anything happening anytime soon, though i do believe things will probably change when they decided to get to it.<br />
<br />
Problem is im past the point of &quot;being patient&quot; as brenlo requests. Im sorryy Bren, but you have let the pot boil too long, there is no patience left. Personaly as of today i think im resigning myself to the idea that im just hanging around till WoW then im out and if WoW doesnt cut it then its time to move out of thie genre and maybe back into FPS or just simply turn off the CPU.

Not to mention is below the players base expectations and encounter requirements to date simply because it's based on some equation which you never stuck to when developing new content. Lastly of note a minor upgrade to a single existing spell lol.<br />
<br />
Both changes of which to boot can only &quot;barely&quot; be felt by solely the level 65 community (and one exclusively by GoD participating shaman who are being carried though that expansion by friends and their guilds do to a very real lack of usefulness by our class there in).<br />
<br />
Sorry bud &quot;significant&quot; changes would be felt by the entire community across the board (or at least more than 1 stinking level!) to some degree.  This certainly not the case, and it seems by the FF info and whats been said so far SoE is not really concerned about addressing these issues (heck they won't even acknowledge a lot of them!).<br />
<br />
My patience is gone, I'm tired of hearing from zilch to incompetence from SoE developers.  I've given up I'm switching back to my ranger for most my play time now.  At least he's not as broken as my shaman on this end of the game heh. I'm out as soon as something better comes this way and there are certainly a number of promising titles likely to be out this year.<br />
<br />
Congratz SoE your skill at further alienating part of your player base has gotten better (250) Whoa and GM to boot! Quite the accomplishment heh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actualy the problem starts mid PoP which is easy to access now, even a unguilded hardly have time to play shaman like myself is elemental flagged, so we are all feeling the sting. Im not quiting my account, but i can understand the lack of communication, caring and understandign of SoEs own product, is enought o drive people away for good. Like i said, if i didnt have to buy a truck this week, i would probably be out doign something alot more fun then EQ, i simply cant afford anyhting else ATM, so thats whats keeping me here. Frankly once i get truckosourus, i might be following suit. Not in a huffy puffy, hold your breathe fashion, but simply cause this game has truly degenerated, i hate saying it, truly, but EQ is not the EQ that sucked me in and its never going back and im never going to change to the new EQ. There is so many reasons i wont list that others have and stuff, but ive noticed through all my life there is a time when a community begins to break down at the end of a game, where creators of the game move on to new projects and the game and the community start to head down a spiral path. Its a stagnate and long death thats hard to see, especaily if you still find enjoyment in the product, but i truly see this happening from my perspective and even if there is not enother EQ like home, im thinking the time to move to new horizons is fast approaching.<br />

You are missing a very vital point.  Why pour your heart and soul into improving your toon if the end result is going to be a bunch of worthless pixels?<br />

Sure, if you don't ever plan to go beyond the Plane of Time, you'll be quite happy as you are now.  But if you are in a guild that is raiding, or will be raiding, Plane of Time then you are almost certainly going to be asked to advance to GoD when that guild is done there.  Think about that.

be the healer in LDoN hard.  just tell me the group make up where you are optimal for LDoN hard.<br />

I have to agree with stygiana.  This is exactly the type of post that Brenlo should NEVER reply to.  It just reinforces that he doesn't pay attention to the rational, well written posts but focuses on the trivial ranty ones.  I guess that's the only way to get his attention.  What a waste of time, I dunno why he even bothers to read a thread with a title like that.  I know I sure don't.</div></div><hr />

<br />
some of you are saying that communication is the most important factor here, but if you read between the lines, shaman (plural) won't see another upgrade for a long while according to him...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">The problems came as soon as slow mitigation started.  That's our key ability, and basically the whole point to the shaman class.  I'm not saying we don't have other things, but slow is and has always been our absolute core.  Deciding to mitigate it directly meant mitigating our usefulness - right from the very start.<br />
<br />
Giving slows out to so many classes -- slows essentially as good as ours when counting mitigation, exactly as good as ours when mobs are unslowable in the first place, and just a bit different than ours in practical terms in groups(ours are still worthwhile in many raids, at least pre-GoD) -- further devalued the very core of our class.<br />
<br />
At this point, outside of raids I would recommend a chanter or a beastlord for most groups over a shaman, easily.  In GoD, I have raids to look forward to and some trials to look forward to where my contribution will be essentially nothing, and I will be a burden to my teammates in some of those trials.  Not encouraging.<br />
<br />
GoD has made our weaknesses apparent to even those thinking of including shamans in other content.  I used to get constant tells for groups until recently.  Now, whenever people are looking for slowers they are looking for chanters most of the time, or else beastlords.  If they didn't realize it before -- as I knew they eventually would -- they're realizing now that slows that are mitigated are essentially the same.  In other words, the core thing a shaman brings is the same as what other slowers bring, so there can be only two reasons to bring a shaman.  First, that he offers enough outside of his slow that he's preferable to a beastlord or enchanter, or second, that there is no other slower available at all.  <br />
<br />
At this point, it's quite clear to most people in the game that the first reason to include a shaman is not valid.  He does NOT add enough outside a heavily mitigated slow to make him a better choice than a beastlord or enchanter.  So to get groups I'm forced to rely on people who want my shaman for the second reason -- there are no other slows available.  Or to play only with the kind of very old friends who don't mind playing at a lower level of effectiveness.  So I can rely on desperation on the one hand or the pity and/or charity of old friends to get a group, or I'm out of luck.<br />
<br />
Great.  Now that sounds like a fun game.  And a class anyone would want to be in and work on.</div></div><hr />

Nobody is born saying &quot;When I grow up, I want to be the sole point of contact between a large, faceless multinational corporation and its hundreds of thousands of enraged customers!&quot;  He's doing it for the same reason anyone else takes on a thankless position, the pay, the experience, and the hope that it leads to something better.

<br />
Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying he's a saint, or even a nice guy.  I have no way of knowing.  I'm just saying that it's highly unlikely that he's able to do much more right now for shaman than he has already done, and beating on him with ridiculous **** like  &quot;SoE/Brenlo/EQ/whatever hates shaman!&quot; isn't going to encourage him to rush right back to help us as soon as he can.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Flufy, while I agree with the faceless corporation rant I do not share your confidence in Brenlo's desire to fix the game.<br />
<br />
Brenlo is not addressing comments/concerns/problems from the viewpoint of one who is working to solve anything. From &quot;what is a shaman&quot; and &quot;I have played a shaman to level 50&quot; to (his new quote of the day) &quot;checking my notes&quot; comments it is beyond crystal clear Brenlo has no clue. <br />
<br />
Shaman have directly provided him with analysis and descriptions of the affect GoD has had on shaman. He claims to have monitored these boards. Yet, every comment screams &quot;Hi, I am Brenlo ... what is a shaman?&quot;<br />
<br />
Brenlo is part of the problem. To &quot;stand up for the community&quot; (whether that community is shaman, rangers, or all of us) he first has to understand what he is standing up for. He has to have a clear knowledge of what the real problems are. He has to have a desire to get those problems fixed. Now, those are just a few things he needs to be able to advocate for the EQ community. His comments scream: I HAVE NONE OF THESE!!<br />
<br />
So, Flufy, sorry, Brenlo doesn't get my sympathy or support as an individual standing as our shield against the big, mean corporation. He is that corporation. He is the corporate part damaging the company by telling the customer to shut up and be patient.<br />
<br />
Don't waste your sympathy and understanding on someone who is part of the problem with no clear interest in being part of the solution.</div></div><hr />

Well maybe he should start to LISTEN to why classes think they are broken.<br />
When i read the knight class issues it comes down to the same issue we have. GoD is all about insane DPS mobs with low hp. Fix the concept and you fix the balance issues. Fix 1 class and you can repeat the process for 8 other classes<br />

For people in his position there are courses that tell you how to talk to customers, angry customers and even some that tell you how to retain unhappy customers.<br />
I for one would be happy if someone from SoE would start a serious conversation about our issues, not a 1 time show about some quick fix and then go back to radio silence.<br />

Maybe he won't rush back to fix us but as demonstrated this seems to be the only type of topic he actually replies to.<br />
And sure I can cancel my account, sure I can also take it 1 step further and actually use my corporate power to force an answer (my compagny makes Sony a lot of profit) but at the end of the day i am still &quot;playing&quot; EQ for 1 single reason, the friends i have here in my guild.<br />
And as the guild invites for WoW beta are coming in guess what will happen if so many players are still unhappy about EQ at that time.</div></div><hr />

Aye, that is exactly the case for me, Grimdreg.  I at times ponder why I should spend my precious time leveling and flagging a character that will ultimately become virtually useless for anything other than visiting newbie zones and buffing low levels?  Partly, becuse like most others here, I love the Shaman class.<br />

All that I am prized and heralded for at the moment, will be but a fleeting moment of glory at some point when I'm passed up for a class that can do my job just as well as I, ...and can add DPS.<br />

But I fear the time is coming where I will actually spend more time leveling one of my alts that can be of more benefit in the end game.

I have not purchased GoD or was a high end-PoP player, but I have some words I would like to say. Incoming rant...<br />
<br />
Right now I think that SoE is VERY worried about GoD, for they have created a domino effect.  Think about it, if we got anything new that we really want it will make other classes pissed.  If we got a new focus that would be useless, knowing most high end warriors dont really even need it anymore.  We WILL NOT get a new heal, as far as they are concered they gave us what we wanted, no matter what the reward was.  If you look at all the stuff we could get the only thing we could possibly get without giving many other classes upgrades is a nuke, thats it.  They screwed up big time and I think they know and are probably rushing to create a massive change, I might be wrong though.  Im just saying that their worst nightmare definately has come true, and they probably are trying to fix it to end all the cancelled accounts or inactive ones no one cares about.  Look at the whole present they gave us on the 5th anniversary,  desperation or kindness? Either of them work.  In my opinion they are trying to add in gear and other nice drops just to keep people satisfied while they try to fix the **** that hit the fan.  The whole point of what i just said summarized in this sentence is that they know they created a very bad domino effect, but just arent trying hard enough to fix it and they are hurting bad because of it.  Thats just my 2 cents, disagree if you will, its just what I see thats going on.</div></div><hr />

Wallorn, what part of Brenlo's response sounds like he is trying to work with us?  It sounds to me like he is saying &quot;Hey we gave you a 50hp raise to Q, and replaced the crappy spell with a new heal that is in line with the two real priests!  That’s right you crazy shamans you now got the same upgrade percentages that real priests got!  You don't actually think you deserve to be useful outside of trivial content do you?&quot;<br />
<br />
While Brenlo, or any of the devs are in no way beholden to me personally, last time I looked I was a paying subscriber to their product.  SOE is beholden to me as a consumer if they expect me to continue to pay for their poor quality products.  I owe then money every so often; they own me at least a semi quality product.<br />
<br />
I have to say after the GoD expansion, I regret leaving Shadowbane and coming back to EQ.  Shadowbane had its faults, and a constant PvP environment is undoubtedly not for most people, but man, even getting pk's or trained repeatedly is less frustrating than reading the responses from EQ representatives when they claim that either 1) there are no issues with shamans or 2) the upgrade to Q and the 1550 point heal solved any issue.</div></div><hr />

You're completely wrong.  He is beholden to us.  We're paying customers that are asking for attention to our problems.  His paycheck comes from our pockets and thus we are right to demand immediate action.  Otherwise, what are we paying for?  <br />
<br />
Lets say you ordered a large with pepperoni and mushrooms from the local pizza spot.  It shows up 30 minutes late, but hey, they're busy and you can sympathize.  So you pay for it, give the driver a nice tip and get ready to enjoy your dinner.  You get inside and open the box to find that all the cheese and sauce has slid off to one side of the pizza.   Not only that, but its under cooked and appears to have anchovies and onions instead of pepperoni and mushrooms.  And the onions are bad and the anchovies stink twice as much as they should.  Unless you're a complete doormat, you'd call and give the manager a piece of your mind.  If he didn't address your complaint in a satisfactory manner, you'd take your business else where, right?  <br />
<br />
How is EQ different? Like pizza you pay your hard earned cash to enjoy it.  Like pizza you expect a certain level of quality to the product you recieve.  Like pizza you also can accept that if there is a lot going on in the oven/production pipeline you might have a wait for your product to be delivered.  And like pizza if theres something really wrong with the product, you expect to be dealt with in a prompt, curteous (sic) and at least somewhat effectual manner.<br />
<br />
SOE has done none of this since the split with Verant.  They've given us (and I mean us as the entire player base) shoddy product after shoddy product.  When they finally address the problems with their wares, its always months after it first cropped up.  Moreover, when we call them on it, they shine us on and tell us that they're looking into it, or it will be addressed.  We don't want obviously broken issues looked into, we want them fixed, and fixed yesterday. I mean good lord, Rangers have been asking for a fix to archery line of sight issues since 2001 and they've just been fixed now.  Thats not better late than never, thats a day late and a dollar short.   <br />
<br />
I've laid out 190 bucks for the initial product purchases and over 400 dollars in fees over the last 3 years for this game (which isn't even that much by many players standards) and I feel I'm owed an explanation as to why my class is now deadweight.</div></div><hr />

Just cancel now and save yourself the money... use the monthly fees saved from EQ subscription towards that WoW purchase. What to do in the mean time? There's plenty to do, and tons of free games (if you want to go that route), or summer is coming in the northern hemisphere... go for a walk, hang out the park, watch a local softball (or other sport) game... once the weather improves and warms up (It's 42 here right now), I plan on taking up some walking, just hanging out at the park, maybe catch some softball games, and other inexpensive activities.<br />
<br />
It costs a grand total of $0 to go to your friendly neighborhood park. Granted, I live in a quiet neighborhood too, so if you're in a big city, that may not be a safe option, but is an option nonetheless, and saves you 12.95/month... and if there's a problem, at least it won't take months/years to even get looked at or a response out of (usually).<br />
<br />
With my &quot;new free time&quot;, I've thought about doing all sorts of things, that don't cost me anything and will reverse the &quot;EQ damage&quot; to an extent. Doesn't cost me a thing, except for some time, which I have plenty of now, and can use the 12.95/month for something more worthwhile. Even just grabbing a book at the library and reading outside while it's nice out... still doesn't cost anything but time.</div></div><hr />

He's also worthless in the newest stuff.  A complete anachronism.  Doesn't matter if he gets better equipment or more spells from here, he'll still be worthless in GoD.

Maybe I'll stay on as my SK for a little while longer, but since SK's can't tank one-group content very well in GoD either, it's not too compelling to play a SK either.  But shamans seem just completely dead.<br />
<br />
At any rate, SOE's handling of the whole shaman class in GoD has really made me distrust the company's loyalty to its own customers, as well as basic intelligence and depth of understanding of their own game.  It's hard to feel like playing another class as a main wouldn't just run in to the same elimination of value that the shaman has undergone.  If expansions sell, regardless of the bugs and the poor design, I think that is probably meeting all and what might as well be the only goals Sony has set for the game.<br />
<br />
When WoW comes out, it will be VERY hard to convince me to stay in EQ, if I'm even around it by then.  No matter what class I'm on.  If they never fix shamans, I'll have to take that as a warning not to get too much time or &quot;emotional investment&quot; or whatever into any other class and character, too.  <br />

He's not a repairman, he's a lightning rod.  NO style of communication with him is going to net shaman anything real in the forseeable future.  He isn't there to make sure your class gets fixed, he's there to keep you from leaving in droves before EQ2 comes out.   <br />
<br />
Step away from the forums and shaman issues for a second and ask yourselves some big-picture questions.  Do you think SoE plans on supporting EQ1 and EQ2 equally, even though you can only play one at a time?  What game do you think they currently have the most programmers working on?  Which game do you think has a bigger budget?  Finally, is it more likely that SoE is going to spend the time/money required to fully repair all the major flaws in EQ, just to have the games profitability dwindle to next to nothing within the year?  Or would it make more sense to send some schmuck out there to pacify the masses with small, cheap fixes and doubletalk until EQ2 drops and they all migrate to it, or to other games?<br />
<br />
I realize that many of my posts carry a semi-paranoic, &quot;The Man is conspiring to keep me down!!!!11!!111one11!!&quot; flavor.  Not much to be done about that, I'm afraid.  But it doesn't mean I'm wrong.  The cold hard truth is that SoE would have to be composed entirely of raving lunatics to even consider implementing the type and scale of repairs required to remedy EQs ills at this point in the games lifecycle.  It would be financial idiocy.  UNLESS they were ALREADY losing a significant portion of their customers.  Hence my advice to click 'end billing' and take a month off.<br />

We already got our cookie.  There may even be one or two more in the offing, but there's no logical reason to expect anything more significant before EQ2 arrives, and there's no reason at all to expect anything after it's here.  We are as fixed as we're going to get.  Let it go.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">I don't agree with the &quot;let it go&quot; part at all.  That does nobody any good at all -- not us, not other classes, not SOE.  It's just a vote for even more inadequacy, but this time on our part -- a leap for the brass ring of non-accomplishment.  You win no prizes by pretending problems don't exist, or sulking in silence, or whatever.  At least if you're going to get screwed, it might be better to not volunteer for it by affirming the value of capitulation.<br />
<br />
I do agree, however, that our complaints are very likely to be fruitless.  If you look at the way slow works in the game, and measure that understanding against the &quot;insight&quot; of SOE about our class and the game in general, it's not hard to see that there really is nowhere to go with us outside of completely redesigning the class.  Considering they can barely even acknowledge anything is wrong with us in the first place, or seriously address any of our problems, how big is the chance for a total class revamp to deal with the fact that our core capability is effectively eliminated(when not duplicated) for this expansion and the entire likely future of the game?  How likely are they to REALLY fix us?<br />
<br />
That would require a great deal of creative thinking, and if they had creativity, they wouldn't have shafted us in the first place, but would have put something in the game already to make us still useful.  Our uselessness shouldn't possibly be a &quot;surprise&quot; to anyone with any knowledge of the class or of slowing classes in general, or even simply a knowledge of game mechanics in general.  Any thinking person could have easily anticipated the result of negating slow in this expansion and thereby putting a nail in the coffin of a class that at this point brings little BUT the best slow by a tiny percentage over two other classes with very similar slow percentages.  This is not brain surgery, guys.  They simply did not WANT to address this or ... couldn't be bothered.  <br />
<br />
Not in the rush to put out an expansion and garner a few more almighty dollars before EQ2 and WoW come out.<br />
<br />
We're done.  Our goose is cooked.<br />
<br />
Brenlo will continue &quot;checking his figures&quot; and &quot;looking into it&quot; and giving us &quot;substantial  improvements.&quot;  And if players are smart, they will continue and increase the trend of using chanters or beastlords when they want slow, and just making shaman bots if they need TOT/malos.  This will happen under Brenlo's nose, and he will &quot;address it shortly&quot; or some such, if he even admits it exists at all.<br />
<br />
And then the problem will go away, as the class does.</div></div><hr />

Yup, and for only 29.95, you can get an advanced character right from the get-go!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">the only reason I havent ended billing is my crew of Rl friends that play the game. <br />
<br />
the flip side of this is when I do leave sony will lose somewhere in the area of 12 accounts. <br />
<br />
my shaman is almost never played at all anymore, its tedious and frustrating to grind aa's out just to make a toon reach the level of barely acceptable in a group. at 65 I should be looking forward to the endgame, not looking at the product and thinking &quot;wow what a load of horse****, I'm not paying for that&quot; and being dead on right, I havent paid for God and I thank God every frigging DAY that I had the foresight (and the crucible to help me decide) to not pay for God. its obvious God is on my side, to bad God sucks ass like it does but maybe with a prayer or 2 to God God will become a better place.<br />
<br />
<br />
sorry sleepy as hell, thats pretty funny when you need some nap time. to bad I will wake up and reread that and think &quot;God Damnit&quot;</div></div><hr />
