<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Archyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Here is from my personal experiences on my shaman with Kael faction.<br />
Up to the point where I started working on my factions in Velious, the only hunting I had done there involved no faction hits, the only faction &quot;work&quot; I had done was the Coldain Shawls 1-3 all of which are pretty easy and take you to amiable or so depending on where you start.<br />
I was just a few steps below Glares Threateningly to the giants and amiable to the Coldain. All this is to give you an idea on where I was when theis started.<br />
If you have done any faction work with the dorfs, hunted giants in Kael and are max KOS, grin and bear it, its gonna be a long ride.<br />
The absolute, total 100% fastest method to getting Tormax faction to ally is go on a Dain raid and get a bunch of faction hits on the royals and Dain himself. Do this 3-4 times for the average Dain raid and your pretty close to ally from glares threateningly; you can also go to SS and go on Yelinak raids and maybe a few other named hits (not sure how this is with the new SS changes however, things are...odd....in SS now).<br />
As far as the hand in quests to the Capt, I found that you get excellent Zek faction, so so Tormax faction and the rif faction is nearly not there.<br />
Best bet for farming faction is the miners in the southern mines of GD, there are 7ish miners way in the back that you can pretty much wack with no downtime, they drop more heads than the others in the mines and hit like girls in frilly dresses. This gets up your standard RIf and Zek factions as well as a few hits to the coldain (awe).<br />
It took approx 50 coldain heads to reach max ally with the Zek, finally reach ally with Tormax (got a sweet SS of my shammie sitting in his lap on Christmas day :D) and Dubious to the rif (stubborn lot they are).<br />
This was from 3 Dain raids with faction hits on all royals and Dain himself, multpile ToV raids (6 or 7) for armor farming and faction hits on a few odd ball named (Yeldema, Sontalak, Telkorenar being the most memorable).<br />
Wish that I could tell you that this would be easy and not a lot of work...but sadly it is a lot of work and a big time sink, as is all faction work. You do have the added bonus of sneak where my shaman did not, so that will help tons ,also I never tried the kobold paws, just the heads, so I cant comment on the faction recieved by them.<br />
The quests are worth the trouble, and I am guessing that your looking at either Gauntlets of Dragon Slaying, Girdle of Dorf Slaying etc if your worried about Tormax faction, if so pre grats :D and good luck.<br />
<br />
Edit: A good way to get Dain faction hits would be to sorta ask a local guild that does do him pretty regular and just tag along for faction hits, spamming Chloro on the MT or tossing a few arrows on him will do just fine, in fact my guild had several tag alongs doing just that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Giostrus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hiya Glade :)<br />
<br />
Was wondering if any of you ever tried a hand in on sneak (indifferent) faction.. assuming of course you can reach him sneaking through..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cymrich</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">you can turn in dorf heds to bvellos at the bank sneaking, but positioning is very important. was ally, then keeled some giants, then went back to ally by keeling tons of bodyguards for exps, then turning in heds. wasn't max scowl, but was close am shure, think turned in prolly 8 bags of dorf heds.<br />
<br />
just watch positioning when sneaking behind bvellos, and make shure no one else is nearby. if they hail any of the giants around him, including bvellos, they will turn, and could get you keeled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Giostrus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i mean actual hand in of head to KT on sneak.... :)</div></div><hr />
