<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">replace both rings with 6ac 65hp rings and get some new wrist slot pieces. Also try and get your hands on a Acrylia Studded cloak, these sell for 800-1500pp but you could go to DSP and farm yourself some acrylia. small pieces = 1 brick/blocks= 2 you will need 12 of these. Then you can either kill rockhoppers till you get a superb pelt of them or buy it at bazaar for 100pp. Then all you need to do is buy the pattern and get a friendly smith to combine it for you(make sure its trivial to them though). Chitinous Belt of possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">cool. any other suggestions?</div></div><hr />

Here are a few more ideas, many of which you can get yourself or with a group of friends.<br />
<br />
Elder Wolf Hide for shoulders  - soloable I should think, certainly easy with a friend. Can take a little while, depends on your luck - I got mine in about an hour. Drops off the named wolf in Hollowshade, spawns in the back of the cave.<br />
<br />
Coldain Military Wristguard - search the board for info. Would <br />
probably need a few friends at your level, not 100% sure though. Extended Affliction 3 and reasonable stats makes this a must-have item considering how easy it is to obtain.<br />
<br />
Some people hate it, but if you don't loath the place try going to Karnor's Castle. Jarsath armour (no drop) drops there, and most people will pass on it. It'd make a good upgrade for your legs, although the legs aren't such a common drop.<br />
<br />
You could consider trying to get groups in Old Sebilis - if you get in the crypt you are in for some nice goodies - JBB, ODS, Heiro cloak - all worth a lot of pp, and all nice shammy kit. And if you don't get a group there, it'll still be nice xp and decent loot from the gems and stuff at other camps.<br />
<br />
Ivory Imbued Collar or Twisted Metal Torque would be good neck upgrades. The collar is around 200pp on my server.<br />
<br />
Go to Velketor's - Crystal Spider Eyes for face are a significant upgrade. Frenzy camp is good loot in general. Cystal Chitin arms are another Velks drop that'd be a good upgrad. If you can swing an invite to the UD camp, spider fur belt is a nice drop there too.<br />
<br />
Finally, I'd suggest saving up for an Iksar Ceremonial Breastplate (about 5k) - more AC and 5hp/tick regen, which will be nice until 58 at least, or even higher.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">in addition to the rings, try black sapphire electrum earrings (ac2 35hp 25mana)</div></div><hr />

Budget increased to ~2200 as I made off with some diamonds and other tasty sellables in PoN last night. I'm also soon to be guilded into Order of Concord, so my uber-mob-loot abilities have been expanded. Any more suggestions would be great in light of these changes.</div></div><hr />
