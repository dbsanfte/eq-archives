<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>lightus_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ok I finally finished up ScS yesterday, but i didnt really see any improvement, I still couldnt do more then one dot pr. mob and some DDs, i mean shouldnt it be so that i could feel a difference ?<br />
I would not recommend it to anyone, before you have maxxed you CHA :-)<br />
Do you feel a difference after getting this ?<br />
<br />
Crit Dot is still the best new AA IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've felt a difference just by the first 2 levels (need half an aa for the 3rd level) and so far I am happy, been doing malos, slow and cripple right after each other on incoming tipt mobs, and after scs I rarely got a pounding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have level 2, and notice a difference when slowing, but not when DOTing. I think the DOT aggro is still not being affected by this AA properly (if it is supposed to at all)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I PLed my ranger alt in PoJ cave area a bit after I got SCS2. I pulled with slow, told doggy to attack (taunt off). EVERYTIME the mob stopped chasing me and fought doggy. When I casted a dot (used bane / blood) the mob came after me again.<br />
<br />
Other night in BoT: I casted same dot combination ( bane / blood ) after slow and the SK had to work his ass off to keep agro.<br />
<br />
Conclusion: SCS works great on slow but doesn't effect dots (or may be only when casted but not the damage done over the time).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">SCS2, not dying at raids nearly as much anymore.  Pushing for SCS3 as it's gonna double the effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">SCS3 was my first GoD AA, and it seems very notable in the early slow/debuff phase of raids.  I concur that dot aggro seems to be still unaffected.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Seems great to me. I finally slowed Lord Mithaniel Marr for the first time this weekend and I have SCS3. I think I had like 20-30 slow attempts before one stuck - no aggro. It may not affect DOT spells or not as much but take away a lot of slow aggro and it helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">yes</div></div><hr />

This happens on green and lt blue mobs anyway, without SCS.  Even on some mobs that are blue but just barely blue,  so I don't think SCS had anything to do with this.<br />
<br />
I have SCS2 and have noticed a difference when slowing in sol ro tower.  Mobs seem less inclined to hate me now and I love it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>blakhomer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Its better than lr5.<br />
<br />
Id prefer the mob not taking a swipe at me at all than avoiding 2 of his 8 attacks.<br />
<br />
Spent 18aas the day I logged in to get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>korask shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I havent noticed much of a difference personally.  With SCS3 i casted malos on a air avatar the other day turned and hearded a few guildies crippled it and got summoned for no apparent reason, and took the tank about 10 rounds to finally get it off me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I was going through vxed with a warrior using a BoW w/ Anger III proc.  I would malos on inc and immediately hit it with turgur's - no delay.  Doing this I would get aggro until the tank taunted/whacked it again.  After an hour of this I was getting sick of it.  I had 12AA banked and I trained SCS2.  I stopped getting aggro.<br />
<br />
That's worth it, imho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Mobs in PoAir are notorious for doing weird things with aggro, FYI.  Wouldn't count anything that happens there as proof of anything either way. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">SCS is pure heaven.<br />
<br />
I bought level 1 and some other crappy stuff when GoD first came out.<br />
Level 1 was noticable in allowing me to duck aggro a bit better.<br />
I regularly party with a 65 SK friend of mine wielding a 40/30 1h blunt weapon.<br />
<br />
I found that with just SCS1 I could pull with Malos and slow on the inc, and she could take aggro off me before the mob got into camp so it wouldn't ever even hit me.<br />
This didn't seem to be the case before I had SCS1.<br />
<br />
With SCS2, I can pull with Malos, slow the mob, and never have aggro when it finally gets to camp.<br />
I can load up a Bane right away, and not catch aggro either.<br />
Even doing Blood instead of Bane didn't catch much more aggro I found.<br />
<br />
SCS3 is amazing though.<br />
I don't get aggro any more.<br />
I can Malos a named mob on inc, slow it, and cripple it without a thought if I'm going to get aggro.<br />
Normally that combo of 3 would get me summoned in a moment.<br />
In Sol Ro on the regular humanoid mobs near the zone in, I can malos on the pull, tag with slow, disease debuff, pox, ultor, and get zero aggro chaining all those spells one after another.<br />
I'll do some further testing today when I party with her to see if I can do a Malos + slow + blood and still duck aggro immediately or not, but I'm pretty sure I can get off of aggro very very fast regardless.<br />
<br />
SCS3 is one of the best AAs I've ever picked up, easily on par with LR5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>snt_asher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">ScS was way worth it i see a big difrence with lvl 3<br />
<br />
just rember you dont have to out run the Tiger you just have to out run the persen next to you even with lvl 1 the other shm's were the ones getting hit  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">This happens on green and lt blue mobs anyway, without SCS.  Even on some mobs that are blue but just barely blue,  so I don't think SCS had anything to do with this.<br />
<br />
I think LB is around level 50 for level 65 toon. The mobs there are around level 55 (ranger is 55 now and the mobs are a mix of blue / white / yellow for her). I did the same thing before I got SCS2: cast slow, /pet attack and pull the mob back to ranger. Only very few times doggy stole aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Malaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I love it.<br />
<br />
However i am kinda disapointed with the persistent casting AA, i do not feel any difference at lvl3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Chairman Meow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I have trained up to scs2, and already notice a huge difference.  I fight exclusively within my guild, so am very familiar with the tanks I group with.  Not only do I get noticeably less aggro, but when I do, the tanks have an easier time regaining.  I highly recomend this aa ability, as soon as you are able. (If you mainly solo, this may not apply to you)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I waited until after the cleric I group with mainly got SCS3 before I started working on it for myself.  I bought SCS1 the other night on a Tipt farming run.  I generally malos on inc and slow immediately.  I have Spell Awareness and a long relationship with the tank I group with, so he times his taunts for when slow lands.  I rarely get agro and if I do, it is only one round of melee.<br />
<br />
So anyways, I bought SCS and died to agro on the next mob.  :p<br />
<br />
Henora: Yay, bought SCS1<br />
Group: Cool<br />
Puller: Inc Golem<br />
Henora begins to cast the spell [Malos]<br />
Golem looks angry!<br />
Henora begins to cast the spell [Turgurs Insects]<br />
Golem yawns, like partially or something.<br />
Henora has been slain by Golem.<br />
Henora: Hmm, maybe I needed to zone to get SCS working!<br />
Group: ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>lightus_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">i have stop thinking about it, now ill just wait until next time we do P3 and see if there is a difference when i malos and slow on inc before the Mt has agro :-)....<br />
Its not useful in a kite group thats for sure, i think i kite just as much as the necros and drids due to overagro... i need learn to control agro :-(<br />
ill get back on the malos slowing part after next trip to time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Seichan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Ok.. after getting Sublety3.. I was camping Comm2 for the Emp key piece.. while laying LDoN Bane and BoS onto a filty snake person.. the chanter was able to pull agro off of me by sitting... <br />
<br />
I mean, I could lay on more DoT's on the mob or just be generally reckless with my dots and still get agro.. but if you're careful.. you can avoid a lot of agro with Sublety 3</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">SCS 3 is working as intended imo. i love it.<br />
<br />
slows, dots, nukes, cripple, quick heals. i can cast it all and not pull agro.<br />
<br />
it does make it more difficult to hold agro if i am tanking though. just gotta cast more spells that piss off mobs is all.</div></div><hr />
