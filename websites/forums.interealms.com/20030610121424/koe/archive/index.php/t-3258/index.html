<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Redtree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well fear was my first ever raid... Man I enjoyed it ((even at the weee hours of the morning))<br />
<br />
I got a nice pair of SK gauntlets and wanted thank everyone for the chance to be there. &lt;&lt; lol Wulfran asked for interested people to give him tell,, think i sent three....sorry hehe&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
We also where able to help humfrey out with this golem that had like a trillion HP.  Was a little worried as i watched Wulfran beat on the thing for 3 minutes and not even a shiver appearing to leave the Health bar.<br />
<br />
PS i didnt even die...Again a first:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Arsecn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hope they were gentle with you ;)<br />
<br />
Gratz!  If Wulf had another hour left in him I was gonna ask him to recreate his infamous 'Ransure' pull of the Amys for ya... woulda fixed that no-dying thing for ya real quick ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Yadilu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I know all about Ransure's style of pulling.  In fact, I've been trying it out the last couply days, I don't think it's workin' fer me :)<br />
I agree though, broke my no-dying-for-3-months pact real quickly.<br />
