Resolved an issue with pet haste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>phoenixone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">yeah right, 3 hours for pet haste.</div></div><hr />

Or did they finally fix the issue with the invulnerable portals?</div></div><hr />

The Spell breath of Trushar.<br />
<br />
I refused to even take the stone for the spell from the last raid, better off for someone that can get some real use out of it get it heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You would be hard pressed to find worse handling of obvious problems with 1/10th (or whatever percentage shamans make up) of a business customers than what SOE delievers. Now we are below an issue with some sort of pet haste. Amazing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm still calm, Just annoyed. :p<br />
<br />
I feel kinda stupid for giving SOE the benefit of the doubt in one of my posts yesterday where I said it wasn't really reasonable to expect them to take the servers down to patch ONE spell, and yet today they do take the servers down to fix ONE issue regarding pet haste and completely ignore the blatantly idiotic change they made to Breath of Trushar.  It would have taken them all of... what, 10 seconds? to change the line in the spdat about Breath of Trushar back to it's previous form.<br />
<br />
In all honesty, the phrase &quot;slap in the face&quot; gets tossed about far too often for my tastes, but I can't help but feel like this truly is one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Now, now... calm down. For this to be a slap in the face, you would have to assume that shamans are at least a passing concern for those developpers working on spell issues.<br />
<br />
Personally, I doubt that we're even that.<br />
<br />
Just be grateful that this issue that affected us also affected mages, necros, SKs, 'chanters and druids. Had it been only us, we would have been able to haste our pet again the same day we would have been able to shrink them too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">yeah ***?   FIX PET SHRINKAGE!!!   my dog is constantly getting in the way it sucks and it's been like this since when .. last fall?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tyck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Fix it?  They are not going to fix it.  Brenlo made it clear that it was done intentionally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>kowalsky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">yeah... now I double grow my pet on raid :)<br />
<br />
&quot;oh sorry can't shrink it.. working as intended said SOE&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;what? it has the size of an ogre?... sorry... working as intended said SOE&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Why intentional?  That makes no sense.  Was there some exploit that had to do with our tiny dogs?   That is crazy-stupid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>kowalsky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">fact is that people kept walking on them while they were double shrunk at the size of a Qeynos rat.. so our pets made a big sitting in POP and the dev removed our hability to shrink them.<br />
now people don't walk anymore on them and our pets are happy.<br />
then they did anothe sitting in POP to have all shaman AA turned into pets AA.<br />
<br />
too bad I was buzy chaining tnarg on my tank because my slow was mitigated when they did that sitting or I would have showed my pet who is the master.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>TPFKAFaern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I was going to say that you have to have a face with Sony for them to slap it, or that the face sits underneath a large helping of red-hair.....<br />
<br />
But then I figured the adopted stepchildren would get upset that the beatings had stopped.</div></div><hr />

WTH is a &quot;sitting&quot;?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">fact is that people kept walking on them while they were double shrunk at the size of a Qeynos rat.. <br />
<br />
well ok. the dog is rat-sized NOT donkey-sized now that you have shrunk it. last time I checked I didn't have to stop and circumvent the rat on the floor. I just stepped on it or over it. Back to the point-- what is the problem with giving shamans a dash of convenience when playing the game? Throw us a bone here- were not talking about 'Project: Priest Balancing IV' here; just a conveniently sized dog like since the near beginning of the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>kowalsky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">WTH is a &quot;sitting&quot;?<br />
<br />
a possible translation issue :) sorry english is not my mother tongue.. <br />
<br />
&quot;sit-in&quot; perhaps? when people sit and complain..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kiisekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Can somebody show me where Brenlo or anyone said that was intentional? I have got to see the reasoning behind intentionally taking out our ability to shrink our pets...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Not necessarily related to the patch message, but has anyone had difficulty remaining in the game for more than a few minutes since the 3/10/04 patch?  I can't keep a character in game and keep crashing to the server select screen.<br />
<br />
I didn't perform any updates or change any drivers prior to the 3/10/04 patch.  I get the same problem running the client in EQW as I do full screen and it has happened on two machines so far (going to test it on another two tonight).<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!</div></div><hr />

this is where Brenlo said it... search for his name as a user.  It's in the message about BoT and it's on the front page<br />

 Folks you already knew about this change as it showed up on Lucy before we began this dialogue. This is not part of the work that Rytan is looking into now for your healing. This was something already planned and locked in. It would have been far too soon to have implemented changes to your heals in the 2 days since Rytan visited. <br />
<br />
I know that it has been a long road for you, but I would like to ask you all for just a little more patience.<br />
