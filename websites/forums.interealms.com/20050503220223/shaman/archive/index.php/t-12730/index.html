<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>craknek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi. I am thinking about buy the Shadows of Luclin expansion, so I have been looking all over the internet for information about the BeastLord class. <br />
<br />
Maybe its me, but I looked on one site that listed all of the spells available to a beastlord starting at lvl 9, and it appears that have alot of the same spells as Shamans, and I do not mean in a Hybrid way, I mean it looks like they have alot of Buffs, alot of DoT spells, the spirit line of spells, etc etc.<br />
<br />
If this is the case, then what real advantage does a Shaman have over a Beastlord??? Please help, I want to play a Vanshir Shaman, but if the Beastlord is just as good then I'll do that.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Keriru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hubby plays a Vah Shir Beastlord and I play a Vah Shir Shaman. I didn't really take the time to learn about a beastlord. But I love my shaman. I love my buffs, and can't wait till they last longer. Hubby loves his Beastlord's warder, because he started off cute, and now at lvl 22, he's an even con. And when I make him grow the pet and shrink us, he looks like a monster. :)<br />
<br />
Reading something about our shammy pets on these boards, I have come to the conclusion that Beastlord pets are better. But I don't know enough about spells for either class to tell you anything else.<br />
<br />
Good Luck. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ask a beastlord to heal a group.  You'll see the difference immediately.<br />
<br />
Bsts and shaman are pretty akin to rangers and druids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Basically comes down to if you want to do more damage go BL if you want to heal/buff group more go sham. <br />
<br />
Kitty great choice btw for either. Have fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Beastlords get some of the same spells as a shaman, but the shaman get them at a lower level then the beastlord.<br />
<br />
Shaman get a 75% slow at level 51. Beastlord get a max of 65% slow and not until level 65.<br />
<br />
Shaman get the Malo line, Beastlords do not which makes it harder for them to land the slows.<br />
<br />
Shaman get the Focus line of spells, Beastlords do not.<br />
<br />
Shaman have a better line of heal spells including Torpor. the best heal spell beastlords get is Chloroblast.<br />
<br />
Beastlords do not get the Cannibalize line of spells, they do get a mana/health regen line of spells though.<br />
<br />
When someone brings a Beastlord into a group or a raid it is usually not to play the same role as a shaman, unless it is for slowing in absense of a shaman. <br />
<br />
I am not saying shamans are better.. just beastlords are different and the role they play is different.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Beastlords get fewer spells than Shamans, and they get them at later levels than Shamans. They are hybrids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Keriru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">That's a really great comparison! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Beastlords are completely different from shamans.  At level 65, beastlords can cast a 65% slow, which is almost as good as our slow.  However, you wouldn't be 65 for a very long time, and you'd still need to get a rune in order to get the spell.  With a shaman, you will have powerful slows your entire career.  In addition to that, you get better buffs sooner than the beastlord gets them.  You also have much better heals, stronger dots, and cannibalize.  Beastlords get decent melee damage and a nice pet, whereas we have 0 melee damage and a gimpy pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Keriru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Okay, so what about a comparison on soloing?<br />
There has to be a purpose for giving us the Beastlord as an optional toon, right?<br />
I mean, we never see /shout Group looking for a BST<br />
So, what's the purpose of a beastlord? To solo? To be independent and cut off from the world like rangers were?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Beastlords are incredible soloers and are also way underrated in groups like mages and necros. They can probably exp faster then a sham solo but won't necessarily be able to solo some names that shaman could if thats your thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have a wee BL in my sack o' alts.  Compared to the other classes, he was an absolute breeze to get to 33 un PL'd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Korok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Beastlords are great soloers indeed.  They can plow through levels at an amazing rate.  They can bring good dps to a group, and can offer the lower end shaman buffs, and slows if there is no shaman present.<br />
<br />
The spirit line is pretty good.  You're giving your group health and mana regen.<br />
<br />
As a BL you're very dependant on your pet.  I mean VERY.  You have very weak armor, and low hit points.  So although you can dish out the melee damage you'll always need that pet by you.<br />
<br />
Beastlords have the best pet heal in game.   At level 49 you're healing your pet for 900hp.<br />
<br />
Some folks choose the pet/cleric role.  I preffer to be in the thick of things, only backing off when I need to heal myself.<br />
<br />
Lastly I'd like to point out that beastlord gear is insanely expensive.  The hand to hand weapons are over priced.  I suppose because they are harder to come by.  The same is true for the armor.<br />
<br />
I've just started a shaman alt.  Wanted to try out a character that had more magic damage.<br />
<br />
Kordok - lvl 10 Shaman<br />
Krinje - lvl 51 Beastlord</div></div><hr />

<br />
BL HP is more than Shaman, plus they get more HP per STA. At level 60, Shamans get 3 HP per STA, while Beastlords get 4.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My BL alt broke 1k hp at level 20, and I don't think I even put 2k into twinking him.<br />
<br />
BL are easy, cheap twinks...somewhere around necro soloing ability for the first 50 levels(possibly better than a necro when they have kei..I killed Bosec(level 34) at 22 with my alt.. &lt;3 chain petting).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Did the monk un-nerf help out beasties since they are of the same armor class?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>kittyshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I played a bl up to 36, then started a shaman just out of curiosity.  I prefer the shaman big time.<br />
A beast lord is a very self sufficient char.  They are great at soloing and dealing damage, but they can't play all of the roles that shaman can play.  <br />
Soloing - edge goes to bl because of stronger pet and better damage dealing, but shaman is a great soloer also.<br />
Groups - bl buffs are not that good in a full group.  shaman buffs rock.  bl heals are not very good, shaman can save cleric (at 36, shaman has 300hp heal, bl has 33hp heal), both can tank good if no warriors available.<br />
One extreme annoyance I have with bl is that they don't have gate.  I hate that.  They cast spells, but they don't have gate.<br />
Overall, I think that shaman are almost as good at soloing and can cover more rolls in groups (tank, buffs, slows, heals).  Beast Lords are good at soloing, self sufficient with spells and act as a damage dealer for groups.  Beast Lords are much cheaper to buy gear for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I know shaman can solo in the plane of fire/water.. can beatlords?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gagner67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">In the End game Shaman's can solo harder mobs.  This is due mostly to the extremely mana effectient heals we get and the cannibalize line.  <br />
<br />
The beastlord cannot.<br />
<br />
After clearing most of PoG.<br />
<br />
Perfect example (of the value of shaman mana effiecent heals) was when a beastlord from our guild tried to take a simple enough mob in PoG called &quot;A Thifling Focuser&quot; -with only his buffs-.<br />
<br />
http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=6004<br />
<br />
The mob had closed too or over 1 million hp.<br />
<br />
The beastlord engaged the mob and healed his pet with his 2100 hp pet heal that cost 425 mana and from time to time stepped into melee.<br />
<br />
End of story the beastlord ran out of mana.  <br />
<br />
I engaged the mob and after setup up (and only my buffs), found that I was able to canni enough mana to heal my pet indefinately and reslow when needed.  <br />
<br />
Thou the beastlord did argue that my 10% more slow played a part compared to his gimped 65% slow<br />
<br />
*shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I solo red mobs at level 65 for exp. Takes me 8-10 minutes per for a hefty chunk of exp.<br />
<br />
BST would be a smear on the ground if they attempted to solo them.<br />
<br />
BST is a good class but to suggest that a BST can solo better than a Shaman is a bit absurd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Some Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">My friend started a BST when i came back to the game with this SHM and he does solo a little more effectively than I do but in the end game I know that will change. Its all about patience from what I've seen</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Hagle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">BST has alot easier time pumping out the dps. If a shaman wants to pump out the same dps he has to have 2-4 mobs all dot/rotting. On any mob the bst can solo he better cause kill faster. Post 60 I just dont see a Bst keeping up with a shm though. I can finish a mob in under 6 min (PoV type). Afterwards I canni 5 am FM and gtg on next and I dont even have any aa's focus items or my 65 spells to speed up the kills. I very much doubt a BST even with all his spells focus items and aa can do that. Also a shm with VT or better gear can handle 2 or more mobs at once to speed up kills even more In PoP zones like BoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>reaper23</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Also Beastlord do not have any root spells and look at their 65 spells plague and acumen indeed a hybrid take away their pet and we could dish out more dps and after their rezz'ed geeze takes forevery for them to get enough mana to get back to fighting .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I know shaman can solo in the plane of fire/water.. can beatlords?<br />
<br />
Yes. Indeed I can</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Keriru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">So, what do you think of a Beastlord and Shammy team?  -Never guilded (not interested in epics at this time) just always duoing/soloing and only with each other. Is this realistic?<br />
<br />
Granted, we let a rogue in our group the other day, and I played healer, because I lost KEI, and it went faster, but it wasn't as much fun. :b</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Gagner67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Greetings <br />
<br />
Yes. Indeed I can<br />
<br />
I have seen beastlords solo in PoF it is nothing short but hilarious especially to see how much their class would probably die for the ability to root.<br />
<br />
The best a beastlord can manage; &quot;going toe to toe,&quot; are Obsidion Spiders in PoF.  They hit for 700+ damage meaning their pet gets railed but tries to manage.  Many times I have watched beastlords with C3 violently cast their 2100 hp pet heal for 425 mana.  Many times I have watched them die too, especially when there paragon discipline has not refreshed in the last 15 mins.  And without C3 forget it they are dead meat.<br />
<br />
Need to hear it from them?  Here then...<br />
<br />
http://www.eqbeastlord.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=4448<br />
<br />
Their only alternative, to turn to, is for the beastlord to aggro kite in a crazy and uncontrolable run about PoF.  <br />
<br />
No, Thank you, I will take Root Rotting as a shaman anyday rather than aggro kiting which is even open to me.<br />
<br />
Don't be fooled Beastlords are limited to the mobs they can take sololy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Dubarnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">beastlords and shaman are totally different all together.  Up to 50 they may be similar because players have not found the importance of buffs and the mobs u fight do not have as many hps but after 51 the game changes.  Shamans are wanted in groups for ONE thing, slow.  The group kindly ( and what i mean by kindly is annoys the hell out of the shaman) asks for buffs but really just wants slow.  a Beastlord is there for good dps and kitty crack.  When i am forming a pick up group i never once think twice bout inviting a BL just cuz his spells are similar, however i DO Get angry when a Beastlord tries to announce &quot;%t is SLOWED&quot;... i'm like i know, i did it 5 minutes ago urs didn't land ****.<br />
If you like to melee and be more fully engaged in combat (hack n slash crowd) play a Beastlord.  If you want to be a versitile class that can do many things try a shaman.  Shaman might not be as &quot;In YOUR FACE&quot; but they are just as fun non the less.  We still tank the mobs we solo (up to a point) we just don't hit back).  It's apples and oranges, both are good pick the one that fits u best.</div></div><hr />
