<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Telil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is my first time posting here but I have spent alot of time browsing the forums and have learned alot<br />
<br />
So a BIG thanks to all the people who post valuable information here :) <br />
<br />
Anyways here is my question. When should you slow?<br />
<br />
I did a search and didn't come up with anything that really helped but I have always thought it was based on the situation. Such as, in a big encounter where the mob could turn you into a pile of shaman goo, give the tank a bit of time to gain agro. In minor encouters such as experience groups try and land slow as soon as possible so as to save the tank from taking alot of damage and burning extra mana for heals, thus keeping things moving and the experience rolling in.<br />
<br />
The reason I ask is I was grinding a bit of experience tonight and was told by the tank that I should be waiting until the mob is down to about 95 %.  There was no particular reason for him to tell me to do this, I wasn't taking undo damage and I was not ping-ponging the mob.  So to make him happy I waited, mob gets to 95 % tank has taken 3 bub's of damage.  Slow lands, cleric complete heals and the tank takes a little less then 2 bub's of damage the entire fight.<br />
<br />
Now the reason I ask, not only did it bug me that someone was tryingt to &quot;TELL&quot; me how to play my class (not offering advice) but maybe he knows something I don't and I should be holding off on slows a bit.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<br />
The quicker you slow them, the better. The tank has his &quot;taunt&quot; skill to get the mob off you after you slow it. Tell him to taunt <br />
faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jagara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">a lot of when you slow depends on how likely you are to land it, whether the mob will summon and kill you easily if you catch aggro, and how much aggro your tank can generate<br />
<br />
generally i slow very aggressively unless its a boss or something that requires a team of debuffing to try for the slow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">So much of it depends on your tank. A 60+ pally tank I can slow the mob ASAP, sit down and laugh as the mob never aggros on me. A warrior OTOH hand...ugh it really varies widely. I've had 60 warriors that couldn't taunt for **** and it didn't matter when I slowed I'd get aggro everytime, not a problem if you can root it easily but some of the mobs in PoP zones root doesn't last long even after a malosi and you get shredded while the warrior is trying to get aggro.<br />
<br />
Last night in PoN I was the only healer and was sure I was going to die with a 58 warrior as tank and no backup healing. It must have been the no stun ability of the ogre because that fatass got aggro fast and kept it, he was a friggin beast :)<br />
<br />
Generally high level pallies and sks I can slow right away unless they are too low level, warriors it varies a lot. You just have to experiement with the group you have and find the right spot and tell the peeps who are dictating how to play your class to take a hike.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you know it's gona be a tough slow (and you don't have the unresistable defuffs yet) chain cast malosini first, then try to slow after it lands.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thlayli of Xev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Pallys &gt; warriors when it comes to slow aggro.  Pretty sure most good pallys pull with stuns.  <br />
<br />
Once they have stun aggro you're pretty much scott free (unless you're chain dotting :P)<br />
<br />
I always kinda have to feel out warriors when deciding when to slow.  use your instincts :P<br />
<br />
go go shammy power!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">as long as you stand near the mob and not 15 feet away when you slow, i'd say slow almost right off the bat. i wait a little bit just to build up a lil tank agro and hit slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Simondavid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It helps if you know what the MA can do. we have some Rangers, Sk's and Warriors in our guild that i could cast Tugur's while the mob is still inc, and not get aggro....but others I need to wait for a bit. If you aren't sure just go stand right next to the tank that way you dont bounce the mob around and have to listen to the whiney tank. Sometimes if I have gotten a resist or am not sure if I will get aggro...I will root the mob then slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Warscar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Tell the tank to stand right in front of you and tell the puller to bring the mob to the tank. When you slow you will not drag the mob 20 feet away then and it is easy for the tank to taunt the mob off. In PoV there is no waiting to slow. You malo on the way in an then slow. Unslowed mob damage is crazy in tier 2 zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Karadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I agree with the others in this post Sk's/pallys i can slow right off the bat but with warriors its a bit tricker.  <br />
<br />
yesterday in PoV NE I had a lvl 65 warr tanking..I was slowing and got argo almost everytime, I waited as low as 85% and still got argo, also the rogue could get argo at will most of the time this warrior was in the top 2 guilds on my server..Then we got another lvl 65 tank from a lower lvl guild got to the group I had a really hard time getting argo and could cast when mob was at 98% and get no argo..<br />
<br />
My advice play with the mobs a tad to see when you get argo and  when you dont. this should only take 4 mobs or so.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Heigelyac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Slow before the mob even gets to the pull spot, and be standing where the group wants to fight.  Tank a little after slow and cripple and your dots all land, you can take hits, it's ok, they will get aggro off of you eventually.  Don't get below 50% life, you aren't a &quot;real&quot; tank.  Get your kill on, use your horse, melee some, jbb nuke, lay out the DPS.  If it makes the tank happy to let the mob get down to 95%, do it that way.  Whatever works for that tank, each one is different.  For one tank I made a hotkey (it only takes a couple of seconds to make one, or to change it based on the tank)  <br />
/pause 18; /assist Jaboberboo<br />
/cast 5<br />
.  Complain if the cleric is constantly out of mana, otherwise, play it up.  Enjoy the game and don't sweat the small stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>uklugh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">In exp groups i cast malosini as soon as the mobb is in range and if it isnt resisted i follow up with turgurs. This way i avoid getting added aggro from having to cast turgurs multiple times (It rarely get resisted after malosini). The mobb is usually slowed before it attacks the tank.<br />
  If the tank is having problems taking aggro i just torpor myself and let the mobbs hit me for as long as it takes.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Here's what gwain does:<br />
<br />
Cast malosini on inc (or wait til the second the tank engages if it's a really mean mob)<br />
Move to stand beside tank<br />
Cast Turgur's<br />
<br />
Depending on how nasty it is, I'll either then bane and ebolt, or epic and bane, or epic and wait a while, then bane.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Gwain should get malo, so I can go afk.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I should also get malo so my tanks don't come as close to death as they sometimes do in PoV when malosini bounces 3+ times.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Trix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">In xp groups i tend to cast malo as soon as its in range, then move right next to the main assist and slow right away, as long as its slow shamans can take a fair beating (torpor tank if u have it). Standing next to the MA means theres no ping pong effect, and the rougues can get right behind it straight away, until they regain agro.<br />
On raids, it totally depends what u are fighting, just tend to find its more of a personal feeling when to slow, the more times u fight a mob the better feel u get as to when to slow.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Dread</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I use different tactics depending on the situation.<br />
<br />
xp group where mob requires malo:  I move out of the camp towards puller a little.  I hit assist key and spam malo until mob gets in range.  Once malo hits ( while Mob in still inc ) I back up some and get to the spot where we want to kill the mob.  This helps overcome the long casting time of malo + 2.25 sec spell gem refresh.  I slow the mob as soon as the gem comes up, which is usually after the tank takes 1-2 hits and still has &gt;80% health.  Moving towards the puller some basically allows me to cast malo ( and thus slow ) sooner, but requires more attention as I have to know where the puller is.  I use this tactic in places like PoD castle or ledge.<br />
<br />
xp group where malo isn't required:  I slow on inc.  I laugh at the mob if it get pissed at me and just torpor.  I stand beside the MT.  If the mob resists slow and is borderline dangerous ( example PoI entrance group with me as only healer ) I root the mob and back up just a little to get out of melee range and slow again.<br />
<br />
On raids:  We have a set dispelling, debuffing order.  By the time mob has optional dispell, malo, OOS, tash, and optional malosini, I won't get agro by the time I slow.  This works well in places like HoT.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Most times I click epic when mob is in range and then slow after epic lands - kinda like a little timer - seems to work pretty well to keep agro off me.  Do this a lot when I am duoing with my warrior.<br />
