<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Graywolf Longleaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">If you get an AA skill that requires a certain level and then lose that level, do you keep the AA skill? For example, if you get Guardian of the Forest at 61 and then become 60, can you still turn into a wolf? Due to limits on how I can play, 62 is a good level for me right now. I was thinking of getting 63, buying a few AA skills and then going back to 62. This may sound quite stupid to some of you, but RL limits what I can do. I know that you can keep regular skills if you lose a level or two, but I’m not sure about AA skills.<br />

Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xaem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes (for innate skills like planar power etc)...<br />
<br />
No (for activated skills)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Feeldary</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No.<br />
Guardian of the Forest cant be activated after delevelling to 60. btw it tells &quot;need lvl 63&quot; /shrug<br />
<br />
i guess there's a lvl check when u hit the hotkey.<br />
<br />
dunno for passive skills, i guess it is like weapons skills : skill at 250, u keep it when delevel. not sure tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zelgadis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">GOTF is a level 61/63/65 skill, though, Feeldary. O.o<br />
<br />
And I believe they included in a patch long ago (to prevent the delevelling stuff that was going on in PVP servers) that made it so if you delevelled with higher skill than you're supposed to that you'd only have a fraction of that skill... or something to that effect.</div></div><hr />

ooooh thank you, i cannot read english.<br />
/sarcasm off<br />
still, at 60, cant use GOTF. here. i answered to Graywolf's question.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Graywolf Longleaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for your help</div></div><hr />

No. <br />

<br />
I sure can.  Maybe you were refering to the fact that once you activate the ability at 61 it requires 63 for the next advance.  Otherwise I wouldn't have spent any time in correcting you here, because I'm aware of skill and ability loss under the required level of obtainment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Feeldary</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">then i must be bugged, as usual.<br />
i cant use GOTF at 60.<br />
/nerf you! :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Suineko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Feeldary is right. Or was. When I dinged 61 I bought GOTF right away and then delevelled, thinking I could still hunt some nice blues in the old world. When I tried to use GOTF it didn't let me use it, and the message said I needed level 63. I'm level 65 now and not delevelling 4 levels to &quot;reprove&quot; it, but that was my experience too.<br />
<br />
Either it got changed, or you're mistaken and feel is right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Roophus Gunthar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yep, my buddy dinged 61 and got the addition hit with 2h and d-lvled to 60 to aaxp grind some more.  He said it was nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Braslo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Feeldary's point is that at level 60 with GotF, it should say that you require 61 to use GotF-1.  It's eroniously reporting 63 as the requirement.  I guess VI didn't consider people getting level 1 and then falling off the usage scale.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tilolil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">On the De leveling with skill points they did nerf this because of PvP exploits.  There were idiots running around that would level to 50 then de level to 30's so they could kill peps easy.  They added code that would limit skills you retained if you lost a level(s).  If I remember correctly it was 2 levels.  So if you got to 60 and maxed skills you could go back to 58 and have the same skills, but each level drop after that your skill would reduce to the cap of your level + 2.<br />
<br />
Makes sense, I just think It is a sad commentary on how peps will twist the rules to try and prove how Uber they are in PvP.</div></div><hr />
