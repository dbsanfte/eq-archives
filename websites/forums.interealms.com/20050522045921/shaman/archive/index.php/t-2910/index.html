<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heh, after months of scouring Kunark for shaman spells, a copy of torpor finally surfaced in auction ;)<br />
<br />
Bye Bye Trusty Fungi, hello Torpor!<br />
<br />
Finally I feel like a Oracle, Malo and Torpor both scribed ;)<br />
<br />
So after a few hours of messing in FG with guildies getting used to using it, I began to get an itch that chain pulling mutliple shrooms wasn't scratching. <br />
<br />
This was solved with a tell from a guildie Troll friend, (/wave Nuek) 60 shadowknight  &quot;2 Gwurms up, want to try get a group together?&quot;.<br />
<br />
I offhandedly suggested we could try to duo one, after all, I have gate, he has FD, what can go wrong? Whip out the OT hammer, bind at SF zone and I'm at the rage spires within 10mins, stomach beginning to churn a bit. <br />
<br />
We buff up, he pulls, I torpor myself, bang Malo,  bang Turgurs first time, take a round of melee and the SK taunt is on. The next 9-10 mins was a constant juggle  of torporing the SK, Torpor/canning myself, and juggling when to put epic on as well as spot heals. I tossed a few banes into the mix when i judged it to be going in our favor, and reslowed after 5mins to be safe. Didnt use JBB once, was too busy makin mana..<br />
<br />
All I can say is What a rush! I never dropped below 25m/50h all fight, spending most of the time hovering between 45-60m (finished at ~50m). The SK went to 25% health once near the start as I was getting used to the flow of things, most of the time he was getting torpored at 60-65% health. <br />
<br />
We both got a rush out of it, and a 60 mage air pet bleh ;), so we went and did a second Guardian wurm, much smoother, and when a 60 bard/cleric ran up and asked if we needed help, it was great to say, 'nah, we got it thanks)'  . Second wurm dropped banishment and TALISMAN OF SERPENT WOOT!<br />
<br />
Oh well, tonight I got my pudding for once, just had to share ;)</div></div><hr />
