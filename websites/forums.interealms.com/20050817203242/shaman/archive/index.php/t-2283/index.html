<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bazbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone know,or is it the same as the other effect (whatever thats called) not effecting JBB?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I believe no right click items are effected by focus items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My belief at this point is that if you can cast the spell by yourself without the item, you benefit from focus. On extended enhancement at least.<br />
<br />
My black fur boots DO get my shadel bandit ring to sparkle. My pegasus cloak (which casts &quot;levitation&quot;, instead of &quot;levitate&quot;) does not.<br />
<br />
Guild SK says that her shadel ring works on her grim aura right click, and the gather shadows on her circlet of shadows, but doesn't on her jboots.<br />
<br />
I tried using my polished mithril mask with the JBB, but it didn't activate...either the JBB doesn't quality, since the right click is 45 (PMM is only a level 2 focus item), or damage enhancement doesn't work on right clicks.<br />
<br />
I would assume that since we cannot directly cast curse of the spirits, that the epic would be unaffected by any affliction items...but longer affliction (which does the damage of the last tick) would be *really* nice, due to the splurt nature.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Extended Range 3 worked for JBB, so I really really hope you're on to something with the 45 limit of the JBB keeping the PMM from giving extra damage. :)<br />
<br />
Winter's Roar spell with PMM worked.</div></div><hr />
