ie<br />
lvl26-Mammoths in Everfrost, Grouping in Splitpaw....<br />
lvl27-......<br />
<br />
<br />
A lot of work but could be worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Voronwë Nimbrethil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Gorm in OOT is a good plat farming spot.  he drops around 20p per kill and has like an 8 min respawn.<br />
<br />
he is easier than the seafuries there.  not sure what level he is soloable by a ranger with today's equipment.  probably 45?  maybe lower.<br />
<br />
with a healer can def do around 40 i'd say in a duo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Telloran Treehugger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Around level 35 I used farm FS weapons in SolA. Just fight your way from the entrance down to the gnomes andsell the pile of FS weaponry you get.<br />
<br />
After that, fight your way back to the entrance, zone out, and sell all of the FS weapons to the gypsies or Tisiana (sp.) outside.<br />
<br />
Rinse and repeat until you have the desired effect.<br />
<br />
I made 2-300pp an hour plus you can get a lot of cheap twink items from rares.<br />
<br />
Of course back when I used to do this, most of the stuff I got could be sold very easily in EC. I uesd to leave the place with a backpack full of Kobold Hide Boots, which sold for about 1-150pp each at the time. I still see em selling for 40-50pp in the bazaar once in a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Canson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I used to make good money farming bandits in WK. Would kill the female monk looking ones, the brigands, and lowbie monk looking male ones (stay away from the casters unless you want to just free up a spawn).<br />
<br />
They drop Bronze weapons and sashes, and give good faction. The sashes are then turned in in  SOuth Qeynos for more bronze weapons, faction and a little exp.<br />
<br />
I used to make good money like a few hundred plat an evening doing this. Would sell all the dropped stuff to the local merchants in WK and when full of sashes make the Qeynos run. Bought my first Wurmy this way and saved enough to later purchase an FBSS and some other stuff.<br />

<br />
They drop low, mid, high cash, up to 4pp or so, mostly low, but also drop plenty of bronze weapons, ringmail armor and words and runes. The named drop a few decent items as well, one being wt redux bag. I was there the other night tryin to get a bag, the zone was empty, and although I didn't get the bag, had 4 idols drop, kept one other rotted, I came out with a few hundred plat to boot.<br />
<br />
Avocets in SK are decent cash as well, sometimes dropping black pearls. Decent solo exp at 30ish I think. <br />
<br />
Perma is okay too, if you can handle the mobs of gobs hehe. The casters can be nasty at times, but they drop decent cash and items. Same as Sol A I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Habermas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I revisited Crystal Caverns as a 42 Ranger (third time there) and was surprised the orc miners were still blue or light blue for the better part. Foremen drop swords that sell to merchants for about 40pp, and there is always crystalline belts on orc inspectors that I heard can sell for 100pp (haven't tried to sell yet, and it is also LORE). After spending time fear kiting in WL and DSP for no cash, it was good to see about 300pp drop into my bank account in two hours, not to mention the velium I came for in the first place....<br />
<br />
First day there, I was invited to team with a 40 monk on the geonids. I was expecting ka-ching! but gems dropped pretty slowly. Made more money on the orcs. Hmmm.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grimmace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Crystal Caverns.  Besides the velium weapons and nice coin, the orc miners drop various sized pieces of Velium.  The small bricks and blocks are used in the thurgadin gate potion.  These sell in the bazaar for 20-50p on Fennin.  So a pack full of those puppies is a coupla hundred platinum right there.<br />
<br />
Also, the spiders drop Crystalline Silk.  Sells for 10-25p a piece.  Tasty.<br />
<br />
Course, Sebilis &gt; all for effortless plat farming, but you know ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Voronwë Nimbrethil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">PoG is pretty sick pp farming.  but obviously requires a full group.  the xp kind of stinks though.</div></div><hr />

I &quot;loot parsed&quot; one 23 minute session (9 kills) at 95.5 pp/hour, and a 45 minute session (14 kills) at 92.8 pp/hour.</div></div><hr />

I am talking Gem collectors and such!!!!!!!! they drop gems for up to almost 200pp and they give great exp so GEO is the best way to make PP in that little but most dangerious cave!!!!! If you can kill fast and ferious you can make good loot I have every time I camped em and now at lv 51 Nice to go there for a little killa and banka and i dont even need t leave zone woot</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gandorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Runneye is my favorite plat farming spot.  Everything on the lower level can drop up to 4pp + BA armor which sells for 3-5pp with max cha.  Plus you get the chance for BA Coif (100 to vendor) BA Swords (5pp or so to venor)  the grotesque alloy mask (100 or so in bazaar) and the coud de' tat, the BA Medallion.  Best thing about medallion and the mask is they are not lore.  I have never kept track to determine PP per hour but this morning I went down with a bank accout of around 1600PP, 2 hours later I had 2100 pp in the bank and 1 mask and 2 MA Medallions to sell at the bazaar, all in all not a bad AMs work...:D I typically grab a KEI and a port back and forth, bout 70-100pp cost and the first coif I get pays for my expenses, the rest is just pure profit.  Plus you have the luxury of a banker (who you dont have to sneak to deal with) and vendors (who you do) down there..quite a treat!<br />
<br />
Oh, and keep an eye out on track for the moldmaster, drops the haste gloves.  Not much haste but I would imagine they would fetch some PP in the bazaar.  He dropped a Mithril Amulet for me once that sold for 75PP<br />
<br />
I am 47 now and mow thru there like no ones business, only real danger is if you get multiples on ya while the battle wizard is nuking ya.<br />
<br />
Very rarely any folks down there and if there are I just take a run over to SolB and look for a group.  Really quite convenient...<br />
<br />
Now, if you are on Prexus and happen to be down there due to this info, politely step aside when I arrive, hehe.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Ahem, by the way.  There is a door that is locked and unable to be opened down there, you will find it as you move around.  SHOULD something aggro you from the other side of the door, and subsequently open that door, do not go in there for fear of being locked in, hehe.  I was in there for about an hour or so last night until I finally got something to aggro me from outside to open it.  Many thanks to Faelaeny (my favorite Warder on Prexus..=)) who did her best to come rescue me...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Tendoryl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">At 20 I used to solo yard trash in Unrest. Drops grave mold, Zombie skins (sell to aspiring rogues for 1pp each, or to a vendor for 5pp) and Amanita Phalloide (sp?) for 9gp each to a vendor.<br />
<br />
27-32 or so, mammoths in EF. Just find a mage or shammy who will summon you those wr pouches and go nuts. Tusks sell for approx 10pp each to vendors in Halas.<br />
<br />
At level 45-47 I would also suggest camping the mino hero. Getting the faction to do the hero bracer quest is a pain in the arse, but once you do it you can land about 700-800pp in a few hours.<br />
<br />
At level 50, you could probably solo the upper areas in Droga/Nurga. In addition to getting your chardok faction up early, and dropping lots of fs junk, they drop faction quest items that many high level players are willing to pay good money for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Raiyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Ok you are all WRONG (hehe)  The new up and coming area to farm pp is Dawnshroud.  I've made probably 300pp an hour there EASILY, killing tribals for their Acrylia.  Go there at 30 and stay till you are 40.  It's fun, it's great experience and the money is AWESOME.  You can throw some rockhoppers in there at the later levels too for some flawless and excellent hides, and you are looking at another 100-200pp each.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Pfoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I've also found that farming items for players isn't that bad either.  At 39, I went to WL and started hunting Raptors for their hides and foraging Yew Leaves.  Those items are used to make velious armor (tailored) and players go berzerk for them.  I make 20p for each raptor hide and 25p for each yew leaf.  It has made me a rich little level 44 ranger.  Give it a shot, you'll reap from the exp and money all the way to 44.<br />
<br />
A Raptor Hide Stack = 400p<br />
A Yew Leaf Stack = 600p<br />
<br />
1000p for about 1.5 levels (me, from 39 to 40.5)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Stridure, actualy the geonids are one of the worst mobs to camp for cash in CC at all, simply because there are only eight spawn points, and the ones that drop the worthwhile gems are rare.  The only mobs worse than the geos for CC cash are the spiders.  <br />
<br />
The miners, with the tons of velium they can drop, are the best cash in CC, especially with their numbers.  You can run through and kill, over and over, and they're easier than the geonids by far as well.<br />
<br />
When getting cash, the secret isn't really finding some huge plat dropping mob, or some mob that drops something worth a ton of cash; those work but aren't very efficient overall (because the mob might go very stingy with cash, such as the HG's, or might not drop the item/the item might stop being worth the camping).  This is why places such as SolA, and the Paineel skellies are popular; they drop consistant amounts of coin or other vendorized loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Tizzers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">If you don't care about Freeport or High Keep faction... The guards in the keep drop about 5pp each and their weapons sell for about 5pp each.... I made about 500pp in an hour constantly pulling. There is a vendor right in the courtyard that you can sell to, although you will have to start using sneak after he becomes dubious.... which is as low as he'll go. Did I mention I did 35-37in about 2 hours here? I was of course duoing with a level 29 cleric. I can't imagine the exp she got... :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>LEXUS</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Tradeskillers need items to make new stuff<br />

Rockhopper Hides<br />
Flawless - some guy doing the Shawl quest needed these to get skill up to get past trivial - was buying every hide I had for 300pp - nice items i bought myself that week )<br />
Superb - same guy paid 250pp<br />
HQ Hides - ah 15pp per hide<br />
<br />
Spider Silks - currently 5pp per silk and 10pp per swatch on my server - Ek Crag spiders drop up to 8 at a time - can you say Cha Ching?<br />
Spiderling silks - same 5pp per silk<br />
<br />
Leather Padding - needed for a tailor to make FS Armor i believe<br />
go to Stonebrunt for LQ hides and Feerott for spiderling silks<br />

just my 2pp - I destroy cp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>TyliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Siren's Grotto.  Not much there that can't be handled by a ranger and a shaman, and also places there where things are soloable.  Never really noticed how much pp per kill, but always quest gems to be had, and a bunch of jewlery and gems, some of which sell to vendors for close to 200pp. Have never gone there that I didnt come away with several hundred pp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>MadWarper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Im supprised that no ones mentioned the MT Deputies!<br />
<br />
Each deputy drops a spear (+10p) and shield (+1p), plus what ever else they might be carrying.<br />
<br />
The deputies at the 'Wall' can be solo'ed with a Harmony pull from 30 on (maybe lower, i started at 30).<br />
<br />
Blixkin is an annoyance to any one killing deputies, but he stops agro'ing when he turns green.<br />
<br />
Ella Foodcrafter runs by all the time when i kill the deputies, never agro's. <br />
Worried about faction for epic? When i first got there she conned indiff, nomatter how many deputies i killed or band-aids turned in, still indiff.<br />
<br />
Why kill halflings?<br />
Halflings have built their homes at the expense of Misty Thicket, they destroy the trees (you can see the tree stumps from the 'Wall'), the Deputies openly kill bears and wolves (where in SFG we go out of our way to protect them) and more over the Deputies KS newbies all the time (just go here (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?zone=7) , look for 'I hate the Deputies ')<br />
Everytime a halfling dies an angel get their wings :D <br />
<br />
Now with the new PoK book in MT, you dont even have to bother to fix your faction in RV!<br />

Happy huntings :) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>norik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Keep the suggestions coming:D.<br />
To make things as easy as possible on me (I prefer easy:rolleyes:) remember to include Where, What and When.<br />
By that I mean which zone, what Mob and what levels it can be done at.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
PS- and please tell me if you think that something can be done earlier, or requires a couple more levels before it should be tryed, or even shouldn't be on the list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Aethien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Aqua Goblins in Butcherblock, on the coast.  They drop four things that sell for 3-4 plat each, if I remember correctly.  Think I went there when I was 8-9th level, maybe even younger.  Made 30 or 40 plat in a few hours - more than I'd ever seen with a previous character at similar levels. <br />
<br />
I'm killing Mammoths in EF right now at 22 - even /cons aren't that common, unfortunately. I usually do a Mammoth or two to pick up some tusks, then head to Perma for some Goblin killing. I've been pulling in about 15 plat or so an hour this way, I'd say.<br />
<br />
Edit:  I think these are the things that the Goblins drop:  Drdjak's Chipped Stein; a Goblin backbone; vial of Goblin Blood, and  . . . maybe the Goblin head?  There may actually be one other thing, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Filson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I went to North Karana for the purpose of getting materials for a fleeting quiver. I didn't expect it to be so lucrative. Here's what I'm getting at level 45...<br />
<br />
 - Hill Giants drop up to 30+ plat, FS weapons, toes and lambent stones, and exp.<br />
 - Griffons drop up to 5 plat, griffon feather (for Fleeting Quiver) and blood, and exp.<br />
 - Highland Lions drop all manner of cat and lion pelts, including the HQ Lion skin (for FQ).<br />
 - Wandering Lions and Bears drop pelts to sell in the bazaar. I'm getting 1pp for ruined, 2pp for LQ, 5pp for MQ, and 10pp for HQ (but not the hq lion skin, that goes for 100s)<br />
 - EK is close and you can harvest silk fast.<br />
 - Bandits drop a plat and sometimes a sash that can be turned in for a couple more pp and exp.<br />
 - Foraging gets you plains pebbles which sometimes sell.<br />
<br />
With tracking, you can expand your search for griffons and giants to East and West Karana by just zoning over and hitting track. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, as wonderful as this all sounds, the whole Karana hunting area can only support one, maybe two rangers/druids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Eands</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I just finishing a 1 hour long farming session.  Incredible Plat.  They drop 4 items each worth 4+ platinum: Stein, backbone, blood, and goblin head.  The backbone and the blood is stackable, the stein and head are not.  Raked in 156 plat in an hour.   Area is camped alot.  Just have to call camp check and wait turn.  There are 2 camps directly south of the dock area, just follow the coast line.  <br />
<br />
I am lvl 15 and had no problem.  In fact, I would med in between spawns so I could root them.  They tend to flee fairly quickly.  Anyways, I hope you find this helpful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Cottin_Baulz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">FS weapons off of HK guards. all but a couple guards green to me at 48. all &quot;guards&quot; drop FS. &quot;captains&quot; dont.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>MadWarper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">If you are into the pelt/silk farming business, here are a few tips...<br />
I sugest that you start at lvl 30, for SoW reasons (even better at 39, for max track abilities).<br />
EK is where you can spend a ton of time... Carrion and Crag spiders, matrical (many HQ drops) and normal lions. (You might run into some competition for Crags by other classes, but with Track, are they truely fit to be called competition? :p )<br />
Also in the commonlands pumas also have frequent MQ and/or HQ pelts.<br />
The REAL money is in the Bear pelt trade (atleast pre-Bazzar), but since I'm a Ranger from Surefall Glade, I'll have no part in the poaching of bears or wolves.<br />
<br />
With this said, pelt/silk farming can be quite profitable, that is if you can find a market...<br />
The silk price on E.Mar has been steady declining (started at 20p per swatch, now about 9p). Not sure bout the pelt trade, but I wouldnt be supprised if it was declining too.<br />
<br />
I would suggest that you find a fence befor you start farming, this will save you from endless hours in the Bazaar (where just about every one has one more of what you are selling for 1cp less :mad: ).<br />
