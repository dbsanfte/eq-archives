<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Eliyra Darkangel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The following is mostly my writing, but it's also a compilation of ideas from my dear friend, the original Telven, and a few others.<br />
<br />
The Overthere, Kunark...<br />
 <br />
Eliyra remained at the edge of the ravine for what seemed like forever.  She had managed to calm her nerves after a time..but the memories continued to come unbidden to her mind.  They were always there, in the back of her mind, but she had not realized how shallowly they were buried.  So shallow that one look, one glimpse of a soul as black as a moonless night, could bring it all back to her in vivid horrific detail.  She realized at that moment that she had never dealt with it...her helplessness, her pain, her hatred...and most of all, her guilt.  Thus, she had never been able to put it behind her and move on.  She felt helpless again now, as she had no choice but to let the scenes of her past play through her mind as tears streaked her face...<br />
 <br />
Many years ago...<br />
 <br />
The two siblings sat across from each other, deep in conversation.  They came here often, the blood red sky and barren landscape not beautiful in the least, but peaceful, and away from the neighboring Nektulos Forest, where there were eyes hidden in the darkness behind every tree, and ears that heard every word that was whispered.  They came here when they became overwhelmed by their doubts and fears, which lately had been more often than not.   All they had known in their lives was Innoruuk and his teachings.  They knew that Innoruuk was the only way, but something about Innoruuk's teachings made them both uncomfortable.  The path he told his disciples to follow seemed cowardly to them, though no Tier'Dal had ever been accused of having any sense of moral code or honor.  <br />
 <br />
Because of these doubts, when it came time to choose their field of study, they had both shied away from the more grotesque professions that dealt with the undead, and tended toward the tamer arts ...Eliyra with healing and Ventel with enchanting.   Eliyra's twin sister, Valkyra, had been fascinated with the undead since birth, and it surprised no one when she chose necromancy as her life's work.  Their eldest brother Telven, ironically, had also chosen the art of healing.  Eliyra remembered a letter she had received from Telven once when he had learned she had chosen the clerical path, explaining how to use the art of healing to do Innoruuk's work...<br />
<br />
&quot;You heal them.  You put life back in their useless corpses.  You make them believe you are their friend.  You wait for them to divulge their secrets.  Then, the moment their backs are turned, we use this information to eliminate them, in numbers tenfold of the number you have brought back to life.&quot;  <br />
 <br />
Eliyra shuddered as she remembered, and her younger brother put an arm around her in comfort.  Neither of them were sure what they believed anymore, or who they could trust.  All Eliyra knew was that every time she called upon the powers of Innoruuk to protect her, or to allow her to heal others...she felt her stomach knot up.  It did not make her feel powerful... it made her feel cowardly and sick to her stomach.  All they had was each other, and their moments together where they could speak their innermost feelings.  Eliyra loved her sister, but love was a concept Valkyra did not understand.  The closest emotion to love that she felt was the emotion she felt toward her skeletal minions.  But that was not unusual among the Tier'Dal.    She and Ventel were the unusual ones.  Which was why they had to cling to each other, lest they drown in their doubts and fears.  She supposed that abstractly, she loved her brother Telven too.  But he was cut from a different cloth than Valkyra.  She was a sheep, following the rest down the path of hatred.  Eliyra pitied her.  Telven, on the other hand, was pure evil.  Yet...they were both of her own flesh and blood.<br />
 <br />
Eliyra and Ventel made their way back toward the rocky pass that separated Lavastorm Mountains from the forest.  As they entered the pass, they sensed simultaneous movement from all around them.  Before they could react, they were surrounded by Tier'Dal guards, their swords drawn, the glint of the red setting sun on the metal blades bathing their faces in an eerie glow.  Eliyra and Ventel clung to each other, confused and terrified.  The guards parted and two figures stepped towards them.  Eliyra's eyes widened as Telven and Valkyra walked up to stand right in front of them, Telven's eyes smoldering with hatred, the redness of his eyes in the infrared spectrum as the light faded making his gaze even more terrifying.  He looked slowly from one to the other before he spoke.  <br />
 <br />
&quot;Did you think I would not know?&quot;  He waited a moment before going on.  Telven seldom spoke at all, and when he did, his words were chosen carefully.  &quot;Did you think Innoruuk would not know of your blasphemous thoughts? HE KNOWS ALL!&quot;  His voice had raised to a shout for a moment, but he calmed immediately, his face the picture of composure once more. &quot;Perhaps in death when you become Innoruuk's slave, you will understand and appreciate His power.&quot;  He came closer to Eliyra and pulled his mace from his belt.  Her gaze locked with his, and she feared him.  She had seen his soul, and it was black as night.  Or perhaps he had no soul, and what she was seeing was a void.  Like the General that would remind her of this moment years from now.  &quot;Or perhaps, my siblings, you will learn to respect Innoruuk's power sooner than death.&quot;  With that, he clubbed Eliyra alongside the head, knocking her unconscious as one of the guards did the same to her younger brother with the hilt of his sword.  &quot;Put them in the bags,&quot; Telven said coldly, as the guards stuffed their still bodies in large burlap sacks and began to drag them, following Telven, Valkyra, and her skeletal minion.  <br />
<br />
They traveled far, through the dark forest, then westward through the East and West Commonlands.  Nearly a full day had passed since they left the Lavastorm Mountain pass, and it was nearing nightfall again as they entered the Kithicor forest.  Eliyra had regained consciousness once during their travels, but the pain in her head along with the various broken bones she had endured being dragged along the ground for several miles caused her to lapse into unconscious slumber once more.  At the Kithicor border, Telven and Valkyra dismissed the guards and dragged their half-dead siblings to the center of the forest on their own.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get out of the bags, fools!&quot;  Eliyra awoke with a start as a foot connected with her ribcage.  She whimpered in pain but dared not disobey.  Her sister opened the top of the bag and Eliyra blinked...even the fading light hurt her eyes as she untangled herself from the burlap bag and lay unmoving on the ground.  She saw Ventel was in a similar state, broken and bloody on the forest floor near her.  Telven laughed.  &quot;Do you hear that, my darling siblings?&quot;  Although she tried not to, off in the distance Eliyra could hear horrible sounds, sounds of her worst nightmares.  The rattle of bones, the howling of werewolves, ghouls shrieking, moaning of zombies.  Telven smiled at them.  &quot;Welcome to Innoruuk's Playground.  I imagine that fairly shortly, you will never again doubt Innoruuk's power, not that you would be given another opportunity to do so.&quot;  Valkyra's skeleton cackled evilly.  &quot;So long, dear brother and sister.  This is for your own good.&quot;  Telven, Valkyra and Jabober ran off toward safety, leaving their half dead siblings behind.  <br />
<br />
Eliyra lay still, unable to think or reason.  Her brother dragged himself over to her.  &quot;Eliyra, they're getting closer.  We need to get out...now!&quot;  She responded to her brother's voice and heard that, indeed, the nightmare sounds were almost upon them.  They helped each other to their feet and moved as fast as they could in their state, holding each other up.  Each of them had  broken bones, and Ventel was wheezing from several broken ribs.  She glanced behind her and saw a squadron of hideous creatures break through the trees.  She felt Ventel beginning to falter next to her, his breathing ragged, and she urged him onward.  Suddenly the ground before her began to spin, the edges of her vision fuzzy.  Her terror, along with the blow to her head, had just been too much.  The last thing she remembered was hearing Ventel screaming.  Then...darkness.<br />
<br />
Eliyra awoke to the sunlight streaming through the trees, making leaf patterns on the ground.  She was surrounded by the normal forest sounds of bixies and regular wolves.  The horrible creatures of the night before were nowhere to be seen.  And neither was Ventel.  Eliyra felt as though her heart had been ripped from her chest.  Her dear brother, her only friend and confidante....if only she had been stronger, they could have made it out together.  She shuddered as she imagined what fate must have befallen poor Ventel.  And it was all her fault.<br />

Felwithe, Faydwer, present day<br />
<br />
The enchanter was studying his books diligently.  Excelling in his profession was his only pride, his only endeavor in life.  He reached out to turn a page and chuckled as he caught site of his pale skin.  It still startled him sometimes, even after all this time.  He was not comfortable in his own skin, so to speak, and was still adjusting.  But this was the only way he would be accepted here, and he knew that it must be.  He could not go home.  Although, without his sister, it would not have been home anyway.  He thought of her often, about what would have happened had he stayed to help her.  Perhaps they both would have died, although he often thought that fate would be much preferable to the ever present guilt that plagued him.   He wiped a tear from his eye and replayed that moment for the millionth time in his mind...<br />
<br />
<br />
Kithicor Forest, many years ago...<br />
<br />
Ventel screamed as his sister fell to the ground, unconscious.  He turned to face the oncoming slaughter, his breathing labored, his own grip on consciousness tenuous.  He took his staff from his back and bravely tried to fend them off, trying to get them as far from his sister as possible.  But there were too many.  Suddenly the ghoul in front of him fell dead at his feet, a dagger lodged in its back.  Ventel  found him self face to face with a female Tier'Dal rogue.  &quot;Here, drink this now!&quot;  She shouted at him, tossing him a bottle.  Ventel looked at the bottle.  &quot;It's blood of the wolf...it's your only chance to get out of here alive!&quot;  Ventel glanced at his sister.  &quot;But...Eliyra!&quot;   &quot;Save your own skin...she's as good as dead.  Drink NOW!&quot;   One thing went through Ventel's mind at that moment....how could he get revenge if he were dead?  He drank the blood of the wolf, and the rogue grabbed his hand and pulled him along.  They quickly outdistanced the undead horrors despite Ventel's pain, and soon crossed safely into the West Commonlands.  <br />
<br />
Ventel was gasping for breath by that time, and the young rogue looked at him with concern.  She had risked her own life for someone she didn't know, who might die anyway.  She subconsciously questioned her own motives as she laid him down in the grass and began to bind his wounds as best she could.  Ventel blinked as he looked up at her.  Her image shimmered, and before him stood not a Tier'Dal, but a wood elf.  He shook his head, realizing how hard he had been hit in the head with that sword.  She laughed at his puzzled expression, but didn't explain.  Instead she began to tell him how she came upon he and his sister in the woods.  She had been sneaking around the West Commonlands, attempting to &quot;liberate indentured coin from the selfish rich&quot; when she saw an unusual sight.  Dark elves, dragging two large bags through the hills.  They didn't look like bandits, and it aroused her curiosity.  Where they were going, she knew not, but she figured, based on the size, that there must be bodies in those bags.  &quot;I would have hated for any money or clothing to go to waste on a corpse, when there are so many poor hungry children in Norrath,&quot; she stated with an impish grin.  She had moved alongside them, sneaking from tree to tree, shadow to shadow...always just out of sight.  When they arrived in Kithicor and the guards headed back toward Nektulos, she tried to get close enough to hear the conversation taking place between the two elves that were now dragging the bags.  She couldn't hear much, but it was enough to realize this was a family affair.  They finally stopped and she saw the male elf kick one of the bags.  &quot;Get out of the bags, fools!&quot;   She had watched as two young, bloodied dark elves made their way slowly from the bag.  They were alive!  Although you wouldn't have been able to tell by the sight of them.  She silently watched the rest of the exchange and knew then what their intention was.  The others ran off, and she had marveled as the two near dead elves had gotten to their feet and started moving.  <br />
<br />
&quot;The rest is as you remember, elf.  I stabbed one in the back, made you drink, and they chased after us,&quot; she said, tying one last bandage around his chest, trying to secure the broken ribs.  &quot;Bleh...too bad I'm not a cleric.&quot;  A look of pain crossed his face then, and she realized it was not from physical pain.  She looked away from him, pretending not to notice his eyes fill with tears.  He would tell her everything when he was ready, she knew.  <br />
<br />
Over the next several months, the rogue nursed him back to health.  She chuckled when she thought of how uncharacteristic it was for her to care for anyone other than herself.  Ventel had long since told her the entire story, and no matter what she said, he would always hold himself responsible for his sister's death.   <br />
<br />
Ventel never stopped to think that undead were not creatures of thought....after they chased him, they either forgot about his sister, or thought she was dead already as she lay unconscious on the ground.<br />
<br />
As Ventel healed, he and the rogue devised a plan for his future.  He could not go back to Neriak obviously.  The rogue proposed he live in Felwithe as a high elf.  There he could further his studies, along with being safe from his people.   And, although she didn't say it to him, she liked the idea of him living near her hometown of Kelethin.  Ventel liked the idea...not only for the merits the rogue had mentioned, but also because living as a high elf would be as far from Innoruuk as he could get, and be the ultimate act against the God of Hate.  He knew not if he would ever worship another god...he was fairly certain he would not.  Not yet anyway.  Once his body had healed, he practiced his high elf illusion spell night and day until it was perfected.  There could be no mistakes....not one, ever.  He must get revenge one day.<br />

The Overthere, Kunark...present day<br />
<br />
Although the tears streamed down her face, Eliyra felt her spirits rise.  This remembering, as horrible as it had been, had been a sort of spiritual cleansing for her.  Instead of trying to forget, she could mourn now.  She knew the guilt would be with her always, but she felt she could move on.  She often wondered what had happened to her brother Telven.  Eliyra had returned to Neriak after a short time, knowing certainly that Telven would be gone.  He moved from place to place, spreading his evil like a plague, and most certainly had betrayed his followers in Neriak, or simply tired of them.  Thus, Eliyra had returned to Neriak without fear, and sought out her sister.  Valkyra was weak...she was floundering in her studies in the school of Necromancy, and she had no will of her own.  With only a twinge of guilt, Eliyra spoke to her of how her experience in Kithicor had made her come to believe in Innoruuk's almighty power, and she would never doubt again.   Valkyra never doubted her story for a moment.  This was Eliyra's revenge.  She would pretend...now that there were no doubts that her faith did not lie with Innoruuk.  She would learn of them...learn their weaknesses.  She eventually found her home in the Temple of Marr, and she would pass along the information to them.  She remember again Telven's words to her in that letter so long ago...<br />
<br />
&quot;You make them believe you are their friend.  You wait for them to divulge their secrets.  Then, the moment their backs are turned, we use this information to eliminate them....&quot;<br />
<br />
If only he knew how she would live by those words...<br />
<br />
