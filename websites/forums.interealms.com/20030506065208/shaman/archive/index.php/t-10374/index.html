Was curious if anyone carries cheap procing weapons for their pets in case u happen to 'bump into' a named mob and want that extra DPS . if so what do u use . hehe apart from Velium weapons <br />
On my server these items are pretty cheap to buy in bazaar and they are my favoured choice<br />
Scorpikis Claw Impaler (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=3568) <br />
Packmaster's Lash (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=5321) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">SSoY procs a 75DD and can be used by our pet.<br />
<br />
Or ask a mage to summon you the haste mask, the belt and 2 weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nruter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I usually check for primary/ all effects/ less then 40 plat in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
GHL are my favorite, but you can get some other very nice weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sedax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The lariats off of gnolls in SK also my fav<br />
<br />
Sedax<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">hey grobbles )<br />
<br />
luv the new sig!<br />
<br />
GHL are the staple weapon<br />
i also use the fireclaw talons off fireclaw in echo<br />
serated bone dirk good for snaring too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">gnoll hide lariets proc stun<br />
<br />
daggers of dropping proc weaken<br />
<br />
both off of gnolls in SKarana</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>agrad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">A few others weapons I have given to the pet before also include:<br />
<br />
Dragonhorn Ykesha (the ranger only piercer, usually much cheaper than SSoY's ie 30-50pp and they still proc fine)<br />
Tentacle whip from Najeena (i like that lifetap proc, only 25pts but at least the pet is getting some healing )<br />
Drogan obsidian dagger<br />
Obsidian shard<br />
Stilleto of the Bloodclaw<br />
<br />
As far as the mage summoned proccing weapons (Blade of Walnan, Hand of Ixlblat, etc) they have never procced for me with the 55 pet, not sure on the pet level requirement for these to proc.  Do they proc with the 61 pet?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You are right, Agrad. Level 55 pet is to low to proc the mage weapons. Level 61 pet is good enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">tentacle whip  procs lifespike  &gt;&gt; 11 dam<br />
<br />
or is that wrong one?  the one off cc terrors drops same wwhip or different one??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Heck....been seeing GHL starting to sell for 60pp each...looks like someone is noticing that at least Grobbles and I have been buying them every time that they are for sale</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">GHLs on Vazaelle have really shot up recently...  I used to buy them for 20-50pp pretty regularly.  I just looked today, and lowest is 100pp, higest is 750pp.  Good luck to them, 'caus eI sure won't buy them at those prices. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ridik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Stuns procs are good All-Purpose additions, cuz the stun time equals time your pet doesnt take damage, so actually saves him more than the little life taps.  Also, makes a world of difference on casters (especially healers). With Dogdog bashing and stunning, serves pretty decent ghetto snare.  Most stun procs being teh cheapest of the weapons is nice too.<br />
<br />
Dragonhorn Ykesha is great for cheap damage as well as the Bloodclaw stilletto.<br />
<br />
But one of my favorite combos is Dot stacking with dogdog.  Usually Woe(or is it Envy?) anyway the one with Affliction and a Serrated Bone Dirk.  Dog that snares and dots can lead to some great reverse kiting.<br />
<br />
I've given him Ebony Bladed long swords before too for root, when I break multi mob camps.  Using pet to park for you takes a bit more control than most shammys are used to trying but is fun watching him do for you what you usually do for your group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Posatrocible</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I have been doing the same as mentioned above by Nruter and picking up a variety of weapons 50pp and under using the /baz filter for select by slot: Primary, select by type: All effects, Max Price: 50.<br />
<br />
Here's the ones that worked for sure:<br />
<br />
[list=1]<br />
 Fireclaw Talon<br />
 Packmaster's Lash<br />
 Woe<br />
 Dragonhorn Ykesha<br />
 Tentacle Whip<br />
 Stilleto of the Bloodclaw<br />
 Velium 1hs piercing weapons<br />
 Icy Blade<br />
 Dagger of Dropping<br />
 Whip of Strangulation<br />
 Serrated Bone Dirk<br />
 Blade of the Earth Caller<br />
[/list=1] <br />
<br />
It's great watching dogdog proc'ing up a storm.  All were interesting, and some are obviously better in some cases.  One thing though, the SBD (procs Engulfing Darkness snare) was amazing when it comes to solo/duo stuff.  In Seb it was a dream come true... the zone trash in PoN the same.<br />
<br />
Exceptions: Two weapons I have had a problem with so far. <br />
<br />
Burynaibane Spider Fang was NO JOY when it came to proc'ing.  Also, dogdog's dps was noticeably lower, I honestly don't think it was wielding it.<br />
<br />
Obsidian Shard did not appear to work.  I had put the shard in the primary slot and never saw a proc.  The strange thing is that, I had bought a couple of these cheap, so when I was testing another weapon in the Primary slot, I stuck this sucker in the secondary.  Much to my surprise, the obsidian shatter proc began to show up.:confused: Can anyone confirm this?  Anyone get the OS procing from the primary slot?<br />
<br />
So, despite dogdog being a warrior, he can apparently wield other classes weapons without a problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">wakazaki of the frozen skies also works very nicely but can be a bit pricy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Wampaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I just got true spirit and was wondering if weapons effect damage? Or do they just allow your pet to dual wield and to proc some nifty stuff? <br />
<br />
Ive only givin my pet a couple velium weapons so far and they worked so uber! I gave him a velium 1hs and a velium mace and he was procing like mad with FoS.<br />
<br />
But does the damge of the weapon matter? Like is there a difference between a rusty dagger or a wurmslayer?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=6842<br />
<br />
makes him hit for 72 with his mainhand (still 60 for offhand :o)<br />
<br />
Usually pick one up in PoM before I go soloing ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Posatrocible</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Wampaa:   Dogdog's DPS is definitely enhanced by giving it almost any two weapons.  Procs completely aside, when I give the Truespirit two FS weapons (non-procing weaps obviously), its DPS rises from 15-20 (with celerity) to around 30 - 35.<br />
