<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fulgrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Returned to the game. After giving away my high level shaman.<br />
<br />
Restarted... A SHAMAN... hehe... just to much fun...<br />
<br />
Anyway.. .my old guild has done pretty well at setting me up till 50 or so with eqiup... and I have reached level 40 in 4 days played... (Game days.)<br />
<br />
This next part is going to fume a couple but... hmmm I'm lucky...<br />
<br />
I'm a barb.... I have my JBB.... but my question is.....<br />
<br />
Would Sol B be the best spot for me to solo and group? or are there better places....<br />
<br />
I am on Karana. and have all the expansions...<br />
<br />
AC is near 825</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Do what is fun for ya...like you said lots of expansions and new places.<br />
<br />
In the 40's some are going to scarlet desert as opposed to DL since you can actually get items you can use there. <br />
<br />
If you are thinking old world then ya, Sol B and Lguk where the 40-50 dungeons. However many of those places are not that populated anymore. <br />
<br />
I would recomend you try out some of your Server boards and see where the folks hang out now days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Four days, eh?  :)<br />
<br />
Of course, check the hunting grounds (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/forumdisplay.php?s=&amp;forumid=19) forums, but I can let you in on a spot that has been great for me.<br />
<br />
In the Northeast corner of FV there is a giant camp... three giants, on a nice short spawn.  There are tons of wanderers a few levels lower than the giants- just about all warrior types.  I started there around 40 on the wanderers, and started in on the giants when I hit 43 or so.  At 45 (when the bracer starts working) you'll easily be able to hold the entire camp.<br />
<br />
There is a zoneline 30 seconds from the camp, there is a bank/city in the zone, and the giants drop very nice loot (forest loops, lumberjack caps, straw belts, minor gems, tunics that sell to vendors for 60pp, etc.)  Wanderers (frogs and dogs) drop regular stuff, couple plat and the occasional bronze/fine steel weapon.<br />
<br />
Experience is outstanding here- I'd go hunt in Guk, Karnors, Maidens, whatever... but I always kept coming back.  Went from 42 to 49 in under four days played (and much of that was not grinding- I went in a couple guild events, did some trading, made a trek to Halas to buy spells and give stuff to newbies...) - most of it here.  Also made a few thousand plat along the way- nice!  Heck, even though the giants are mostly light blue now (at 49), I'm tempted to stay a little longer... I'll bet I'd still get a yellow bar every hour and a half or so.<br />
<br />
Oh crap- you're on Karana!  Uh, ignore everything I said above... until I decide to leave... hehe (just kidding, think I'm heading to Burning Woods to do hornets next.)  :)<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">City of Mist until 45, then bloodgills or stay in CoM till 50.  Haven't spent much tim in luclin zones at this point, and velious mobs are too high in hp / cr, so I'd reckon those are still the best spots, especially w/ a jbb.</div></div><hr />
