<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've done some searches and read a that a lot of people are happy with critcal affliction.<br />
<br />
My question is, is it worth it to buy the first level knowing it'll be a long long time before being able to get the rest?<br />
<br />
Currently I'm at a toss up between training crit affliction 1 or SCF3. In ldon's I usually bane then toss maybe one nuke in. Places like Valor and Solro I usually do bane/blood/athema and tank the mob. My family group isn't exactly high dps (for some reason most of us like healer classes) so I'm trying to do what I can in that department. <br />
<br />
Also does critical affliction work like SCF where each level increases the damage as well as the frequency or is the crit always the same damage and only the percentage goes up?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hail,<br />

Personally I wouldn't work on Critical Affliction for a long time yet, you have other stuff that I think would suit you better.  Level 1 fired (from memory) very infrequently.  Maybe one or two ticks would crit on a Tactics mob when soloing with CritAff1.  The percentage of a crit increases dramatically with CritAffliction3.  If you aren't getting the other levels soon, I would wait if I were you.<br />
<br />
If you are still tanking quite a bit, finish CS&amp;ID.<br />
Also, you are losing out on potential free mana and hitpoints any time you have Boar &amp; KEI (or better) on because your stats are capped at 280.  A few levels of Planar Power would give you immediate (though small) boosts in total hp/mana when grouped.  I'm also a big fan of Suspend Minion2, but if you don't solo or raid much, it might not matter to you.<br />
<br />
There are still lots of good AA's for you to work on before picking Critical Affliction in my opinion.  But at this stage there are no real clear 'must have AA's' the way the first hundred went, as playstyle and opinion can vary substantially.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I got crits 1 for eye candy. probably will get pet affinity before Crit Affliction 2/3. Definitely max all but GoD nukes out first, even resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks, I figured as much, but thought I'd ask anyways.<br />
<br />
I did buy SCF1 a long time ago with my cleric just for the occasional crit, but that was only 2 points so wasn't really a big deal. The 5 I can definately find better uses for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I got crit affliction 1 because I didn't really have anything else to spend my points on at the time. It seemed to crit every so often (like they said before, maybe once or twice a mob while soloing) but wasn't a huge difference. I finally got lvl 2 and I didn't notice a change at all. Xping I can go for 3 or 4 mobs without a single tick, but then again maybe its just rng being stupid. I'm going to try and finish up level 3 tomorrow and will see if it makes a big difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hail,<br />

It can. :D   You may still go a DoT or two without a crit at level 3, but if you cast 3, you will generally see at least one DoT crit tick in my experience, and often many more than that.  It will often fire enough when soloing that I can actually forgo my usual last DoT cast about every third mob, saving me a few hundred mana on that mob and at least a thousand or so (haven't calculated it) mana per hour.  Small potatoes when you are raiding but when soloing non-stop for drops/exp it adds up.   :cool: <br />
<br />
I've noticed more mobs tend to follow me (instead of stay with the MA) when I run off to pull in LDoN's now, and that's ONLY using Bane for DoT's. :p   When Bane crits twice from a single cast, you can forget about dumping aggro unless your MA is really amazing. ;)  I'm very leery of DoT'ing now on raids because an early crit tick usually equals death (or a big waste of cleric mana to save me), so I'm glad I also have FoMM to make my nukes have a little more punch. ;) <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Clawmarks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I got level one CA1 and was actually impressed with how often it does go off..its FREE damage people and let alone damn cheap at that to purchase. I would actually be afraid to have CA3 and attempt to lay on a couple dots on raids or in a group where agro control is needed...hard ldon's, GOD trials..ect. <br />
<br />
On my necro I got all 3 levels and its huge when you pop on 4 dots on boss encounters, FD, and watch the critical tics go that are focused at 30 percent more dmg on top of it.<br />

<br />
Thanks, right now I've got 25% benifical haste + 10% from QB1 (I think 10% correct) + 10% from cleric spell haste so hasn't been too much of a prioity to me since I'm already at 45% almost all the time. It definately is nice to have faster Q though and something I highly recommend to anyone that doesn't have a good spell haste item. <br />
<br />
There are definately a lot of AA's I want to get, but it takes me quite a while to get them because while I'm flagged for EP's no one in my family is so I only get to exp in lower zones. Maybe 2 hrs AA in valor/tactics or 4 hours doing ldons sadly. My biggest issue is dps atm so we can at least exp faster off of crappy exp mobs or finish ldons faster to gear up our tank and be able to do some better exp stuff like ldon hard.</div></div><hr />

Pet affinity is nice too. Nothing like having fully buffed up pet for free. I havent done CA3 yet but CA2 is ok. In the end it depends on how you play. I 6box and my tank has DBoTW so it take all 3 dots and some crit to pull aggro and only if I start at 98% so CA3 would be great. But like someone else said you dont want to pull off aggro as you pass through to pull more (least thats what I do). I suspect that in hard ldons CA3 would be big help for me cause my warrior can support the aggro to benefit and it would help with the 10K hp bigger mobs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>haruuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">i have ca1 at the moment, and like someone else said, i got it for eye candy, basically. at the moment, however--despite my total of only 75aa atm, i am starting to view it a little differently, and may go for 3 soon. i'm just realizing more and more that certain ideas i've had about how i was going to progress through aa aren't all that important. example--why get quick buff 3 before crit affliction 3? sure, makes things less obnoxious when you're maintaining buffs in groups or raids, but it's not imperative, and a 3 second cast time on a heal over time is kind of contradictory--why spend time cutting down the cast on a heal that takes time to do its work, anyways? crit nukes? name something that doesn't resist cold (slight exaggeration. slight.), and i'd rather cast BoS and forget on a mob that i can use poisons against than poison nukes.<br />
<br />
bottom line--once i get nd3, i'm going to have to sit down and look at getting critical affliction 3 sooner than i thought. maybe after rc3, or the healing gift line. definitely before nuke crit aa's, and probably even before combat agility and LR5 (i use dots a lot more often than i take melee dmg...a LOT more). <br />
<br />
<br />
i love having options :)<br />
<br />
for that matter, i love the entire aa system. yeeeehaaawwww</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">definitely before nuke crit aa's, and probably even before combat agility and LR5 (i use dots a lot more often than i take melee dmg...a LOT more).  <br />
<br />
Kinda getting sidetracked here, but if you raid at all, LR5 is a must. Its by far one of the best aa's we get for the raiding shaman imo. Nothing like slowing Quarm and getting aggro, then getting missed 2 out of 4 hits and living, instead of getting one rounded. However, if you are a soloing shaman then maybe Crit Affliction would help you more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The main reason I want a 3 second Queiscence is to lower the chances of interrupts and make sure Q lands soon enough to save my, or someone else's, life. Sure, when you just have it going on the MT as a matter of routine, extra 3 seconds won't make a big difference, but when it's your party's main healing tool, it's a whole different story. I just don't have enough mana to keep everybody alive with Tnarg when I am the MH and there are 5 mobs in camp, which does happen now and then.<br />
<br />
crit nukes? name something that doesn't resist cold (slight exaggeration. slight.), and i'd rather cast BoS and forget on a mob that i can use poisons against than poison nukes.<br />
<br />
Like many things in EQ, cold vs. poison is situational. We were doing The Shade in PoN over the weekend, and he resisted all of my Disease and Poison based DoTs, but cold nukes landed for full all 17 times. Would have nuked more except for the fact that I was healing the rampage tank, who just happened to be our Mage :)<br />
<br />
i love having options :)<br />
<br />
Couldn't agree more!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Couldn't agree more here. I grinded out CA3/LR5 before I was even at 100 aa's and I don't regret that one bit. Without it I don't think I'd be able to tank solro trash with my crappy 6k fully buffed hp and two healers. <br />

<br />
I think thats most of it. I was going to start working on my healing aa's, but thats really not much of an issue to me with all the healing I've got lying around. The only heal I uses 99% of the time with Hobbez is Q. I would probably do CS/ID before doing full levels of critical afliction.</div></div><hr />

        Like LR5 improve mitigation at best by 5% you'll still be one rounded  :rolleyes: .</div></div><hr />

<br />
Better then 0%, and just because it may only be 5% it doesn't mean you ONLY miss 5% of all hits. I have been missed on red cons 7/10 times. It helps alot. :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Anyway, got Crit Affliction 3 tonight and I did notice a difference. Its still not as high as I think it should be for the ammount of aa it costs, but I would say I averaged 1 crit every 8-10 ticks, which isn't bad. When I stacked 2 or 3 dots it seemed that it got alot better, but that could just be to double dots. Just some additional input  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Well I went ahead and trained crit affliction 1 just for the fun factor and eye candy as a lot of people put it. Definately not the most effecient use of my points, but I thought it would be a nice change at least. Then I went through two whole adventures without seeing a single crit, I got more nuke crits on level one then that. <br />
<br />
So much for wanting to have a little fun in eq lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">You might want to pick up: http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=24884<br />
<br />
It costs 1450 in BB, and I think it is well worth it for extending dots.<br />
<br />
Seeing that you have LDON gear with Type 3 slots, you might want to go for: http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=25737<br />
<br />
It costs 1150 from East Commonlands.  This focus effect will add 20% damage to determental spells ( dots )<br />
<br />
These can vastly improve your damage without costing you AA.  GoD AAs are expensive ( to get Crit Dots 3, you will need to spend 30AAs ( 5, 10, 15 ) ), and for you, I can see that better used in enhancing other areas such as CS, ID, Healing.<br />
<br />
I worked on Adept first for Healing.  I did this because it gave me an immediate return on my AA investment rather than Gift which is crit based.<br />
<br />
I worked on PP later in my AA chain, and I am currently working on Enlightenment Line.<br />
<br />
The only GoD AA I would recommend is SCS for you at this time, and to be honest, I do not see a huge return on that AA - Nihils is an aggro magnet as well as our dots still.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Like LR5 improve mitigation at best by 5% you'll still be one rounded  :rolleyes: .<br />
<br />
You can increase that if you are in a Time / GoD guild.  <br />
<br />
Time Drops<br />
-----------------<br />
Cloak of Falling/Fallen Skies adds +10 Avoidance.  Drops off of Tallon<br />
Leggings of Furious Might adds +10 Avoidance.  Drops off of Bert<br />
Ring of Evasion adds +10 Avoidance.  Drops off of Saryrn<br />
<br />
I haven't seen any +Avoidance items yet in GoD, so I cannot comment on those.  I did recall seeing one as I was making a wish list :P<br />
<br />
With those three time items alone, you can increase your avoidance by +30.<br />
<br />
But, yes, you can still get one rounded.  :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>haruuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">ok--a 3 second Q sticks fast enough to save your life or someone elses? so...getting that first 420 point tick 3 seconds earlier is a life saver? 840 hps in 2 ticks...1260 in 3. still not up to tnarg's base yet, and now we've had 3 ticks go off already. Q isn't an emergency heal. it's a cheap maintenance heal, or a good tool to use to create the effect of mitigating. <br />
<br />
as for LR5 being a must for raid shammies--i'm not in Time yet. at the stage i'm at, i'm working on PoP progression, and leading raids to get others backflagged on a lot of the early PoP mobs. ie...Grummus, AD, TT, MB, etc. i know the level of danger is nowhere near what it is in Time, and that the mobs don't hit for nearly as much, but for what i'm doing, LR5 is far from necessary. <br />
<br />
i do plan on getting LR5 done before too much longer, but at the point i'm at, critical affliction 2 and 3 may well be the better buys for my points.<br />
<br />
<br />
of course--there's also the progression factor. if i opt to go with radiant cure or max my healing aa's before Critical Affliction--which is likely--i will probably go with LR5 before Crit Aff. <br />
<br />
<br />
once again, it's great to have options :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I would max LR and ID first before I do CAf3 because of the aggro that you will be getting from dotting.  I have the BA4 aug and Extended Torment4 aug which work great with CAf3.  As Korelen says, it's a huge aggro magnet, and you need a way to either reduce the aggro, or to have some damage avoidance/mitigation to stay alive.<br />
<br />
Personally, I did my healing AA after my CAf3 and advanced spirit call AAs.  I still don't have the critical heals.  I think I'll get pet affinity and SCS, then probably the pocket pet AAs before I get the critical heals.<br />

<br />
I found LR5 a HUGE value when I was still a little bear cub playing in BoT.  If a slow was resisted, I was pretty much dead.  A guildie recommended to be to work on LR5, and I saw an improvement in my survivability if slows were resisted in BoT.  It was a good move for me, and I think it was a wise investment.<br />
<br />
CAf3 will give you more unwanted aggro ( even if you have SCS3 ), and if you are not equipped to deal with that aggro, then I would hold off on it.  BUT, that is my opinion.  You can get CA3, LR5 ( 27AA Total ) vs CAf3( 30AA ).<br />
<br />
Radiant Cure is a must.  I use it all the time, and it will help you on encounters such as Grummus.<br />
<br />
I completed CA3 / LR5 first, and then I worked on my healing AAs.  I completed the Adept Line first, and then I worked on Gift.  Once I finished my healing, I worked of CS3 / ID 5.</div></div><hr />

CA and LR do not improve mitigation, they improve avoidance. CS and ID improve mitigation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">One thing i almost saw hit on, but I was wondering...does CA go from base dmg for the crit OR if you have BA4 which increases what your dot does EVERY tick...will it mean HIGHER crits if you get CA?  Just for numbers, say a dot does 100hp a tick, with BA say it does 125 base....will the crit come from the base 100 from the dot, or the 125 it does base with the BA?<br />
<br />
Also, I just finished LR5 my self last night, was thinking about getting CA3 (If I really put my nose to the grinding stone I could do it in a cpl of weeks fo solid grinding), is CA3 worth it if you go all the way?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">ok--a 3 second Q sticks fast enough to save your life or someone elses?<br />
<br />
Whether it will save someone's life depends on where you are hunting. For example, a 65 BST and I were in Droga over the weekend to camp 31% haste and gain some levels for our friends, an ex-65-Wizard-turned-46 Ranger (made 47 there), 57 Enchanter (made 58) and 61 Cleric (made 62). Droga is good for PLing your friends :)<br />
<br />
Once the Cleric left, I was the main healer and, of course, the main slower. At one point the BST decided to pull  :rolleyes: and we ended up with 5 mobs in camp, some unmezzable, including a level 60 wanderer just to make things interesting. It was a bit hectic since our lower level friends could buy it so easily, but Q kept everybody up through the fight. And, unlike Tnarg, it had almost no agro associated with it. I may have been able to get by with Tnarg, but it would have been harder on the mana pool and the extra agro would have meant more time spent root parking and less time spent slowing and healing.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, it is certainly true that faster Q is unlikely to save anybody's life past LDON or Tier1 PoP when mobs start hitting for more than Q can heal. But it will still buy you 3 seconds, which means more time for Canni = more mana :)</div></div><hr />

Apparently this guy is meant to hit for a max of 2200 or more ....  and its not a one off, have been screenshotting and parsing alot of this sort of stuff since I have been working my defensive abilities and stats ....<br />
<br />
After a heap of parses and experimentation, my general rule of thumb is +10AC ~ +60HPs over 1500AC ....  <br />
