<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">where would this rate on a list of BP's for shaman. once the effect is clicked its a 10 wisdom and 53 AC BP.<br />
<br />
thats not bad at all , it dropped off trak and i got it last week , ive been trying to get prices on it (soley to measure its worth), i hear about 20-40k on morrle thulle. that sound about right ?<br />
<br />
Again, not selling it , just wondering how it measures up ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Never had one yet but it goes for 35k on zebux and is pretty steady at that price point.  Seen several or the same one several times at that price.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">wow .<br />
<br />
/wears with pride<br />
<br />
thnx , thats all i wanted to know</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just sold mine for 23k and an Emerald Dragonscale Tunic. I used it for a bit, but the 23k helped me more and still need to sell the tunic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>celebel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">can someone tell if the bramblecoat stacks with all shaman buffs (SoS, HoS, ...)?<br />
<br />
How do you rate this bp?<br />
<br />
Jaundiced bone breastplate,<br />
thurgadin<br />
ToV<br />
Vindi<br />
<br />
is there any other BP interesting for a shaman that is more or less in that range? (I mean, don t tell about VT bp or NTov...yes, it s nice but unreachable for a lot of us).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bankster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Had A Jaundiced Bone BP from level 53 till a week ago, never in all that time did see a single thing that the bramblecoat will not stack with, shaman or otherwise.  <br />
Lame effect for what was at the time of its release &quot;THE&quot; uber BP, but can't deny that the extra 18 AC is nice. Lasts an insanely long time too. Even after I upgraded, and before I sold it I still swapped in the JB to cast bramblecoat :) <br />
<br />
In regards to the list I would say from best worst<br />
<br />
Vindi(best pre-Luclin shaman BP IMHO)<br />
ToV (skyshrine and Kael probably in that order)<br />
JBBP<br />
Thurgardin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i love it so far , the only thing i wish was it was a 9point damge shield that stacked with our DS potion  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Patito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I just picked one up for 22k. They've been going for around 25-30k on Stormhammer. I'm wearing it now instead of my fungi, trying to see if I really need the fungi any longer now that I have torpor. I could really use the money I'd get from selling the fungi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've had mine forever and never actually wore it as my bp.   First I wore a fungi to 60, then I got a Vindi.  I just put the JB BP on, click the buff and then bag it.  To me, the main value is that it's 18 extra AC that doesn't take up an armor slot.  It is always helpful, no matter which bp you're actually wearing.<br />
<br />
It was absolutely beautiful with the old models though, shiny gold Wonder Woman bp...</div></div><hr />

I've been pondering this too.<br />
Lately been looking at the not-no drop dragonhide bps from Klandicar:<br />
<br />
Worked Dragonhide Breastplate: Wt 5.50. +30 AC, +3 Str, +3 Sta, +3 Agi, +3 Dex, +3 Wis, +3 Int, +3 Cha, +3 vsMg, +3 vsFire, +3 vsCold, +3 vsPos, +3 vsDis, +50 HP, +50 Mana<br />
<br />
Reinforced Dragonhide Breastplate: Wt 5.50. +32 AC, +4 Str, +4 Sta, +4 Agi, +4 Dex, +4 Wis, +4 Int, +4 Cha, +4 vsMg, +4 vsFire, +4 vsCold, +4 vsPos, +4 vsDis, +60 HP, +60 Mana<br />
<br />
Heavy Dragonhide Breastplate: Wt 5.50. +32 AC, +5 Str, +5 Sta, +5 Agi, +5 Dex, +5 Wis, +5 Int, +5 Cha, +5 vsMg, +5 vsFire, +5 vsCold, +5 vsPos, +5 vsDis, +70 HP, +70 Mana<br />
<br />
(I assume the peerless goes here...)<br />
<br />
Matchless Dragonhide Breastplate: Wt 5.50. +35 AC, +7 Str, +7 Sta, +7 Agi, +7 Dex, +7 Wis, +7 Int, +7 Cha, +7 vsMg, +7 vsFire, +7 vsCold, +7 vsPos, +7 vsDis, +90 HP, +90 Mana<br />
<br />
Compared to:<br />
Rune Crafter's Breastplate: Wt 9.00. +37 AC, +3 Str, +6 Sta, +3 Agi, +3 Dex, +14 Wis, +30 HP, +80 Mana Effect of Riotous Health.<br />
<br />
Wolf Caller's Breastplate: Wt 9.00. +43 AC, +6 Str, +6 Sta, +6 Agi, +6 Dex, +15 Wis, +4 vsMg, +4 vsFire, +4 vsCold, +4 vsPos, +4 vsDis, +45 HP, +90 Mana Effect of Riotous Health.<br />
<br />
Chestplate of Vindication: Wt 25.00. +45 AC, +15 Sta, +15 vsMg, +15 vsFire, +15 vsCold, +15 vsPos, +15 vsDis, +100 HP Effect of Aura of Battle.<br />
<br />
Or even the Rumblecrush BP:<br />
Wicked Mail: Wt 4.50. +36 AC, +15 Str, +15 Sta, +15 Wis, +10 vsMg, +10 vsFire, +10 vsCold, +10 vsPos, +10 vsDis, +75 HP, +75 Mana<br />
<br />
The big problem with the Dragon BPs is the loud red color. But the HPs and the resists aren't so bad in comparison.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Bramblecoat (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=517&amp;source=Live) 18 AC, damage shield 3, 3 hour duration.<br />
<br />
Compared to:<br />
Spirit Weaver's Breastplate: Wt 9.00. +37 AC, +6 Str, +3 Sta, +3 Agi, +3 Dex, +14 Wis, +50 HP, +60 Mana Effect of Riotous Health.<br />
(2 of those dropped yesterday in Plane of Growth SE corner off wisp things, along with some greaves. In a pick-up group, no less.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Could those mobs/that area be done by a monk/shaman (60) duo?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mosheaehsom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I've never tried the wisps, but I've done a fair bit of soloing in PoG.<br />
<br />
I believe the wisps are fairly resistant, so malo/sini before slow, and I'm pretty sure they're casters of some sort.<br />
<br />
I'd imagine a monk/shaman duo could take em, I know i've done them with a mage/shaman combo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Great, thanks for the info. Spent two years in KD and never did see a chain BP drop.<br />
<br />
Might run up there and see if i can get lucky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>KrintixXaneris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The big problem with the Dragon BPs is the loud red color<br />
What?  All dragon armor from WW is dark green on every race/class.</div></div><hr />
