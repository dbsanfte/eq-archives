<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cazec</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Which would be better exp for a 54 Shammy? My gear is ok but not the greatest. <br />
<br />
The hole is easier to get to etc.<br />
While CoM is sorta hard to get to.<br />
I heard CoM drops out at about 53 or so , so is my best bet the hole?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The Hole is a great place, but the areas you could solo are often camped.  The experience modifier is excellent, the mobs aren't too tough, and it is well-located for people with PoP.<br />
<br />
At 54, if the front 6 mobs were split, I'm sure you could keep them all clear, and be able to grab more if you have time.  The splitting is the tough part, not sure when they single-pull but I think it's around level 55... worth a try.  You can always root-park to split, or hell, slow-tank them to split.  They're not particularly difficult mobs by any means until you get to the golems and such, which can summon.<br />
<br />
Haven't tried CoM, but from what I've read it will start to go light blue on ya about now... unless you go in deeper.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hole sort of dies off once you ding 54. As does CoM. I personally did a mix of katta guard soloing in the bank area and grouping pop at that level. Went through 54 in 4 days, 55 in 3, and 56 in 4. Just alternating back and forth. Although 56 was almost exclusively pop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>dirtybax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I can solo pull entrance mobs in the Hole with a 52 Shaman.  I stand on the light post to get the first one and pull with Turgur's.  I have been duoing there with my 51 Rogue.  Good Experience, but you really need to be able to get all the mobs before the drop off to make it worthwhile.  Otherwise respawn is too long imo.  Oh and some Eles are LB at 52.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>qhor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">if you've never been to the City of Mist, go there.<br />
seriously, it's a cool zone - kind of a dungeon feel, but you can sow/use<br />
horse there.  i like the feel of it, usually pretty quiet save for the<br />
occasional reaver or rak raid.  relaxing.  pathing is (or was, may have<br />
changed since the 4.8.03 patch) so bad that even if you start a train<br />
of half the zone (which i have) you can easily outrun it.<br />
<br />
most of the spawns around the entrance, bridge, stables, temple<br />
<br />
--&gt; http://www.eqatlas.com/kunark/cityofmistmap.html &lt;--<br />
<br />
will be light blue to green. however, the goos in the &quot;goo house&quot;<br />
(#3 on EQatlas map) and the two houses to the north- and south-west<br />
of that house should still be dark blue.  if not, the spawns in the two<br />
gazebos and at the bridge near the locked door to Rak (#1 on map)<br />
will be. many still are to me at 55.<br />
<br />
another obvious perk of CoM is that a lot of the shaman epic takes<br />
place there, from the papers that drop off of random ghosts/skellies/goos<br />
to Lord Ghiosk to Neh and Rak Ashiir.  it's good to familiarize yourself<br />
with the zone, also might as well kill 2 birds with one stone and farm<br />
some epic pages while you still get experience (if you haven't already).<br />
<br />
<br />
just my opinion though.  i wasn't too impressed with the Hole exp..<br />
if you want to do boring experience grinding, do it in PoP (grouped) or<br />
HighKeep (bards/nobles solo). CoM is a bit more interesting, especially<br />
your first few exploratory trips there.<br />
<br />
just a note, pet pathing is (or was, patch again?) very poor.  it's best to<br />
park pet at entrance, go wherever it is you're going, and summon him<br />
there.<br />
<br />
have fun whatever you choose.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">CoM can still be really nice exp.<br />
<br />
For Goo killing without clearing the whole damn city Make a pet at the zone-in and park him. Dive into the water at the entrance and swim all the way to <br />
the end of the tunnel on the left.<br />
<br />
You pop up INSIDE the goo house.  Swim around to the far side of the small 'island'  to jump up onto it.  Once you're up on top you'll have to root/slow the goo in the middle..then hop across to the door, let yourself out, and go set up camp out on the path outside the door (don't forget to summon doggy!).  Once root breaks your goo will take a bit of time to cross the water and come get you..since goos have a notorious problem hopping without any legs..<br />
<br />
Kill goo as you normally would.  Having an already buffed pet should make this trivial.   While I typically encourage melee'ing..these really lend themselves to root/rot/doggie killing for some reason.<br />
<br />
The advantage to camping outside is not only can you pull the goos inside the house, but by 54 you should be able to single pull the higher-level goos from above you on the path when they patrol to the lower area.  If you get an add, there is plenty of room to split them in the generously sized courtyard there.<br />
<br />
If you're feeling adventurous you can run over to the ramps down to the gazebo area.   The gazebo mobs should all be blue to you, along with most of the mobs along the way.  Keep an eye out for the Army Behemoth for ochre clay for your lower level shaman friends.  There are also some good random drops, and pieces for Epic here which made it my favorite spot at these levels.<br />
<br />
Overall I spent hours here solo.  Cash wasn't half bad, and the ability to go eat, talk to RL people, answer the phone, and basically relax was a welcome change.  I kinda miss it.<br />
<br />
Oh..and did I mention that in case of emergency the entrance is only a short run away, and that SoW works here? :O)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>starlite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Kunark has real atmosphere....partly due to a well thought out history; all the dungeons have a whole chunk of history attached to em, and this interweaves nicely with the epic storyline.<br />
<br />
yeah i am a big fan of com......its got huge nostalgia factor...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>pibs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well I'm betwixt and between at 52.   Tried the Hole.  Was really disappointed to find half the elementals lite blue.  Add to that the wandering revenant problem, and, well, forget the Hole.<br />
<br />
I tried CoM too.  All the entry mobs were lite blue and the rest of CoM camped.  Bumber.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking the following:<br />
<br />
Bandits in JP<br />
Back to Echo yet one more time for TM and the slaves  :(<br />
Dulak ships<br />
<br />
Think I'll try bandits and the ships, though I hear ships are not good experience and bandits in JP now have a pathing problem.<br />
<br />
Ahh these between levels.    :(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>starlite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">erm ur gonna give up on a spot cos u went ther once and it was camped ???  i assume u mean that at peak time it may be camped alot?  and the other spots wont be ??? <br />
 have to say i have never met anyone camping goos or gazebo for exp.  Stables yes, temple yes reavers yes, but not mid section.<br />
<br />
i have a lvl 30 druid alt i use to do recon on camp spots- bound in HHK most of the time, zooms around from there.<br />
<br />
if u can exp offpeak  53 to 54 is HHK all the way.  harder at 52 to split the nobles, but at 53+ they are single pull s.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>tunes77</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Camped the drop off spot in the hole with a chanter partner.  Everything was blue and we killed reasonably fast but it wasn't the best exp at 55.  Soloing the entry is easy enough but again the xp wasn't great.  They started going lt blue more often than not.  Also with the recent pathing changes, 2 revenants path down the entry corridor, making it a lot tougher spot.  They can be nasty little buggers with their necro spells.</div></div><hr />
