<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kittyshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sorry for the dumb question.  I haven't ever used magelo and I was wondering if it is completely safe to use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thyrm Jarlson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you manually create and update your character of Magelo, then it I'd say it's 100% safe. I paid for the premium service and use auto update that synchronizes the character info and to tell the truth, I never thought about how safe my login info is...but haven't had a problem in the 6 months I've been using it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd say the people who run Magelo are trustworthy folks but its still good practice to never use the same username and password as your EQ account on any EQ related service, never sign up to anything with the same password as your email also, specially when you have to give your email address in the sign up process.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kittyshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i went into magelo and manually added my gear.  I was really asking about the exe file that they have that looks at your char while you are playing it and pulls all of the info on its own by reading the memory locations that eq uses in your computer.<br />
<br />
thanks for the responses.  <br />
<br />
I think I will just stick with the manual method of updating my gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you're using IE, go to the Tools/Internet Options menu.<br />
<br />
Click on the &quot;Advanced&quot; tab.<br />
<br />
Scroll down and make sure &quot;Use HTTP 1.1&quot; is checked.<br />
<br />
That should fix it.<br />
<br />
If you're not using IE, then I'm not sure.</div></div><hr />
