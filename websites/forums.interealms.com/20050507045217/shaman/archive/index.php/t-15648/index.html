<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kahna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've done some searching around, but I can't seem to find anything helpful about how we could most effectively use our pets.. I know most shammies toss weapons and all kinds of stuff on them, on top of buffs of course, and I was wondering how to go about it. Like what kind of weaps our dogs can or can't use, other items, what this &quot;alpha dog&quot; term means I've seen a lot on these boards but never in game, and anything else that could be helful. Any links or tips would really be appreciated. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Silverpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My pet is nothing but a DoT to me.  Also can take some aggro up front on adds, but is worthless in PoP for tank mezzing.  My stratagy in groups: malo, slow, pet, dot, canni, canni, canni.<br />
<br />
Best use I have found for my pet is farming greens.  I can take 2 down at a time that way.  But our pets are not meant to be like a BL pet, ever.  They are a DoT that never fades as long as you dont let him die.  I do haste him (our pet spirit haste is only 50 mana), even slap an HoS on him once in awhile if I have mana to burn.<br />
<br />
One other use is aggro kiting.  Since we dont have any snares, aggro kiting sucks for the most part.  Necro/Shaman combo aggro kite is the best duo team for shamans that I have found.  Level 61 Shaman and level 61 Necro (necro has a 60 warrior pet at 61) can hold most open kite areas in T1, T2.  Besides, he can rez and summon in non-PoP zones, and I can buff him with all his favorite spells.<br />
<br />
These are just my opinions.  I may be wrong, but thats the fun of EQ.  Do what works, and learn from your mistakes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Silverpaws is correct, overall, in how shaman pets should be thought of. At certain levels, they CAN tank (40's and 50's), but in general, they are best thought of as dots. The 34 pet is really weak for tanking so you'll have to tank for it. Now, at 65, in PoP, my pet can't tank as mobs hit too hard. However, in some zones, where mobs are even dark blue, such as Crypt of Nadox, he tanks just fine, with an occasional Quiescence on him. As far as giving it weapons, they put doggie in 'dual wield' mode which ups his dps. Mage weapons will work, as will rusty weapons. Generally, warrior-all race weapons will work. Do a search here on &quot;alpha&quot; and you'll probably find dozens of threads. They'll give ya all kinds of info. And as Silver said, just experiment and see what works for you. Good Luck!! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think our pets will just just about any weapon.  I use a serrated bone dirk whenever I catch one for 200pp or cheaper in the bazaar..  rogue only snare weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Whenever I am soloing something in the old world, for whatever reason (was soloing reports for my seru earring last week, for example) I use my pet to tank and help split adds (by old world I mean anything prior to pop).<br />
<br />
I can throw a quiescence on my pet prior to the pull, then pull with malos and send my pet in to the middle of whatever adds are coming.  Since malos is practically 0 aggro, all the mobs will stop rushing me and instead attack him.  This leaves me free to slow everything one at a time and root it without having to deal with being quadded and bashed in the face by multiple mobs.<br />
<br />
Also, for most old world mobs, your pet can tank them just fine with just a quiescence.  Seru mobs quad for 180-199ish, and he can tank them just fine.  By rooting a mob and ensuring that your pet is within melee range of it, you WILL NOT be summoned, due to the special aggro rules of root.  This is very handy.  I can easily tank a seru mob with just quiescence to heal me, but it is a real pain because they tend to bash you when you try to reapply dots, thus extending the time it takes to kill them by a considerate amount.<br />
<br />
Even against considerably weaker old world mobs, though, your pet's DPS just isn't impressive at all.  He does about the same (maybe even better, due to AC factors) damage to pop mobs, but they just have so many more HP that his damage is really inconsequential.  I want to say something like 20dps.  I still get him out when I am in an exp group, though.  The added damage, although it doesn't really do much, doesn't hurt, and you can still use him to distract an add mob for a few seconds (although he will most certainly die to mobs that triple for 500+).<br />
<br />
So, basically, your pet is just a situationally useful tool that adds a little bit of damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You can take down more than 2 greens at a time.  I hunt LQ hopper pelts in Marus Seru for leather padding and would root all the hoppers I saw and sic dogdog.  Dogdog stays busy with the one he's on, but adds the new one to his aggro list.  This makes him very efficient, snapping from one to the next immediately.  All I did was root, sic, and loot.<br />
<br />
General tips with dogdog -<br />
<br />
   *) Buff with HP buffs+haste.  Optional, STR buffs.<br />
<br />
   *) Always give two 1H weapons, even rusty daggers work.<br />
<br />
   *) SOW is helpful if you are going to want to pull him off the mob.<br />
<br />
   *) He can't hold aggro worth squat.  Even one DOT will usually pull the mob off onto you.  Root it or tank IN TEH FACE.<br />
<br />
   *) He has awesome regen.  If he gets low and you don't want to heal him, root the mob and back him off for a rest while your DOTs chew on the mob.<br />
<br />
   *) Any mobs that hit you get on his aggro list.  Hence, if you are grouped and don't want him to leave a mob to attack a parked one immediately, target the mob he's fighting, do BACK OFF and ATTACK in quick succession to clear his aggro list.<br />
<br />
   *) If he's got a mob on his aggro list and that mob drops below 20% health, he'll switch targets to the low one.  This means if you're root-rotting one while he's gnawing another he just ruined your plans.  Use the BACK OFF/ATTACK trick above to keep him from aggroing on the low health mob.<br />
<br />
   *) If you're grouped, turn taunt off.  If you sic the dog on inc and he has a ways to run, the act of siccing the dog on a mob can cause the mob to attack YOU.  I don't know exactly why this is, but I have seen it plenty of times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Don't under-estimate dogdog --- the level 61 spell (which summons a level 58 dog) is quite nice.  I always keep a slew of rusty daggers on me, purchased in PoK.  Summon dogdog, hand him 2 daggers (to make him dual-wield), throw a Focus of Spirit on him and haste, and he pushes out 40 DPS.  That's pretty damn respectable, imo, and definitely helps take mobs down faster, especially when 2-boxing.  If you have a mage in yer group, have him hand dogdog a set of mage summoned gear --- mages can actually summon haste items for pets, 2 proc'ing weapons, and hp gear....  this ups their DPS even more.<br />
<br />
Dogdog can't take a hit though, at least in PoP.  Even slowed they smoke him out in a few secs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">A full set of mage-summoned plate makes a HUGE difference for their pet - I think it helps pooch a lot, too, in the emergency case where they're actually tanking something.  *grin*  Of course, at that point, you're probably toast, but it's good to know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Dog dog can tank pretty much any normal mob in tier one thats slowable given a cleric hp buff and a focus. When I was soloing through the late 50's in nightmare I'd give doggie a low level symbol, a focus, root the mob, sick him, and dot the target. Worked farily well.</div></div><hr />

ummm...I don't know where you heard this, but I'm positive I have been summoned before by rooted mobs with pets in melee range....where did you find this info?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kahna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hehe this has all been very helpful.. thank you all :)<br />
I do typically use my dog as a DoT that I don't have to cast over and over again and just needed to know how I could improve his damage output. He only tanks when I'm farming up greens or light blues ;p <br />
But what does Alpha Dog in the shaman pet sense mean? <br />
And can our pets use throwing weapons?</div></div><hr />

Way back in the bad old days, when SOE made a number of changes to pets, it was discovered by someone that dogdog suddenly had the ability to dual-wield. He never had that ability before, and the immediate assumption was that it was a programming error on SOE's part.<br />
<br />
So, people wanted to bring this very useful information to the masses--in other words, to Shaman's Crucible--but they were afraid that if they did so, SOE would read the site, and fix the error. So they instead developed a stealth campaign to pass along the information--something referred to as Project Alpha. <br />
<br />
It became clear fairly soon, though, that SOE was aware of the change, and had either intended it, or just didn't want to fix it. Either way, the term Project Alpha stuck, and dogdog's dual-wield ability has been referred to in that way ever since.<br />

Project Alpha History (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=5360) <br />
<br />
Whole reason I dug this up was after reading this thread I was wondering who was the first person to actually call it Project Alpha. That would be Taladaen. Nice job making shaman history lol. <br />
<br />
<br />
Almost a year old already, time sure does fly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Bailie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">This is a really good thread for newbie shamans.  Its too bad there isnt a tactic forum or some place for this sort of thing to go that wouldnt get drowned out by general chatter.  Have a funny feeling if it was stickied (or linked in a stickied post similiar to the epic post) it would answer alot of questions for future posters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Dawg-dawg is probably my favorite part of being a shaman at this point.  <br />
<br />
For serious work, mine gets Focus + Str of the Diaku (for a little extra atk) + Temperance (pocket cleric not high enough for aego yet) + Replen + SltW + 2 1handers (either the 'Dagger&quot; off the troll in PoS, or some cheap proccing weapon or other) + Primal Avatar and not only has little trouble holding aggro, but can tank the semi-slowable bot giants from full to dead.  Kraggs + no aggro from healing pets = $$<br />
<br />
I wouldn't reccomend doing pet-tanking full-time as it's a lot of maintinence work, but in a pinch, having him be able to really tank when the MT dies is far preferable to just siccing him on the mob and hoping he lasts long enough for me to get to the zone.<br />
<br />
Now if there were only a shammy-usable item that conjured 1-handers, it'd be a perfect situation.  As it is, having to buy a bp full of daggers every few days is kind of a pain, tho well worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">well there is a item (for barbs) that conjures 1hb hammers but they are shaman only and WILL NOT make dog god duel wield ...

I wished they had finished that .. oh if you have a mage summon weps have him summon phantom plate ... it seems to mae a difference to me</div></div><hr />

I believe this is the item you are referring to <br />
<br />
Initiate Symbol of the Tribunal (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=1376) <br />
<br />
It summons a hammer, lucy says it is no drop, but I'm on FV, and it's not no drop here, but neither are most things. However, it is primary only, which is why pets won't dual wield by giving them 2. I guess I could give them one first, then another item, never really tried it.<br />
<br />
As far as the quest never being finished, I do have the item, apparently I was VERY lucky. If I recall correctly, you needed the perfect beads off some goblin in Everfrost, if you got the regular beads, you got the xp and all as if the quest was complete. But if you handed in the perfect beads you got the Symbol. I am not sure, I have just heard that I was extremely lucky, I wish I saved that luck for an item I could actually use, even when I first got it, the hammer sucked and I never used it lol. Oh yea, I did one time summon one for a guy on a CR. Yay newb quest :)</div></div><hr />
