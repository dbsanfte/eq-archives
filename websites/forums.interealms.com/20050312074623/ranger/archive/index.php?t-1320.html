In my grouping experience very few rangers nuke while they melee, though I'm guessing Glade rangers are better aware of its influence on DPS.<br />
<br />
Personally, I nuke just enough to dip below full mana, though I nuke as often as possible in a situation where a mob has to die fast.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I spent a couple hours in The Deep last night fighting Shriekers.  They resisted every CoF at least partially (usually half) out of 30ish casts.  I can hit them easily (low AC), so it turned out nuking was a bad idea.<br />
<br />
In the same pulls, we sometimes got Enthralled Underbulks.  I was seeing strings of 10's (my minimum lammy damage) and other similarly low numbers, since their damage mitigation is huge.  I was having little trouble sticking CoF for full on these guys, so I used it whenever possible.<br />
<br />
There... two instances, same camp... one where nuking lowers my DPS, one where it increases it.  So, in answer to your question... it depends!  :)</div></div><hr />

I used to nuke mobs at 30 seasons between swings of my sword.  I melee'd two white con aviaks that way, hehe.<br />
<br />
I don't have any dot's or dd's memmed now, just buffs, and tangling whatits.</div></div><hr />

Then it just becomes a mana burn (not that I have much to burn), and that's really the only time I use nukes when I'm not FM grouped with clarity.<br />
<br />
Hehe... tangling whatits... my slots are normally:<br />
<br />
1) Heal<br />
2) Ensnare<br />
3) CoF<br />
4) Skin like Whatever<br />
5) Call of Sky<br />
6) Shield of Whatever (DS)<br />
7) Ensnaring Roots<br />
8) Sow or Wolf Form<br />
<br />
To rebuff str/CoE/SoN/Coat, I swap out my skin through my root, mem buffs, cast, remem previous spells.  They're lined up in my spellbook for ez-mem, so every hour I recast the long lasting buffs.  I keep the skin in memory because it wears off in less than an hour, and I hate losing those HP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Assuming you have some form of mana regen - it does improve the overall DPS a little at times, and at others seems to not reduce it too much.  Particularly good when you want to &quot;finish off&quot; a mob and need a fast surge in damage.<br />
<br />
First level crit nukes also amuses people on a ranger - getting a crit strike for 600 is great, or using my blade of the falling stars I can proc crit for 826 :-)<br />

Nukes have their time and place - it's all about learning how and when!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Whackkity - do you know the answer to your question or are you starting a discussion?  Have you parsed this sort of thing?  What I do while I solo is I nuke the snared mobs a few times as I pull it to a safe spot, and melee to death while tossing in a few more nukes.  I pretty much nuke whenever it's available, the sooner the mob is dead the less mana I have to waste on heals after all.  But ultimately I would not know the answer to your question, though I'm pretty sure c) is not the one you want.<br />
<br />
Mirisa - do you have Call of Flames?  I am pretty sure I increase my damage output nicely by casting this in between swings of my LSoEE.</div></div><hr />

<br />
add it up and it comes to liek 300ish, so cali should be hit whenever possable :D <br />
<br />
but other then that, calculate the casting times and you come up with some EWWWW numbers.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerail</div><div class="date">04-15-2002, 11:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">depends on a few things for me wether or not i nuke...<br />
<br />
If i'm solo and no mana regen then no I will not nuke<br />
If i'm solo and i have some mana regen then I will nuke if above 60m (otherwise I save my mana for heals and buffs)<br />
<br />
If i'm in a group and no mana regen then no I won't blast unless I have FM (which is rare)<br />
If I'm in a gorup and i have mana regen I'll blast every chance I get unless the person main tanking (if it's not me) is having problems hoding aggro over me<br />
<br />
On a raid - I always have mana regen and I nuke every chance I get against a mob that i know will not resist it (aka the non clothed snakes in ssra, a lot of different boss mobs etc)  Although in dungeon crawling I dont bothter blasting much.<br />
<br />
long live calefaction ... now only if there were a cold based version of it for those pesky FR mobs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Whackkity</div><div class="date">04-15-2002, 11:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">*GEEK ALERT*<br />
<br />
First approximation:<br />
<br />
It's cost-effective to nuke between swings if the dmg/mana ratio of that spell is greater than one and a half times the ratio of your DPS to the mob's DPS.<br />
<br />
So take CoF, which has nearly a 2.0 d/m ratio.<br />
<br />
2 &gt; 1.5(your DPS/mob DPS)<br />
<br />
so if the ratio of your DPS to mob DPS is less than 1.33, it makes sense to cast CoF in-fight rather than to wait til after wards to heal up the extra damage taken by not casting.<br />
<br />
This assumes no loss of your melee damage by casting which is not technically correct but works as an estimate.  It does not take into account fizzles or resists.<br />
<br />
This makes sense intuitively, because if you're way outdamaging the mob, it doesn't feel right to nuke but rather to let your swords do the work.  But if you're in a tight fight and the mob is hitting for 100 in the time you hit for 100, then you're going to benefit from nuking instead of saving the mana for healing up later.<br />
<br />
Anyone see anything wrong with this analysis besides the obvious dork factor?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mirisa</div><div class="date">04-15-2002, 11:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mirisa - do you have Call of Flames? I am pretty sure I increase my damage output nicely by casting this in between swings of my LSoEE. <br />
<br />
Yes &amp; a spare Electrum bladed Wakizashi in the bank if I ever want to do the quest again. But like I stated in my pervious post.. I use my mana wisely unless I have crack because I'm usually running around pulling stuff so I hardly med. I'm a fighter not a nuker. :D As i see it rangers who nuke and nuke usually don't pull much, how can they if they use all their mana on nukes? They must be medding or they have some sort of clarity. <br />
<br />
Sometimes that mana you burned pretending you're a druid by nuking could be used in a situation that went wrong, like root parking etc etc.. You'd be amazed how many ranger's I have been grouped with who after 2 mobs are OOM because of their nuke fest. kinda like a nuking cleric, sure they can nuke too but WHY?<br />

On raids I usually nuke a decent bit, and my group very often gets the kill.</div></div><hr />

I usually have Clarity 2 or Koadic's Endless Intellect up when I'm grouping or raiding, so I'll dump a nuke whenever I feel it's appropriate (ie, all the time) and when I have a small reserve of emergency mana (if I'm not pulling, I always have mana to spare).<br />
<br />
I also try to get a mage-summoned focus item as well - max nuke with Calefaction so far is 540.  Try doing 216 DPS with your weapons!  When I get Spellcasting Fury, I can only assume I'll be nuking even more... :)</div></div><hr />

When im solo, i never nuke (unless im in too deep lol).<br />
When i group, i nuke when im full mana, usually to finish a mob off near the end of the fight.<br />
When i group and fight CH mobs (like Prophet dogs in velks) i chain nuke at mob 50% health.<br />
When i raid, i will try to coordinate nukes with the rest of the team members for better xp rate without screwing up agro.<br />
<br />
So, basically i nuke when i have the mana for it (and the mana regen), unless im soloing.</div></div><hr />

Now that I have drones of doom, I would use that over call of flames soloing because of its better ratio (and solo fights are slow).<br />
<br />
Call of Flame boosts your damage by up to 10dps depending on resists. It will slightly reduce your melee, depending on the speed of your weapons, but never more than 10%, and probably on average around 5%. So if you're doing 200dps melee, then it's not worth it to nuke. If you're doing 200dps melee, please post your profile :)<br />
<br />
Of course, it's important to have enough mana for buffs and snare, so in a group where you are pulling without clarity, you won't be nuking. It would be interesting if anyone could figure out the circumstances when we are better off nuking in a group vs. downtime healing. I think it depends on what percentage of the damage dealing we are doing (i.e. with ranger rogue monk warrior, don't nuke, but with ranger and paladin, nuke).<br />
<br />
Nuking can also be used to smooth out the fighting. That is, save up mana on easy fights, unload on tough fights.</div></div><hr />

Read what I type carefully, I use my mana elsewhere. Or am I suppose to manaburn just because you do? It's all situational, just because Joe Doe Ranger likes to blast and blast doesn't mean I have to, I know when to use my nukes and when not to.<br />
<br />
Oh and if I want to use a rogue, I'll load up the other account, but you know what? I like the ranger better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tarmor</div><div class="date">04-16-2002, 12:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay first off let's look at the numbers:<br />
<br />
Normal Melee DPS (target dependent of course) is on the order of 75dps.<br />
<br />
CoF -- base damage 206 + mage bracer = 247 max damage.  Max DPS = 123. <br />
<br />
Calefaction -- base damage 450 + mage bracer = 540.  Max DPS = 216<br />
<br />
<br />
By way of comparison to a pure caster -- i.e. a Wizard<br />
<br />
Ice comet -- base damage 1120 + mage bracer = 1344.  Max DPS = 213<br />
<br />
<br />
The real difference between wizards and us is that our DD spells have long recast times.  That said, we fill the time with melee damage output.  The next effect is to give us a very high sustained damage profile.<br />
<br />
We are quite simply unlike any other class in this respect.  Toss us some KEI + PoTG and a Bard song and we can average out to over 100 DPS on non resistant mobs over extremely long periods of time.<br />
<br />
As for mana regen/HP buffs == Opti buff combo for us (whether solo, exping in a group, or raiding with most encounters) is as stated KEI + PoTG + Symbol.  The combo gives the same 1150HP that Aego does but trades the AC for an extra 6mana per tick.<br />
<br />
Also of note for those who say we don't have enough mana to constantly cast while in melee -- Our mana regen (standing) can be as high as 38mana per tick (PoTG + KEI + Bard + AAExp + Normal)  At that rate of regen we can quite simply cast either CoF or Calefaction constantly (Calefaction takes just over 7 ticks to refresh, while the mana used is replenished in six, similarly CoF takes three ticks to refresh comparied to just over three ticks to replenish the mana)  You will eventually depleat your mana bar if you constantly alternate between the two, but you will find that with even minimal down time you are in good shape.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lithledana</div><div class="date">04-16-2002, 12:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I nuke constantly in ssra temple.  Especially on boss type mobs.  Rarely does calefaction land for less than full (once druid fire debuff lands) and it does a lot more damage than me poking away for 1 point with off hand and some 16 points or whatever main hand.  Especially with the ruby focus bracer.  Nuking and proccing weapons considerably raises dps in some of those fights according to my logs.</div></div><hr />

With channels, just offer 200p donations or something-- a must have.<br />
<br />
With that in mind, unless the mob is 100% FR, calefaction is memmed always.  Soloing is bit different, as I usually go with Calefaction, b/c I root park and dot/bow sometimes.<br />
<br />
A Nuke is best for when the mob leaves your melee range and your trying to find it, so I nuke and spin and then run to mob.  That's when it's efficient to nuke Imo, since you can't melee hit the mob.<br />
<br />
And yes, it adds DPS nicely, if you are smart.  Some friends of mine have real time DPS programs on, and constantly announcing DPS per character, after fights.  Outside of rogues, rangers are the best damage dealers, hands down.  A 60 Warrior (non-tanking) with nice items can get close, but where I pull ahead is with fire nukes.  Pallies often heal here and there (Healing wave of prexus is very nice), so in theory, although their dps is strong, in reality, their roles often are more than pure meleeing.<br />
<br />
Nothing like pulling a frog _00X and hitting it with a few bow crits and a calefaction, before it ever reaches the group.<br />
<br />
A caveat: not only do Warders usually have crack, we have higher wis on average I would bet and more + mana items, plus some AA points, and then, I think we're not comparable with the lower level rangers.<br />
Thus, this post should really be about whether Warders nuke alot, and then also if 55+ do and 49+ and so forth- as each stage of progression has its limits and benefits.<br />
<br />
Saving mana = pointless (exception: when LoM hehe)- it's meant to be burnt IMO!  Every cleric I know says at 40m, they are Gtg.<br />
<br />
Lizzy E.<br />
<br />
P.s. in duels, calefaction can be very very handy- I've surprised a few melees by nuking and never getting within melee range the whole duel.  Nuke, dot, nuke, bow, snare/root, nullify magic, etc. etc.1</div></div><hr />

I nuke a lot more when soloing, since I tend to do at least the first part of the fight while bow-kiting. There's plenty of time between arrow shots to get a nuke in.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Against Vulak (ie before the ring was put in), nuking with Firestrike was very effective - more efficient than Calefaction and *way* more DPS than just meleeing whilst slowed.<br />
<br />
My point there is that it's definitely worth having a nuke or DoT available if your targets can cast any sort of slow on you.<br />

<br />
My best dd is a 37 pointer, and it's a bit slow to cast.  That said, there are definite situations for using it at level 25.<br />
<br />
1)  With slower weapons.  My main hand is 11/29 right now, so unhasted I don't feel I lose much time with the nuke.<br />
<br />
2)  Damage shielded mobs.  I've been fighting in Permafrost a lot lately and so-and-so gets burned loses its charm after a few swings.  (My enchie friend really needs to get some debuff spells :) )<br />
<br />
3)  As others have mentioned, with enchanter buffs, which I've gotten real used to having.<br />
<br />
Obviously nuking is a level related event.  The reasons that make me nuke will no longer apply when I can debuff a mob, or dual wield gets better, or my main hand damage bonus begins to kick in.<br />
<br />
What I think is great is that there are whole new reasons to nuke at later levels.  Being a ranger means constantly evaluating your options. It's what makes playing a ranger so much fun.</div></div><hr />

raid  with c2 or c3   Cale every time it pops basically   on gaters...  in ntov... etc<br />
<br />
I mem cali and call of flame if the mob is not fire resistant.  need the speed and if you time cali to hit just as the gate starts your whole raid goes smooter.  <br />
<br />
duo with mana spell or regen....  Pull with cali every other pull or so.   nice to start em weak and angry when you are tankins</div></div><hr />

Our usual routine would involve me and the pet meleeing while she nuked. More than once it got a bit ugly when we were impatient and didn't wait long enough before the next pull..the pet dies, the mage goes oom, my health is in the last red bubble... root, back off, nuke it to death. Was kind of fun being grouped with a high damage caster and being the one to get the kill by casting ;)<br />
<br />
These days, I always have calefaction loaded, and I use it many ways. When I am main tank, bombing the mob helps make sure it stays on me. When a mob enrages, casting doesn't get riposted, I still get my damage in, even if I can't get good position. With a gating mob or one that will CH, as it gets down to that point, I'll bomb it in hopes that the large hit will take it down before the spell can trigger.<br />
<br />
Solo, I nuke less if I don't have mind buffs. If I have mind buffs, then what's my reason for not nuking, solo or otherwise ? ;) I generally find that if I have C3 I need to actively waste mana to get ahead of my regen rate ;)<br />

And yes, I know how to control my aggro and I know where it's supposed to be. ;)</div></div><hr />

Of course, at 32, my nuke only does 37 pts of damage. And my wisdom is pathetic :p so I tend to be sparing with mana, in CASE of emergencies. But normally (and observationally, I don't parse heavily) I seem to get more benefit from Snare/Flame Lick/Stinging Swarmand saving mana for emergeny Snares, Roots, and SoWs than to regularly cast a 37 pt nuke.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I use nukes when I am low on health (especially when the healers are oom or dead) and can back out of a fight to help finish the mob off without giving him more chances to hit me.<br />
<br />
This will change with levels of course, right now I use CoF as my main nuke, Careless Lightning as my back up.  Yes I have Firestrike, much too long a casting time.  I usually never get to finish casting it because the mob hits me and interrupts.  I rarely put it up, only on big raids where I know I won't be puling aggro.<br />
<br />
I also Nuke to pull a mob off a caster that nuked too early.  Its always gratifying when they start crying I'm dead and then they aren't, and are very surprised.  Converted a couple ranger trashers that way.<br />
<br />
You have to play with all your tools, get to know them, and get to know when they work the best and when they get you killed.  to do anything less is a disservice to yourself and your teammates.  Giving up on nukes without giving them a full workaround is cheating yourself.<br />

<br />
I rarely nuke, though I have started using dots while soloing shrooms recently.   I can usually get a couple dots off during a fight without hurting my mana too much.<br />
<br />
I have a really hard time believing that me nuking while in a group or raid is going to do that much more damage over melee given my fizzle rate, the resist rate, and my limited mana.  I have tried nuking, but I get lots of fizzles, and lots of resists, and lots of hits for low damage,  and I just end up oom for all that, so I basically gave up on nuking.<br />
<br />
I save my mana for heals and buffs.  Though I do keep CoF up to interrupt gaters if we are fighting casting types.</div></div><hr />

So I usually pull with a Drones of Doom, and after that just melee, usually lay on another DoD if the mob is still over 3 bubs of health after the first wears off.  <br />
But unless it's one of those hard to hit but low MR mobs, I don't bother nuking.  I have noticed, on one of the few raids I've been on in the Hole, when I tossed in a few Dismiss Summoneds on the appropriate mobs, that did wonders for helping my group get the exp. :)</div></div><hr />

When I'm purely a damage dealer I nuke as often as CoF refreshes if mana's not a problem.

I raid almost daily, and it is usual for one of the chnaters to kindly MGB everyone at the end with KEI for their exping.  If you have KEI, ther eis no reason not to be nuke happy.  I regen mana far quicker then I regen HP, so I would prefer to nuke a mob I am soloing to kill it as quickly as possible and regen back the mana.<br />
<br />
On raids, I like to throw out a nuke to see if it sticks.  On mobs that take full fire damage, I will cycle through CoF and firestrike to up my DPS. Interestingly many mobs seem to be more susceptable to fire then most other attacks.  I frequently hear casters saying a mob is resistant when I am landing for full.<br />
<br />
With my current weapons there is no way I can get anywhere near the same DPS with pure melee.  In the time it takes to get the next mob in camp I will have recovered a good amount of my mana.<br />

So nuke nuke and more nukes ..... and can't wait for calcification :)</div></div><hr />

EXP groups - Huh?  What's an exp group?  Haven't been in one in about 10 levels.  Firiona Vie Server just doesn't work like that most times.  But my last Kael raid I got 6 blue at level 43.  Was very happy about that.<br />

I have a nice guild and nice friends, so I must be insane as I rarely have C3 while grinding. <br />
<br />
Actually, I rarely grind where other people do. I am not a people person. I do not like being in popular grind spots because the idiots are generally there as well. That means there are usually no chanters where I like to go.<br />
I also end up doing a lot of the pulling and/or tanking for grind groups. I can't afford the mana. <br />
<br />
Otherwise, my nuking is largely situational.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grayfyn</div><div class="date">06-14-2002, 07:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When to nuke?<br />
<br />
When you want to be a damage dealer. We can do many things, and do them well. Buff, CC, aggro control, downtime heal, etc., and when we choose to, we can lay the damage on thick.<br />
<br />
An example, using rough numbers, but close enough:<br />
<br />
39 Ranger gets his Careless lightning spell (99 dd). Casts it a few times, says &quot;kewl&quot; and never uses it again.<br />
<br />
His hasted DPS (50%) with, say, a Lammy and a Centi SS = (roughly) 20<br />
<br />
His rogue buddy's hasted DPS with, say, a Trak Tooth and a Centi SS = (roughly) 31<br />
<br />
Careless lightning, 99 damage with a 2.75 casting time DPS = 36<br />
<br />
How long does a fight last at that level, 20 seconds? 3 Casts of Careless lightning will have that Ranger doing Rogue-like damage for half of that fight,  and coming close to, equalling, or exceeding the Monk's damage.<br />
<br />
(This assumes that the nukes are landing for full damage, so it's situational, of course)<br />
<br />
It only gets better as the bigger nukes come up. If you've got the mana to nuke, and a mob they'll land on, not nuking is limiting your damage potential, and that, in a word, is bad.<br />
<br />
Since I'm frequently  the only Ranger in attendance at the guild raids I've been to lately (HoT, DN, Wuoshi, Gore etc), nuking is usually not an option. buff_slave_01 reporting for duty =/<br />
<br />
Being a hybrid is all about using every advantage you have to generate impressive results for any situation.<br />
<br />
 In the damage arena, we've got the superior attk ratings, the ability to keep a mob from ever turning our way in the first place (unlike rogues), nukes, great straight-up melee damage, and self-procs to make any narrow-focus melee class respect our dps. <br />
<br />
We can't always use every advantage, but when we can, ouch.<br />
<br />
This is all beside our end-game archery untouchableness.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rakassan</div><div class="date">06-14-2002, 04:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Like most other people, I will say it is situational. On a low AC mob, there is no need to nuke, better to save your mana for healing (if you are soloing) or other spells. On a high AC mob, especially one that is not fire resistant nuking is definately the way to go. At level 60, firestrike casting time drops down to 3.2 seconds leaving it just under 100 DPS for a full hit. Start swapping out your normal items for mage summoned focus items (if a mage is available) and your nukes become an even more important part of the damage you can deal. I can personally nuke during a raid with KEI and focus items and get higher damage than melee due to the fact that alot of the raid content in SoL is high AC, the drawback is that alot of the mobs have higher fire resistance too so knowing your targets is required. When I am soloing, I am generally dual boxing a chanter so I always have KEI, haste and a slowed mob, so I can nuke as I see fit without having to worry about mana much at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Delyth</div><div class="date">06-15-2002, 11:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hehe<br />
<br />
I nuke. <br />
If I have a C2/KEI I nuke everytime CoF and Calefication pop. (firestrike BLOWS). I nuke until I am down to what I consider my safety mana (about 1.5-2 bubs of mana) If I can't do CC with that amout of mana in an emergency (ie bard/chanter dies) then I would feel like I am one sorry ranger and have to go play my enchanter or bard for a bit. <br />
<br />
Soloing, I nuke to finish them off, if it is a mob I know won't resist too much. I usually do a little dotting when I solo. Helps a bit and uses up my normal  nuke mana.<br />
<br />
Hehe I also like to try to KS the wizards on guild raids... I love seeing Suchandsuch Weezard does critical damage for (insert nice +1k damage here) and having a group with 2 rangers and some healers grab the xp them :) Let them know they are not ALL powerful (until they get manaburn). /chuckle</div></div><hr />
