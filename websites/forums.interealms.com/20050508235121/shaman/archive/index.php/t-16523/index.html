<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Waredan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, trolling through the boards clicking on others profiles and stuff, i hit on someone:<br />
<br />
                       Burzlaff Pranxed <br />
Dark Prophet of Enshadowed a Brell Serilis guild<br />
                          -=Gear=-<br />
<br />
<br />
       I went to his guild's website and after a few minutes of reading, noticed that a GM AE shrank a bunch of people. Personally, ive never had this done to my guild, or me personally. I dont know how long they have had the ability to do this, BUT, it signifies to me that if they have the ability to do this, then it wouldnt be TOO hard to put it to use on NON-gm players. <br />
<br />
       That ability is clearly there (duh, there is no reason it cant be) so why not throw us a bone and make AE- out of group shrink happen? Just modify it with a little consent box or something. Its too easy and would be an AWESOME spell that dosent do anything but cut another useless timesink of having to shrink a raid. <br />
<br />
Just a mere observation<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>vaniar luclin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I hate to come across so negative, its not really your post Burzlaff, its the constant crying for this out of group shrink. I gotta tell ya with all the other ways to shrink from Warriors Kunark bracer, to shrink devices (tinkered), to shrink items, to shrink potion to all the classes that have access to shrink or formchange_tinyrace..... if you cant get your own dang shrink then either shut up or just do the rotate through the groups thing. I mean really, is it all that difficult, with all the other things that are really wrong with the playability of the Shaman class that you guys have to keep harping on SHRINK???? get a grip please... I for one am sick of seeing this on any shaman board except as item 37 in a wishlist, right below some sort of rez (sarcasm for the literary challenged) <br />
<br />
I am sorry for the seeming attack on you but its really just that your Shaman_398 that thinks this will make a diff to any real issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think they have the capability to make a simple aoe shrink now, just like the boxes in LDoN that can heal you, or the mist potions.  Question is if they will of course.  It'd prolly have to come with an annoying confirmation box.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>writher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hey Vaniar,<br />
Read the post.  It's not Burzlaff starting this topic, but someone who read from Burzlaff's Web Site that the GM used an AE shrink on the ogres.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I for one am sick of seeing this on any shaman board except as item 37 in a wishlist, right below some sort of rez (sarcasm for the literary challenged)<br />
<br />
I for one think the shaman class is already reasonably well balanced with exellent playability, soloability, usefullness in groups and raids, and DPS (yes, I said DPS !) barring a few tweaks here and there we do very well for ourselves.  Shrink out of group is very much an issue I'd like to see adressed because it's a serious annoyance that has an obvious solution that doesn't affect game balance. <br />
<br />
Just face it, we don't have all that much to complain about. Fixes to shrink, rabid bear, and the bear model are bound to be on top of a lot of people's lists. Personally I'd probably add a higher level turgurs with lower recast time but that's about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Since the introduction of tinkering devices and project illusion, I haven't had to switch groups or invite anyone specifically for shrink in several months.  Almost everyone in my guild has a shrink device, since we have a gnome necro that made them at cost for everyone.  Almost all our chanters have project illusion, and they turn their group in to guktans.  About half of our warriors have a cobalt bracer, which ends up being like 5 more people per raid that can shrink.  On top of that, we have finally recruited a few beastlords, which adds even more shrink capable people.<br />
<br />
There was a time, about 6 months ago, when I would have done anything for a TGB or MGB'able shrink.  Shrink devices weren't out, no one wanted to buy potion, and my guild had one active (me) and one semi-active shaman.  That was hell.  Now, though, it isn't even an issue any more.  On the rare occasion that someone needs a shrink and can't get it from someone in their group and asks me, they just get referred to the recruit shaman and we make him do it.<br />
<br />
So, basically, TBG'able shrink with a confirmation box or something would be great, but I no longer see a reason to keep bringing it up.  SOE has heard by now that we want it, and they will either do it or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hyperd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">We NEED PET inspect ability, I want to see what the Pet actually equips.<br />
<br />
We Need to have our group spells affect all pets in the group too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">We Need to have our group spells affect all pets in the group too.<br />
<br />
They would have to make it so that cures don't effect charmed pets, but yeah, good idea.<br />
<br />
The number 1 thing I would like to see is the ability to consider a mob and see what debuffs it has on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>vaniar luclin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I really should have been more careful to say that it isnt Waredan/Burzlaff as a shaman or a poster, Im just SOOOOOOOOOOO sick of seeing this as a topic that some people think needs to be addressed before all others, and I apologize to people that really feel that they need to have this so desperately (it could be that Im spoiled and way out of touch with non elemental guild raiding issues). I havent even bothered with Rabid bear myself, but Id would like to see some fix to that to make it useful before giving me some AE spell that I dont think I have cast more than 2 times a week and usually single versions when that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Skadi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Vando needs a hug!<br />
<br />
<br />
/hug!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Waredan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ya, Im not saying &quot;Fix this NOW!!1!&quot;, but just it seems that it is very feasible, and &quot;seems&quot; somewhat easy since the spell (most likely a spell) is already there and such. All they'd have to do is tack on a confirm box. <br />
<br />
Many other things need to be fixed with more priority than out of group shrink... thats a given. It just seems that it would take a programmer all of 5-10 minutes to do this with very VERY little effect to the balance of the game iteself. <br />
<br />
Was just an observation, and a little speculation on wether or not they plan to introduce out of group shrink soon. <br />
<br />
Also, I think i asked it, but has anyone in the past had a GM AoE shrink before? Is this a new thing, or has it been around for a while and im just in the dark?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">AE shrink will bad because it abuse other player and they can't refuse it, plus no way to un-shrink without you/illusion, if you give a pop-up box then it will even worse, <br />
<br />
think about what happen if everyone spam cast this this spell everywhere with pop-up box, and what happen to your guild if that stupit box pop-up every 10minutes to whole raid -- since people ususlly die/rez and need shrink again<br />
<br />
I though best way is just remove all shrink from game and make it self only, so all those lazy people can buy their own shrink potion/tinkering; it is pretty cheap, 10pp per charge and at most 100pp per night is like nothing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Xhosa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I though best way is just remove all shrink from game and make it self only, so all those lazy people can buy their own shrink potion/tinkering; it is pretty cheap, 10pp per charge and at most 100pp per night is like nothing <br />
<br />
Great, then since it costs so little you don't mind me asking you for 1000pp per raid target (as deaths need to be reshrunk after rez) as you are so flush that that much cash means nothing to you.<br />
<br />
Now we could do 2 or 3 targets in a raid night and we do take on mobs which can wipe us out and we try them again, it's a part of growing as a guild. That could be 3000pp plus the rest. No way do vendor droppables exceed 3000pp in a raid night. Our guild does not charge its members to raid or expect them to pay for their buffs or shrink themselves for that matter.<br />
<br />
We have group and single target shrink. I'd be happy to cast the single one on a person that just got rezzed or cast the group one multiple times at the beginning of a raid. People would just get a poppup box on either the group or single target version.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">There is a need for an out of group shrink (anyone unfortunate enough to be stuck in VT for hours can tell you this) and it would be REALLY easy to implement, but it is definitely below fixing doors in zones on SOE's priority list.<br />
<br />
Just make anyone in /raid shrinkable and VIOLA, your skill at being more useful has increased (1)!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Not saying this is the top of any list, but for a raiding guild, getting shrink around is irritating/costly, when there's no real game-balancing reason to prevent it, it just has to get enough grumbling for someone to address.  Possible fixes:<br />
<br />
* allow shrink within your raid<br />
* popup box for shrink outside group<br />
* allow shrink on anyone, then implement /normalsize command<br />
<br />
I'd take any of the three</div></div><hr />
