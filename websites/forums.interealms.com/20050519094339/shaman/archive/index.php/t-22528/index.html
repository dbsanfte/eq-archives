<br />
if i understood correctly, you cannot shrink anymore your pet with regular shrink but only with tiny companion? that means 1/2 shrunk instead of 2/3 as previously (with 2 regular casting)?</div></div><hr />

------------------------------- <br />
<br />
With the update on the 14th, we changed the AA system to allow for more flexibility and control as we move forward and add additional AAs. All of the over 300 AAs were affected by this change. Some of the AAs have since been behaving incorrectly and we feel that these AA problems are enough of a hindrance to gameplay that it is necessary to correct them tonight. <br />
<br />
Here is the list of changes we have for you tonight; <br />
<br />
- AA abilities that were previously usable when using a discipline, sitting, or under the effects of stun, divine aura, or silence should once again be usable in those situations. <br />
- Resolved an issue with Warriors Shielding that caused it to cancel instantly <br />
- A bug in the Iksar Necro skullcap quest that allowed players to obtain it illegitimately has been fixed. <br />
- Several tradeskilled items have had their values modified to prevent a profitability exploit.  <br />
<br />
- The key to Veeshan's Peak is now No-Drop on Firiona Vie  <br />
<br />
We apologize to those of you, who had raids and other activities scheduled tonight and thank you for your patience. <br />
<br />
Thanks all! <br />
<br />

I don't know why they just don't do away with TS's. Oh wait - because they are a time sink.<br />
<br />
And &quot;team&quot;?  Yeah the 1976 Tampa Bay Bucanneers were a &quot;team&quot; too.  0-16.<br />
<br />
If the EQ team was a football team they'd be the Cinncinnati Bengals. (Called the &quot;Bungles&quot; prior to last year)<br />
<br />
If they were a baseball team they'd be the Pittsburgh Pirates (11 straight seasons of sub .500)<br />
<br />
If they were a basketball team they'd be the L.A. Clippers.  Had talent - let it slip away.  And the ownership (Donald Sterling) gets PAID whether his team stinks up the joint or not.</div></div><hr />

McQuaid was good for the game. The vision had some major blindspots but I still enjoyed the game more under his lead than the current crop of paint by numbers and no soul to anything proceedings. <br />

Millman is still around.  He's around in &quot;The Grey&quot; forum near the bottom of the Crucible forum list.  Still outspoken, still drunk.  His guide on playing EQ drunk was a classic.</div></div><hr />

I'll have to disagree, I believe that the original EQ team were rocket scientists compared to the yahoos in charge now.  Everything up to Velious and its lore was a work of art.  Vox/Nagafen raids were fantastic.  You worked for what you earned, and there were very few whiny max levels who didn't know what the heck they were doing.<br />
<br />
What do we get these days?  Inconsistent &quot;story&quot; segments written in a &quot;See Spot Run&quot; grade level, and a ton of aliens with names like Ff'zrtx'dftkl'sdtz that harass scantilly clad chicks with big noses.<br />
<br />
Brilliant.....</div></div><hr />

We should probably make a list for Talamay, what all has changed since Velious? I'm going to start a thread!<br />

Off topic, but obviously you dont understand sports franchise dynamics. The Clippers are not an example of a team where the owner is making money (other than the inevitable scarcity gap premium that comes with a monopoly business that controls the # of franchises,i.e. value goes up because new buyer cant get new team, likely has to buy old one). Over 1/2 of pro sports teams (Big 4) lose money every year. In fact sports team ownership is historically one of the worst investments a person can make. We all know about the Steinbrenner's but he is quite rare. Usually only the top 10 teams in a league make an owner money over the long-term when you factor in the costs associated (having 100s of millions tied up has a cost) with the business.<br />
<br />
But your main point is well taken :)<br />

<br />
1) They perenially suck.<br />
2) THey perenially have decent talent.<br />
3) They perenially don't make the playoffs.<br />
4) They perenially make a profit.<br />

<br />
From the above (You can't right click and copy)<br />
<br />
The Clippers failed to make the playoffs - AGAIN.<br />
<br />
And Sterling is making 25 MILLION in profit.<br />
<br />
STILL WANT TO HELP WITH MY UNDERSTANDING OF &quot;SPORTS FRANCHISES?&quot;<br />
<br />
I &quot; UNDERSTAND &quot; that the Pittsburgh Penguins and Pirates lose money.  I also &quot; UNDERSTAND &quot; that Sterling MAKES MONEY - EVERY YEAR.<br />
<br />
BUT THANKS FOR &quot; HELPING. &quot;</div></div><hr />

Yes and no. Many good changes to the game since he left but they are primarily annoyances that have been removed or lessend. Thats fine and helps everyone. But on the other hand there has been an extreme focus on keeping the top end of the players happy the last few years.<br />
<br />
Yeah yeah Blazz, I know non-top-end players got a few things too but very few that are exclusively for them whereas there are just tons and tons of things/zones that are only for our beloved ubbers.<br />
<br />
All in all I think EQ is far worse as a game now than it was in the &quot;good-old-days&quot;. Its more like a job now where you HAVE to spend lots and lots of hours a week to get anywhere. And many things are off-limit even if you do spend lots of time if you are not in a big guild. It must no doubt be more fun and selfreassuring to be an ubber now since they know the are a very specialized brand of people but its difficult to understand that its a good business decision by SOE to go that way with EQ.</div></div><hr />
