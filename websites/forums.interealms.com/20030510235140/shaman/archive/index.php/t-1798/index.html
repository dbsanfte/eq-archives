<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Amenkhet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I say untwinkable cause I recently started on the newest server--Kane Bayle.<br />
<br />
I am currently level 10 and *just* got SOW, so money is very tight. As we all know, money is needed!<br />
<br />
I have a half-formed plan in the jello-like mass I use as a brain but would like your opinion on it.<br />
<br />
So I have a Vah Shir shaman. Truly crappy equipment. A splintering club and mostly padded armor ( dont even have a tunic)<br />
<br />
Where is the best money maker in the game for this lvl or one close to my lvl. I was thinking the Warrens, but if I know about it, so does everyone else. Once I have 200-300pp from selling the bronze weapons available in the Warrens, blacksmithing and get to banded and then my worries are over. Is this a sound plan? <br />
<br />
I welcome your input.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">no, your worries wont be over, but banded is better then nothing<br />
<br />
heres what i suggest: blacksmithing takes up to much cash, so jus find someone who already has done it.  pick up what you can as you go, get some cash, then buy some banded.  i had 100pp self made at lvl 6(lucky as hell on bear pelts though =-) )<br />
<br />
best money maker is to gain levels, but the warrens is fine.  the drops of the king might be pretty easy to sell for a decent bit of cash, seeing how noone will have good equip.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>hdaana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">call me old school but i'd sow for donations or something and get a hold of a magic weapon and go to odus and do wisps.they sell for 7pp i think it was to the gyspys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Although the drop rate has been, well, dropped, will-o-wisps are still a fair bet. Getting hold of a magical weapon might be tricky (for barbarians there is always the trusty &quot;Initiate Symbol of the Tribunal&quot; quest, there is probably an equivalent for Cat-peeps). Anyway, kill will-o-wisps and loot greater lightstones - take them to the gypsy camp in North Karana where you can hand them in  for a &quot;concordance of research&quot; which you can sell to vendors for about 9.5 plat</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You're a cat.  Stay on the moon.  Go to Paludal caves and hunt there - they xp will FLY by and once you hit about lvl 18 - 19 you can start hunting the bandits...they drop a nice bit of change and bronze weapons/armor.  The armor sells for 4 - 5 plat a piece.<br />
<br />
By the time they green out (25?) you can go to Netherbian Lair and hunt Trogs, Fungus, Netherbians.  Lots of plat, and the Fungus drop armor to round out your equipment.<br />
<br />
Don't waste your biggest advantage - being on the moon.<br />
<br />
<br />
edit: forgot to add - you *can't* solo in the Warrens.  Its just too full of mobs.  And usually its devoid of people/groups.<br />
<br />
With bad faction in Paineel, and a nearly empty dungeon (unless KB is different because of it's newness) you are in for a lot of wasted time and pain if you head to warrens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">try frontier mountains btw...<br />
<br />
<br />
Jus get in a group outside the fort, and try to win the drops of the biggarse weapons the giants sometimes lug around.  <br />
<br />
At 34 you should be able to solo them pretty easy, and the weapons they drop sell for 40pp to vendors, and on that server probably more to players...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Andrewe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I agree that just leveling up until you can kill bandits in Paludal will get you dressed in Bronze Brigadine armor by the early 20s. The AC is the same as banded, it however weighs a bit more. Grouping up you should be able to hunt them by the late teens. (In a group of twinks we saw more than a complete set drop in a single night; obviously you'd be killing slower, but still it's a fairly common drop.)<br />
<br />
I'm thinking this will be faster than getting 300pp or so to learn banded yourself. And leveling speeds on the moon are so much faster than the old world that it's worth just grinding through rather than focusing on gear IMHO.<br />
<br />
There are newbie quests you can do to get cloth/patchwork-quality armor all over you in the meantime, I forget the exact locations but I believe they are given in Hollowshade in the newbie area.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just for reference - even cons to my lvl 12 Bard gave me over 4 blues of xp per kill in Paludal Caves.  It is the *best* exp in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">No thoughts on $$ making, but do you know about the Vah Shir newbie armor?  The quests are pretty darn easy, the drops needed for the quests fairly easy to obtain.  Talk to the cat on the path, in or near hut just as you leaving the city into Shadeweavers.  The armor from the newbie quests definately better than leather, maybe comparable to banded, but has some stat adjusters on it as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
As I can tell you from personal exp., it is gonna be next to impossible for you to get down to Norrath until you are in your 20's unless someone can cast invis on you.  No way you can make that run thru paludal caverns with invis. if everything is gonna aggro on you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Mez has started characters on new servers a couple of times....  it be fun....  but the economies can be kind of strange because everyone is in da same boat.    When yoo can make banded yoo have a hard time selling it because no one has cash to spend... yooz all broke all da time.<br />
<br />
The best spot mez ever find for quick cash at low lvl is old world....  sisters island in OOT....   Vah Shir with sneek should be great because yoo should be able to sell to the vendor on da island.  Mez would get to lvl 14 for da bind spell and den go to sisters.  Da belts sell to vendors for 1.4p each and drop like candy.<br />
<br />
At first I would spend more cash on spells den on equipment.  Just get garbage in each slot and one of each tipe of weapon to keep da skills up.<br />
<br />
Another rich area to explore are quests but mez have no idea what quests are available to Vah Shir.<br />
<br />
*burp*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I found that in the first weeks of SZ the people who made banded where able to make a good amount of money, its in high demand, you can sell for 1 or even 2pp per ac.  The problem with smithing on old servers is that there are very few untwinked newbies, so noone needs banded, on a new server, EVERYONE needs banded, and very few have the initiative and cash to make it (you need like 300p to get to be able to make banded at a half decent rate).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">oh yeah...almost forgot:<br />
<br />
around lvl 26-28, go to EF and hunt mammys.  the tusks are 7 to 10 pp each to a vendor, and w/ cha buffs the prices are pretty darn good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Actually, not everyone on new servers needs banded anymore.  They added some EXCELLENT newbie armor into the game.  Example a Truthbringer's BP (obtained by my GF's lv. 12 Pally) from newbie drops has 12 AC +3 Dex +4 Wis !!!!!!  A full set of this stuff is obtainable by lv. 12 and has much more than just the raw ac offered by banded, the stuff loaded with dex, sta, wis, etc.<br />
<br />
I understand not all newbie zones have this new questable armor though...I believe Kitty's, DE's, Misty Thicket, and Freeport do......not sure on other areas.<br />
<br />
Sooooo, depending where you start banded not guaranteed to be a big seller.  May want to check it out before you put the effort into smithing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Grotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Kitty shaman have some excellent quests for gear available to them. Check out that while you are still on the moon. <br />
<br />
Plus lots of zones have new quests available for lowbies. I started a druid tailor on Prexus and by level 10 (one evening of play) I have a full suit of halfling moss toe armor. The BP is 7ac 2 wis 5hp which is quite nice for the level its obtainable at. The legs are 5ac 2wis which is perfect prior to getting 7ac 4wis gator legs. <br />
<br />
The newbie halfling rangers and paladins all had access to questable full suits of chain and plate armor. All of the low level content has got me wanting to start a few more non-twinks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Niall Graycloak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">best place I've ever made money on a new server was in the Warrens, especially as a shaman/mage. Go in with a few summoned bags for the bronze/heavy stuff and loot bags off the kobolds for the rest - works wonders. Last necro I did this with had all his spells at 16th, 200pp in the bank and had decked out a friends ranger in full ringmail to boot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>jannia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Stay put and hunt on the moon. You can get very decent armor off of the Traders and Lodi Kai in the Traders cave in your newbie area. Once I got a full suit of the chain armor, I left for the Paludal Caves. I leveled like mad there with only 1 death.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>jannia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Paludal will get you dressed in Bronze Brigadine armor by the early 20s<br />
<br />
The Lodai chain armor that you can get off of mobs in the Lodai Kai Trader cave has better stats, weighs less I think and you get it sooner then hunting for bronze at the bandit camps in PC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Reidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Conerning Paldual Caverns...you CAN make the run from the Nexus side (shadowhaven) to the lowbie friendly side (thicket) without invis...just SOW.<br />
<br />
The pathing in their sucks...so if you know your way (courtesy of EQ Atlas) I made the run several times back and forth starting at level 9 (when I went to the moon).<br />
<br />
Just hotket &quot;TRAIN to ???&quot; out of common courtesy, and let people know you are on a &quot;suicide run&quot;<br />
<br />
When you get to 14, it's even easier.  Cast levitate on yourself, and do the same SOW train ordeal, but the levitate will make life easier. <br />
<br />
I tried invis without SOW at level 8 (hehe).  Little did I know that invis lasts anywhere from 30 sec to 30 minutes.  Imagine my expression when I popped visible in a lake full oif fiends.  This troll wet himself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Elric the Feeble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I play a cat, and the reason I think there arent as many cat shammys around is that the moon is cash tight for quite awhile.  When I started, I pretty much just killed in shadeweavers, made a butt load of bandages, and did all of the quests.  Its slow and very suckworthy.  Your tailoring skill ought to be prety good by now hehehe.  Go the back way into paludal (through hollowshade) and kill kill kill.  It wasn't until I reached about 20 that I started getting the kind of loot to work on trade skills/buy real equip.  I think I ran around with a tarnished spear for like 14 lvls LOL</div></div><hr />

<br />
Spoken like a true twink.  The quests are a huge pain in the butt.  I would never go as far a sto call them easy.  The drops are scarce.  Try them untwinked sometime.  Do Spiritist Ragnar's quests to get padded armor to start, then work on the dude in the shack in shadeweavers quests.  As mentioned, leveling is your best asset here.  Get to Paludal as soon as possible.  Tailoring.  Materials drop everywhere.  Forget cash on the moon, its not like BB or Everfrost where backpacks are dropin all the time, mobs actually drop cash, and HQ skins fallin out your rear, just level and get to Paludal!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>TweadleDimm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">For somone who claims to have been twinked with a JBB from level 1 , you're pretty free with the twink labeling .<br />
<br />
Elric mentioned he was so twinked in another thread.<br />
<br />
I believe it was &quot;NOOBS&quot; or something like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Elric the Feeble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">YESSSSS-keyword(s):ADMITTED I AM TWINKED.  try it sometime.  Point being, Make a new cat, UNTWINKED, UN-PLd, and do the armor quests in shadeweavers, and THEN tell me the items are EASY to obtain, that they drop often. I have played 2 characters totally untwinked beyond lvl 20 this year, and the quests are average, kill wise.  The items rarely drop.  By the time you get the no drop crap necessary to complete the quests, you've already got better crap.<br />
<br />
PS  still cant use my JBB, guess its just AC.<br />
<br />
Arent you the ranger I saw the other day with the complete issue twink CLS, etched, etc ensemble?<br />
<br />
Just LOOOOOVE people that want to bash someone for being twinked, and are quite twinked themselves, they just cant admit it.<br />
<br />
Also LOOOOOVE people that post for areas to hunt/by LVL, and come off immediatley with &quot;I am only slightly twinked&quot;, or better yet, &quot;totally untwinked&quot;, and give some LA strat for how at 20th lvl, you too can solo red mobs, root n' rot style, and only use 1/2 bub mana and maybe lose 1/2 bub health per kill.<br />
<br />
It should also be noted that I say these things soley for personal entertainment value (for the most part), and readily welcome comebacks, as they are what make the whole thing enjoyable.  Its a game folks, some of you need to remember that.</div></div><hr />
