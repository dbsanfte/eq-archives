My comments:<br />
<br />
a) a hammer?  bah.  should have been a spear.  A wicked looking spear.<br />
<br />
b) I haven't seen all the different class-specific weapons, so not sure how good the stats compare.  +140 hp/mana is nice tho.<br />
<br />
c) somehow we got a larger heal than clerics and druids?  /boggle.  The pessimist in me says this will be changed to clicky Acumen soon. <br />
<br />
d) A 15 minute recast time?  thats pretty steep.<br />

I am still working on my VP Key.  The cleric and druid staves were linked the other day in /gu...I've been keeping an eye out for the SHM one and found it on Lucy.<br />

re:  1 heal every 15 mins.  I like the idea of a 'break glass in case of emergency' heal spell...but in EQ those 'emergencies' happen every few minutes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Its a extra heal off the hammer. Not something that can be used to take the place of regular heaing but a nice quick cast for a rough moment. Heck id not complain about the 15 minutes. Sorta LOhish with a quicker reuse. <br />
<br />
 Course i also have NO EFFECTS on any of my weapons so this is just from my perspective.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I really hate those effects that have a long recast.  Without a visual clue showing when they can be cast again they would remain mostly unused by me.<br />
<br />
On a side note, kraggs mending has incredible aggro, might have some use there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When a melee player clicks on a weapon link, he sees the damage bonus that he WOULD have IF he could equip it. My Monk did a fair amount of link shopping back when we were compiling a comprehensive list of 2H bonuses :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ulver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I know initially the cleric stick had a 2 second recast on it.<br />

The recast timer wasn't displayed on the links originally, but far as I know they were always there in practice.</div></div><hr />

I would gladly take the hammer and use it while soloing if I needed something for instant quick heals for no mana cost.  It does require you to have it equipped but it's alot easier since it's 1hb and not 2hb.  I would gladly take it and hope to get myself one pretty soon.</div></div><hr />

Thanks, never really shopped for shaman stuff on another character.<br />
<br />
<br />
There was a link to one of the cleric sticks being shown around on patch day and showed a 2 second recast time.  May have been just a typo(could it?) in the file or something.  I remember seeing that and wondering just how insane are the devs, really.</div></div><hr />

         It's not an instant heals...even if i don't understand the concept of instant quick heal  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
          15 minutes recast make it worthless. If we are in healer mode ,we probably heal more than 50 time in 15 minutes (that just 3 heal per minute).</div></div><hr />

Still not meant to be healer mode hammer. It simply what it is. Does everyone just have high end equipment and all flags and just dont need this?<br />
This would fill in a can5 nicely with no mana. The effect isnt useless i think people just want more out of it that it was designed for. Come back from rez and dont have to cast Q to get more intial health back. Its not useless just not earth shattering. Be a convience effect. I can think of plenty of uses. Is everyone so high up the ladder anymore can just skoff at this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Tebion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">this hammer is perfect for raids where you go oom due to spotting and where every single heal really counts -&gt; its worth swapping weapons for 2 seconds and maybe give the clerics the needed time to get the next ch stick on the tank for sure.<br />
<br />
imo one little heal is better than none at all, every bit helps (otherwise you either zerg or dont do thrilling encounters, hehe .... and this is not meant as offense of course!! i just like trying to kill mobs with unperfect setups/as few friends as possible ;) )<br />
<br />
damn, need more time for camping vp-keymobs again :) ;)</div></div><hr />

Not much of a bone 15 min recast time stinks It may be good in a pinch but worthless for anything else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">its a free ****ing heal people.. god you people are even more jaded than i am :\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">for once i'll agree with you Tikoko and go back with what i was saying.<br />
<br />
it's a free heal that's faster casting than our fastest heal currently.  It's a life saver if nothing else and will give you back all of your canni5 dmg if nothing else in one hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Ulver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Almost the exact amount healed as a Cann5 as well</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I like it, it's a heal that can be used in the recast time while spamming heals.  no complaints from me, it's a free 1900 hps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Dread</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I think this could be modified to be usefull without making it overpowering.  I think that 1 minute recast would be perfect, but would even settle for 3 minutes.  If I could use it every time I can5'd then it would be useful but not overpowering.<br />
<br />
15 minutes is just plain silly tho.  As it is right now, I am casting non-stop pretty much all the time.  Between keeping up Breath on the MT, cycling FA on the melee, spam healing when required, can4 constantly for mana, and nuking the remainder of the time - I don't see myself having the time nor patience to switch in a weapon once every 15 minutes for a marginal benefit.   I don't understand why SoE can't cut shaman a break, I'll bet I push 5 to 10 times as many buttons as other classes in a given time period.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">damange bonuses on cleric, druid, and shaman specific weapons?<br />
<br />
Anytime a melee charactor looks at any weapon will show a damage bonus. Wont when we have on in our hands though when we look at it. But will to a warrior , monk etc. <br />
<br />
All the weapons i look up real quick for shaman shows a damage bonus regardless who could use it. ( on alla's)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Anytime a melee charactor looks at any weapon will show a damage bonus. Wont when we have on in our hands though when we look at it. But will to a warrior , monk etc.<br />
<br />
That's right. The displayed damage bonus depends on three things and three things only:<br />
<br />
(a) whether the class of the character looking at the link gets a primary hand damage bonus at level 28 (all pure melee clases and hybrids get it, priests and INT casters don't);<br />
<br />
(b) the character's level;<br />
<br />
(c) for two handers only, the weapon's delay - see the damage bonus table at Lucy.<br />
<br />
The displayed damage bonus does not depend on the type of weapon (slashing, piercing, etc) or whether the character can use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Someone was laughing when they made this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's put that thing we called a complete heal on this stick, and give it a reasonable cast time! ...And then make it take a quarter of an hour to cast again! And then let's put it into the keyed zone we just revamped to raid-only entry with elemental level critters. They'll eat it up!&quot;<br />
<br />
Goddamned sadists. They could have let us retain our quiet dignity and just put Avatar on it.</div></div><hr />
