<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rubitt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Interesting fact that Focus effects (and normal effects) all have their lvl posted now. Not sure why focus effects need a required level but well have to wait and see where soe goes with this one...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Numgrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's not a required level exactly, if you're familiar with Alla's listing of &quot;Level for effect&quot;, it's the same thing. Example, Copper Hammer lists as 50, when it starts to proc since it was nerfed. Hope that clears it up for ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">who cares, the last expansions have all been for level 65 folks so anyone who isn't at the max level already is a raging loser.</div></div><hr />

I dont agree with that at all...in fact LoY, while rather craptacular for the midrange 60+ is rather phat exp in the mid 40s till 60ish, in fact I did a lot of grinding toward 60 in Crypt of Nadox. Also LDON, while some dont see it as a &quot;real&quot; expansion does offer genuine content and really good exp for the effort for a level 20+, for non twinks its a good way to learn group dynamics easier (/assist, mezzing, etc) and for twinks its a good way to level without PLing and still learn how to play the class correctly.<br />
Sure PoP is aimed at higher levels and GoD is aimed at even higher levels, but dont just say that anyone that isnt 65 is a raging loser, thats just being a troll.<br />
As to the topic, there are several required level &quot;limits&quot; added on items, J-boots, SoW potions, Manastone etc, they were added to clarify some things and as per SOE's usual speed, some mistakes got made. The effects are still very useable by people lower level, but for example, you cant equip Jboots unless your level 50 now (like you would want to) but they still work fine from inventory for my 28 monk and 45 bard. Dont get all upset and do the chicken little thing. The sky isnt falling, at least not when it comes to your Jboots it isnt :p</div></div><hr />

That is, arguably, one of the most ridiculous things I've read here in quite some time. Light above, before you retired, YOU spent some time below 65. We all did. Being &quot;max level&quot; takes work.<br />
<br />
As for the topic ... I tire of folks screaming &quot;nerf&quot; every time something changes in-game. This is not a nerf to my mind, it's just housekeeping. The last paragraph of Helfdane's post says it perfectly.<br />

There is plenty of content and things to do for people under 65.  In fact, I think it would be pretty hard to experience all or even most of the pre-65 content before dinging 65.  I took my time leveling to 60, and there are still many many low and mid level zones I know nothing about.  If I were to make a new character, I could level up to 60 using nothing but zones I didn't use the first time around.  There are hundeds of quests listed on allakhazam's geared towards mid-level people that I have never done and have no clue about.  Basically, I'm trying to say that there is plenty of sub-65 content.<br />
<br />
What about post-65 content?  With the exception of the high-end GoD zones, I've seen and done everything there is in this game.  I've done every high-end encounter and explored every high-end zone.  This is because I spent 61 days played getting to level 60, and 210 days played working on my post-60 game.  I need more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">All items with effects have gotten a &quot;required level&quot; added to their effect description, whether they needed one shown there or not. But I don't see what's so &quot;nerf&quot; about that, sheesh.<br />
<br />
One inconsistent thing I noticed was the Mana Pres IV on Scaled Avatar's Boots showed level 44 instead of 0 like most of the other focus effects.</div></div><hr />

Doesn't really matter since you can't do the combine until 55 anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">When I see all these empty mid / upper level zones I wonder why they ask for more zones in this range. 95% (if not more) of the causal players will do either LDoN or go to the zone with the best ZEM.<br />
<br />
Sebilis, HS, Velks, SolB / SolC, Chardok / ChardokB, Nurga, Droga, CT, DN, most LoY zones are such nice upper level zones but usualy deserted beside some farmers now and then...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well, the problem is, most of the pre-65 content just isn't worth doing.<br />
<br />
When was the last time you hunted the hidden valley in Twilight Sea? Spelunked in Dalnir's? Aside from people PL'ing Paladins and farming Fableds, Unrest has been empty on Saryrn for almost a year.<br />
<br />
The problem is, the only stuff &quot;worth doing&quot; is the so-called endgame, so people slap on their belt buckles and do the crazy grind to 65... so they can sit in BoT.<br />
<br />
But yeah, there's a lack of level 65 content, too. It's all hidden behind PITA flags, and even more PITA GoD goodness.<br />
<br />
The problem is, evey pre-65 zone they put out is pretty much just a farm zone for bored 65's, and every high-end oriented zone they put in is either all raid all the time, or is so easy and boring that people whine about it (Like LDoN)<br />
<br />
As a player with a lot of 40-60 characters, I don't want MORE zones... I want what's already there to be made worthwhile. A good start would be to itemize Luclin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">old world/kunark/velious could all use an updating, some of the stuff they take the time to do just cracks me up. <br />
im mistmoor (castle not ldon) you can get the diamondine earring, requires a group of mid-high 30's or a very very good puller to get...it has a lvl 1 focus effect. they took the time to add a focus to it but made it for people to low to even get the item. <br />
