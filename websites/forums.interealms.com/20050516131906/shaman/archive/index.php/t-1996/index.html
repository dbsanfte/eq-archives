<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>AJ0302</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">@lvl 60 who has the highest regen (not including spells/items). was curious since they nerfed iksars and trolls from using AA regen<br />
60 iksar<br />
60 troll<br />
60 ogre with 3 points regen</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>DemonMage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Troll/Iksar have same regen, and 99.9% sure they should have more then an ogre with only 3 extra regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You misunderstood the nerf. <br />
Ogres don't have 3 AA regen points more than Iksars/Trolls now, but every race has the same AA regen(every point gives them all 1 regen/tick regen). <br />
Before the &quot;nerf&quot; Iksars/Trolls were getting 2 points/tick regen per point in the AA skill while other races were getting 1 point/tick.<br />
<br />
So yes, Iksars/Trolls have still the higher regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">OMG! I understand now! I thought they were stopping Iksars/Trolls from GETTING regen AA points... they were getting 2 per point instead of 1? It all makes sense now!<br />
<br />
/em collapses into a state of Regening Happiness</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Farbzilla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">oh boy if it had been a case that troll/iksar got no AA regen i'm sure the troll/lizard comunity would have been up in arms (for whatever good that does)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>AJ0302</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">lol oh ok thanks guys, how much do nekkid 60 trolls regen @ 60 w/ 3 pts. in AA regen</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I still think that Iksars and Trolls who spent points on regen should be given the option of getting those points back.  I'm not sure if GM's have the power to do that or not though.<br />
<br />
Would any of you actually take back your 3 points if you could?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Not me - but then again I got it at 54 so dont have torpor at which point regen becomes much less of an issue, and for the next few levels it is nice to get as much regen as I can (Troll + fungi + regrowth + aa regen = v v nice regen).  At 60 I dont know if I woul dhave bothered with regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yes I would: as a troll with fungi at 56, 6pts regen in exchange for an experience level seemed just about worth it, 3pts regen doesn't.</div></div><hr />
