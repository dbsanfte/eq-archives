<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Any chance on a new forum specifically for Shaman concerns, complaints, suggestions etc?<br />
<br />
Seems the general forum is getting filled up with these posts and its getting a bit fustrating sorting through all of them. I don't mind the discussions, but maybe there could be a forum just for them?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thyramon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Personally, I wouldn't mind seeing a separate forum for this either.  It'd be a nice way to isolate the general negativity of class balancing debates from other issues.</div></div><hr />

<br />
new forums soon enuff !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Slqmdooley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've been a culprit in the fix shaman debate.  I think once GoD goes live and we get what ever we get a lot of this will die down.  I am also a sucker in that I think the people at SONY will give us something.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think a loosely moderated &quot;Rant&quot; type forum would be a good thing here. Might allow people to air some grievances and get the venom out so it doesn't cause a ruckus amongst the entire community.<br />
<br />
Several other class site forums have one, or something similar. It's a proven concept.</div></div><hr />

Thanks Glori :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The Paladin board has a &quot;Class Balancing Forum&quot; for stuff like this.  Keeps the balance arguments out of General, seems to work pretty well over there.</div></div><hr />

I would really love to see this here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">What, pray tell, is &quot;Appropriate&quot;  subject matter for the general forum?  No one reads any of the other forums really, may as well delete what you don't like.</div></div><hr />

How about anything that doesnt incite infectious bitching and whining. Oh and dont forgot suttle sarcasm :p<br />
<br />
People do read the other forums. This is just the most popular. I agree, get the bitching whiney, last forever cause no one can agree arguments out of here. All they do is drive us apart and even worse they are infectious, so next thing you know your joining in on one side or another. Usualy only happens around expansions though.<br />
<br />
Hmm, how about a &quot;Expansion B|tching forum&quot; ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gert Groinwounder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I read quite a few other sites' forums, but mainly stick to the &quot;Rants&quot; section of them.  I think if we have one, it needs to be un-moderated tho.  Moderated Rant forums are kind of like watching edited for TV movies...<br />
