<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So last night, the iksar apparition was up. A group of friends and I headed down to what we thought would be an easy walk in the park.<br />
<br />
Me - 65th shaman<br />
62nd Shaman<br />
63rd monk<br />
61st enchanter<br />
63rd warrior<br />
61st druid<br />
<br />
We had the side assistance of a 56 druid and a 40 rogue, who camped in the main hall after determining he was up. (alts)<br />
<br />
All went well until we began the ritual. VS moved to the center of the room.... and I started pulling the arisens, like it recommended on allakazam.<br />
<br />
Let me tell the others this....<br />
<br />
DON'T DO IT<br />
<br />
First pull went fine, two at a time, we easily killed them.<br />
<br />
Next pull.... 1 iksar arisen..... and VS, still untargetable. Enchanter could not mez or memblur. So we evac'd. (He was hitting for 200)<br />
<br />
VS is still up. Ok, let's return!<br />
<br />
We ran back down..... and the chanter starts to do a &quot;mezz-run&quot;. Well we must have run past one mob that wasn't mezzed, cause next hting we know we have 20 mobs on us.... chanter died, other shaman died, rest evac out.<br />
<br />
Now we're frantic. A 63 necro comes bringing a 65 cleric. We run back in... and run straight into the train of 20 mobs. Necro dies, chanter dies again, but we pull through... kill them all.....<br />
<br />
and vs depops.<br />
<br />
I logged off after we got everyone out. That was perhaps the worst disappointment to date with EQ... I'm mad at myself mostly, as I was the one who ended up pulling VS... the rest was just a comedy of errors trying to recover from the original **** up.<br />
<br />
Soloed thuga this morning. Plan on sologing kraggy tonight. But it's the bones from VS/VSR which are a royal pain as he's permacamped....<br />
<br />
Dunno when I will be able to try again. :(<br />
<br />
*cry*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You need a lot more than one group to do this IMO.  By the time the script is over the entire room will be respawned.  So that is about 8 mobs (most of which can HT) .. probably more, PLUS the quest mobs.  <br />
<br />
You either have to use some type of harmony (enchanter has this but can't remember the name atm)  or a few more enchanters to lock down the adds.<br />
<br />
Also .. pulling the first two is fine like you did. Killing them was your first mistake, just lock them down.  Then wait til the script is over and lock the other two down .. while pulling and slaughtering VS and the adds in the room.  It's definitely not a cake walk and the people in my guild are wary to try this again. <br />
<br />
Might be awhile till I have my 8th :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, now it's personal. Next time we go down, we're bringing the whole guild. I've had nothing but support from my guild over this - even the enchanter who died twice... I am very lucky to have such a great guild.<br />
<br />
But the bones from VS are the big stinking problem, alas.<br />
<br />
Soloed thugga this morning.  Going to solo Kraggy tonight. Never soloed Kraggy before, it'll be a challenge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Good luck harv, this is one of the quests that you have done that i havent even started on yet :P. Let me know how it goes :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Every time I go into KC it seems that someone has just killed VS, his remains, or are about to.  Just hang out one evening in there and I'm sure you will get them.  Try just after a patch or something.  Nobody ever knows what they are for and I'm sure they wouldn't mind a little help with the kill.<br />
<br />
Wish my guild was as supportive .. most of them fear HS for the simple fact that there is no way out except to port or gate .. /sigh<br />
<br />
edit: oh yeah and I soloed Thugga yesterday, he is a blast!  I love being a gobby hehe, I actually scared someone at the giant fort ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Malkaven Maddness</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">same thing happened with my grp.  i had about 4 lvl 65's there and the untargetable vs came after my grp and killed us all.  I was pretty pissed but i did petition and i *DID* get my relic back from a gm.  I told him(acactly what happened), he obviously isnt suppose to get agro and attack you.  It happens mainly cause we pulled the big skeletons gaurding him while he was fighting rile but regaurdless its the whole point on making him untargetable.  he harm touched my group to death as well(chain ht'ed).  i told the gm all this and he gave me it back.  maybe im lucky but imo its a bug.  <br />
<br />
<br />
i redid the quest not to long ago and didnt touch the skeletons and waited till vs killed rile(took like 15 minutes).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You pulled the Arisen BEFORE pulling VS??!!  <br />
/panic<br />
<br />
You want to leave the Arisen doing whatever it is they do and tag VS once he becomes targettable and ONLY then.  Pull the remaining Arisen/room spawn AFTER VS is dead and go turn your stuff in.  You may get a couple adds or none at all from pulling the targettable VS.<br />
<br />
In the 12 minutes it takes VS to become targettable take a coffee break, deal with anything that jumps you, and play gems.  Don't get antsy and try to clear a room with an untargettable aggro mob that will wipe your raid.<br />
<br />
Alla's is an ok resource at times, but they tend to screw up or omit the tiny important details that will kill a quest for you.  The final fight has been posted pretty thoroughly in these forums, but it can be a bit difficult to find the right old posts.<br />
<br />
Gonna see if I can find the good stuff and post a link. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I grabbed this out of an old post by Arasai/miser(sp).  Good info and the &quot;room&quot; to pull to is the far end of the tunnel!! :)<br />
<br />
I cleared out all the mobs in the room and the hallway leading to the crack in the wall. Then everyone went into the room in the hall and I triggered. Takes FOREVER for the script to play out. After triggering this is what happens exactly: <br />
<br />
1) Iksar Apparition turns into Vauris Sathir and sits there for a few mins. (Untargetable) <br />
<br />
2) Vauris Sathir runs into the room with the sparklies and despawns, inturn spawning 4 &quot;arisen&quot; and a swirling mass of bones. <br />
<br />
3) At this point I just waited and let it play out, I didn't pull the arisen. The swirling mass will despawn(it was untargetable) and Rile Sathir and Venril Sathir will spawn(both untargetable. note that VS looks like a mass of bones in this script) For about ten minutes they goof off and do nothing(perhaps some text?) <br />
<br />
4) Venril will kill Rile and become targetable. Have a level 60 pull him to the room, Enc mezzes any Arisen that come with, and you get him slowed ASAP. (If you are 60, pull with malo and slow on inc....it landed first try for me then I landed cripple first try as well) <br />
<br />
5) Remember TO KEEP THE ARISEN MEZZED. They respawn immediately after dying as long as the script is in progress. After the fight is under control, get any arisen that didn't come with VS. Get them mezzed. <br />
<br />
6) After VS dies, a spirit of Rile will spawn on the stage. Take the drop from VS and your cudgel and give it to him. Room should be safe if you have all the Arisen mezzed. (I personally got respawn in the room, if this happens just do the hand in then hurry back to room.) At this point you can kill all the arisen mobs. <br />
<br />
For me, VS dropped the turn in item and the amulet. I kept both just incase it was for a further quest. After VS died, I saw spirit of Rile, but I wasn't in exp group so I couldn't get the trigger item. When the room repopped with normal mobs(the script room) Rile seemed to poof and it freaked me out. After clearing the room again Rile was back and I did the turn in with all the arisen beating on me. (We thought the script was done and I had ****ed it up so we killed them! haha) It's an awesome fight, we had 9-10 level 60's there for it and it wasn't really overkill. Better safe than sorry. <br />
<br />
(Incase you are planning I had the following and it was cake after slowed <br />
60 SHM <br />
60 PAL(with slay3 /drool) <br />
60 MNK <br />
60 ROG <br />
58 CLR <br />
60 NEC <br />
60 WAR <br />
60 ENC <br />
60 DRU<br />

Particularly the 12th post down :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">oh man harvyst.... yeah don't touch ANYTHING in that room until VS becomes targetable :(<br />
<br />
VS is extremely easy with a group of 60's. Bring a cleric and enchanter and a tank of some sort ( 60 monk tanked him for me )<br />
<br />
With a full room pop, after VS becomes targetable, I pulled VS with malo, and 2 of the big skelly dudes added. That was it. Enchanter locked those down, I slowed VS, we beat him into the ground. Its really that easy :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Fancy I've got other people linking my posts now as assistance =P<br />
<br />
If you have any questions on it before you go in, send me a tell sometime.  First time I did it (fight had not been completed by anyone yet), the untargettable did not assist the arisens (maybe just luck), but there were some bugs with it shortly after that, and they made some modifications.  We wiped out due to not knowing the massive triple HT's were coming, couldnt get back in time.<br />
<br />
Second time, since we had no problems the first, we pulled the arisens again.  Bastard came after us this time, so we just let him hit us until he re-popped as targettable.  Took a bit of damage, but we were able to get through it fine.  With PoP levels and AA's, shouldn't have any trouble.<br />
<br />
3rd fight I did (for a friend), I just had everyone stay in the back of the tunnel and wait until he became targettable.  People get pretty impatient and like to go look, just make sure to keep them back.  <br />
<br />
1 group of 60+ is plenty, pull with malo, hit him with slow on inc, and you're golden.  We got 2 arisen adds every time (all 3 tries) that I pulled at 60, I don't know if you can reduce that at higher levels.</div></div><hr />
