<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kegiel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I am a newb shaman... in fact newb caster in general as for the last 3 years I have played a monk/warrior/bard. I have never had to worry about mana for pulls and so now that I am vastly enjoying my shaman over any class I have yet played and I want to perfect my strategy a bit.<br />
<br />
My question to you is at what point is it good to trade more hp vs. spending more mana? Kind of an obscure question so I will give you an example as to what I mean.<br />
<br />
I am currently level 25, and a bit twinked have fungi, Rune Etched Icewurm Fang, and some junk ac/sta/hp/mana equipment (haven't made a magelo for this character yet). My ac is 650.<br />
<br />
I am hunting in the brute caves in WW. It is ok experience and the brutes are pretty easy but the down time between kills is just killing me. Mostly dk blues and an occasional white.<br />
<br />
My current strategy is this:<br />
root  (30m)<br />
envenomed breath (100m)<br />
tainted breath (40m)<br />
clinging darkness (free, troll snare necklace)<br />
root  (30m)<br />
envenomed breath (100m)<br />
tainted breath (40m)<br />
melee till dead.<br />
<br />
I canni down to 80% during the battle at all times to make use of my fungi with regen up at all times. I don't bother slowing them as the root prevents them from hitting me most of the time and I can easily channel roots through their attacks anyways.<br />
<br />
the use of 340m is about 2 bubs of mana for me. And so I am wondering if I have no trouble tanking the brutes where should I start meleeing to maximize kill time. Meleeing while the DoTs are running is pretty effective in killing them. But since canni/fungi is a good source of mana when I have the hp but if I melee early on I get down to say 60% hp in the battle and I wait for a bit before I can pump my mana back up with canni/fungi.<br />
<br />
I know it is a newb question and a matter of testing to find that sweet spot - but I figured I would ask if anyone could enlighten me on lessening downtime and increasing my kill rate.<br />
<br />
thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think I leveled every one of my characters in that Brute cave. What a great spot.<br />
<br />
If I recall correctly, I would pull with slow, stack on a poison dot, and then melee right from the beginning. I certainly didn't have a fungi tunic, so I'm sure you'll be better off tanking than I was (and I don't remember it being a problem). Slow at your level isn't terribly dramatic, but it's enough to help you refresh the poison dot when it wears off, and will lessen the damage you take. I was using a crappy 2hb from CoM, so your REIF is probably as good or better.<br />
<br />
As far as your downtime, are you canni-dancing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jayzan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's hard to solo at that level.  Paldura Caverns is still decent xp at that level and easy to solo.  But it sucks at 26.  You'll just have to suffer through it or get tank to dou with.  AT 29 you get your bearform regen which adds wisdom and hp regen. And at 34 you get a pet and soloing will be A LOT easier...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The trick to it is to use mor hps and less mana... even without the fungi you regain hps faster than mana -thats what makes canni useful.<br />
<br />
Try pulling with slow, meleeing, and tossing in a dot.<br />
<br />
When you have downtime and need to med up, watch for the tick (when you see yor man/hp go up) and time your cannibalization to happen between the pulses.  With a little practice you can be sitting when the tick happens to get the sitting med/heal rate, stand, cast canni, and sit down in time to get the sitting med/heal rate again.  Its very effective, but keeps you busy -having played a bard it should be easy for you.<br />
<br />
Soon you will have a pet.  Shaman pets are not capable of tanking for you, but are more of a longterm dot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kegiel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah I do that canni jig and keep my hp at 80% when not meleeing. So maybe if I were to slow/dot/melee it would speed things up. I find that i have to keep (root|snare) up at all times on the brutes because of the pathing issues. All but two of the brute spawns immediately head for the nearest wall to step through when they start running. I just find when I do meleeing from the beginning that my hp are down far enough that I can't canni as much though it is a quicker kill but more down time recovering hp's to canni to recover mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I don't know what the pathing is like down there since the changes, but it used to be heinous. Sometimes when the fleed, they would warp through the walls and under the world. Then, after they regenned up a bit, they would start hitting you but you couldn't hit them back.<br />
<br />
Tons of fun.<br />
<br />
If that still happens, you can run out of the caves and into the lake. The Brute should eventually pop up in the water close to you, where you can finish it off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kegiel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Interesting... I hadn't tried running into the lake but they all love to get under the world though I haven't had an instance of them still attacking me (used to happen a lot when mobs went under the world, but I haven't had it happen in a long time). I will try the lake idea when my root/snare runs out at a bad time. Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Toshizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Simple.<br />
<br />
Target, slow, dot, melee, refresh 1 dot, rinse repeat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Eriadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'd pull with slow, and for the best XP (number of kills/hour as well as ZEM), I'd go live in SolA for a while.  Permafrost is also nice.</div></div><hr />

My little Shaman on Stromm is now 29 because of those monkeys in WW and that's how I did it even with the crap gear she's wearing. <br />
<br />
Those caves have horrendous pathing but you can get them out of the cave, even if they fall under the world, as long as they're still chasing you and not doing the death march. Each time one decided to poof on me I simply ran out of the caves and went into the late and the monkey would pop in the water.</div></div><hr />
