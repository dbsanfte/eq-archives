<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aneron Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The paradox of our time in history is that we have taller buildings but <br />
shorter tempers, wider freeways, but narrower viewpoints. We spend more, <br />
but have less. We buy more, but enjoy less. We have bigger houses and <br />
smaller families, more conveniences, but less time. We have more degrees but <br />
less sense, more knowledge, but less judgment, more experts, yet more <br />
problems, more medicine, but less wellness. <br />
 <br />
We drink too much, smoke too much, spend too recklessly, laugh too <br />
little, drive too fast, get too angry, stay up too late, get up too tired, read <br />
too little, watch TV too much, and pray too seldom. We have multiplied our <br />
possessions, but reduced our values. We talk too much, love too seldom, <br />
and hate too often. We've learned how to make a living, but not a life. <br />
 <br />
We've added years to life not life to years. <br />
 <br />
We've been all the way to the moon and back, but have trouble crossing <br />
the street to meet a new neighbor. We conquered outer space but not inner <br />
space.<br />
 <br />
We've done larger things, but not better things. We've cleaned up the <br />
air, but polluted the soul. We've conquered the atom, but not our prejudice. <br />
 <br />
We write more, but learn less. We plan more, but accomplish less. We've <br />
learned to rush, but not to wait. We build more computers to hold more <br />
information, to produce more copies than ever, but we communicate less <br />
and less. These are the times of fast foods and slow digestion, big men and <br />
small character, steep profits and shallow relationships. These are the <br />
days of two incomes but more divorce, fancier houses, but broken homes. These <br />
are days of quick trips, disposable diapers, throwaway morality, one night <br />
stands, overweight bodies, and pills that do everything from cheer, to <br />
quiet, to kill. <br />
 <br />
It is a time when there is much in the showroom window and nothing in <br />
the stockroom. A time when technology can bring this letter to you, and a <br />
time when you can choose either to share this insight, or to just hit delete. <br />
Remember, spend some time with your loved ones, because they are not <br />
going to be around forever. <br />
 <br />
Remember, say a kind word to someone who looks up to you in awe, because <br />
that little person soon will grow up and leave your side. Remember, to <br />
give a warm hug to the one next to you, because that is the only treasure you <br />
can give with your heart and it doesn't cost a cent. <br />
 <br />
Remember, to say, &quot;I love you&quot; to your partner and your loved ones, but <br />
most of all mean it. A kiss and an embrace will mend hurt when it comes from <br />
deep  inside of you. <br />
 <br />
Remember to hold hands and cherish the moment for someday that person <br />
will not be there again. Give time to love, give time to speak and give time <br />
to share the precious thoughts in your mind. <br />
 <br />
To all my friends in my life, thanks for being MY FRIEND!</div></div><hr />
