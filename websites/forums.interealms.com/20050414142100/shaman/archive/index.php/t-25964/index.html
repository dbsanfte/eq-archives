Server Merges <br />
<br />
<br />
On March 22, 2005, we will begin the process of merging some of the EverQuest servers. As we have seen from the recent success of the Zek merger, combining some of the EQ worlds is beneficial for players?Eexperience. In fact, we have been pleasantly surprised to find that the new Zek server now has a higher population than the four combined servers had prior to that merger. We hope that by merging some of our lower population servers with a higher population server, we will continue to enhance your gameplay experience <br />
<br />
Merging Servers <br />
<br />
On March 22nd, Antonius Bayle will merge with Kane Bayle and will retain the name Antonius Bayle. <br />
<br />
On March 23rd, Bristlebane will merge with Solusek Ro and will retain the name Bristlebane. <br />
<br />
We understand that server identity is important to our customers and we will be integrating server titles into the title system to allow you to display your server of origin, should you desire to do so. <br />
<br />
Complimentary Character Move <br />
<br />
Shortly after each merger is complete, we will allow all customers affected by a merge a one-time, complimentary character move to the server of their choice. For each customer with an account on a newly-merged server who request such a move, all characters associated with that customer?fs account will be transferred to the selected server. All characters will bring their items with them in the transfer. <br />
<br />

I thought Sol Ro and BB had huge pops?<br />
<br />
FWIW, I wish Blizzard would offer server moves. Their hardware is crap and my server is so overpopulated it isn't funny. (And neither are the crappy side effects)</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's funny. They totally destroyed pvp servers by merging all the retards back into mainstream EQ. <br />
<br />
Thank you Sony for making the last 5 1/2 years of building Vallon Zek into an honorable pvp server a total waste of time.</div></div><hr />

According to this announcement, one of these 2 servers does in fact have a huge population.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm surprised they are merging the English Euro servers so quickly. you would have though that they would wait until the first month of the Euro release of Wow had taken place and see how the land lies then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jeis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">BristleBane at one time was massively overpopulated and had a huge player base, was also most unstable server hence being nicknamed BristleBroke</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Merging a smaller server into a larger server makes the most sense. If the servers were ranked by populations from 1 - 20 (20 being the highest), merging 1 and 16, 2 and 15, 3 and 14, 4 and 13, etc, would bring all the servers to the level of 17. This is probably the formula they are using, it makes the most sense. <br />
<br />
Personally, I think they should wait another 3-5 weeks, for the effect of DoN on former players to be more accurately shown overall. DoN could bring back a few &quot;1 monthers&quot; or it could pull a few back for longer. Hard to say without giving DoN a solid 6-8 weeks to filter out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jeis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Same can be said for giving WoW another couple months see if the people that left find it boring and if Blizzard do announce a path forward.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I guess if they merge now and then later, things become crowded again, they can just use the old server hardware to open up a new server.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Character Limitations <br />
<br />
If you have more than eight characters in total on two servers being merged together, only the first eight characters (in alphabetical order) will be displayed after the merge. Characters other than the eight displayed characters will not be available for selection until currently displayed characters are deleted. All characters from both servers will remain on your account provided that the character was not below level 10 and had not been logged in within the last six months.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What happens if you haven't logged in for 6 months ?  I am currently traveling the world and by the time of the merger it will have been about 6 months since I have logged in (Back to play again at the end of April)<br />

Edit:<br />
Arhh reread it and its *ONLY* characters below level 10 who haven't logged in in 6 months who will be deleted, not all characters who haven't logged in in 6 months</div></div><hr />

This can still be a problem. I will be deploying for another year in May. As I tradeskill, I have lots of mules under level 10 with scads and scads of tradeskill items. I can log onto all of my mules before I go, but if SOE decides to wait until November-December to merge Quellious, I am seriously screwed.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, I am STILL trying to finish getting a situation resolved where I logged in in January for the first time in 11 months (again due to deployment) only to see that all of my stacks of items on all characters were reduced to one item each on all three of my accounts. I cannot seem to e-mail them and as I have to log on to use the petition system - not easy, as I am still deployed for another week - resolving it has been a painful, painful process.<br />
<br />
This is making me wonder if I should have just sold my two level 65 accounts before I deployed and bagged EQ.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">it's pretty easy to get to lvl 11...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Rishathra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">it's pretty easy to get to lvl 11...<br />
<br />
True. <br />
<br />
On the other hand, redeploying from one zone, PCSing with family, and deploying to another combat zone 65 days later, I really, really don't feel like spending time I will have to play PLing up the 20 mules I have spread across three accounts. <br />
<br />
And frankly, with my current experience, I am not confident that I would avoid problems even then - the stacking bug, for example,  hit all of my caharacters including my 65 cleric and SK and is still not fully resolved. <br />
<br />
I find it hard to be rational about this, so perhaps i should move my comments to the rant section.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Forget it.  Put the situation out of your mind, resolve it when you get back.  You have a lot on your plate right now and EQ is just a game, not worth your anxiety.  It can be hard to snag the right ear, but I've found that GMs can be very helpful when they latch onto an issue.  Sound out your situation whenever you get back to the states, take action from there :)<br />
<br />
Stay safe, Rishathra.  God speed you home to your family.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Denorea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Rishathra~<br />
<br />
Hoping upon hope they dont' merge Quel at all.  From what I've heard we were the 2nd most populated server as of mid-january.  Hoping that will keep us safe from a merger.  Good luck to you, and I'm keeping my fingers crossed for the both of us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Honestly, I am willing to bet SOE would be very flexible in this type of situation. Buy another set of &quot;Platinum&quot; disks so you have a fresh account with a 1-free month, have them move all the &quot;lower&quot; guys there, use the free month to strip out the mules. The Platinum disks are a reasonable investment anyway, especially if you have multiple machines or move around.<br />
<br />
But like Brohg said, not til you get the mor important things taken care of, like coming home safe.</div></div><hr />
