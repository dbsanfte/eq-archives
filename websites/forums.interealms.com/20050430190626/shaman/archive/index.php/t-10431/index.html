<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Journy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I could have added my thoughts to another post, but felt that wasn't what I wanted to make my point.<br />
<br />
What's the biggest &quot;single&quot; issue to you? Personally, if all they did was lower the aggro on my poison dots, so I could cast one after I slowed, and nuke some, without getting to be the mobs dinner guest, I'd be fairly happy. As it stands, I think some spells, particularly the poison dots, are just to much aggro for what they do. If I don't have a Knight tanking for me, I constantly feel I must hold back, a lot. <br />
<br />
The other thing I'd like to see, and I know I'm not alone here ;), is for a hastend canni 5. Take between 30 and 60 seconds off the current 3 minute timer. Whatever you feel is &quot;balanced&quot;.<br />
<br />
Now there is two simple, easy to code fixes, that won't step on anyones toes for the most part. So now, I'm curiopus to know, what the &quot;one &quot;single'&quot; issue you'd like to see fixed, or altered the most? Keep in mind to be reasonable, Shamans are stuck as a jack of all trades class, nuking like a Wizard or healing like a Cleric, isn't going to happen. Nor should it.</div></div><hr />

Good God, I hope you ARE alone.  Can V is, in my opinion, the single best AA skill of any class in the entire game.  The only one that even comes close to holding a candle is the Rogues' SoS.  Our mana regen far outstrips anyone in the game with Can IV and Can V, with Torpor/Quiescence.  And this includes the #1 mana hoes, Necros.  To put in an AA to make us e\more godlike mana than we already have would blind the other classes to any issues that we have and make them beg for the nerf stick.<br />
<br />
If you want to hasten something, how about Radient cure?  Why not change Virulent Paralysis to be less resistance as well as longer duration, when you train the higher levels?  How about an AA that doubles Karagg's Crap Healing?  but NOT Hastened Cann V!</div></div><hr />

poison dot aggro is manageable, just gotta be careful<br />

nothing else i would really complain about besides spectrals/spells, which will never be changed most likely</div></div><hr />

Do you know why we have so much agro? Its because we have more mana to blow then any other class in the game.<br />
<br />
We can maloxx, slow, cripple, every pull and continue to keep the melles buffed. Now your upset because you can't throw a dot onto that big pile of agro?<br />
<br />
Do you know why druids don't have a problem with agro? Its because they have to limit how much mana they use, they can't just pile as much as they can onto a mob withought having to worry about if they will have enough for the next pull.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd like to see less poison dot agro as well.  Maloxx creates almost no agro and most shaman that I know don't cripple as it creates massive agro doubled with slow and its effectiveness in most situations is minimal at best.  So that about narrows it down to slow as far as agro and I still can't throw a poison dot in until 50% if I'm lucky and on most pop mobs they'll be dead in under 20 seconds at 50%.<br />
<br />
So as far as damage that leaves us with subpar nukes or very situational rains.  I'd love to be able to add to dps by dotting at 80 or 90% like most other classes.  I'm not talking about loading up the dots at 90% but most classes can get at least one dot off early in the fight and not worry about agro if they are standing.  I'd also love VP and RC to be a little more effective at later levels.  So I guess my list would be reduce poison dot agro to be more in line with other dots, make VP a little more reliable and bring RC's recast down to 2 minutes and then maybe 60-90 seconds for the 3rd level.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't care about DOT aggro, I only dot when I solo, if I'm in a group I'm chain nuking after slow.<br />
<br />
Umm, put some of our rare spells on vendors like you did for Beastlords. and nerf their 65% slow while you're at it :)<br />

<br />
I don't cripple at all.  I certainly don't malo every pull unless its a mob I know will likely resist.  And I most certainly don't buff melees every single pull,  maybe a Feral every so often, and SLTW, but those are not single pull spells.<br />
<br />
Its all about mana management and agro management.  If theres no need to do those debuffs then I can live without that agro.<br />
<br />
Do you know why druids don't have a problem with agro? Its because they have to limit how much mana they use, they can't just pile as much as they can onto a mob withought having to worry about if they will have enough for the next pull. <br />
<br />
Its not mana issues.  It is a case of agro, its pretty evident if you've ever watched druids in action.  their spells do agro quite a bit.<br />
<br />
As to faster canni5 I'm all for it.  I don't know that I would really go for a huge decrease, considering it can be considered overpowered in that event.  Just makes less work for my fingers.<br />
<br />
Would dearly love an AOE form of malo, even if it wasn't a large debuff.  Dot agro would be nice if it was reduced some, but it doesn't mean as much to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Journy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Well, not sure we &quot;blow away&quot; every other class for mana regen now. Necros getting 50 a tick, without having to take the time out we do to canni, might have overtaken us on that. Having the cast time reduced would probably make other classes hate us, true.<br />
<br />
As for the dot aggro, if we can't use them other then to solo, and soloing post 60 isn't all that viable really, why have them? Would doing 100 dps &quot;really&quot; be that overpowering? Especially since it's not everyday that there is only one Shaman present at an event.<br />
<br />
I would love it if they gave us an upgrade to Kraggs mending, but something tells me the Druids aren't going to let that go without a fight. Though giving us the ghetto CH they originally had planned for us that is about Tunares renewal quality, would give us some more options and help with the rather large (IMO) problem that is Shaman stackablility. Maybe the Druids would let it go with no gripes, maybe not.</div></div><hr />

And I certainly think a lot of Shamans don't realize that we have it better then a lot of other classes. But there are still a few things that would be nice if they would fine tune some.<br />
<br />
To me, lowering our aggro to some extent would be a nice fix. They wouldn't take away the aggro mind you, just fine tune it so the dots are more of an option to us. I wouldn't mind if they tossed out that possibility and gave us the ability to actually be in a CH chain instead. But not sure the other two Priests are going to be ok with that. Would have to be set up right to not step on toes of course.<br />

ONLY Necromancer have better mana reg rate than us, however, necromancer is not pupolar in group.   They don't slow, haste, heal, buff as a shaman can provide to a group.<br />

I also want a group shrink spell that I can MGB so that I don't have to get passed in and out of groups at raids to shrink people.  Thank god that last week one of our necros switched mains to a 57 beastlord.  I make him do it, now.<br />
<br />
Poison dot aggro does need to be decreased.  If I have a warrior tanking for me, I always take aggro when I slow.  If I use a poison dot, I have aggro for a very long time.  I am happy they finally took the DD portion out of our spells in PoP, but it would be nice if they went back and removed it from all our other dots, as well.  I still use two poisons when I am soloing.<br />
<br />
I think we need an AA that makes canni4 hit us harder and give back more mana.  3 stages (cost 3 - 6 - 9) and it multiplies the damage and mana by 1.5x, 2x, and 2.5x, respectively.  This would increase our mana regen by a bit, but more importantly, it would give us more time to cast other spells.  In a good, fast pulling group where I am the only healer and slower, I can keep up.  However, I am constantly cannibalizing.  Any time that I am not casting malo, turgurs, or kraggs, I am casting cannibalize.  If I take a moment to type a tell or say something in chat, I start to fall behind.  This is really annoying and causes burnout after doing it for a few hours.  After a 6 hour session in a 5-melee group, my brain is numb and my eyes feel like they are about to fall out of their sockets (however, I have gained 4aa, which makes it worth it I guess :))<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>doedel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">My improvement-wish in short: Change the AEs.<br />
<br />
I am quite comfortable with my control (slow, VP, root) , buff and healing capabilities.<br />
My biggest issue nowadays is the pathetic damage output in the Highend game (PoP) in comparison to every other class. <br />
<br />
Normally a one-group-situation encounter in PoP goes like this:<br />
Mob is pulled, Shaman cast Malo, Shaman cast Slow. <br />
While the tanks and nukers finish the mob i have the following options:<br />
- spot healing<br />
- dot mob with Spear of Fate<br />
- dot mob with poison <br />
- dot mob with disease<br />
- damage mob with AE<br />
- nuke mob cold/poison<br />
<br />
Spot healing is rarely needed because normally there is always a Main Healer in the group<br />
<br />
Spear dot wont do full damage because most of the time the mob is dead before the last and biggest damage-tick of the dot resolves<br />
<br />
Disease dots may do big damage in theory but they take too much time until they do full damage; as with Spear dot the mob normally is dead before the spell resolves.<br />
<br />
Poison dots are imbalanced at the moment: There is <br />
- Bane of Nife (1698 dmg); <br />
- Ancient Scourge of Nife (1955 dmg); only available to Uberguild-Shaman<br />
- Blood of Saryrn (2240 dmg); L 65 spell, so only available to Uberguild-Shaman<br />
<br />
So 99 % of the Shamans only have L 56 Bane of Nife as poison dot; its big drawback is the high aggro you gain (thats because of poison counters)<br />
Dmg/Mana Ratio: 3.99<br />
<br />
Nukes:<br />
L 62 Spear of Torment 675 dmg for 275 mana; ratio 2.45<br />
L 64 Velium Strike 925 dmg for 300 mana; 3.08<br />
<br />
Damage is not that bad but also misses a real &quot;punch&quot;; every other caster or priest class has better nukes. Also the casting and recasting times are quite high. (7.8 secs for Velium strike, ugh)<br />
<br />
This leaves the AEs:<br />
L 55 Torrent of poison 2x2 or 3x1 rains with 540 dmg each; ratio 4.26 (3 hits); 5.68 (4 hits)<br />
L 64 Tears or Saryrn 2x2 or 3x1 rains for 650 dmg each; ratio 4.33 (3 hits); 5.77 (4 hits)<br />
<br />
Small problems with the AE:<br />
- It can damage yoursefl if you are not careful<br />
- its aera is location bound not mob bound, so if mob moves or flees it can miss hits<br />
<br />
BIG issues with the AEs:<br />
<br />
- RESISTS! Very often one or all rains are fully resisted. Even with Malo on the mob. No other Shaman damage spell is resisted that much.<br />
<br />
- You cannot kill mobs with the shaman AEs. I am very sure that there is a piece of code which prevents mobs from taking damage from the AE rains when they are below a certain amount/percentage of HPs.<br />
<br />
Ways to improve AEs:<br />
- Get rid of that AE-rain-wont-dmg-wounded-mob feature<br />
- Add ways to lower the resists either by changing the spell itself or by introducing an according AA skill or by new focus items/effects.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Think now days most everyone can get up to 4.8k with ease it would seem, well anyone who would be 65(which would be req I assume for level3) Would rather the ability for can5 than can4 seeing as most shaman that have can5(that I know anyways) don't even bother to mem can4 <br />
<br />

<br />
Yeah, that would be a real benefit to the shaman class as a whole. Why not just make shamans as uber as you have a button they can press to get whatever AA they need? Or maybe a DT button? But only for the ubers!<br />

<br />
Upping the poison/disease counters on BoU/BoS. Having these two removed by one cast of RadiantCure1 sucks.<br />
<br />
AE malo.<br />
<br />
Point blank slow spell, or a targetable tigirs that hits more than 4 targets.<br />

None of which will ever happen of course.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Poison DOT aggro is fine, apply common sense. In most groups they don't run full duration, just nuke instead if you feel the need. With Velium Strike, this is finally reasonably effective/efficient.<br />
<br />
I'd like a group haste myself, or at least a faster casting version of SLTW. I can't stand casting speed on melees, annoys the hell out of me.<br />
<br />
The AE Malo would rule as well, although I'm not sure I'd have a whole lot of use for it, and it'd likely cost a gang of mana. And knowing VI, it would prolly drop in PoTime only on every second day of the third leapyear as a rare drop from a rare spawn with a PH. Just because they love us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Reduced aggro on poison DoTs would be nice, and I don't think its imbalancing. Reduced resists on Torrent of Poison would be appropriate too, it resists far more than any other spell.<br />
<br />
I think our canni capabilities are just fine.<br />
<br />
I do think shaman are somewhat useless on unslowable or heavily mitigating mobs, and an upgraded cripple spell to debuff these guys str/dex/ac some more would be a welcome addition.<br />
<br />
Haste is a PITA. Please give us a group haste, with a reasonable duration (e.g. 30-40 mins) - 50% haste would be reasonable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">(1) Cannibalize is more and more a non issue in 2 sec boss fights. Mana regen is not the powerful tool that once was during Luclin. For this, give us upgraded heals. I never hit Cannibalize during a Saryrn fight and I was chain nuking Velium Strike. And in much longer fights like VT, I seldom need to use it. The passive manaregen (VoQ and CoM) is more than enough. Maybe one shot of Canni 5, all this time I am nuking or DoTting.<br />
<br />
(2) Slowing is again, a non issue with everyone and his mother mitigating slow. For this, give us upgraded heals.<br />
<br />
(3) For the love of (insert the God you beleive in here) fix the goddamn aggro from poison DoTs. Why the hell do I have to tank a bloody XP mob after one single slow AND one poison DoT when tank is wielding Bloodfrenzy and Blade of Carnage?<br />
<br />
(4) Remove post 60 stat buffs. No really, they are utter crap. Infusion of Spirit takes care of clerics who like to melee for 0.4 DPS, and Focus takes care of the rest. Why the plethora of other useless stat buffs?<br />
<br />
(5) Updrade to poison nuke would be better than shorter cast time only from 54 to 61 version. 750-800 damage range would be ideal.<br />
<br />
<br />
Those are my opinions only, if you disagree, feel free to call me a whiner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">But Zorlac!  I don't want to heal!  I'm a shaman not a cleric!  <br />
LMFAO!  <br />
My statement sound absurd to anyone else? <br />
<br />
lvl 61 poison nuke needs to do more dmg imho.  <br />
<br />
Stronger heals would be nice as well and give us a better contribution to PoP fights.<br />
<br />
Poison counter aggro needs to go away.  <br />
<br />
post 60 stat buffs to str and dex need to go away.<br />
<br />
Fix those and I'm fairly happy.  Not that I wouldn't enjoy a group shrink spell too that I could MGB.  Not like two other classes can't also cast shrink (war, bst), so we might as well be the best at it.  More of a convenience thing than anything tho.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Make Ferine Avatar 60 and stick it on a vendor.  Ok, that's not happening, but I'd love that mucho.  It's what Avatar ought to have been.<br />
<br />
I am fine with the aggro on poison dots - it's good to have an aggro tool like that.  Sure it's got downsides, but there must be checks on just massive manadumping - or even situational spell use.  <br />
<br />
AE slow (not 4 targets)<br />
AE malxx (not 4 targets)<br />
<br />
Get rid of all 60+ stat buffs, except stamina I suppose.  Frankly I'd be fine losing that too as part of the trade off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Dread</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I want to be the best at something.  It seems VI thinks that we are primary slowers ( and punishes us signifigantly for having the ability ), but then makes our slow only marginally better than other classes, then pimps it out to all kinds of classes.  With mitigation, we lose even the very slight edge we normally have.  If I could say that in every situation, I am the best slower, I would be happy with my other abilities.  But unfortunately, I cannot. <br />
<br />
Here are some suggestions that I made in another thread<br />
Slowing: <br />
1. Let turgurs scale up to 80% at level 65. <br />
2. Make more mobs magic immune and give us a slow that is at least 50% that works off another resistance. Poison is fine. Don't give poison slows to other classes. Retune many of the mitigating mobs to MR mobs ( or unslowable by magic but not MR ). <br />
<br />
possible fix:  I have an idea that would address points 1 and 2. Get rid of that crappy alchemy master BS, and give us an aa that has 5 levels. Each level cost 2 points, and you could train onces each level 61-65. Each point would increases our slow% by 1%. This would allow us to get turgurs to 80% and grummus to 45%.<br />
<br />
Other: maybe not both, but 1 of the following 2 <br />
3. Adequate healing. Give us a quick casting direct heal. Something like 2k hp heal that takes 3-4 seconds. It is rediculous that my best heal takes 10 seconds and only heals 1.5 red bubbles on a tank. <br />
4. More DPS. Rains have decent dps, but are too situational. Bigger direct nukes would be much more useful in todays quick encounters. <br />
<br />

Oh.. one more thing for the wish list.  a 60% group haste that lasts 30 minutes.  I hate giving up a spell gem just so I can keep my group hasted.</div></div><hr />
