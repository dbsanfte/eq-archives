<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm hardly a pro, and honestly expect to get more tips out of this thread than I'm going to give.<br />
<br />
But in the interests of not being a schmuck, I'll stick in what I can think of, that might help those logging in for the first time.<br />
<br />
* If you're frustrated with the mass crowds in the newbie area, explore a little to the sides.  There are generally one or two easily found areas to get the quest critters, and then some more isolated areas with the same stuff where you can hunt in relative peace, with the other few people who looked for a path less traveled.<br />
<br />
* If you're going to take up a tradeskill, do it early, and take the complementary tradeskill as your 2nd skill.  Such as blacksmith/mining, leathercrafting/skinning.  You can discard any tradeskill at any time (losing all skill point advances) so don't worry about taking the 'wrong' one.  By taking it early, you'll avoid having to come back and slaughter/harvest in greenie areas to catch your skill up (higher level tradeskill harvesting can't be performed without meeting the minimum skill level).<br />
<br />
* Remember that it's beta, and your characters can and will be wiped.  So you might have more fun rolling up a less popular race (horde seems less popular than alliance) if you're getting frustrated with the crowds.<br />
<br />
* Exploration is also fun, and gives pretty impressive exp at lower levels.<br />

Looking forward to hearing some others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">&quot;can be wiped&quot; possible!<br />
&quot;will be wiped&quot; uncertain.<br />
<br />
Character wipe is the number one question about the game right now and it is on it's 7th offical discussion thread with hundreds of pages of posts on the subject on the WoW beta boards.<br />
<br />
It's fairly frustrating simply not knowing what Blizzard's final decision regarding this is yet.<br />
<br />
Two tips!:<br />
<br />
Especially if you play with friends try to divy up the various tradeskills you all do (though I do highly recommend that you at least take the base gathering skill and the associated crafting skill as a pair:  ie herbalism and alchemy)  Tradeskills are VERY useful and worth doing and imo fun.  Save any and all linen or wool that you get.  Don't sell it to a vendor.  Use it to tailor or make bandages or MOST IMPORTANTLY!@!@@@!#!#<br />
<br />
OMG!  as a newbie there is NO SINGLE ITEM more valuable to you than....  <br />
<br />
<br />
a bag.  space for items is at a premium as a newbie!  <br />
<br />
Saving items for your friends who tradeskill also applies to light leather, copper ore, and the various herbs.<br />
<br />
Second tip:  If you take up fishing it has anti macro  coding.  You dont just press your magic fishing hotkey.  It is interactive!  When your lure bobber bobs you have to click it to catch a fish.<br />
<br />
The bag tip was sort of a ninja bonus 3rd tip in the middle i guess =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Do not fool yourself into thinking they will NOT wipe everything. They have stated that if they announce a wipe people stop playing. So they won't tell you but once retail hits I see only ONE option for NOT wiping. Turning the closed beta server into what eq now has as a test server.<br />
So they keep testing on that server but the server won't matter :P<br />
<br />
If that does not happen than u can put your money on a wipe. Hey we get to play a game for free. Don't panic. Enjoy the ride.<br />
<br />
<br />
Soulstorm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">So they won't tell you but once retail hits I see only ONE option for NOT wiping. Turning the closed beta server into what eq now has as a test server.<br />
They have sated they are considering keeping the closed beta accounts alive (for those that purchase retail by a certain date).  They haven't officially stated anything about the open beta except:<br />
We are still formulating our plans for the characters from the open beta and will provide more information in the near future.<br />
And in the 34 page, Part Seven thread about Wipe vs Not Wipe, Blizzard has made one post - the first one:<br />
Please use this thread to discuss a possible character wipe between beta and retail. <br />
<br />
Please note I do not have a decision to give you. As soon as I do, I'll let you know, believe me. Thank you for your patience in the meantime. <br />
I suspect they've decided, but their making everyone think they have a part in the decision.  Good ol' Blizzard!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Good tips so far.  One thing that I disliked when I first started to play was that names didn't show up unless you clicked on the npc.  You can see names without clicking on the npc by turning on the NPC Names option in interface options.  Another useful tip and one I would think most people would know by now is to ask city guards for directions.  Their directions are great and they even mark it on the map for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Weapons training (i.e. &quot;Why can't I use swords??):  this one had me scratching my head.  The trainers are only in the major cities, and when you find a major city, you will know it.  Each trainer only does certain weapons, and it is not cheap.<br />
<br />
I fully expect a wipe, although there would be less newbie zone crowd nightmares if they didn't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">hehe the newbie zone nightmare can suck heeh think of poor old fipps. There was a lineup of like 7 people waiting to kill him :)<br />
<br />
/1 Noob1 Where is Fipps i need to kill him?<br />
/1 Noob2 Pick a number :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Hehe i skipped that quest.<br />
<br />
The wipe will happen they do not want to announce it. I mean c'mon think of it this way they are saying they DON&quot;T KNOW ANYTHING at this point and they are THINKING about it. Like they are thinking about the monthly fee? You  are trying to tell me that a decision has not been reached? The decision is made already. Both on wipe and fee. The reason why they are not announcing it is because of the negative coments they will get.<br />
<br />
WHAT ? 14.95 a MONTH? OUTRAGE I AM NOT BUYING THIS BLIZZARD FU etc<br />
Or...WIPE? I worked so hard to beta test this (play for free) and you are gonna wipe my character. that's it I am not buying this game FU blizzard u suxxorz.<br />
<br />
See?<br />
There is no doubt in my mind that they made the decision. Not the whole team is working on quests and server stablity and content. Blizzard has people to take care of finances and do some math for them. Both decisions are made. Just can't be &quot;officially&quot; announced.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sousltorm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Another tip then:<br />
<br />
On any quest where you have to kill Named X and return his Head/Paw etc...  quests like this give SHARED drops...<br />
<br />
so a line of single people standing around don't understand it and newbies often refuse groups because of it.  Five people with the quest to kill Badguy and loot his Head all group together and kill him, all can loot the head.<br />
<br />
As far as the wipe issue, while the vast majority of us  might expect and be in favor of a wipe, the problem is  the PERCEPTION that Blizzard is creating regarding the issue.  Somewhere in my gut I fear they might not wipe...  because they could easily wipe or move the old Closed Beta toons to a Test server and roll the ST/OB servers to retail.  Yes newbie zones will be madness in retail with a wipe but I do think it'd be for the best.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sousltorm<br />
<br />
Even if there is a line to kill the mob, and people aren't grouping to do it, they only take about 1 minute to respawn, which is nice.<br />
<br />
I really hope they wipe everyone.  Start clean.  The crowding will not be as bad as people think if they were to wipe the servers.  When it goes to retail, it will not have the same number of people as in OB because lots of people are playing right now just because it is free.  Also, they will not have so many people jammed into limited server space for stress testing purposes.  They will be more evenly distributed across more servers.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Use the ingame mailboxes! With such limited storage space available and very few auction houses it can be beneficial to have a secondary character you can mail stuff to that you cant use just now or maybe want to try to auction off.<br />
<br />
As long as you dont click on the messages in the inbox they will stay there for 29 (or something like that) days.<br />
<br />
Only slightly negative thing is that mails with items attached take a while to show up - probably around 30-40 minutes. Cash-mails get transferred instantly as far as I know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I want a wipe too, I'm just screwing around with my talent points spending it on what benefits me now.  I could always respec but damn its expensive.</div></div><hr />

Leathermaking can make bags to...but the recipe is acquired via quest...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">the bags from leatherworking are barely worth it.  they are Kodo hide bags from a quest in Thunder Bluff.  first you have to fork over a pile of light leather to complete the quest.  then to be able to create the bags you need like 3 thin Kodo hides... well you don't get them from skinning a Kodo, they are a rare drop from Kodo =(<br />
<br />
Yes it is an option but not a strong one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Wow, guys, some fun stuff in here.<br />
<br />
All this talk of bags reminds me of another way to get em.  My current character (mage) took up tailoring to make her armor and got INCREDIBLE fast skill progression by auctioning any time she was in a city or village &quot;making linen/wool bags, just supply your own linen/wool&quot;.  Absolutely raced up those levels.  I lost some money on thread, but not enough to make a difference.  My characters without tailoring usually just auction to see if anyone will make a bag if I supply the components.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Uthgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Tip#1 find 2 trade skills and learn them at level 1. I did and it was a natural progression while leveling my character. Personally I selected 1 gathering and 1 main trade skill. Trade skills are actually fun and rewarding and the sooner you start the sooner you benefit from them.<br />
<br />
Tip#2 Learn all the secondary skills such as Fishing, First aid and Cooking. My main is a hunter and my bear pet likes to eat allot! With fishing and cooking I am able to keep my bear happy and fed without constantly going back to town for supplies.<br />
<br />
Tip#3 Do all the quests available at your starting location. Some class specific skills are only available through quests. Allot of people are spamming the ooc channel on how to tame pets but if they had done there class trainer quests it would be obvious.<br />
<br />
Tip#4 The silver exclamation point over a NPC means they have a quest but you’re not of sufficient level. Visit him again when you reach a higher level.</div></div><hr />

Aye, my wife did tailoring and she would go back to the newbie areas and sell linen bags for a couple sp each.  Not a huge money maker, but it is a good business (bags sell for 5 sp from vendors).  But yeah, I think that you can supply linen and stuff and get them made for free pretty much from some nice folks :).<br />

<br />
You cannot learn your tradeskills until level 5 fyi.  They basically force you into collision with the trainers at around level 5-6 when you have finished with the newbie zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">You can share quests with group members.<br />

Once a person has been invited into your group, pull up your quest log and you can hit a button so that other members of the group can start the quest (without having to go back to the quest NPC).<br />
<br />
Doesn't work on all quests, since some are race/class specific, and other quests require earlier quests to be completed... but it's helped a couple of times.</div></div><hr />

Actually, its not that many light leather ..and I got more than enuff thin kodo leather to make the 5 bags I have just in the time it took me to find that damn Ara'chea mob...heh...took me forever to find him...<br />
<br />
I dont think 12 light leather is too much for about 800 exp and a bag recipe...<br />
<br />
Am hoping they add more high end leather containers in, but just mentioned the kodo bags because it beat buying the bags from the vendors or hunting up a tailor</div></div><hr />

You had far better luck than I did, the Kodo component was rare as hell for me (this was months ago) so maybe the drop rate is better now!</div></div><hr />

Ask a guard!<br />
<br />
Hehe, yeah, but that question can be valid really.  For example, starting out a troll that can use axes and throwing axes, the guard in the newbie city won't tell me where to go to train guns/swords/maces or even 2-handed axes.  You need to go to the Elite Weapons Trainers in the big cities like Org (2-hand axes/bows), Undercity (polearms/swords/2-hand swords), and Thunder Bluff (guns/maces/2-hand maces).  <br />
<br />
There was a thread on the warrior forums that showed a nice comprehensive list of where to go for all sorts of training (even tradeskills stuff too I think).  I can link it after work if anyone is interested.<br />

Or if your an alchemist you can make swiftness potions. Instant cast for 50% movement increase for 15 seconds. IGW is a must but i think I will get Nature swiftness first. Instant cast healing waves or direct damage is very nice. Its really just a matter of taste :)</div></div><hr />
