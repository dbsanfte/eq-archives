------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
** Bug Fixes **<br />
<br />
- Fixed a bug that allowed items to be placed in the wrong equipment slots<br />
- Fixed a problem that some folks had with polygons and clipping using the Matrox Parhelia card<br />
<br />
<br />
** Spells **<br />
<br />
- Changed Luclin port spells to be usable from anywhere<br />
- Added new Druid and Wizard transportation spells for locations in Luclin<br />
<br />
<br />
** Items **<br />
<br />
- Removed the cap for items that granted bonus mana<br />
- Bricks of Black Acrylia are now stackable<br />
- Plains Pebbles are now stackable<br />
- Casserole Dish Sketches are now stackable<br />
- Yttrium Sleeves and Leggings now have a plate armor appearance. They are also no drop<br />
<br />
<br />
** New User Interface **<br />
<br />
- New Interface Window: The Compass! Press Alt-D to activate it. The higher your Sense Heading skill is, the more responsive and accurate the compass is<br />
<br />
- Fixed the fatigue percentage Label to show 100% when you are not fatigued at all<br />
- Clicking to add new items to a stack in your inventory will now stack those items into the inventory rather than onto the cursor<br />
- Fixed a bug that was causing some people to lose items when looting too quickly<br />
- Tracking window no longer shifts to the top every time an NPC dies<br />
- Training window no longer only shows the first digit of the amount needed to pay for training<br />
- Fixed the bug that was causing left clicking during mouselook to target<br />
- The 'hits mode' menu and filtering for it is done, including the options for normal, abbreviated and number/miss only for the six main melee filters<br />
<br />
- UI Skin Creators: We added the following EQType labels:<br />
71 = Current AA pts available to spend<br />
72 = Current exp % being assigned to AA<br />
73 = Last Name of the player<br />
<br />
- Alternate Skin Users: You may need to return to the default interface until the skin that you are using has been updated to work with the latest client. The addition of the new Compass window as well as some other changes may cause problems with skins for older patches of EverQuest. If you experience odd interface behavior or crashes, please try /LOADSKIN DEFAULT to return to the default skin.<br />
<br />
<br />
** Bazaar **<br />
<br />
- The Bazaar Search Window is resizable (added in an earlier patch)<br />
- PCs can't beg or pickpocket from NPC's and PC's in the bazaar (added in an earlier patch)<br />
- The Trader drop down box is now sorted alphabetically<br />
<br />
<br />
** Alternate Advancement **<br />
<br />
- Priests and intelligence casters now have the Combat Stability and Natural Durability Alternate Advancement abilities in their Archetype<br />
<br />
<br />
** Miscellaneous **<br />
<br />
- Reduced the faction hit for the final turn in on the Wizard Epic quest<br />
- Implemented key rings. Certain keys will be placed on your key ring when you use them (like clicking on the appropriate doors or locks). The keyring is a part of the character, not a space in inventory. To find out what keys you have just type /key and the game will give you a list<br />
- Moved the safe point in Marus Seru to a somewhat safer spot<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
** From Neriak **<br />
<br />
An uncharacteristic silence descended across the Imperial District of Neriak, city of the Prince of Hate's children. Not so much an absence of sound, more the oppression of pure silence; an almost tangible potential crackling in the air itself, as a quiet before a tumultuous storm.<br />
<br />
Nobles and commoners alike stood motionless in the streets, a look of confused expectation upon their upturned faces. The ghouls guarding the entrance of the Dark Academy chittered briefly to one another before melting into the shadows.<br />
<br />
All eyes looked upon the Dark Tower of Sorcery, it's smooth stone walls seeming to almost pulse with a power from within. Darkened windows and oriels looked out upon the silent city of the Tier'dal, imparting an impression of amused malice.<br />
<br />
Silence... interminable, suffocating silence... instantly broken by a deafening, mind-rending thundercrack, reverberating from the cavernous walls of the city, shaking the very foundation of every building with immense force. Blinding luminance, lancing forth from every aperture in the tower, burning the eyes of those foolish enough to look on, whilst the thundercrack pained each listener's ears.<br />
<br />
Then, as soon as the cataclysmic burst had come, it vanished. The ringing in the ears of every dark elf within the streets below slowly subsided, to be replaced by a lone, maniacal stream of laughter echoing throughout the city from the Dark Tower's summit...<br />
<br />

Hell has frozen and its christmas for the next month.<br />
<br />
I was hording AA points for PoP in the hope of new skills and this would have been one to hope for. I have 6 AAxpoints so Natural Durability 2 should put me a few HP's shy of 3khp.<br />
<br />
w00t thanks VI. 8)~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Damn, yet another AA skill that seems usable</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What hte heck does Natural Durability do???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Defleron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Do I remember right that ND only affects natural hit points (taking into account STA). Naked with 255 sta is what, 1600 hit points for a shaman I think.<br />
<br />
ND1 = ~32hp<br />
ND2 = ~80hp<br />
ND3 = ~160hp<br />
<br />
Or does it effect your full hit points? Either way it's a welcome addition :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Heh; And  Combat Stability??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Defleron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">A chance at better damage damage mitigation. Casters realm lists it as a 100% chance to improve mitigation, but that's been proven to be false. Mobs can still hit you for their previous max, they just have a chance to hit you for less each time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Nice patch!<br />
<br />
And Combat Stability I think is damage mitigation (i.e. you take less overall damage the more skilled in CS you are)<br />
<br />
/sigh dammit I am never gonna get Cann5 if they keep this up :/<br />
(Not complaining, not complaining ;P )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Carrieanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Stability is channelling :)<br />
<br />
so next time your getting clocked by a WW dragon think of those interruptions :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Defleron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Combat agility would have been channeling, stability isn't :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Spinashe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Straight from Celt's great AA thread on Rangers Glade<br />
<br />
Natural Durability<br />
(2/4/6) This ability increases maximum hitpoints by 2, 5, and 10 percent, based off your stamina buffs and base hits, NOT hitpoint buffs. This of course includes working off of Riotous Health, Marvelous Visions, etc. Maxed, this skill will give you an additional 10 percent of your unbuffed hitpoints, as well as increase your hp per stamina point to 4.6, 4.74 with Physical Enhancement in Class, instead of 4.2. Well worth the point expenditure if you need the hits, a normal ish 2500 hp unbuffed ranger still gets 250 hp from this skill maxed..a noticable, sizable MEASURABLE improvement. Max this fairly early in the grand scheme for all builds  Hitpoints are absolute, this skill alone, maxed, gives EVERY level 60 ranger 158 HP at the very least, with 0 gear/buffs at all, and every +100 hp item will actually be +110 hp, +112 hp with Physical Enhancement in Class. Also of note, if you plan on getting Physical Enhancement, you MUST have the first level of Natural Durability to get any effect on your hitpoints from Physical Enhancement.<br />
<br />
<br />
Combat Stability<br />
(2/4/6) This skill increases our chance to mitigate damage when we are hit, by 2, 5, and 10 percent respectively. This doesn't mean damage percentage, it means the chane that we will meitigate the damage down to something smaller, like a fungus shroom hitting us for 35s a lot instead of 130's. I have this abiltiy maxed, and can speak from experience that it DOES increase our tanking potential by quite a bit, ESPECIALLY if you subscribe to the mass hitpoints/medium ac school, for whatever reason. My ac gear isnt great, so I decided if I am gonna get hit, I want it to deal less and have my 38/55 point self buffed damage shield eat them up. The change in tanking is *very* noticeable at 1250 ac/4k ish selfbuffed hitpoints maxed out, and does show noticable improves from the second and third tiers especially. This skill works very very well in evening the gap between our tanking and that of a well equipped Paladin/SK without any AA, and helps ease the pain of watching them outdamage our epic wielding brothers when they have a vulak axe or similar large devastating 2hander. It is necessary to have this skill at the first tier if you wish to see any improvements in our mitigation from Physical Enhancement, and also works hand in hand with Combat Agility in improving our overall tankability.<br />

There you go guys!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jeraem Gaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Wow unexpected AA improvement, that caught me by surprise. Guess that'll waste some time till PoP maxing those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Stability is channeling<br />
<br />
Don't think so. We have a channeling AA skill. Wierdly enough its called channelling focus. From CastersRealm (yeah yeah, i know):<br />
<br />
Name: Channeling Focus <br />
Level Requirement: 55 <br />
Ability Type: Passive  <br />
Max Training: 3 Levels <br />
Point Cost: Level 1: 2 points<br />
Level 2: 4 points<br />
Level 3: 6 points <br />
Description: This ability reduces the chances that a player will have their spell casting interrupted due to damage or movement.<br />
The first point improves channeling by 5%, the second improves that to 10%, and the third raises it to a final 15%.<br />
 <br />
Think combat stability is as the posters said, damage mitigation, at 10% maxxed skill.<br />
<br />
The Natural Durability is a bit confusing as the melees have Improved Natural Durability. Hopefully its the same thing. Also, i couldn't follow the ranger thread whether it includes buffs or not. Guess we'll see soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">hmmm, do I want the extra HP's, the possiblity to live through one more frenzy round (allowing the tank to taunt it off me or a CH to land) or the UNGODLY amount of mana from Can V and Torpor?<br />

It's not usless, the poeple who can currently zone in without having quested the Seb key will probably find that it was a bug that will be fixed.<br />

So now the debate is on, what's better to do first, ND or Combat Stability?  The real HP's gain from ND is easily seen, but getting hit for a lot less is tempting too.</div></div><hr />

I play a melee class and was ecstatic to see the new AAs for Shaman--of course I play a Shaman too, so I'm biased. I like to play around in Magelo when I'm bored and always had a hard time finding ways to raise my Shaman's hitpoints with attainable items.<br />

2845 - ND1 <br />
2929 - ND2 <br />
<br />
139 Hp increase! <br />
<br />
Pretty cool.<br />
<br />
That is exactly what should be expected.  You got 2% and 5% increase over base.  With ND3 you would end up having 3069 HP, for a total of 279 more HP.<br />
<br />
<br />
I definately plan on getting ND, will make my HP as follows:<br />
<br />
ND1 - 2978<br />
ND2 - 3066<br />
ND3 - 3212<br />
<br />

How many DPS upgrades we received since Kunark? Zero. Nada. Zilch. That uber shi-tty level 44 poison DD doesn't count. Neither does the Ancient Scourge of Nife that drops so far from one mob and where no guilds really care going that are capable of doing the ring.<br />
How many DPS upgrades did melee receive? A shi-tload.<br />

<br />
Looks like ND is the way to go tho.  Specially since I have canni5 and am scrounging for every scrap of hps I can get!  Looks like it takes the percentage of your unbuffed hps plus stamina buffed hps.  So you with only riotous health and PE is what is taken into account.  That means those with uber hp gear will become even more uber if they have the time to exp between raids.  <br />
<br />
As for me I'm gonna finish off Quickbuff 2 and get my Elder title and a faster casting Torpor (which will help a lot).  Then we'll see bout some more arch skillz.  <br />
<br />
Oh hey i gotta question.  Does Enhancement Haste III effect stack with Quickbuff?  i.e.  if I have QBII for 25% haste, and EHIII for 33% haste, will that make 58% haste and Torpor at 2.52 seconds?  If so I'm just gonna push for my emporer ring key and forget about sinking more points into QB.  The new skills would be better in that case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">The one downside for me is that if every time they patch they break the new custom UI, I am not sure it's worth it to create a custom UI. I may just stick with the default even though I find the interface window hella lame.<br />
<br />
/boggle<br />
<br />
You're doing something wrong, then.<br />
<br />
Every time they patch the UI, I simply patch the stuff into my custom folder that I need, then log on and everything works. I never have to reset or reload anything, and nothing's ever broken.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's probably too late to fix it now, but next time, follow these simple rules:<br />
<br />
1) Go to your default folder.<br />
2) Sort icons by date.<br />
3) Pick all the files that have been modified in the past two or so days.<br />
4) Copy.<br />
5) Go to your custom folder.<br />
6) Paste.<br />
7) Click 'yes' to all.<br />
8) Log in.<br />
<br />
There's no need to /loadskin if you do this BEFORE you log on for the first time. Which is to say, download the new files, then quit out of EQ and follow my instructions, then log back on. The result is that you'll load directly into your custom UI which will be using the new files, and there will be no need to fix windows or anything of that nature.<br />
<br />
This has worked for me three for three now.<br />
<br />
And apropo of nothing...<br />
<br />
I am the very model of a shamanic barbarian.<br />
I've information hunter, gather, pastor and agrarian.<br />
I know the chiefs of Halas and I perform the rites of spiritual<br />
From summoning to binding, an order that is ritual<br />
I'm very well acquainted too with spells toxical<br />
I understand alchemic ointments that are topical<br />
About the Council of Justice I'm teaming with lots o' news<br />
And if nothing else, I know Glori's blouse is not too loose<br />
<br />
I'm very good at killing things that no one really should<br />
Slowing them and tanking them like no one ever could<br />
In short, in matters hunter, gather, pastor and agrarian<br />
I am the very model of a shamanic barbarian.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">Absor posted this advice somewhere:<br />
<br />
Remember, the key here is that if the interface can’t find a file in the custom folder, it will look for it in the default folder. But if it can find the file, even if it’s an old version of the file, it will try to use it. We do this because the newest file might not be the file you want to use (the older file might be a customized one). This could cause trouble, however, if we update a file in the default folder that also exists in your custom folder. In a case like that, you’ll continue to use the old file - and that might cause your game to crash. <br />
<br />
So here’s what we suggest. <br />
<br />
If you are using a customized interface, make sure that only the files you have modified are in the folder for that skin. Delete all other files. That way the game can use new versions of files that you have not modified out of the default folder. This should help you avoid many of the issues that come up when we update the UI files. <br />
<br />
We also wanted to let you know that we understand how updates to the interface can frustrate those of you that have customized it. We will endeavor to make it clear what files we’ve changed for the interface in our patch messages in the future. <br />
<br />
For example, this morning a few files changed in for the interface, making it so that some people (and in some cases a specific character) could not log in. The files we changed were: <br />
<br />
- EQUI.xml <br />
<br />
- EQUI_Animations.xml <br />
<br />
- EQUI_BazaarSearchWnd.xml <br />
<br />
- EQUI_BazaarWnd.xml <br />
<br />
- EQUI_OptionsWindow.xml <br />
<br />
- window_pieces04.tga <br />
<br />
If you have those files in your custom UI folder and you haven’t edited them yourself, deleting them from that folder should fix things. <br />
<br />
May help. Wish they had posted that before though~~</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, EH III stacks with QB, but EH III does not affect Torpor.  Spell Haste III does stack with QB and does affect Torpor.  (EH III and QB stack for stuff like invis, focus, celerity, etc.)<br />
<br />
I have an EH III earring and QB 1 and Torpor is still at 5.4 seconds, I'm going to stick it out and do QB 2 for a 4.5 second torpor before tossing a coin to go after SCM or the new durability thingie.</div></div><hr />

I've gotta say i don't really thing natural anything is really wort it especially sta. 5 points of natural sta will give you 10 points of sta which would be 30 hps. With 3 lvls of regen you would regen that in 1 minute. Not to mention that someplace down the road you very well may end up maxing out your sta buffed and the sta isn't worth anything then.<br />
<br />
ND is worth it for more hps, Natural sta isn't unless you've just got points to burn. Go run 3 regen 3. They really are the most usefull things in that lvl.</div></div><hr />
