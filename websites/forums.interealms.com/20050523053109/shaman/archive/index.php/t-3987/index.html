<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Goodberry</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I quit about 2 years ago. Totaly quit and stopped playing. I have decided to give it another try and logged in tonight to find (to my surprise) that my level 19 Barb Shaman on Layns is still there. So much has changed in the game I was hopeing you guys could give me some advice.<br />
<br />
#1 I am in all banded and I have a Glowing Wooden Crook, a Shiny Brass Shiled and a Screaming Mace (this was good equip when I quit!). by todays standards this seems pretty weak, what equip should I be looking for?<br />
<br />
#2 I am broke (like 50 plat) where can I go to get some good coin at this level? I need to solo most of the time because I have a 8 month old daughter (joy of my life) and I need to take care of her first and it is not fair to make a group wait.<br />
<br />
#3 Are there any new 1-19 spells I should know about? Or game dynamic changes that I need to know about?<br />
<br />
#4 is Tudamorf still around?<br />
<br />
#5 any advice you can give me in general?<br />
<br />
thank you for your time.<br />
<br />

Wow... 2years ago! You may want to invest in a piercer (Harpoon of the depths comes to mind, should be easy to get, and low cost) If not, then some other low-cost piercer to keep your skill up. Banded is not too bad actually, keeping your ac up is always a good thing. <br />
<br />
Soloing is doable, if not tough until 24. As far as spells, the only notable that comes to mind is *Grow* which you will find in Luclin. If you don't have the expansions (particularly Luclin) I suggest you get them if at all possible. The best thing you can do is browse the boards and look for advice, there is a wealth of knowledge here (I am at work, so I can only say so much) Good luck to you, welcome to the Crucible ;-)</div></div><hr />
