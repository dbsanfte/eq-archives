Basma, you against the EULA when you use EQW.<br />
<br />
Another remind, don't speak EQW, SHOWEQ etc words in game, I believe that VI had a filter setup for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">EQW is entirely different than ShowEQ. EQW lets you run EQ in a window - ShowEQ sniff transfered packages. I seriously doubt VI feels EQW is a threat. My guess is it even helps VI make even more money since people can play multiple accounts on one PC if they want to.<br />
<br />
What DLL is missing Basma?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I dont use it as I am lucky enough to have 2 computers (well - 3 - but the other one is used for looking stuff up and isnt powerful enough to run EQ - I love working from home in IT :) ), but I know LOADS of people who do - and almost every one of them is using it to run a second account, all of which would be cancelled immediately if they tried to ban people for using EQW.  Verant are stupid, but I hope they arent THAT stupid.</div></div><hr />

I doubt this... I have talked about EQW many times in guildsay and tells... never had a problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mwinda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">That DLL is in my EQ directory.<br />
<br />
Make sure the EQW files are not in your eq directory (sub-dir is ok)<br />
<br />
Look for that file in you everquest directory... If it's not there run the patch and make it get that file.<br />
<br />
If it is you are probably not setting up your EQW shortcut right... make sure that you use fully qualified paths for both eqw and EQ itself in the Target field of the shortcut... for example: Target: [&quot;c:\program files\everquest\eqw\eqw.exe&quot; &quot;c:\program files\everquest\egame.exe&quot;]. you need the quotes around the paths because program files has a space.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Basma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">whats the minimun requirement to run eqw without slowing down everquest or your computer so much..right now i am using an IBM 500mhz P3 256ram 64meg.graphic card..and when i loaded it before the crash seem slow</div></div><hr />

I've got the EQW files in my EQ directory. Not a subdirectory. Seems to work fine for me. I actually had strange graphic problems when it was in a seperate directory. I did all the normal checking (desktop color 16 bit, desktop res same res as ingame, etc.). I was about to give up on it, but figured I'd drop it directly into the EQ folder. Works great now. Just my 2cp.</div></div><hr />

Ditto, I've been running it for about 2 months now so that I can run a second account. I've spoken to my guildmates about EQW in guild chat. I don't think that VI will take any action against people as they would be losing $25.90 per moth, becuase they would have to ban both accounts.<br />
<br />
If they do I'll just wait until SWG comes out and start playing that instead :D</div></div><hr />
