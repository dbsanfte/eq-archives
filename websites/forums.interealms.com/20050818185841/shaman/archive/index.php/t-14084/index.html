<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">see what they need to do is make c2 last as long as KEI. id still donate for that on my lower levels. Personaly i have always thought the downtime was a bit much in this game. Its the lower levels that really drag on cause the cleric has to sit OOM, the game should flow at all levels like it does at 65. How many times you sit in PoP cause the cleric is OOM from a regular pulling cycle? I personaly never do.<br />
<br />
Ahh well , thankfuly the only one that i care about that is under the limit is my necro and they do fine without KEI</div></div><hr />

Oh god, don't let them EVER make that change.  I'm not an Everready and my HP's don't equal your mana.  If that were the case, then they'd be fighting over our mana all the time and we wouldn't have the time to make mana for our own.  I'm GLAD to leave that to Necros.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Its not just KEI from what I hear. What it seems is happening is: right now if you can't use a single target buff on a person because they are too low you can still buff them by getting that person in your group, targeting yourself then casting the group version of the spell. Doing that would allow the person who would normally be too low for that buff to still receive it. You could also cast a group buff on characters that are technically too low for it by using mass group buff. On test this has been changed to where the buff will not land on them if they are too low even if you got them in your group or used mgb.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Too bad C2 won't stick on anyone under 46 now anyway.  If you are under 46, you can have clarity, insight/brilliance and gift of magic cast on you.  No C2, no KEI, no tranquility, no VoQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">true, i dont see whats so wrong with letting mana users caster a lil faster, yea C3/4/5 was too much, but c1/2 ?  they need to make c2 group castable down to say.... 24ish and last about 1.5 hours before AA and focus items.<br />
<br />
Frankly this change will stop me from leveling another caster again. Unless its a shaman enchanter or necro. My wizzy is 34 right now and im not going to power level him to 44 so he can use KEI. Quad kiting was the only thing i enjoyed and now that is gone without big downtime and im not buying him a horse to make up for it. Frankly its would have been good to not ever have had it, but to take it away now that everyone is used to it is a bad plan i think. Im veyr much for keeping the game pure, but like i said, im so used to it with him, i cant see myself quading up and siting for 15 minutes to get my mana back, its just too boring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>em2johns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I don't see KEI as being all that bad a thing myself.  We'll see less twink casters coming up through the ranks, and back to seeing more tank classes including shaman.  Bring back KEI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Its a good change.. and frankly too long in coming.  The damage has been done.  These buffs are just too powerful for lower level characters.<br />
<br />
It is annoying not being able to cast my super godly buffs on someone.  I am after all an elder prophet, slayer of dragons and gods -but its bad for the game.  Not just kei but focus &amp; virtue.  I have lower level alts, I've used these abilities.  KEI allows a caster to solo non stop for hours.  Focus and virtue can add 1500 hps.  That will double the hps on my low 50 rogue or my 40s monk, on a lower level character thats nigh invulnerability.  Think back to when you had under 100 hps, and mobs hit for only a couple points.  Think of what you could have done with that many hps.<br />
<br />
We all know that solo experience is faster than group experience if you dont have to rest up between kills.  So what these buffs have done is killed grouping.  There are no groups available, therefore everyone must solo.  There are no groups because everyone solos.  Its a catch 22.  With more soloers, there is greater competition for resources.  With non stop killing, there is greater competition for resources.  Without grouping the social aspect of the game is lessened.  Its bad for the game any way you look at it.<br />
<br />
These changes are a long overdue step in reversing this damage.</div></div><hr />

This is exactly what we have goin on the Test server atm....<br />
<br />
I have no idea when its going live, but it is going to go in at some point....I really am starting to feel like a Sony rep here, but I have to say it'll be worth it compared to some of the other changes they have going in. Most have already been shared here on the Crucible so I wont sound them off and further my &quot;fanboy&quot; rep lol ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">It is not just KEI is is all spells level 51+ ... there was a bug that allowed group spells to stick to players under those levels if the target of the group spell (usually your self) was 46+.  KEI is just the most noticable spell this will effect (except for us shaman that pl alts)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Phread</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I think this is a stupid patch now at this time.  Yes, it would of been appropriate when 60+ levels were available.  Now after months and months of playing with it and getting used to it they are taking it away?  I quit eq for almost a year because I got sick of waiting 40 minutes to regain my mana, it was old and frustrating.  I think that its to late to take the buffs away now.  Back when they first introduced KEI i was toally against it.  I have a RL friend who had a made a druid and got him to 60 within 1 1/2 months because of kei, I thought it was total bullcrap.  Now that I have made a Shaman and normally run around with kei (no canni yet)  I think I would ruin my fun with him because I would end up sitting for about 30 minutes to regain my mana after buffing. I wouldn't mind so much if they did this patch but made low lvl kei spells.. Say at 30ish have one that does +12Int/Wis and mana regain half of what kei is.  I think its gonna bring the game down but I don't care, I got a 44 Ranger who wouldn't mind coming out from retirement  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

Right, so you want all of us to get 60+, get some of the rarest shaman spells and 10k+ for a horse when we can complain about paying 30pp for kei and complaining about it when they take it away? I plan on complaining since it will get me further than trying to get all that stuff you think all shamans should have</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">10k is NOT a lot of money.<br />
You can make 10k in a day of killing soloing golems in pov, and you don't need any of those l33t spells either.<br />
Metallic liquids still sell for 5k+<br />
That, or go farm ice or hill giants for cash.<br />
Or go to some place like sola and farm fine steel.<br />

Yes you can talk all you want about it ruining the game and all that stuff, but twinking and leveling alts is what keeps people still interested.  Just because it takes me a little less time to get to 60 doesnt mean im totally clueless to how to play the class.  Why do you think Sony invented Paludal Caverns?  Because people where tired of spending weeks leveling at low levels.  I don't play many alts but if they remove KEI from sub-46 players I doubt i'll play any again.  Sure go ahead call me lazy and stuff :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">When I started playing Everquest, there was no C3.<br />
<br />
When I came back a few weeks ago, C3 was everywhere.<br />
<br />
I am absolutely storming through levels with it. I've been picking it up regularly since level 37, and I've just hit 41 in about 10 days, soloing all the way.<br />
<br />
I think the argument comes down to whether you think people should be able to crash through levels faster than they could with Everquest classic. It took me longer to get through my 20's than my 30's. For me, that's good, as I just want to get a high level character so I can visit every damn zone in the game. This would not be good for SoE. The faster I reach 65, the sooner I'll quit.<br />
<br />
I like C3. I like less down time. I don't like sitting around on my ass for 10 minutes between kills. If they slow down the game again, maybe I won't have as much perseverance as I do now, and quit.<br />
<br />
I certainly wouldn't start up a caster again knowing it's 20% play and 80% sitting around, at the moment KEI is the only thing that changes that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Thlayli of Xev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I think it's hysterical that people have been freaking out that C3 is bieng taken away. Not just here (not picking on you Xenah), but in game sitting around the nexus/pok. <br />
<br />
OMG they're taking KEI away!!<br />
<br />
Hello? There are other  high lvl spells being yanked too - aego/virtue, focus, regens, hastes.<br />

<br />
<br />
Well sh*********t... if I knew it was that easy I would've gotten Torpor back when I dinged 60...<br />
<br />
You're acting FAR too christian, I don't believe low levels should get a free ride, and not just because I didn't. But at the same time, you shouldn't be such a dick to them, humans naturally do what makes life easier for them. Would you rather climb the wall or take the back door?<br />
<br />
&quot;Level up, get Cana 5 and Torpor or Quiesance and get with the program&quot;? OH! I didn't know there was only one way to play the game. I'm tempted to call you a nazi *sshole, but I won't  :D . Hell, why not slap on &quot;Get some VT and elemental armor while you're at it you lazy piece of sh*t&quot;?<br />
<br />
I'm 61 now with Canni V but not Torpor (Kragg's DOES work just fine), and working towards 65 for Quiessence/Malos myself. <br />
<br />
There must be some sort of balance, low-levels musn't have their levels spoon-fed to them, but the EQ world shouldn't be overly hostile to them. This is represented by two extremes... those who cry bloody murder about KEI/Aego/Focus being taken away, and those that believe all shamen should take the route that they took and &quot;Get with the program.&quot;. This extreme is represented by the wonderfully amicable Zhorn. To sardonically answer Zhorn...&quot;Wow... he's right, I shouldn't be lower level, I'm sorry, I'll go get lvl 65 in just a sec... Oh... lemme snatch this copy of Torpor off this vendor... sure I'll only use it in the 5 min it takes to get from 60-65, but it'll be worth the 12pp 6gp. Since no one else wants money, I guess I can go to RM or Seb when I need some. Glad no one ever crowds those zones for cash drops.&quot; <br />
<br />
As long as we keep teeter-tottering from one extreme to the other, there will never be any real balance. There are too many variables to be taken into place... but then again... some of em are just lazy newbs that are surprised when they don't get donations from someone they ask, I'm not defending those people.<br />
<br />
And if it matters, when KEI became popular Nexus-candy, I was around lvl 55, and was still to cheap to pay for it ;). I'm not calling myself hardcore, but I definately wasn't one of those who got from 1-60 quickly. And I have yet to have someone call me a &quot;bad&quot; shaman.<br />

<br />
It isn't.  I returned recently after an 18 month or so absence and started over on Firiona Vie.  I haven't found level oriented buff restrictions to pose any difficulty at all.  Servicable gear is cheap and readily available.<br />
<br />
I've been having as much fun playing as I ever have whether grouped or solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Okotona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I've been having as much fun playing as I ever have whether grouped or solo.<br />
<br />
That's good, as it should be ideally. Part of being in a hostile environment though would be to have the group-dependant classes suffer by casters greatly favoring KEI'd solo time to grouping.<br />
<br />
I'd have to go with the side that says the 'damage' has been done as far as how long KEI's been available. The casters have had their fun... I'm sure many group-only (Or simply more group oriented classes) will find this to be a relief, hoping that the casters crawl back out of their soloing holes and help each other ;).<br />
<br />
Now that I think of it... I was quite a solo whore myself, back in the day...<br />

beotch. Camped GWs in SF with a 65 pally for a few hours. PWNed Seb crypt and emp for a solid 7 hours, as well as MANY other expeditions to Seb for Malo/Torpor. Killed WW dragons with the guild. Offered anyone selling Torpor as much as I could (20k+Hiero Cloak+3 of the 4 research components), but only been for sale once that I've seen in the past decade or so (mild exaggeration). I solo'd in CT to get the 3 of the 4 research components. I've tried killing Cliff Golems solo and with a group. I've told all my friends that I'll murder IRL for Torpor.<br />
<br />
I also believe that it's the general concensus that Torpor is NOT easy to get(Thus the ever-present post wanting their drop rates increased), unless you're in an uber guild that does dragons with 1 group and you wear a constant IV filled with Mountain Dew. But then again... look who I'm talking to. The other extreme.<br />
<br />
Currently leveling up asap for Q, which is for sale more often and for less, if Torpor continues to be as stubborn as you, Zhorn.<br />

I wonder if you act like this merely to get a response quickly... hehe... kinda reminds me of myself..<br />

I contradicted nothing.<br />
<br />
For people with the desire and motivation it IS easy to get. I didn't say it would be instantly attainable.<br />

Some people claim to have been without torpor/malo for 6 months. Some say there are neigh on impossible to get. I say they are not trying hard enough at all to get them.<br />
<br />
Easy is a relative term. Some folks might say the 2 months I took to GM Smithing was &quot;easy&quot; (the ones that took 6 months would!). <br />
I say it was &quot;hard&quot;. Who is right?</div></div><hr />

Boy howdy, did you ever contradict yourself. Of course you didn't say it was instanty attainable, but you said I should get off my ass and get it, as if it took relatively low effort. Then you said Weeks and weeks and WEEKS it took for you.  You're just too hardcore for me ;).<br />

Just don't think this would work, myself.  The reason being, is that the spell would have to check recipient level to determin what the effectswill be THIS time.  This is a quantum level above the resistance check currently done and I think if implemented, it would add quite a lot to lag.<br />

I thought this would be a good idea in the begining too, until I started to think about the realities of software design and the client/server relationship.</div></div><hr />

Damn, I wish it only took a month, maybe it will now that school is out. Been looking for Torpor since around lvl 58... long ass time ago... Solo'd in seb alot constantly /ooc'ing for a Jugg/Emp group, to name one of my efforts...<br />

Bad luck, or maybe I'm not doing something right, probably could've bought it for it's current 55k price on Xev if I spent all that time killing HK guards ;) (Although I did get a Hiero cloak from Seb...worth 20k-ish?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Itun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Its simple.... with KEI casters don't need to group.  Sony want you to group..... nuff said<br />
<br />
That's the problem with the attitude of Sony, they're forcing us to group whereas alot of people wants to solo for obvious reasons...<br />
<br />
1.) Some folks are loners and are happy to solo on their own.<br />
<br />
2.) Too many groupies are idiots and gets people killed. Alot of the players don't know how to play their classes well and also don't know how other classes play. So, with retarded players in groups, I don't blame them that peeps avoid grouping altogether.<br />
<br />
Sony/VI has a history of loving to piss off the customers.... to Sony, a happy customer is a pissed off customer. They don't give a fark about you, all they want to know is that if you have a valid credit card.<br />
<br />
Here's a quote from Kelly Flock, former CEO of SOE who resigned last year, he became a CEO in the year 2001, after this quote was made, he resigned a year later....<br />
<br />
&quot;When asked if he takes into account consumer input Flock is dismissive, relying instead on the expertise of his staff. 'No, we never talk to consumers - they just f--- us up. Someone asked for a copy of our market research which made us take the decision to do EverQuest. I said we hadn't done any market research. Had we done, the game would never have been made. We never focus on them. Gamers don't know what they want. We just want to know if they have a valid credit card.'&quot;<br />
<br />
This was printed in a UK gaming magazine, Flocked was interviewed by this magazine. I don't remember the name of it though, sorry. Someone else may know.<br />
<br />
Lum the Mad (formally www.lumthemad.net, who shut down his site to go work for DAoC) ripped the quote from the magazine and posted it on his website. It was reposted thousand of times over in many websites in months time.<br />
<br />
Basically what I am saying, even if you guys love the change, it never hurt any of you guys except that some of you prefer to whine that they are PLing too fast and some of you prefer to play nice and slow and fair...whatever.<br />
<br />
Now, there's the player base that is paying Sony to play the game and those that LOVE the KEI buff wants to use it, then Sony comes along to NERF not only KEI but a wide of assortment of other buffs as well. These people may quit because of the change, so why is Sony wanting to throw away money by making these changes by pissing people off?<br />
<br />
Well that's their problem, they don't know how to make MORE money, they just prefer to throw away money by pissing off their customers.<br />
<br />
So it seems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">So far, I haven't seen one good reason to change this spell. A few posts have berated us for wanting the game to be 'too easy', but so what? I don't understand why that would upset anyone. What do you care if someone levels fast? How on earth does that effect you? This isn't Quake. Having KEI on hardly gives you an unfair advantage. It's available to all, and this game isn't a competition.<br />
<br />
The closest I've seen to a point being made in favor of the change is that fast levellers don't know how to play their class because they haven't put in the man hours. What a load of bollocks. Bad players/groupers are bad for a myriad of reasons. If you don't like the way they play, kick them out of the group! I've yet to see a level 50 caster asking noob questions, and if I did, I wouldn't group with them. Problem solved. Forcing everyone to slow down just because you had to or because one fricken person isn't a god at playing their class is idiotic.<br />
<br />
Just give me ONE benefit to nerfing KEI. One. I can give you a hundred reasons that it's good as it is now.<br />
<br />
&quot;BOOHOO! Learn to play the game! This game should be a struggle. It should be slow and frustrating. You WILL play it my way. HAHA I'm already level 60 I don't care.&quot; - Until of course you start a character and remember how long it takes to level. Then I doubt you'll be turning down KEI. Hypocrites.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My thoughts exactly.<br />
<br />
This is a matter of choice and the choice doesn't hurt either side of the fence.<br />
<br />
Those that prefer to play the hard and slow way, that's your choice.<br />
<br />
Those that don't wanna sit on their asses and med or for 10 minutes per kill prefer to have KEI and level up faster. That's their choice.<br />
<br />
Those that want Aego and other buffs, especially from the 2-3 boxers don't wanna sit and heal up for 10-15 minutes per freakin' kill wants to have great buffs that ups their HPs and other stats so they can kill continously w/o having to stop to heal up. That's their choice as well.<br />
<br />
The choices that we make doesn't hurt anybody. Period.<br />
<br />
Sony don't want us to have choices or a choice for that matter. What they wanna do is FORCE us to group whereas many don't want to or never planned to group in the first place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Eilderts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">What is the lowest level that somebody can get exp when grouping with a chanter that JUST got c2. Honestly that should be the lvl it effects.<br />
<br />
As for c3, let me just give an example of pre-20 casters with kei. Nontwinked, self-buffed lvl 16, mana at 20%, hp at 92%. Mana regened faster. Today at lvl 20, I was fighting and noticed that if I was simply casually nuking in a fight with my best nuke, I was still FM at teh end of a fight. <br />
<br />
Thats not how the game is supposed to work. Granted, I have played the game before through these lvls and definately appreciate the fast lvling (almost dinged 20-21 in less than an hour...still got 1/2 a yellow left, GROUPED...), but still...I met a lvl 26 newb the other day who didn't know what the words agro and camp meant and also thought his Polished Steel Ulak and Fighting Baton was bad damage. I wanted to scream (bsties, grr they get the early game too easy lol).</div></div><hr />

It really is too easy to level up now and using group buffs on low-level chars is basically making them invulnerable.  I don't think overwhelming buffs really hurt people who are just burning time on a twink, but I have run into &quot;new&quot; EQ players who would not even exp in a group with my L40 SK unless they had KEI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">This is a matter of choice and the choice doesn't hurt either side of the fence. <br />
<br />
I would disagree with this statement.  It is a matter of game balance, not a matter of choice.  If some one is making use of an workaround(which is how people under 46 get KEI) to gain unfair advantage over others(pure melee get no buffs with as dramatic an impact on thier ability as casters and hybrids get with KEI) it is unbalancing.  When people(twink, alt, or true newbie) do not have to learn the class appropriete skills(such as mana conservation) till 50 +, it is unbalancing.    When a class finds getting a group at lower levels difficult becuase one of thier most important buffs is not needed to people buying a better version that lasts 3 + hours in the Nexus(as is the plight of some lower level chanters), it is unbalancing.  People have thrown a fit and whined and cried every nerf, but nerfs are done to retain and repair game balance.  Sometimes a nerf just is necessary.</div></div><hr />

But that's the point, don't group with them! The game (at least my server) is not overrun with players who will only play with C3 in their effects. It's filled with players who want it. Remove it from the lower level characters, they'll just enjoy the game less. Why is that better for the game?<br />
<br />
Honestly, where is C3 cast most of the time? The Nexus and the Plane of Knowledge. These seem to be the hub of C3 pimping. I spend a lot of time in those zones, and guess what? Most of the players there are in their late 30's onwards. Of course there are lower level players getting high level buffs, but the majority of the time it's soloers or groups finding a way to play the game their way without having all the fun bashed out of it.<br />
<br />
Let's take the worst case scenario. A group of level 15 characters get high level buffs, then go back to Crushbone or wherever and run rampant. They hardly ever die, they level like crazy and can take on anything in the zone.<br />
<br />
So what? How does that hurt you or anyone else? They're getting fun out of the game. When I see another player of my level doing a lot better than me because of C3 or a high level shaman buff, my first reaction is not to stop their fun, it's to get some for myself. The buff is available to anyone.<br />
<br />
There is only one reason to nerf C3. To make the game take longer, so that people don't hit 65, get bored, and stop paying SoE their monthly fee. So if you're a Verant/SoE representative, I understand you supporting this nerf. If you're a player, why would you want to force other players into the same routine YOU use to play the game.<br />
<br />
If we take out C3, let's also keep all buffs within a certain level, make every item have a required level and block lower level characters from entering zones they can't possibly hope to earn experience in. Then we can hopefully make Everquest a stagnant, tedious experience for all lower level characters.<br />
<br />
I expect SoE to keep the players playing as long as possible. It's their business. Why some players help them do that is beyond me.</div></div><hr />

Exactly. Unfortunantly that's what the so called &quot;purists&quot; wants. <br />
<br />
Funny they whine how unbalancing the game is...how many posters here crossed their fingers and say &quot;I never used KEI!&quot;...<br />
<br />
Most posters here PLed to 65 already and they just don't care anymore....just wait until the nerf takes place and when they wanna start a new toon, they're gonna find out just how fun it is to sit on their arses and med for 10 mins per kill since they can't 2-3 box anymore to buff the tar out of their toons. Or even sit and heal up for 15-20 minutes per kill if the toon is a meleer.<br />
<br />
NO ONE LIKES DOWN TIME! PERIOD!<br />

And yes Sony wants more of your money...the longer they FORCE you to level reallllllllyyyy slow, say anyone like the idea that it would take you 2 years or so to reach lvl 65?? That is if Sony wanted to? Or how about 5 years to reach lvl 65? Sony could do it if they wanted to.</div></div><hr />

But people *can* still 2-3 box.  What do you think they did before KEI was invented?  Clarity is plenty powerful on a level 1 character, and if you 2-box an enchanter the shorter timeframe won't bother you.  No one is going to have to sit and heal up for 15-20 minutes per kill, there are plenty of people who 2-box healers.  <br />
<br />
Honestly, I played my twink in PC (remember this zone greens out at 25) and people will not do anything without KEI and Aego.  They don't know about meditate, they don't know about sit aggro, they just know about KEI and nuke, nuke, nuke.  Plus the whole group has to stop every 30 minutes and wait for someone or other to go hunt down a KEI.  It is crazy.  <br />
<br />
The sky isn't falling, really, it isn't.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ummmm...the only toon I have that is 65 is a warrior, so in my case no.  My 53 shaman alt in fact rarely bothers to get C3, because with Canni, it just is not neccessary.  Name calling is not going to make your point, in fact it just makes you look kinda foolish and immature.  Facts are how you win arguments, so let's look at one, and just one fact in favor of the KEI fix.<br />
<br />
FACT:  The enchanter community generally supports this move, and has been asking for it(with admittedly some disention, but not much).  They point to the fact that with easy KEI access at all levels, it makes enchanters from 1 - 59 less disirable group members.  One of the primary reasons to have an enchanter in group is for mana regen buffs.  Pre level 50, in most exp zones, that is almost the only thing an enchanter brings to a group.  Sure, they can mez the occasional add, slow(tho it is not nearly as needed pre- PoP) and haste, but adds can be rooted, shaman can slow better, plus haste and other buffs.  Even when going into zones where slow is mandatory(PoP), a shaman has a better slow, can take the agro from slowing better, can haste, and can add other buffs as well.  Enchanter CC is rarely needed.<br />
<br />
Keeping a class desirable in groups is far more important than making sure you can KEI your twink you are too lazy to level without KEI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">What is the lowest level that somebody can get exp when grouping with a chanter that JUST got c2. Honestly that should be the lvl it effects.<br />
<br />
Sounds like a very good and reasonable idea IMO.<br />
<br />
As far as why is nerfing KEI on low levels a good idea... Despite what you may think, there IS a level of competition in EQ no matter who or how you play.  We all play with the same limited content and that by itself forces some level of competition for spawns and xp camps whether you are a solo player or raiding with your guild.<br />
<br />
With the recent easing of the levelling treadmill, there has been a rather massive influx of higher level players and due to some pretty poor design choices, the areas where those high level players can hunt for xp or loot has shrunk.  Put two and two together and you have some massive competition for xp spots at high levels while a TON of zones designed for lower level players go utterly ignored.  How many people that started playing EQ within the last 6 months or so even know what Dalnir's Crypt looks like?  Kaesora?  Splitpaw?<br />
<br />
The argument that many newer players aren't as good as the old school players stems from this as well.  Those dungeons were once good spots to xp as well as taught you many valuable lessons about your class and how to best work with others in difficult situations while you levelled up.<br />
<br />
There's a problem though, at least in the short term.  There simply aren't nearly as many low level players out there to populate all those areas and make them viable zones that you can go LFG and pickup a group for xp, at least not now.  The KEI nerf is a good step in the right direction as well as the increase to group xp.  Now the final step, IMO, would be to adjust the xp mods in those difficult dungeons compared to the stupidly easy spots to balance the risk vs. reward.  Another good idea IMO would be to implement Graveyards in some of those tough lower level dungeons to remove what has always been probably the biggest deterrent to xp'ing in those areas.  CRs are just horrendous. :o</div></div><hr />
