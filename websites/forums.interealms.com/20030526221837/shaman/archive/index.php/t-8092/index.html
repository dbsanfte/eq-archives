<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>umpaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm not sure if its just on my server, The Rathe, or if others have noticed this as well but it seems like since PoP came out that the number of 50 - 60 drops spells in the bazaar has dropped markedly. I think a lot of people have moved on from older content and  most are in PoP now.<br />
<br />
This is kind of a bummer for those of us who don't already have all our 50+ drop spells, especially the rare ones. Maybe if you don't got'em now you aren't going to get a lot more shots. <br />
<br />
Just a heads up to all you, like me, sub 60 shaman's out there that don't have all your spells. You might want to buy them if you see them cause it seems like the rare spells are going to get even more rare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>UbercyrusForbeis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think it's kind of a good thing. Ever tried to get a Topor group on the Rathe? hehe<br />
<br />
I prefer to kill for and quest most of my stuff, so I like the idea that it opens up Juggs and Emp and others.<br />
<br />
Just my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have noticed it - there are still much of the 50-56 stuff out there, but after that, it's gone away. All the stuff that used to drop off of the harder dragons, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This is fantastic, IMO.<br />
<br />
This means that the content that drops these spells is not being utilized, and THAT means that it is available for YOU to utilize it.  <br />
<br />
Start hunting those Guardian Wurms (but not on The Rathe, because *those* Guardian Wurms are MINE, MINE, ALL MINE!).<br />
<br />
You *will* get all your spells if you hunt the guardian wurms and other kunark dragons.  I've gotten Torpor, VoTB, Talisman Of The Raptor, and Pox Of Bertoxxulous from SkyFire dragons.  I still need Malo, but I have every reason to believe it will eventually drop there.</div></div><hr />
