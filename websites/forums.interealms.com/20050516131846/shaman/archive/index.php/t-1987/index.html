<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Talamay Crystalspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">doesn't sound like much...<br />
<br />
shamans still only have torpor to do any real healing..<br />
<br />
raids are still focused on main tank / CH circle..<br />
<br />
spells are still nearly impossible to obtain except those ranked highest in the ueber guilds..<br />
<br />
makes me wonder why i came back =).</div></div><hr />

Fundamentally, you haven't really missed much.  EQ is still EQ.<br />
<br />
Only big changes I can think of are those that came with Luclin, most noteably the new Alternate Advancement System.<br />

you missed Verant actually making our group buffs usefull. They now buff the same amount as the single version. Other than that, you missed Verant saying they're going to redo the interface in EQ for the past 8 months.</div></div><hr />

Jeebus.  Slow down there.  It was a comment about the board in general, not you in specific.  Your post was mostly watered down summaries of all the rant-a-thons that have been going on here.  You seem to have a handle on the things that people like to bitch about, which is why I said, &quot;I guess you're all caught up now.&quot;<br />

<br />
Run-3 and Cannibalisation are the be-all-end-all shaman AA skills.  There are several other good skills, but those two are game-breaking.</div></div><hr />

you missed lots of patches, emergency follow up patches and followup emergency patches to the emergency patches!!<br />
<br />
anyways, I think reading patch messages is a good way to catch up on old news.<br />

1924 hps for what 1-1.2K of mana?   Dear god that skill is sooooo worth it.  My soloing ability lept through the roof after attaining it.  hahah plus you get to scare clerics!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Hail,<br />
<br />
Welcome back. :)<br />
<br />
Alchemy got a little attention.  The old recipes are back in game, and they added a few new ones.  It is still insanely expensive.  They gave us a gimpy clarity potion, but it costs too much to make even for guild use imo.  Grow potions to 180 is now a viable method for skilling up past Mastery (much cheaper than Gate potions).<br />
<br />
There is new Tribunal Cultural chain armour called Artificer's Ringmail, an upgrade from the Northman's Ringmail.  Some of it is nice, most of it could use more AC.  It is prohibitively expensive to try to make, and the supply of Grandmaster Tribunal Smiths is limited (if even present) on most servers.  Basically 3 smiths out of all the servers have been making the stuff and posting the stats at EQtraders.<br />
<br />
Oh, and Blue Diamonds are even more valuable now, as they are used in just about every high-end tradeskill item, regardless of race or class.  Not just for resist jewelry any more.<br />
<br />
Timorous Deep Firepots room is now bindable again for gate classes.<br />
<br />
Oh, were horses around when you left?  Nice benefit outside of medding while &quot;standing&quot; in the saddle, still capable of casting and using JBB.<br />
<br />
Take care,<br />

<br />
The usual path to AA skills has been <br />
1) regen x 3<br />
2) run x 3<br />
3) Mental Clarity x 3 (takes all 12 points of arch skill . . . only worth it cause it's a prerequisite for Canni5.)<br />
4) and CANNI5<br />
<br />
After that whatever u wanna do will probably help you equally.  The path I suggested is the &quot;generally agreed upon&quot; path to the best and most notable skill Canni5.<br />
<br />
Other notables are Spell Casting Reinforcement, which can make Torpor last one tick or two ticks longer than normal, depending on how many damn points you put in it.  21 points total needed to max this at 50% longer buffs.  *wince*  However, only 2 AA points are needed to make Torpor last that extra tick almost every time.  <br />
<br />
Spell Casting Mastery is supposed to be very nice once you max it (12 points), lowering the costs of spells by about 30% on average.  <br />
<br />
Channeling also might be good, if they fixed it, which I dunno if they have or what.<br />
<br />
Mass Group Buff makes yer guild love you, not much else to say about it tho.  Pisses off clerics tho . . . they got that uber self buff it overwrites . . . tuff **** tho haha.  MGB is too expensive at 9 points tho for what it does.  I'll probably get it anyway just for a boost in the guild faction area. <br />
<br />
Um, o, check out the new CT!  It's loads of fun, but highly dangerous.  That extra hp/stam u like will help u a lot there, as things hit hard and fast.  New lewt from the zone is impressive as well, or some of it is anyway.  Mostly tho, the impressive thing is the exp hits.  In a full group of lvl 60's I get a quarter blue per kill.  In a hard driving fast killing group that makes for an AA point every 4 hours approx.  <br />
<br />
Newbies are even more fun to twink and level these days.  Droods get succor at level 19 or something.  Pallies get exp rezzes starting at lvl 30.  Clerics get additional exp rezzes of varying percentage, 0% rez starts at like lvl 12 or something.  Pally 0% rez is at lvl 22.  Oh and lvl 55 pallies can now cast 75% rez, which is quite serviceable and worth having over trying to find a cleric for an hour or whatever.  <br />
<br />
newb casters no longer have to med while looking at a book.  1-10 lvl chars respawn after dying fully clothed with all their equipment.  &lt;== abusable.<br />
<br />
Epic can still be factioned to complete all but the tear (which can still be MQed by an ally faction shaman). <br />
<br />
That's all i can think of atm.  Hope i have enlightened you in the manner in which you requested.<br />
:p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Talamay Crystalspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">thanks for the information guys.<br />
<br />
i tried the group stamina buff last night... considering that i'm not in a guild now, nor will i join another one, my play time will be with up to one single group.  anyway, my spirit weaver's breastplate will sit comfortably in my bank.  so that's good news.  <br />
<br />
i'm undecided on AA points... they allow for some cool things, but in my opinion those things should have already been part of each class anyway.  AA points just mean more meaningless whackamole leveling crap.  <br />
<br />
megumi, i don't think you were around when i used to post here... i'm &quot;confrontational&quot; and almost entirely not serious : ).  this is a game after all.<br />
<br />
oh yeah.. i have a magelo profile, i just haven't updated my sig yet :P</div></div><hr />

Thank god i can finally retire now thats theres another grumpy ass shaman back on tribunal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Talamay, there's some pretty cool single group things that can be done in SoL, like the fast Caller quest or some of the named in Umbral Plains (one guy drops a two handed priest item that looks like a big book on a stick, hilarious!)  There is also finally some decent gear that can be acquired in non raid situations, like that yummy earring in ME.<br />
<br />
Run speed is definitely an AA skill worth sticking some points into...like someone else pointed out, you don't have to run faster than the mob, just faster than your groupmates!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">heeeyyy<br />
<br />
I checked out your magelo Talamay.<br />
nice gloves.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Talamay Crystalspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">yeah.. need new gloves.  i used to have coldain but i gave them away when i quit.  then i gave the account to a friend and split paw is what he put on talamay :/.<br />
<br />
coldain should be easy to get though, i have a lot of friends that are giant aligned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">And actually, coldain gloves are pretty reasonably priced for how nice they are...3K on Emarr.<br />
<br />
Still very very very jealous of your hat, no one will camp the good rats with me.<br />
<br />
/sniffle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Oh! Thought of two more things:<br />
<br />
* Player made pottery trade skill items that port priest classes back to their home city.  Tribunal worshippers get a port back to good ole Halas.  Things weigh 20 pounds, have a 30 second cast time, but endless charges!   Easy to bank/sell and not terribly expensive (8k on Emarr).<br />
<br />
* Mages got a new mod rod spell with SoL, a three charge mod rod that takes 300 hitpoints per charge and gives back about 2 bubbles of mana (estimate).  Mages get more mana back with a rod than it takes to make a rod, so shaman + torpor and mages + mod rod 2 have become a powerful mana making machine.  Wonderful for long, mana intensive fights where clerics/wizards tend to run out of mana.  Group a shaman with some clerics and feed them health while they mod rod down for healing, it's GREAT!  I think it adds a valuable and important role for shaman in high end raid situations where sometimes we felt we didn't stack very well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Mage focus items are pretty cool.<br />
Quick cast is great for torpor and everything really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Corwil Delyonhart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">/wave Talamay</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Wow. Talk about coincidence.<br />
<br />
The other day I thought about something Talamay said (while observing a nice flamewar on eqvault)<br />
<br />
&quot;When you understand that people are the way they are, you'll remove a lot of stress.&quot;<br />
<br />
Or words to that effect.<br />
<br />
WB. Hope your system kicks butt. Luclin adds the proverbial cyber-molasses to mine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Did anyone mention group focus?  :)  No more focusing the entire guild during a raid, one by one . . .<br />
<br />
Chutoi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Talamay Crystalspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">group focus would be great... unfortunately i don't think i'll have much chance of getting it, from what i've heard.  supposedly it drops from luclin boss mobs.  last i checked 'boss' mobs couldn't be killed by one group.<br />
<br />
: )<br />
<br />
how's it going chutoi?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Talamay,<br />
<br />
Luckily, Verant seems to have wised up after the &quot;Uber Rare Kunark High Level Spell&quot; fiasco.  Yeah, the spell drops off Luclin boss mobs, but they will soon be as commonly found on the market as Focus.  My guild has already outfitted SEVEN shaman with group focus and have a spare in the bank.<br />
<br />
I would expect to pay no more than 2-3K for it within a month or so.<br />
<br />
Group regrowth and group sow too, joy!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Corwil Delyonhart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Don't lose hope on group focus Talamay. On Rodcet the spell is down under 10k now mostly. More spells drop than the items that people want so the Rhags etc are all killed pretty much every spawn. I think it's pretty safe to assume that is going to happen pretty much everywhere eventually if it isn't already. Rhag one isn't that tough at all. Problem I had is finding him up more than dropping him ;) He's no tougher than an old world dragon back when you could attack him with higher levels. 2 or 3 groups of decent people can drop him with very little effort. <br />
<br />
Group Regrowth is pretty sweet too and that's one groupable in Ssra. And for the fashion minded in Luclin - the new fungi tunic in Fungus Grove is a black leather look. That drops off the caller quest there along with a slew of other toys.</div></div><hr />
