<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">These things are driving me crazy. First of all, there's too many touchy queery ones with cute hearts on them. Second of all, many icons don't look anything like what the spell does. <br />
<br />
Judging by the new Malo icon, it lights dogs on fire. Wth? What's your least favorite new spell icon?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">So far I dislike the Agi buff icon with the little feet, I keep thinking it's SoW and ran halfway across DL without SoW on this morning ;P<br />
<br />
They should have Group spells with a different color than their single target versions as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gert Groinwounder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Icon colors according to Absor...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>molgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What bothers me most is that the icons are so HUGE! If they want to use the new fancy icons for the spellbook and buffs window that's fine by me, but in the spell gems (even the new huge spell gems that waste a ton of screen space) they are impossible.<br />
<br />
As for which one is the most heinous-looking: cannibalize is sort of weird, i liked the brain icon better than the generic sparkle. But mal* definitely takes the cake, why a dog and nothing about magic, cold, or poison? My guess is they confused it with Tash, since tash has an effect message that says something about barking  and its buff icon in the old UI was the same as the one for wolf/bear form.<br />
<br />
i DO like that ultravision, spirit sight, and invisibility now have different icons, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Shrink is kinda cool :)<br />
<br />
<br />
But I agree, the hearts and crap need to go.  I'm a freaking priest of the god of Fear, he did NOT want me to be huggy and cutesy!<br />
<br />
<br />
Lunasombra Childeater</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I don't like the Turgur's icon.  The problem is that there is too much detail on it, so you can't tell what the heck is on the icon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Padraic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My best friend and I were in Halas last night, dumping stuff on a mule.  I thought, hrm, better sow the mule.  So I start casting.<br />
<br />
Suddenly all the guards around the docks are beating on me.  Nothing more embarrasing than being chased out of your home town by a bunch of light blue guards, cause you can't take the faction hit.<br />
<br />
After I zoned, I realized I didnt' have sow mem'd.  That was root.  Heck, I'm not even sure who I targetted with the spell :p<br />
<br />
They are taking way to much getting used to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i dislike turgur's as well. you can barely see what it's supposed to look like in the 8-slot spell window, and uhm, it makes little sense. looks like the old cripple icon.<br />
<br />
btw, you can shrink your buff icons:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>molgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">the slow icon is really crowded, but it actually fits slow better than cripple, seeing as it's an arm holding a sword with an hourglass next to it.<br />
<br />
the cripple icon should just be some big flabby arm or something, though... the hourglass makes no sense...<br />
<br />
and why do SoW and SoC have the same icon but Scale of Wolf has a different one?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I don't mind them too terribly much, and I don't find the icons to be too confusing since I learned to read roughly twenty years ago ;) However, the colors really do have to go. Pastels? Please. They shoulda spent a little less time working on the new character selection 'explore' option and more time coming up with icons that fit the game. Some nice woodblock stamping woulda been pretty sweet.<br />
<br />
I know that the new focus icon is supposed to be a dreamcatcher, but am I the only one who thinks it looks like the sort of stain that gets left on the window of a peep show booth?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I've fixed the buff icons being too big with the buff icon reducer mod and I fixed the spell bar to be approx the same size as the old one using the spell bar from &quot;the win&quot; mod (found in the complete set section).<br />
All from www.eqinterface.com of course.<br />
<br />
Now if I could only get the damn freakin &quot;fading&quot; crap out of them.<br />
When I can't use a spell I don't want to think that I can use it because it happens to be 2% more faded than an available spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">ROFL Jing, I wa sthinking the same thing about the malo icon....poor doggie!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Fattn, I set my spell bar for 75% both faded and regular, that way it never does that annoying &quot;fade&quot; thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">That was one of my pet peeves, too, the spells fading back in weren't that noticable.<br />
<br />
Think we could convince Yzzy to release his spell book and spell icons as they are?  Really, the book and the icons are the only things I expect to change at the moment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I think Fattn is referring to the fact that after you cast the spell doesn't &quot;grey out&quot; like in the old UI. The picture is still there but it's just a little darker. Bugs the hell out of me too.<br />
<br />
It's all just too big. I've spent hours going through changes stupid little numbers just to make it all smaller like it used to be. Screen space is at a premium now that I need a second visible chat indow.<br />
<br />
&quot;&lt;Fades&gt;false&lt;/Fades&gt;&quot; is your friend.<br />
<br />
The thing I hate the worst is I keep losing the tails on all my letters! gy ij yv! Who knows?!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Hrendra An'ei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I don't know about y'all, but I'm in love with the modified buff window found here:<br />
<br />
http://dm-mt.dynu.com/DM/geddineui.asp<br />
<br />
It's quite pretty and functional. Try it. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I found it the icons were much more in line what they are.   However the blue hearts are kinda.. tacky.   Acumen should be an eye like the other vision spells (since 2 of the effects are vision related).  I'm not sure what the icon for Cannibalize is suppose to be.  KEI uses the same icon (not sure on the regular clarity linee).   I miss the heads.  I'm still sticking with liking the icons overall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">As soon as someone does a set of spell icons that match the old interface I'll be ALL over it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Tantobourne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">It does take some getting used to.  Sometimes when I open up the spellbook I expect to see Bubbles, Blossom, and Buttercup smiling back at me along with Mojo Jojo, each in their own little comfy spell slot.</div></div><hr />

That buff window is the nuts - thanks for the link :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I'm pretty sure a softskin female designed the new icons.  All those pastel colors.  Yuch!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Tossyndar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">/feedback Dear Verant Interactive I feel that its only fair to notify you that some of the Icons that you are using are TM to Mattel Corporations &quot;Carebear&quot; line of products, as a concerned citizen I would ask that these Icons be removed Immediately and be replaced buy &quot;Poke your Eye Out&quot; type Icons that will have us on the edge of our Keyboards wanting to kill mobs, not hug them. I would also ask that the Faber Castles Pastel Colour selection of Pencils be removed from the Art department, and be replaced by sharp implements. I feel that our Icons need to be rendered with real blood, prefreably from previous Art director who okay current Icons.<br />
 A selection of Body parts could be riped off from said artist and captured  JPEG'd to BIT MAP format. these would help form buff symbols, Poked out eyes for Assidious Vision and see invis, and severed feet for sow etc, etc, I guess you get the Idea by now.... <br />
<br />
Needless to say the UI is great but the Icons suck the sweat of Cazic-Thules grandfathers back after a long shag........</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">man i would love to see something like this for the spell gems too thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">i hate the new spellicons :(<br />
i'd gladly just trade them back for the old ones :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">For the most part, I like the new icons very much.<br />
<br />
They are taking some getting used to, since I'm not quite to the point where I can just look at them and tell what they are yet, like I could the old ones.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind, tho, when you first started playing EQ, you basically looked at the old icons the same way because it was all new and different.  Same thing goes here, you just need to get used to it.<br />
<br />
So far, I am very impressed with the new UI!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">i agree, after a while we should get used to them. btw if you want an eye-icon for acumen it should be a very simple process of copy/pasting in the .tga files with PSP or photoshop or something.<br />
<br />
the old icons are in the ui folder, named Spell_Icons.tga, the new are named spells01-05.tga</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Patito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">anyone know if or how you can change the title of additional chat windows?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Sordia Winetrsbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Ok the hearts have to go. I am a shaman, spirit/dream walker. I am not a cutsie make-love-not-war kinda gal.<br />
<br />
I am a barbarian, hence barbaric. I think that if my spirit guides ever got a look into my spell book I would be laughed out of the spirit realm and lose all my powers permanently.<br />
<br />
I don't think that the Clerics are too impressed with the cutsie graphics either.  They beleive in the vengful gods, that smite the wicked, not the nice wittle touchy-feely gods.<br />
<br />
Maybe the tree-hugging-hippy druids like the hearts, but I think that even they are more naturalistic then these icons imply!<br />
<br />
VI, this is a dark world, full of war and chaos! ***  were you thinking??!!</div></div><hr />
