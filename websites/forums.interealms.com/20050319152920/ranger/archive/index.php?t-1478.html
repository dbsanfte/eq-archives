<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jorana</div><div class="date">04-18-2002, 10:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last night I was playing EQ when the screen went black and the top of the screen had half inch verticle green lines running across the top.  The system was locked so I powered down and turn the power back on.  Now I have a BIOS boot-block on and I can't get my PC started.  How do I recover?<br />
<br />
Any help to a non computer person would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ronarin</div><div class="date">04-18-2002, 10:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In general, if your computer halts before trying to boot from the hard drive you have a hardware problem.  This problem is most likely a failure of the in one of the major subsystems (CPU, Video Card, Memory, BIOS, Main Memory, Network Card, Hard Drive Controller, etc...)  There are also a few virus programs that can affect your BIOS.<br />
<br />
It would help to know a little more about the problem before attempting a solution.  Specifically can you answer these questions:<br />
<br />
1. When you say BIOS boot-block.  Do you mean the computer will not complete a power on self test (POST) or do you get that actual error message?<br />
<br />
2.  If you are not getting the BIOS boot-block error message but you do get an error message can you post the exact text of the message?<br />
<br />
3.  If you are not getting a text error message do you hear a sequence of beeps during the boot process?  If so what is the beep sequence?  (i.e. long beep, short beep, short beep, short beep)<br />
<br />
4.  Who made your computer?  More specifically who made your motherboard?</div></div><hr />

That involves moving a jumper, and varys from comp to comp.</div></div><hr />

Have a computer type friend do it, or bring it somewhere. Messing with the jumpers on your MB can break things badly if you're not careful...<br />
<br />
Also, clearing the BIOS would be a first step here, I think. If that doesn't work, something is probably broken.</div></div><hr />
