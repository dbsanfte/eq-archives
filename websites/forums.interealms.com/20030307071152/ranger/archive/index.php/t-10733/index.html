<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Glendar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I currently have 16 AAXP points with 2 saved as I work toward either CF2 or ND2 ( I have CA1, MC1, CF1 and ND1).  My guild is nearing the time of starting to raid in ST and NToV.  Most of our targets now are Kland, Zland, Statue, WToV dragons, Rumblecrush, Doomshade, Vindi, etc.  After reading Celt's great post (/cheer Celt), it seemed that ND2 was the smart choice.  The idea of those extra HP keeping you alive in AoE raid situations (an alive ranger always does more damage than a dead one :p ) seemed to make good sense.  However, as I look to use TS more and more on raids (obviously much more effectively when I get EQ way down the road), I wondered if the extra crits of CF2 made more sense.  <br />
<br />
Thanks for any insight on my situation/question you can give.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Telloran Treehugger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm planning on going for CF1 and ND2. Getting CF2 doesn't seem like it would be as noticeable at getting the HP from ND2. <br />
<br />
In my opinion CF2 is a bout a reliable as counting on procs. With ND2, the hitpoints will always be there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Velondra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Go with ND2, then get ND3! I got ND3 in arch and have never regretted it. Aego would normally give you something like 1000hps, I get 1100. ND3 boosted my unbuffed hps by 300, and raid buffed that goes up to about 500 extra hps because of this skill. (have 3.1k unbuffed hps and 5k raid buffed, with no NToV or above gear which is pretty good.) 500hps on an AE mob isnt to be scoffed at..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Eonowyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Velondra - I'm pretty sure that Natural Durabilty does not affect hitpoints from pure hp buffs - it affects hps yielded from stamina, which in turn increases your overall hitpoints, but aegeo does not become more hps from ND.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>TaliosTerangrea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I am at this exact same position and with the new patch stating that CF2 and CF3 would yeild more benefit for non-warriors.  Does it make sense to do CF2 over ND2?<br />
<br />
I have used slightly different points but have CF1, ND1, MC1, FB1,<br />
<br />
Thinknig of going CF2, ND2 but not sure.  Have heard people say CA is worth a point too.<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Glendar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Good point Talios.  I completely forgot about that recent tweak.  Hmm...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aeneran Orcreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Good question, also at the same point.  I have CF1, ND1, CA1,  and MC1.  Almost to that 18th point and decision time.  Anyone parsed CF2 since the patch?  I'm personally leaning towards ND2 since my guild just started with HoT and Kunark dragons, but if CF2 has been increased enough it may be worth it...<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>TaliosTerangrea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">hmmm I tried to train ND2 tonight but says I need 4.  I am guessing I need to do ND2 and ND3 at the same time.<br />
<br />
This changes things a bit so I am a bit confused on what to do for arch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kaeadin Stormcloud</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">to get the second level of any arch skill requires 4 AA points.  if you choose to get the third level arch skill it will require 6 AA points.<br />
<br />
Thats why ND 2 is asking you for 4 points : )  to do ND2 and ND3 at the same time therefore requires 10 AA points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>TaliosTerangrea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thanks I just figured that out last nite lol.  So I would ask the question to the group here..<br />
<br />
would ND2 outway CA1 and CS1?<br />
<br />
I am leaning toward that route since I really don't know of the benefit of ND2 over some other level 1 abilities like CA or CS.<br />
<br />
I have CF1, ND1, FB1, MC1, and 2 points to spend.  Thinking CA1 then doing CS1 to follow up.  Any other suggestions?  <br />
<br />
Thanks for all your comments.  Appreciate the responces.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Neetero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I just got CF2 and don't really notice many more crits at all.  If there's a difference over CF1, it is ever so slight.  Probably should have gone with ND2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Daesun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">ND owns all.  You can't compare an extra 10% hitpoints with any other arch skill.  I only have ND2, but the hitpoint boost I got from that could only be obtained by winning a couple of drops in a ToV-capable guild.  ND can be obtained by anybody who's not afraid of boring grinding.<br />
<br />
And of course, if you *are* in a ToV-capable guild, ND boosts your HPs even more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Aeneran Orcreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Went ND2 myself as I felt the 70 odd hps would serve me better than a slight increase in crit rate.  Very happy so far.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>RykalKlopek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">i went <br />
CombatFury2 <br />
MentalClarity1 <br />
CombatAgility1 <br />
HealingGift1<br />
<br />
ND<br />
i couldn't care less about 2% more HP, or 70 more hp.  I do not take damage alot and when i do it is only till the mob gets mezzed or i jolt it off.  when it comes down to it either you are going down or your not.  I leave tanking for tanks, if more than one mob is pulled i will snare the others to pull agro untill they are mezzed so they do not agro on cleric when he heals tank, but it is nothing chloro does not fix during the fight.  <br />
<br />
CF2<br />
i thought i had wasted 4 points till i got on a raid and was criting alot more than most.  probably does not help dam/sec all that much but critical hits are cool.  just have to think about you could train in 2 things or improve this one.  just depends how you play.  anyways, after having CF2 at raids i am very happy with it, i trained in CF2 after that patch so not sure if it changed it, but i am happy<br />
<br />
MC is a no brainer, worth 2 points<br />
<br />
CA not really sure, seem to be taking a little less damage when i solo, hard to compare this really<br />
<br />
HG 600hp crit heals, nice to save mana when soloing, life savers when you have to be the one patching the tank waiting for a CH.  this has saved rears several times while grouping.  and there is nothing like landing a 600 point heal on yourself when running low while soloing, such a tension breaker.  besides when PoP comes out and I one day get 62, an 1166 crit heal would be too nice<br />
<br />
again aa abilities should be spent on how you play, i know other rangers that go ND2 and CA1 CM1 cause they tank alot for their daily guild exp grouping.  I like to combat and avoid being hit, and heal between pulls to top people off to save the cleric some mana</div></div><hr />

<br />
ND does not affect +hp buffs. It only works off your base hp, hp from gear, and hp from stamina effects. Aego is +1100hp and BoA is +1150.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>diarmad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I just went with CF2 tonight and am already wishing I went with ND2. I kept track of 50 kills with CF1 and 50 kills with CF2..I crit a great deal less with CF2 than I did with CF1. I was getting about 2 to 3 crits per fight with CF1...now I am lucky to get just 1 a fight. Maybe it is just bad luck..who knows...but it was my understanding that gaining a level in an AA skill was supose to make it better...not worse.<br />
Oh well, I guess I can always make the AA back.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Hawkwind Dniwkwak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">So many acronyms, argh. Can someone explain what they mean? :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Eolair Strongbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">hehe, lets see.  And this is as much for myself as anyone else, so I can keep track.<br />
<br />
MC = Mental Clarith<br />
CF = Combat Fury<br />
ND = Natural Durability<br />
CA = Combat Agility<br />
CS = Combat Stability<br />
SCF = Spell Casting Fury<br />
HA = Healing Adept<br />
HG = Healing Gift<br />
<br />
That's all I can think of off the top of my head.  And this is just Arch, not class.<br />
<br />
If you tend to be a tanker, I would say CA and CS are actually better than ND.  In a place like the planes, the complete dodging of an extra 300+ attack, and the decrease of 30 damage out of 300 every swing is invaluable.  If you are a raid style, ND is king to work against those AE spells and such.  CF is eye candy, and does increase DPS a bit since crits can do more than your normal max damage, not to mention you'll increase the number of bow crits you get.  *can't remember ever breaking 90 with my 10 damage weapon, but was doing up to 130+ with CF1 last night*  In all, the Healing Gift might occasionally mean something, but I think the others will help more in the long run.  If a 400+ heal would save someone's life just long enough for that CH to go off, who cares if you healed 800?  CH would have doen that anyway.  And rangers will never be designated healers no matter what.  Might be more helpful as a solo'er, but in all honestly you can get just as good exp in the planes in groups than you can solo.<br />
<br />
So far, I've gone MC1, ND1, CF1, and will probably be going for ND2 next.  I don't use spells anywhere NEAR enough to warrent spending AA's on them, nor do I really have the wisdom to use a lot of nukes anyway.  Haven't had the need to tank very much, so I'm gonna work on my HP and damage output mostly.</div></div><hr />
