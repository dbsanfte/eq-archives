Can anyone on test server verify this? I'm gonna try it when servers come back up. If we really are getting illusion potions we will FINALLY have something a little bit more useful to make with alchemy. /pray</div></div><hr />

<br />
They are selling for 300 each on Quellious</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Particulars please:<br />
<br />
Where do you buy the wormwood?<br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
Good places to get the various meats??<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">eqtraders.com has a list of good places to get meats under the &quot;how to do baking&quot; guide. <br />
<br />
Worm wood is bought in the new city, Gunthrak (sp?), in the lighthouse straight out from where you zone in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Unoeye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Err after the intial newness wears off, don't you think 78p is a bit much for an Illusion potion?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>KriFos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Cut the price down TEN TIMES? You proud of yourself? Helping to screw alchemy profit? 100pp? <br />
<br />
Sure, im a grandmaster alchemist with gm item.. I can make those with little failures... if i loot the meat myself - they will cost about 85pp (counting 7-8% failures) to make... sell them for 100pp? thats just great... 15pp profit... yeahaaaaa... no wait a min... I sold lots for 200pp each, and they are about 200-300pp on AB server... No reason you should fuxxor the prices up just to SELL... Hard enough to get the meat you need, if you buy it - the cost for the potions will rise... <br />
<br />
On another hand, no i dont think 85pp per potion is too expensive to make - or 200pp per potion sold... Why? Well, whats the fun when everyone run around illusioned all the time? I see this potion more of a fun potion to use when i want to, and to get into zones that i normally am kos to... (Chardok Cudgel quest maybe with illusion iksar?)<br />
<br />
Just my cents.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Halfling works.  78pp isn't cheap and I don;t see a huge market but hey it's fun. I am gonna try and load up on halfling potions har! And kitty and Dark elf!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Naala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Three questions.<br />
<br />
1)After &quot;consuming&quot; one of these postions does the effect last until you camp or is there a duration?<br />
<br />
2) Does the &quot;effect&quot; make you non KOS in a city that you are KOS in? (On a racial faction basis... meaning Dark Elves will love my kitty arse if I'm in illusion dark elf form, and can you do faction based quests that perhaps you couldn't do before?)<br />
OK.. that was 2 questions in one :)<br />
<br />
3) Can you click off the &quot;illusion effect&quot; at anytime?<br />
<br />
Chow Chow for Now,<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Vhalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">KriFos,<br />
<br />
Illusion potions ARE a novelty potions with 0 practical use (unlike sow) and dont give me the *i can use it so Im not KoS* bs because everyone knows that there is little that an iksar wants to go to old lands for anyways... I sell them for 15pp profit because I give rats @ss about making plat off Alchemy. Its the jackasses that make ridiculous prices on Alchemy that make it a non-profit buisness. <br />
<br />
NON-RIPOFF price = component price + 20%<br />
<br />
Farmed items are included in component price (eather its a time value you spent farming or bought from bazaar)<br />
<br />
Want to be sick-ritch in EQ? Get Tailoring to 250 and you will run out of ideas on what to spend your plat on.<br />
<br />
Good luck<br />
<br />
Edit: Duration is same as regular illusions, which is about 45minutes if im not mistaken, and it does change your faction standings in most old/kunark world.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Charge whatever the hell you wanna charge or what the market will bear. It's your time spent making them, how much is your time worth to you? You may not care about making money from Alchemy, others do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Arorot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">FYI ~ the illusion lasts about as long as a spell aka 30mins or so. Zoning , death, or camping of course removes the illusion. The illusion does use a buff slot and can be clicked off at any time. As far as KOSness goes if your religion is KOS to whatever race youre trying to mingle with youll still be KOS.<br />
<br />
A good place for a variety of meat would be the pirate camp in gunthak. Erudite , DE , human,Ogre ,Troll drops there I think also iksar and gnome. Oh and as a side note theres a named troll shaman that spawns inside the little fort that dropped a charm for me too. Forgot the charms name and mobs name offhand charm is some red feather thing and is effected by ........Charisma !   Yes unfailing reverence is useful. Well ok maybe not i didnt notice any stats modified or changed after buffing myself with it.<br />
<br />
Oh and i sold a pair of DE potions for 100plat each last night. Seemed liek a fair price to me and the ranger that bought them wanted 10 shots actually but a lack of meat kept me from filling the order.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">So wait where do you actually get the meat? And what other pieces do you need just wormwood?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Okotona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Please, this is one of the first really cool things about alchemy, I know people that'd pay hundreds for these...<br />
<br />
If we start selling at 100pp, and make low profit, people will EXPECT that they're only 100pp, and we'll continue to make crappy profit, like with SoW potions..<br />
<br />
I'm not saying anything like 500pp, just like 150-200pp so we all can benefit from it...<br />
<br />
I dunno, I just hope you all won't sell em for only 100pp, with my bad luck in alchemy my failure rate would destroy any possible profit =/</div></div><hr />
