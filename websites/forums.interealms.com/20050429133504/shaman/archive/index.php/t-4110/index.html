<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mongore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am currently level 42 ogre shaman. I have been camping HGs in RM and the occational Gornit in OOT. The money is nice in both these places but I still roll in only 250pp a night or 500pp a day, which is slow to me cause I got such a long ways to go. Could anyone give me some money making suggestions? I can't realy play the market because with bazaar it is hard to sell stuff for a higher price now.<br />
<br />
Thanks to anyone who posts a helpful ideas.<br />

P.S. I also have a few 56+ friends that might be willing to help me camp certain items one is a 60 necro so if you have any ideas on places to camp items for nice money that would be nice too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>DarkSidhe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Only thing I can suggest is to find the rare old-world item(s) that are worth some cash still. Camping plat in RM/OoT/RandomZone works, but it's a lot of work for a little payback.<br />
Alternatively, get another 8-12 levels and hit Seb crypt yourself with those friends...lot of people will say it's death (and it is) but it can be done. Went there with a group consisting of a 60 necro, 53 cleric, 52 or 53 druid, 51 rogue(me), 53 or 54 ranger and a 58 or so sk. The SK had the only epic there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ougabouga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, what I did, worked my butt off with HG's and anything else I could get pp off of, had about half saved up.  I also was getting very frusterated.  I went to SRO and got the AC and multi-quested the ring for 6K.  Be warned, it is a very aggravating camp.  People will say to you &quot;your a shaman, why do you need jboots&quot; and the KS'ing in the zone is unreal..no other word for it.  I noticed that the same people were there day after day also farming it, so I stopped feeling quilty.  If your patient and can handle the stress of this free-for-all zone then it may be an idea for you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Knowsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Nope nope, yer all wrong. I know how to make the plat fast :) So much of it, that at lvl 48 as an ogre after a MONTH of soloing I made enough to pay 37k for my JBB and continue to be fully equiped (255wis was 2500 mana before mana cap went away)<br />
<br />
Do the Coldain Military Bracer MQ.<br />
<br />
There is a great thread on Allakhazam about this.<br />
<br />
Things to know is that if you aren't a Rallos Ogre/Troll (but what Shaman ISNT a rallos ogre? ^_^) just make and alt and get him a port to GD, then find sow, lev, and invis and walk to CC and camp him. He will loot everything for the quest, just log him on when something drops.<br />
<br />
Another good thing to know is that you can buy a Blood Wolf harness in the bazaar for like 100pp. You will only need ONE harness to make cash...quest is bugged and quest dude gives you the harness back. Don't petition/bug this plz :)<br />
<br />
You willl want to have the alt bound in Thurg so when you get the Acid out of CC, you can jump down the ledge (get the acid by farming orcs...you will also get some lowbie drops off the Herbalist, Foreman, etc...) and die, free port to Thurg!<br />
<br />
When you initiate the quest by giving the Broodmother the Giant Control Harness, camp out and log on your Shaman, who WILL be camped out at the shardwurm cave ent OR the Coldain Mines, depending on how fast your connection is, I would recomend the mines to be safer.<br />
<br />
The first time you do the quest loot the bracer for youself, it's UBER. As in better then a JBB by FAR. Stats are 10ac 5str 6wis 5svc 5svm Extended Affliction:3 (EA:3 is found on only one other droppable item, be sure to advertise that too :) andthat the item sells for 40k :P)<br />
<br />
Now you know everything about this quest, and how to get a JBB.<br />
<br />
Sell the bracer for 5k MQ, after a day or two you will have enough money to buy a JBB...I've done it for a month and now I'm worrying about buying an ODS, Golem's Jawbone, Raptor Hide Cap, and Lodi Shield. This quest is INCREDIBALLY good for cash. You will sell them fast and well.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anothering thing I am seeing work is selling MQ Earring of the Solstices for 10k. You can usually pick up the MQ for 8k if you shop around, but hell, who cares. Just buy them for 10k. But if you don't want to do this quest (this quest WILL work, HAS worked, and WILL get me another 16k min) then you could sell these.<br />
<br />
Other possibility is Shawls. Someone is selling the 8th Shawl MQ on my server for 35k, if you want to be a tradeskiller then this is a VERY good idea, since it only costs about 16k to buy ALL of the items needed to do the quest. 35-16=19k gain for each quest. They are very hard, but they CAN be done. And when you do them, you will make a LOT of money.<br />
<br />
<br />
With any of these Cash schemes you will have your JBB in a week, even if you only play 4 days a week for 3 hours a day. They work, and I hope none of you have to pay as much for your JBB as I did. (21k cash a Bracer MQ and an Emerald Dragonscale BP - 20wis BP &gt;&lt;.....41k total)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Meener</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm confused...what part of the quest are you MQing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>HordainPrima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">He's MQ-ing the Giant Control Harness - he get's it ready to go on his Troll and camps it near the Broodmother.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Knowsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm not MQing anything. I'm just selling the loot rights to a mob that only spawns when a quest is done....so in effect I'm MQing nothing, but it's still basically a MQ because there's no better name.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mongore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Wow thanks for the info on the quest it sounds awsome and I will be sure to try it. What is the minimum level for this quest I haven't gotten a chance to play much lately but i am currently still level 42.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the Help.<br />
<br />
Mongore</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bubub the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Says that the Guy you have to kill for bracer is LvL 55.  So you are saying wait till almost 60 to do the quest?  Or are you saying you auction the MOB before you hand in the deal to the broodmother?  Sorry I am still pretty new to EQ just trying to find the fastest path to obtaining a JBB w/o doing hill giants, before lvl 45.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rigga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The coldain dwarf that drops the bracer is level 45 (He is the quest spawned version that appears outside the mines just before the broodmother shows up)<br />
<br />
He was fairly magic resistant to me as my level 45 shaman but once i got malise to stick (took about 3 casts) i was able to stick slow and root on him without much trouble and the dots landed fine. I root rotted him for a while since he has a good deal of hp's and after he was down to about 30% i ran in and meleed him down with my pet so he can be soloed around that level for anyone that is interested in getting the bracer for themselves.<br />
<br />
Thanks to Knowsow for the info i didnt really know anything about this bracer till i read this thread and although i havent tried selling the multi quest rights yet the bracer itself is well worth the relatively small amount of effort it takes to get this :) <br />
<br />
Extended Affliction III is great :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Seefar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'm new to this MQ thing too. So I'm just a little confused on how the buyer gets the item.  I guess they would have to go with you to GD, wait for you to kill the dwarf then loot the item? Or do you do the turn in and then they have to kill the dwarf?<br />
<br />
Sorry to be dense.  I would like to try this, and I sure don't want to *F* it up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Talsondar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Made 800+ in 2 hours today on Genoids.  Of course you will probably never be able to get that camp solo, hehe.  Of the couple hundred times I have popped into CC to camp check I have gotten it twice.  Most times there is a list as well.  On Prexus btw...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Rigga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The dwarf that has the bracer will not spawn without handing the controll harness to the broodmother, so in essence all you are actually selling is the ability to make this dwarf spawn.<br />
<br />
Its up to the buyer to kill the dwarf and take care of soughting out who loots it. You could help them kill it i suppose but why lose the faction if you dont have to, and if your using a level 1 troll/ogre warrior like i did to initiate the quest that character wont be much help :D <br />
<br />
Oh and if your going to use the mule character to do it i recommend trying to create a troll rather then an ogre, my ogre mule had a hard time fitting through doorways in thurg to hand in the acid from crystal caverns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Crug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ok I am confused.  So I have to do the entire quest or just turn in the blood wolf harness to the giant wolf trainer?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Seefar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yes, you have to do the whole quest.  I just tried this the other day and it's not that bad until you get to the part where the mule has to turn in the Giant Control Harness to the Broodmother.  She is inside the Shardwurm caves and there are other Shardwurms there that can see through invis and your mule will be KOS here.  It's very difficult to clear this area solo as some of these guys are pretty tough. <br />
<br />
Also, I haven't been able to find much information on the Broodmother, but somewhere I read that she is a 12 hour spawn.  How do you MQ something with a 12 hour spawn?  Your buyer is expected to camp the dwarf for 12 hours until Broodmother spawns?<br />
<br />
What am I missing here?  I would still like to complete this quest to get the bracer and get one for the friend running the mule that was helping me but I'm a little stumped on this last part.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shmokie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">As a quick note, the blood wolf harness is completely and utterly useless.  You don't need to turn it in at all to do the quest.  I have verified this personally (by doing the quest *grin*) -- get the bottle of acid, give it to the dorf for the gem, give gem to giant for different version of gem, give the gem you receive right back to the giant to get the control harness.<br />
<br />
Just an FYI.  Don't need to be killing those cute lil blood wolves if you don't feel like it =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Seefar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Good point.  Probably explains why he gives you the Bloodwolf Harness back. Not a bug after all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Rorg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Uhh, no... you have to turn in the harness as well... My brother and I did this quest MANY times... if you just turn in the gem he says something about how the gem is nice, but would be more useful with a harness...<br />
<br />
/shrug<br />
<br />
That's how it worked for us at least...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Hk2001</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Go in Invis, the wurms in the main tunnels do not see invis... walk right up to the Broodmother... The 2 wurms in her chamber DO see invis, but you can walk in between them with no aggro <br />
<br />
Worked for me at least</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Look at the banner above that would be the easiest way lol, sorry I couldn't resist...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Scylding</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Look at the banner above that would be the easiest way lol, sorry I couldn't resist...<br />
<br />
<br />
Don't give in the the evil plat sellers.  Don't it will only hurt you in the end.</div></div><hr />
