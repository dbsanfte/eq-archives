<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sebanis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm talking about the regen + root potions. After checking the alchemy section I'm thinking these are vendor sold. Problem is, as an iksar I have a bit of a problem when it comes to checking other cities for it, and it's not in Cabilis. Can't find it in Thurg either. I haven't checked Shadowhaven completely (I keep getting lost in there, grrr) so if anyone can help and give me a location where to buy these would be most appreciated :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>LithasMojobag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's been a long while since I checked but bark potions used to be sold in Rivervale. (many different vendors who sell potions in the halfling homes.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Pretty sure these are in Thurg, past the bank, go a bit further down the hall, cluster of stores on the left, female vendor.  If it is Bark potion she sells, it's crap, like 40 points of regen total, for 20p or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Szlia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Look better: Bark potions are sold in Cabilis West by the vendors in a tent on an Island. You know, the one half way between the Gauntlet and the Necro Tower...</div></div><hr />
