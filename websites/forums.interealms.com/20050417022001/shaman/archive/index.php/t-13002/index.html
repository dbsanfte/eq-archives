<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Metadone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, everyone says The Hole is like Heaven xp wise and I wanted to try it because I've stayed in CoM for a looong time.<br />
So I started pulling the first golem on the right but always had 3 golems coming. Tried to pull it with a debuff to reduce assist aggro, still got 3. Tried to pull the one on the left, same thing. Tried the guide that are on this forum, still 3 coming. Men, how can I brake these bad boys ? I've got the feeling that it is not possible, and I know it is possible as some already made it. Need I be a special level to pull them by 1 or 2 instead of 3 ?<br />
Thank you for your help.<br />
Regards,<br />

<br />
Best advice - leave there, go to LoY level up in the entrance to Nadox, come back and have another go when you level. Not much help I know, but there you go :p<br />

I hear another mob wanders up that way now. Just make sure to fight close to the water to avoid adds and to give some distance when they turn to run.<br />
