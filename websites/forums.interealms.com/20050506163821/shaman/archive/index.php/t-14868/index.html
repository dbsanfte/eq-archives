<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just had to post a note about how much I enjoy playing my shaman.  My main is a 56 warrior and I also have a 55 druid.  My shaman is a semi-twinked alt that's currently lvl 41.<br />
<br />
This weekend I was grp'd with a friends 43 monk (with mostly very bad gear - talking cloth here   :eek: ) in U2 in Echo.  We got to our camp and there were 3 fiends spawned and we were trying to figure out how to handle them since we couldn't single pull and I didn't want to wait for the FD/mobs walking back at different speeds routine.  So, I said go ahead and pull all of em and I'll pull them off one at a time with slow/root...worked like a charm :p   We also broke the 4 umberbulks spawn the same way (ok, I made a slight mistake initially and had to run for my life for a few seconds...but it was all ok in the end)<br />
<br />
Anyway, just wanted to let everyone know how much fun I'm having with the shammy :D  Can't wait until I get in the 60's to see what I can solo then!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tiorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have to agree, I am a lvl 43 Troll shaman with a lvl 52 Ranger, I love my Ranger dude, but with my Shaman theres just so much more that I can do when things get ugly.<br />
<br />
With the Ranger I can root, back up and take on one mob at a time<br />
- root parking - and yes I have become quite good at it.<br />
<br />
But in order to kill the mob, say there are 4 of them I have to close into melee range, when I am in range I am taking damage. (Remember Rangers get crappppppppy heals)<br />
<br />
My Shaman on the other hand can not only root 4 dark blues, he can kill them np.<br />
<br />
Root park the adds.<br />
<br />
Dot them<br />
<br />
Watch them die while not taking any damage.<br />
<br />
Pretty sweet.<br />
<br />
If in group, root them - slow them for the melee types and then dot the adds - so by the time the melee's get to them their half dead.<br />
<br />
Very sweet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Armed with a stick and a burst of fire, we make our way into the world. Early on we are close to warriors. But even then we stand apart. The inner fire glows in us. And the winter is soon ours to call.<br />
<br />
With the insects that come to distract our foe, we become a primal  force. As we progress we call the spirits of bear and boar, of monkey and ox. The poisen of snakes and the sickness of disease aare all oursto command. We can stand at a distance and watch our enemys rot from withen, but I for one find little pleasure in such a thing. <br />
<br />
I prefer to carry the fight to my enemy. With Bone and blood and Cold and steel, with the wolves spirit gnawing at the heel. I stand against the fury of a feeble enemys might. I crush them with the spirits that are mine to command and all the magiks my will stand strong.<br />
<br />
Time makes us stronger. Experiance makes us more flexible, Wisdom teaches us what we can effect and destroy. And Alone or at the fore in any battle we are the rock upon which armies break. <br />
<br />
Stand tall. Walk proud, And carry a big stick. <br />
