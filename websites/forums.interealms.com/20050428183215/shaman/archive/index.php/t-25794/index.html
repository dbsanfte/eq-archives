<br />
At some point just about every class has some nitwit trying to get them nerfed in some manner. I've even seen posts to &quot;nerf Priests&quot;. OMG! There isn't a class in WoW that someone hasn't whined about needing a nerf. Being a Hunter I hear it all the time about my class too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">faern,<br />
<br />
normally I am with you, but, Pallies are the most played class, taken into account they are one faction only.<br />
<br />
Also, they do not, by any means, have the lowest dps in the game, I routinely get hit for 200+ and crit for 500 +, this happens all the time.<br />
<br />
gear dependant? Who isn't? I am using level 48 and 50 weapons, because I cannot find anything else, my armor sucks, pallies have multiple lives which truly does extend their hps into the 12000 + range, that is tough. They are gods of pve, they may not kill fast, but man they can kill anything. I have serious pally envy, really.<br />
<br />
Battlegrounds come, the horde is going to get a serious ass kicking because of 50 screaming pallies being able to charge willy-nilly into any horde fortress and kill many targets, then just wander away with &quot;immune&quot; over their heads laughing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">LOL! Tell that to the pally 2 levels higher than me that I ganked in straight up 1v1 last night.  He didn't do anything to piss me off, but I just got some payback and was looking for some interest.  It was a really close fight, but in the end he was dead, I wasn't.  Yeah, I know it's only one instance, yeah, it means nothing, but pallys are beatable and before 40 they have no mobility.</div></div><hr />

Everybody doesn't?  I can't go 5 feet without tripping over one.  :)<br />
<br />
Not saying I agree with everything on the website, but it's a funny shirt.<br />
<br />
<br />
PS - I think your list of paladin 'cons' isn't really accurate.  Pally DPS is in the bottom half of the 9 classes, sure...but dead last?  Not sure about the talent trees but it seems that most classes have weird crap or useless talents in their trees.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A few high crits mean nothing. Hit for 200+? Crit for 500+? So what? My warrior was routinely hitting like that with 1h weapons from mid 40's.  What about the picture I saw, posted by you Mill(? not 100% sure it was you) of a troll rogue getting like a 1200+dmg crit at the high 40's or low 50's level range.  <br />
<br />
Although I am starting to loathe the fact that so many idiots play pally's (and I'm alliance!) seeing blatantly biased comments like this trying to skew perspective about how super overpowered omg uber the paladin class is just annoying.  You've been on the bandwagon throwing your comments about paladins since day one it feels like, and like gnome bashing, it's just starting to get old.  It's getting to the point now where, while you have some great comments to make, I just end up skipping over most of your posts because somewhere in most of them you've put a part of a 'pally rant'.<br />
<br />
In terms of DPS, paladins are easily the lowest of the alliance melee classes. Sure, put 'em up against a cloth class like priest or warlock and they'll probably outdamage them in pure melee, but the moment they start using their spells they'll probably outdamage a paladin as well. The only reason a paladin is considered such a powerful class is because they're like the energizer bunny; they just keep on going and going and going.  They don't do it fast, they can just pretty much do it all day long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Paladins are hardly the lowest DPS class; that's just propaganda thrown out to avoid a nerf.  Some level 60 rogue quoted his DPS as 200; my 45 paladin has a listed DPS of 154 (with a 39dps weapon) and that neglects procs and engineering toys that I could use.<br />
<br />
The following are the only paladin weaknesses I've encountered:<br />
1. Hard to maintain aggro efficiently and reliably (especially on multi pulls).  Its usually not a big deal if you are proactive about aggro generation, but if you're lazy (or want to be lazy) its an annoyance.<br />
<br />
2. Lack of ranged attacks.  The only fixes for this are engineering (long, one minute cool down on dynamite), linken's boomerang (not sure on the cool down since my paladin doesn't have it yet), 31 pt investment in the marginally useful (mostly useless) holy talent tab for the 30 second cool down mana inefficient nuke, or fight only undead.<br />
<br />
Yep, that's it for paladin downfalls, and they aren't that game breaking either.<br />
<br />
Strengths?<br />
1. Best AC in the game: plate armor, aura, talents to increase the effectiveness of both (this makes the assumption that warriors don't have similar - I really don't know).<br />
2. Priest quality healing in most instances: very few areas need more than the ~1300 heals that a 60 paladin can provide.<br />
3. Phys damage immunity for 20 seconds, spell immunity for 10 seconds: AND you can cast through both and melee (+50% atk speed) for 10 seconds.<br />
4. Good DPS: not the  BEST, but its certainly not the worst by any means.  I'd put paladins right after mages/rogues/hunters.<br />
5. Can solo YELLOW CON elites or lower at most levels: Anything that doesn't stun is easy, but does require *some* strategy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats a pretty small group.  Do you consider Druids a melee class?  Or just Warriors and Rogues?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Don't compare dps numbers unless you're sure you're using the same program. WoW default doesn't equal Cosmos, which doesn't equal whatever else. As for paladin dps, sure it's low, but then again they still can crit for a 400 at a time which as a rogue is a great deal of my hitpoints. Hitpoints that I have to way to really recover in battle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">And how hard do I hit a paladin? Hmm, let's see, SS about 100-200, a 5 point evis for about 450-750 top, with crits. Plate sucks ass. Only thing keeps me alive is the use of my special abilities and good bandages and pots. Even then it is ugly.<br />
<br />
No, Pallies DPS is not so bad at all, it really is just mistruths to try and mitigate the whiners.<br />
<br />
A good pally is nigh invincible. Thankfully, truly, alot of them really do suck, such an easy class to level, alot of the battlenet kiddies went right to it.<br />
<br />
Sucks when a pally shows up, because you know you have to devote an entire group at least 25-30 seconds to kill them, or you have to ignore them and let them heal.<br />
<br />
And they can kill you, very well thank you.<br />
<br />
<br />
So if you are a good pally, please stay away from me, I do not want to fight you :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">750 eviscerate with crits, you gotta be joking me.

<br />
Walruss, plate mitigation can be up to like what, 50 + %. An evis is I believe, 935 damage max, on cloth peeps I can hit 1400-1700 with crits occasionally yes, plate? Plate just sucks. I am better off actually using a rupture or some crap.<br />
<br />
Jin, eviscerate is not dependant upon weapon damage hehe, a nice little plus for those dagger guys. My SS will be higher than a dagger rogue, but evis is essentially the same.<br />

Come, its funny, you know you wanna laugh. **** i almost wanna buy it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Grimdreg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Maybe its just because I play a shaman, the other most overpowered class in the game, but I never have problems with paladins 1v1.  I just keep them snared and flame shocked/searing totemed and earth shock any unshielded heal attempts.  A couple of lucky windfury procs and they've burned two shields and use the last one to run, which is instant death versus a shaman.  <br />
<br />
So, in conclusion, Nerf Shamans!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Yeah I gotta admit after level 50 they are cake for me in 1v1.  I just hate having to attack a group with one in it, especially outnumbered its impossible to take out targets quickly enough to survive.  That is unless you have mages with you.  Mages are the most complete PvP class in my opinion, good in both dueling and groups.</div></div><hr />
