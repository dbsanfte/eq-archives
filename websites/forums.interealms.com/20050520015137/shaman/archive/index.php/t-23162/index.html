<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys, I'm looking for a good site where I can sort through the different augments that are available to purchase. Mainly I'm looking for the +dmg augments that can fit on type 4 weapons, but I'm having a hard time finding them on allakhazam.. if anyone can direct me to a better place to look, maybe with a filter, it'd be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Would this be what youre looking for?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My favorite:<br />

www.squidbox.com/ldon/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">exactly what I was looking for, only I have one problem.. none of the augs are what I want! :(<br />
<br />
I could have sworn I saw a type 4 damage aug somewhere..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Procs could be interpreted as +dmg in a way. But again you might already have considered that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I fiddled with the sites provided and I couldnt get it to display what he was looking for either.<br />
<br />
There are some augs what are for weapons of differeing delays that directly add to the damage of the weapon.  Like a +3 added to damage (minimum delay 20) that would turn a 12dam/30delay weapon into a 15dam/30 delay.<br />
<br />
Gonna play around with another and see what I can find for ya.<br />
<br />
EDIT<br />
<br />
OK, found a few<br />
<br />
Heated Desert Emerald Fragment (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=42138)<br />
Sparkling Emerald of Ravaging (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=42113)<br />
Raw Emerald Shard of Malevolence (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=42063)<br />
<br />
Most seem to be type 6, with one type 5.  There were one or two more that I found, but they listed to damage bonus, so I didnt include them,<br />
<br />
I used the EQdiva LDon search engine;  I find it to be really reliable.  Unfortunatly, it doesnt like Mozilla, so if you are using firefox you will have to swap to IE or it wont work (I know, but they are bards; what are ya gonna do?)<br />
<br />
Heres a link :  http://www.eqdiva.com/eq/items/LDoN.aspx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Maybe the sites are ill-updated?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I limited a search to type 5 and 6 on the squidbox page.  Heres what I found:<br />
<br />
http://www.cardplace.com/eq/ldon/list.cgi (type 6)<br />
http://www.cardplace.com/eq/ldon/list.cgi (type 5)<br />
<br />
You just had to know what slot type to search for, or it wouldnt even show them to you.  When I ran a search for weapon augmets of any type those didnt come up.<br />
<br />
I still prefer the EQDiva....been using that one for a long time though.  This one is new to me today.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">LDoN merchant listing (http://www.rpgexpert.com/330.html)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ok, here's the situation... I got a monk friend that is going to be getting a Rakusha Bo (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=23137) very shortly, and we were looking for something non-proc to aug it with that would increase his dps. I thought I had seen a +damage augment that would fit in type 4 slots(which is what this weapon requires) but I can't see that anywhere in any of my searches. I found several type 5 and type 6, as ya'll have said, but it's not quite what I'm lookin for.<br />
<br />
If it comes down to it, he'll just get a 150dmg proc to put on there, but we were hoping not to do that.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for the help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i belive that all type4 augs are procs....not entirely sure, but have never heard of one that you can buy in LDoN with AP<br />
<br />
there is type 6 that is non proc increase in melee DPS through dmg/delay.  is that what you might be thinking of?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Ok, me and my buddy found one, unfortunately it still isn't gonna work =(<br />
<br />
There's a +3dmg augment for 2handed weapons that is type 4.. but it's 40dly weapons and above only. Thanks for the help guys</div></div><hr />
