<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Trueshotz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok im currently level 46 Fear kiting in JP....I've had no problems yet,  If i got an add i would just root and run no big deal. At 50 or 51 im plannin to start and finish epic no leveling in between just strait epic.......I was wondering if 50 or 51 is a good level to do epic since i see that to get a group in PoP you need your SW.....after i hit 50 or 51 and do my epic i wanted to know if i could do PoJ at 50  i saw people of that level doing it but is it easy to get a group at that level?? Basically once i hit 50 or 51 and do my epic where should i go......When should i start doing AA points,and wat is the lowest level i can group in any of the planes?? ok thank you for all your input it really helps. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">47 is the techinacal min. level<br />
50 is when you MIGHT get a group (cleric's can easily get groups now)<br />
55 is when you really stand a good chance at getting in a group</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Trueshotz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">And lets say that i am 50 and have my epic should i keep on leveling or go AA??? if i keep leveling were should i go at 50?? and if i do AA where should i go??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">At 50 gain a level.  You cannot work on AA until you hit 51.<br />
<br />
AA is very much a matter of playstyle and preference.  The general consensus is that in general, level &gt; AA.  Depending on where you do your xp'ing, however, it might be worthwhile to hit 51 and then work on AA until you max out runspeed.<br />
<br />
I'm catching up to a formula I'm gonna be following until I hit 60; get 1 AA in 51 get 2 in 52 get 3 in 53 and so on.  Whether this is optimal, I doubt many here would agree but I'm having fun doing it and thats what counts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Swiftwind or not, you will have a problem getting a group in PoP until your mid 50's.  Lower level rangers are considered mana sinks.  I know that I have problems getting groups by myself (54 ranger).  it is only when I duo a 60 shamen I can find a group.  <br />
<br />
As to AA, it is much easier to get AA at 60, or even 55 then it is at 51.  The benefits of getting to 55 out way the AA you could do in the same time period.</div></div><hr />
