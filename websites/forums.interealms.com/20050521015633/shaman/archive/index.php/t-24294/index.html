<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wilcas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">If I wanted your mag, I would buy it.  Better yet, send it to me for the $26 you peal out of my wallet every month.<br />
<br />
I don't accept popup ads from web sites, REALLY annoys me to pay for them; especially when they are deliberatly made to look like the service agreement - but with the click-offs reversed so i can accidently get even more of their advertising.  Show some corporate responsibility and courtesy to your paying clients.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Better yet, send it to me for the $26 you peal out of my wallet every month.<br />
<br />
That should read:<br />
<br />
&quot;Better yet, send it to me for the $26 I voluntarily allow you to peal out of my wallet every month.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aside from that, I have to agree. The ads are ridiculous. Stick a quick paragraph in the patch message, leave it up for like a week if you feel you have to, and then take the damn thing down and relegate it to the SOE Live site. Changing the &quot;skip&quot; and &quot;order&quot; buttons around is sketchy on the lowest of levels, but it's nothing that can't be avoided on the part of the gamer by paying a bit more attention.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Leaving it up for a week is not acceptable, give me the option to NEVER see another frigging annoying add is acceptable though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Agreed big time.  Get rid of the F'ing thing.<br />
<br />
And 99.9% of the time I would squarely place blame on the player being lazy and messing something up... but come on.  When I'm logging in my accounts every single day and get into a pattern of click, enter, enter, enter, click, enter.   And they throw in something like that to the start up screen... Calling BS on this one.  And I agree how sketchy do they have to be to move the buttons back and forth.  How do they even justify this?<br />
<br />
I really wish a dev (or who ever is to blame) could give us a reason why they put these things on during start up.  I agree make it a big notice that pops up 5 times max that says &quot;If you would like to read more about how you can sign up for X, click the itty bitty button on the side of this message.  If you want to be left alone to play the game and not be harrassed click the BIG F'ING BUTTON THAT SAYS &quot;LEAVE ME ALONE TO PLAY THE GAME&quot;<br />
<br />
Anyone know how to cancel if you've already accepted this? :/  I admit, it was late one night after getting BOOTED from the game for no reason and I accidently accepted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yes - you supposedly can cancel from the &quot;Manage my account&quot; link on the EQLive site.  Check there - the name of the section might be somewhat different, but I'm sure you'll be able to figure out what I really &quot;meant&quot;.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yep really annoying.<br />
Not only do i have to constantly click no but being a Brit i couldnt even subscribe to the ****ing thing if i wanted to.<br />

Either I cannot figure out what you meant, or it can't be done.  There are 4 buttons under &quot;My Account&quot; &quot;Edit my Registration&quot;. all of them deal with Email ads from various areas of Sony and their paying &quot;associates&quot;; not the in-game popups. If there is another place to change this, it in not intuitive - at least intuitive enough for me to find.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>KumoeSpearbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think sneaky Ugzug is telling you to cancel your subscription.<br />
<br />
He's so sneaky, that troll.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Kumoe gives me more credit than I'm due.  LOL<br />
<br />
I was actually talking about cancelling a purchase.  I thought there was a place where you could cancel an expansion that you purchased online.<br />
<br />
However, Kumoe's idea works just as well... and you'll NEVER have to worry about another pop-up in the EQ client EVER!  It worked for me!</div></div><hr />

Shouldnt have too. Show me once, fine, but there should be a &quot;never see again&quot; option RIGHT there on that screen. Forcing us to go to their website, where we are inundated by even more advirtising, is lame.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Does anyone know what numbers to put in the Eqclient.ini file to make the add quit popping up?  Then again the last couple times I've tried that kind of thing it hasn't worked.  Think it worked for getting the pop up for LDoN to go away but nothing past then?  Actually looking though the EQclient.ini I'm not finding a field like there were for the LDoN and Omens.<br />
<br />
Anyone got any better ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I suggest petitioning/bug repping and other equally harrasing actions in game to get this issue looked at right away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>crollub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I will be buggin petitoining for this to be gone or for a never show this crap again option everytime I log in<br />
<br />
This kinda spamming and popup nonsense needs to stop now</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>vincenzovs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Agreed.<br />
<br />
This kind of advertising, and even having the cheek to put a button there that a kid might accidentally press....<br />
<br />
Can we feedback to Sony that this makes us dislike them as a company and pushes us away from everquest rather than pulling us?<br />
<br />
Give us the spam ONCE. But not 8 times a week please.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Buzcam_Aro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I had petitioned the harrassment I was receiving from this pop up every 2-3 times I logged on, each of my accounts. I pointed out it was crafty how they swapped the Skip and Order buttons from their traditional positions and offered no way to disable the GD thing. <br />
<br />
<br />
I received a nicely worded letter about how it would be gone after next patch and instructions on how to cancell had I accidentally ordered. It was a  formed response about 3 pages long, so the feed back they are getting seems to be universally poor imo.<br />
<br />
<br />
Shame on SOE.</div></div><hr />

There was an intuitive way to cancel the pre order of Omens, but I couldn't figure it out for the magazine. That part of the my account section seems to have gone missing. I couldn't even figure out if I had actually ordered it. I clicked order but in my sleepy pissed off state I closed the popupwindow before I could see what it had to say--Does that order it? The damn add still comes up thats for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Khubla Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">This works to stop that annoying nag screen to buy their magazine when you log into EQ.<br />
<br />
Open up the eqlsPlayerData.ini file with notepad and changing the two lines containing weborder to this: <br />
<br />
WebOrder1FirstOffer=1100000000 <br />
WebOrder1LastOffer=1100000000</div></div><hr />

This thread is a great spot to share that information! :)<br />
<br />
I know I havent gotten a response yet and still have it ordered on one of my 4 accounts.</div></div><hr />
