Any recommendations on which one to play on? If I remember correctly I recall a post where it said that the main thing to concentrate on would be resists, is this true? On the pvp servers how hard is it to do the so called traditional path of leveling, Oasis 12-19, HHP or LOIO 20-30, FM 30-35 , Overthere etc. Or should I try to get on the moon? Or stick closer to our home points?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LottoBS</div><div class="date">05-05-2002, 02:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It all depends on what race/alignment you want to play.<br />
Alot of people will go out for their way to kill you if your a good alingened lightie in Lake of ill omen .. =)<br />
Same rule apply to all other areas, in general... darkies dont like lighties and lighties dont like darkies =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bladebane</div><div class="date">05-05-2002, 02:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It would depend on what type of pvp you would like. If you want definite set teams  I would suggest sullon zek. Tallon is guild vs guild pretty much since they never decided to hardcode it as the 4 teams. Vallon is more light vs dark from what I hear. Rallos if you like item loot but it might be hard as a melle until you can get some no drop to level in.<br />
<br />
Resists are pretty much needed for a ranger to be good at pvp. Magic is the first you should build up so you can't be snared or rooted. Its fairly cheap to get as well (sarnak tabard, Dwarven ringmail if your an elf, 7mr bracers, splitpaw mask, black alloy/iron coif). <br />
<br />
I wouldn't suggest going to overthere to level unless your on rallos but the rest of the spots are alright. I usually picked spots that are closer to a bind point since you will die more often on a pvp server. <br />
<br />
If you do play on tallon we have a player made rule that you should loot and scoot to another zone if you died from pvp. If you want to stay ask the person that killed you they will usually let you if they are nice. Bindrushing (getting your bod and attacking the person that killed you) is generally frowned on and will get you corpse camped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Akuri Shadowleaf</div><div class="date">05-06-2002, 02:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">never played too much on rallos zek but keep in mind any race can pk any race and it is item loot.  + or - 5 levels is the pvp limit<br />
<br />
sullon zek, any level can kill any level.  xp death when you die in pvp, and from what I've heard SZ is greifing hell.  the teams are divided up by your deity<br />
<br />
tallon zek, sleeper is awakened, teams are broken up into 4 teams by race ((elves (high, wood, half), humaniod (human, barbarian, erudite, vah shir), darkies (iksar, troll, ogre, dark elf), shorties (halflings, dwarves, gnomes)).  top guild is a 4-team guild.  haven't played much on tallon zek.  it's + or - 8 levels for the pvp level limit<br />
<br />
Vallon Zek is the server I play on.  It is + or - 8 levels as well.  There is only 1 guild that is clearly ahead of the others.  There are about 2-4 guilds just below the highest one, and then there's about everybody else.  The server has mostly become lightie vs darkie with the top guilds being 3-team guilds (all races except darkies).  Right now the darkies are a bit down and we lighties control most of the server.<br />
<br />
As far as how to play on a pvp server...  well, that's a very large topic and one that is still debated on pvp server msg boards.  Basically, play with your head, don't expect to level too fast, don't expect to gear up too fast, learn how to play pvp as opposed to pve, develop a good reputation, and learn as you go.<br />
<br />
Gearwise... well...  like all gear questions i answer this: it depends on your gear as a whole, and not 1 piece vs. 1 piece.  The major difference gear-wise on a pvp server is that resist gear is required at level 6 until level 60, whereas on a blue server you don't have to worry too much about resists until the high 40's.  At high level you'll probably have your &quot;main&quot; set of gear and two bags or so of alternate gear depending on the pvp situation (not unlike blue servers at high level really).  <br />
<br />
Rangers in PvP... it all depends on how you play.  If you go out there and think you're a warrior you'll get your ass handed back to ya.  If you learn and play smart, you can be a monster in pvp.  The only ranger on Vallon that I know who has AM3 and endless quiver is a friggin BEAST in pvp.  <br />
<br />
you'll need to carry a bag of utility stuff (pumice stones, potions such as envenomed heal which will instantly cure tashani when it gets cast on you). <br />
<br />
you'll need at least 2 sets of weapons.  1 set as your main set of weapons (highest damage output weapons) and you'll need a jousting weapon (the highest damge 2hander you can find, the delay on the weapon is irrelevant).  some end up having several sets of weapons (for instance they'll have they're epics as main set, a 33/51 as their jousting weapon, and a Journyman's stick so they can try and proc tashani on an opponent, very hard to land a snare at high level without somehow debuffing your opponent)<br />
<br />
these are just ramblings off the top of my head, it's really something  you have to get a feel for.  It's a lot of fun, and after 2 years on a pvp server I don't see myself ever going back to a blue server.</div></div><hr />

A light could probably lvl there now too though since it's a dead zone. population probably maxes around 20 at peak times. <br />
<br />
Yes, Sleeper has been woke here. The top guild, Pandemonium, is a 4 team guild and controls all the uber mobs. <br />
<br />
www.pandemonium.cc<br />
<br />
There are still light guilds and dark guilds around. Such as Veneration, who is a light only guild ( No darks ) and is the second best guild on the server. All the other top guilds are also 4 team. <br />
<br />
Like said above, TZ is alot of guild vs. guild warfare. <br />
<br />
I'd say good MR is a must on any pvp server... a good temper also helps. If you can't control your words in pvp, you just end up looking like a moron.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yuglooc</div><div class="date">05-06-2002, 09:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My experiences on Rallos Zek (±4 level limit on PvP, one item + coin loot, no race/class/deity PvP restriction) is that the normal blue server leveling path is much more difficult.  Outdoor zones where experience comes easily are the nastiest when it comes to PvP attacks.  For instance, solo fear kiting of snow cougars in Iceclad Ocean isn't a viable option on Rallos Zek.<br />
<br />
I can't speak for the post-50 game, where 30 vs. 30 epic PvP battles in the Planes are not unusual.  In the pre-50 game, I'd be sure I was in a full group with a VERY small level range when hunting in the normal outdoor zones.  Having one player 3 or 4 levels above everyone else often means death to that person - the PKs DO look at you from a distance, and WILL attack when you least expect it and when you're ill prepared.<br />
<br />
You're less likely to be attacked in dungeons (with few exceptions).  I learned about Droga and Nurga while playing on Rallos Zek - they're great places to work on indoor (meaning no SoW or Harmony) fighting skills with minimal risk of encountering PKs.<br />
<br />
I haven't played on the other PvP servers.  They do have the advantage of lower risk (no items can be lost, except possibly on Sullon Zek, where corpse camping is legal).  However, you'd have to deal with the politics there - the idea of 4-team guilds is bothersome to me.  (That allows for the &quot;invulnerable healer&quot; tactic, in which a group consisting of one high elf cleric and five evils attacks a group of elves.  The elves CANNOT attack the high elf cleric, who is helping the evils.)  Also, it's more difficult to get to some places thanks to territorial control.  I'd imagine it would be a lot harder to get to Nagafen's Lair as a ranger on Tallon Zek than it would be on Rallos Zek.<br />
<br />
Yes, having decent MR (to reduce the chance of being snared, rooted, or blinded) is more important.  On Rallos Zek, it's a good idea to have a &quot;backup set&quot; of armor for traveling.  Losing a banded item or +7 MR ring is no big deal at level 30; having that ivy etched piece that you just spent eight hours getting or the 5AC 55HP ring you paid 200pp for HURTS.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gavving</div><div class="date">05-06-2002, 11:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, since VI redid their website, they've hidden the PvP ruleset information.  Kinda makes things more challenging.<br />
<br />
As for which server to play on...  Tough call.  SZ is much more black and white, hardcore kind of server.  No rules except no cussing or insults.   RZ is quite a bit different due to item loot and 4 level range.  VZ/TZ are the same except for player created environment and rules.  <br />
<br />
As for leveling...  On VZ, lvling in Oasis will probably get you some PvP action while leveling, which can either be fun or annoying.  But pretty much if you played a Ranger you could level in those areas.  Now if you were playing a dark team class that'd be a different story.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NeoTZ</div><div class="date">05-06-2002, 03:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sullon Zek - Way overpowered Dark team.  Population for teams is like 70% dark team, 25% neuts, 5% Good.  Not much fun losing exp to pvp. lvl 60s can gank you when you are lvl 6.<br />
<br />
Rallos Zek - Item loot sucks for the starting player, Never know who your enemies are really sucks.<br />
<br />
Vallon Zek - TeamvsTeam in that you cannont attack someone on your own team, but you can heal those on other teams.  Resulting in 3 Teams Vs 1 (lights vs Darks).  Clear cut on who your enemys are but... I feel it is kinda blue due to the fact you don't have that many enemys.<br />
<br />
Tallon Zek - (my server) Same as Vallon Zek except for one detail, The server has Turned Guild vs Guild.  Basically lvls 1-40 it is still Light Vs Dark in determining who your friends are, and sort of the same way 40-60.  If you are unguilded you fall into a category of light or dark depending on your race.  If you ARE guilded 50+ well, your Guild is your team.  Light guilds (3teamers) still help eachother out as as Dark guild help eachother out. But if you are in a 4 team guild, you are on your own pretty much.<br />
<br />
Personally, I love playing on Tallon Zek.  There was a time when I loathed what the server became (4teaming).  But, after playing so long, seeing what imbalance hardcoding has down to Sullen Zek, I am very happy with the way it has become.  There are friendly fights whereever you go.  You pvp to survive, kill or be killed, and it makes playing EQ way more fun.  <br />
<br />
Prepare to Die.  You WILL die, and die a lot.  Accept it and play accordingly, get your body after you die and find someplace else to go. Make it so that every time you do die you learn from it, at become a better player from it and you will have fun.<br />
<br />
Yes, the Sleeper is awakened on Tallon Zek,  but it was awakened in Style.  Pandemonium (top Guild) were farming Sleepers Tomb for several months, not allowing ANYone else in to get primal ( yes , yes, they left some mobs up a few times, blah blah blah =P).  So, Veneration (2nd most powerful guild), Ganks the 3rd warder and awakens the sleeper late one night so that they could deter Pande away from Sleepers and start farming Primal.  But one week later, after the sleeper killed everything in Skyshrine, the Warders spawn again, and Pande gets 2 more monk robes. Oh what a fun server this is Indeed.<br />
<br />
I'd say join Tallon Zek, and Make either a Halfling Ranger or Human Ranger.  Halfling ranger to Join 'Short Unity', Human Ranger to Join 'Retribution Reborn'.  Short Unity is better though.  They are the only non dark one teaming guilds left, and they will teach you how to become a good pvper, both in Skillz, and in etiquette.  Plus, you'll have fun =).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Junun</div><div class="date">05-06-2002, 03:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Everyone posted pretty accurate info on the servers as far as i can tell.<br />
<br />
I just want to reiterate that a ranger with AM3 is something you dont take lightly. Ask anyone who is in range of me :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Loga</div><div class="date">05-08-2002, 01:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a 54 warrior on VZ.  The advice given here is good info.<br />
<br />
One thing though that bothrs me about pvp is that it has really become a disorganized slaughterrfest where everyone is trying to kill eveyrone not on their team or in their guild just to kill them.  Basically roleplay is shot out the door completely and it becomes a player murders player.<br />
<br />
Even in the dark ages there were ramificatiions to killing someone, either religious or otherwise.  I have always found it totally out of character and out of roleplay to actually kill someone.  I guess it is the mechanics that Verant set up.  Player attacks a mob and nearly dies winning the battle. and someone on a differing race is watching and kills the player while they are nearly dead.  This happens alot.  My first day on pvp this happened to me and a friend.  It has never ceased since.<br />
<br />
If it weren't the scenario where the player waited to kill you after your fight they will kill you near the end, then kill the mob and take the exp from it too and the loot.  This is what some do.<br />
<br />
The level limits are silly in pvp.  Think of it this way.  Some players, mostly darkies, love to sneak around in the outskirts of town and pick off newbies.  If someone of a high level sees this happening there is nothing they can do about it.  Even if they were a healer they'd be yelled at for healing the other player.<br />
<br />
All in all I think PvP is good.  It is where all the hotheads go for the most part.  I wish a few more would go that way.  I have also found that those that are really skilled at pvp are rare.  There are those that are highly skilled.  But the vast majority are just, run at the guy and whack him with your swords or gank him during battle or kill them after a rez (even though there are loot and scoot player policies).<br />
<br />
Basically Verant didn't create a good system.  All they did was create variety where the players can smack each other around to their own liking.<br />
<br />
Now that we are 3 years into the game it is still rare to see pvp servers that have many guilds powerful enough to do the likes of ST or NToV, etc.  I'm just saying they are behind the curve.  Also I'm saying their knowledge and teamwork and kinship is all shot to hell.<br />
<br />
One thing I do regret about not playing a ranger on PvP is that I'd love to have my AM3 and EQ knock some players heads when they move into my line of fire.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is true, pvp servers as a whole are behing the pve-only servers.  HOWEVER, I strongly disagree that our knowledge, teamwork, and kinship is &quot;shot to hell&quot;.  Teamwork is the only thing that works on a pvp server, kinship is very very strong when you have to battle for zone control when uber_mob_001 pops, and our knowledge...well...we all do the same things and read the same spoilers.</div></div><hr />
