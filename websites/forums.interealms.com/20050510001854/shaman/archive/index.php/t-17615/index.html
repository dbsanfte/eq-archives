<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I seem to prefer hard adventures to normal adventures. So far I think done mostly EC for had adventures and done mistmoore twice. The 2 mistmoore, one was pass by 8 mins the 2nd was fail by 1 min(annoying).<br />
On the second had a chanter and necro in group and neither really wanted to charm a lvl 65 mob(. <br />
So a few questions, what is your preferred group make up for a hard adventure?<br />
Personally I find a monk or chanter is good to have. Not necessarily both though. Or even having 2 tankers worked well or a bard pulling.<br />
<br />
2nd question, is what hard adventures have you tried?  <br />
All the ones I have done are slaughter apart from the one I failed which was an assasination. Thing about assasination is that the named is most likely with a group of mobs and hits hard like 1200 yesterday I think. Collect someone suggested could be better on hard but I am dubious because I think its more dependant on the size of the dungeon you get. Rescue is basically Assasination but having to use extra time to get the rescued back. <br />
<br />
Also as a note, found loot from hard adventures can be nice upgrade for some people and some are really nice sellables 60-80k. Not sure what kind of loot other people have come across.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ideal group for hard would be something along the lines of :<br />
<br />
SHM, CLR, ENC, WAR, RNG, misc DPS<br />
<br />
Shaman slows/debuffs/patch healing<br />
Warrior tanking (duh)<br />
Enchanter gets a charm pet, debuffs, and mezzes<br />
Cleric heals (duh again)<br />
Ranger tracks, snares, and of course dps.<br />
<br />
After that just add some random DPS class or a split tank or whatever...  That's my IDEAL group, but lots of combos can work just fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Personally I've done 9 hard adventure, all successes so far, with 7 in ruj and 2 in Miraguls now. Most have been assassinates altho have done a couple slaughters. Haven't tried any collects or rescues yet.<br />
<br />
Personally my typical group starts with me and my roommate (65 warrior) and a good cleric. Next thing is an enchanter and we've used several different ones in our guild. We usually add on to that a bard and a dps. The dps has been a monk, a ranger or a mage so far.<br />
<br />
In our groups the bard has does the pulling and seems to do a good job with lul and fade. The enchanter charms a mob and does crowd control with the bard. With the charmed pet we have pleanty of dps to handle any of the missions and with the bard to help with crowd control recharming is pretty easy and safe. With this type of group we have succesfully handled a 7 mob pull on hard with out any deaths.<br />
<br />
We've had a couple close ones and one extremely close one but we're 9 for 9 so far. The closest we cut it was on an assassinate which always seem to be as far away as possible on the map and we killed the target with 1 minute left in the adventure window and 4 mobs mezed in camp while we here killing him.<br />
<br />
As far as the charming goes there's a specific mob type in each dungeon that is the only one thats charmable. Also the level 65's aren't charmable have to find a blue con version of that mob.<br />
Guk- the eyes (beholder)<br />
Miraguls- the holgresh<br />
Mistmore- the mummies<br />
Ruj- the wolfs<br />
Tak- Not sure =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ciele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">SHM, CLR&lt; ENC is the base of a group with a shaman I think.  Sometimes if everyoen else is really strong you can switch the cleric for a druid.  But SHM + ENC makes a real good team in charming stuff which makes for an easy Hard adventure.   The remaining 3 should be a tank and two DPS, I prefer at least one monk, to handle big room splits if you get one of the sucky dungeons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i usually switch out a chanter for a bard...the bard can mez and pull very well.<br />
did hards everywhere but MM and guk, and did all types of adventures (slaughter being the easiest by far).<br />
<br />
did war,sk, shaman,cleric,wizard, rogue/necro..we did fine<br />
<br />
did bard, war/sk/pally, cleric, necro/ranger, rogue, shaman...we did fine<br />
<br />
i wouldn't go in with anything under a 7.5k tank...i did go in with an 7k SK who had no defencive AAs and we won (the cleric was kick ass though).<br />
<br />
i think a decent cleric or a great druid is a must.  really need some form of crowd control or a way to single pull.  Must have a slower.  i would say velious boss mob gear or better is the min gear requirement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Jeez, at 52 getting anyone to try a hard mission is like pulling teeth. Personally, I think hard is better to do early when its not quite as hard as lvl 65 adventures can be. <br />
<br />
But...my group is shaman, cleric, chanter, necro, warrior/SK rogue. Seems to do OK.  I would really like to try a shm, cleric, chanter, necro/mage, mage, SK sometime too. I've been very very successful with pet centric groups in LDoN, but I don't know how it would translate to a level 50ish hard mission. Again, no one ever wants to do hard at my level so most times I give up and go with one of the tells spammin me for a normal level slower.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">my hard level 65 adventure groups are shaman, cleric, bard, (tank-monk, pally, warrior) and 2 others, sometimes including a second cleric and other strange combos.<br />
<br />
We can all use the loot that drops, the aa is decent, on par with our former exp zone of tactics and 105 points is nice.<br />
<br />
I've done hard adventures in every theme.  The worst by far is guk.  Guk sucks, I think I like Rujark best, but those mobs run away real fast, snarer is nice there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've done a lot of hards. My favorite class to have along is a bard with fading memories. They flat out rule here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah I was reluctant to choose guk on a hard and you have verified it does suck. Not sure what miraguls or Takish is like on hard, Miraguls somebody said was easiest on hard on par with Rujarkian.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Just to elaborate further for you mcroc, there are a few things that make Guk unattractive to me.  <br />
<br />
The terrian is one, there are these stupid bumps all over the dirt part of the floor that obscure your view ( You cannot see your target. ) if you are shrunk.  There are small lips on the doorways that do the same.  There are planks are hard to pull across and if you try to fight near them, god forbid someone falls in the water, then you have the whole land/water casting issues.<br />
<br />
Next is resists.  I have to malos every mob on Guk hard pretty much.  I don't have to do that in Tak/Ruj/Mir... though I often do malos anyways, since I can't really afford resists - if I don't get agro then the tank is taking too much damage.<br />
<br />
More mobs enrage in Guk than in any of the other dungeons I have spent a lot of time in.  20 tak, 18mir, 5-8 in the other 3.  This means my dog dies all the time (yeah I am one of those that think his 20dps is worth it and I don't use talisman of alacrity thanks ;))<br />
<br />
Completely subjectively, read at your own risk, the mobs just seem to have higher atk in Guk.  After doing 20 tak, 18 mir then moving to Guk, the mobs here are hitting our tank harder, owning our puller (7k/1500ac bard) and owning me when I get agro.<br />
<br />
Finally, the Eyeball type mobs.  They have 3x as many hitpoints as any mob in any of the other dungeons.  That really slows you down, whether you are on a slaughter, assassinate or whatever.  They are unrootable, so I often have to tank them for a while if we have a monk tank.<br />
<br />
Also of note, we only do Slaughter and Assassination on Hard in my groups.  I sure wish they would put in a drop down box instead of having to ask for a different adventure over and over... for the last time, I don't want collect 21 reports!~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yeah and also Guk are big dungeons, and on normal I have even noticed the resists are bad. Its a nice mixture of undead and live though if you have the relevant classes in group. The other bad thing is one guk mission I failed on normal, one of the mobs being rescued but there was a multi tiered kinda level which inadvertently killed the mob we were rescuing with some mobs on the tier below. Anyway thx for info I will definately avoid guk on hard now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hard adventures kind of lean toward &quot;holy trinity&quot; groups ala Sebilis, but you can get away with all sorts of wierd group structures depending on the mission.  I like to have a knight or 3 in most groups and pallys can produce either respectable or just obscene amounts of damage in undead based dungeons.  Clerics are an obvious choice and I still like VoQ/mez enough to want a chanter along.<br />
<br />
Guk really is not that bad IMO and I prefer it to Mira's and Tak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'm about 20-2 on hard overall since Ldon came out.<br />
<br />
Usual group is: paladin, ranger, rogue, cleric , enchanter, shaman.<br />
<br />
(A few times we have swapped rogue for BST/second ranger.)<br />
<br />
As posters above mentioned, need a group where everyone covers multiple roles, and have solid DPS. I prefer melee DPS for hard mode as they can take more of a kicking when things go bad ;)<br />
<br />
As for adventure type id rate it: kill &gt; rescue&gt; assasinate &gt; collect, main reason being that assasinate bosses on hard can be mean bastards, although our ranger managed to tank down a 1400 hitter Mira boss after our paladin had died when we split *cough* the room and got everything. Me and the cleric just kept an SR/Tnargs chain going long enough to grab the 105 points before we ran oom and wiped when the enchanter dropped ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>veggi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I've only done 4 hard adventures all in ruj, they are indeed hard but fun.<br />
<br />
Group setup was <br />
Shaman/SK/Rogue/BL/Cleric/Bard<br />
Shaman/SK/BL/Ranger/Cleric/Bard<br />
<br />
Both groups did the adventure in 55-60ish minutes<br />
<br />
I use malos on most mobs, purely to avoid resisted slow aggro.  You don't want a 1k hitter go after you, they will kill you fast.<br />
Mobs have about the same hp in hard, my bane still doesn't do full damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Only done 1 hard adventure so far in Rujark.<br />
Shm, Cle, War, Rng, Brd, Wiz was the group makeup.<br />
Bard was the puller, though a monk or sk would have done just as well.<br />
It was an assasination.<br />
Even with cleric dying once, and needing to evac 2x, we still completed it with about 10 minutes to spare.<br />
<br />
I think Hard is where the shaman really shines.<br />
Malo + slow gave no resists for me the entire adventure.<br />
Slow is truly appreciated in hard adventures where as you can get by in a normal adventure without slows.<br />
Mobs also live long enough in hard adventures for you to see your dots go full duration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I've done two hard adventures, one with my 40 bard and the other with my 65 shaman, which was in Guk.<br />
<br />
Mission: Guk, Collect 26<br />
<br />
Group makeup:<br />
Me - Vindi level gear, 80AA<br />
65 EP Warrior, top end EP gear and lots of AA<br />
65 SK 250+ AA, EP gear<br />
65 Druid 100+AA, EP gear<br />
65 Enchanter, HoT gear, ~60AA?<br />
65 Monk, NToV/SSra level dunno AA<br />
<br />
Status: Success. One succor to zone, one chanter death. 4 minutes to spare at end :D<br />
<br />
We didn't bother with pulling. Warrior just ran in to every room, If there were 4+ mobs I'd AE slow, less I'd single slow. Chanter mezzed all the adds. I kept quiessence up on the Warrior, druid did the rest of the healing and threw in some dps. Didn't use charm at all, not even sure if the chanter has DC or not.<br />
<br />
Loot: We got the mandible (secondary slot item) and some boots, both were so-so items, nice but nothing special, value &lt;6k. Not a single Aug dropped, which astounded me. Opened one chest, got a single charge potion of invigorate :p<br />
<br />
Hard adventures are definitely more fun, and I've seen some very nice loot that friends have got out of them. Good CC, Slower and healer is essential, but they're defintely doable with druid+shaman and no cleric. Having an awesome tank made a massive difference for us. More importantly you need people who know how to play, and ideally be used to grouping together though that's not essential.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Has anyone done a hard mission at lower levels?  Me and my friends have gotten to the point that we are finishing normal Guk missions with 40 and 50 minutes to spare and we are curious if it would be worthwhile to attempt a hard mission in our 30's.  Our main problems would be that there are only 4 of us, we have no mez/mana regen, and I am the main healer, but that hasn't caused us any problems on normal missions so far :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Hard adventures are about 2 things and 2 things only - how skilled your tank is and how well you can pull. If you have a bard or monk to pull and get singles, and a tank who knows what they are doing, Hard adventures are ridiculously easy. If you do not have a puller, or if your tank is lacking good equipment or good smarts, its over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sithrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I do hard missions whenever I can. Normal missions are very dull IMO.<br />
<br />
My ideal group:<br />
<br />
Tank (any plate tank, well geared and AA'd)<br />
Enchanter (as long as they have CoD)<br />
Snarer (RNG/DRU)<br />
Cleric (druid can fill in as well, but needs to have skills)<br />
Shaman (I am not absolutely needed, but hey, it's my dream group)<br />
Monk (for controlled pulls, pacify/lull get a decent number of resists)<br />
<br />
The core of this group is the death machine, i.e., the CoD pet. Monk brings in a charmable mob, which gets mezzed by chanter. Tash, Malosinia, and Ensnare on the soon-to-be pet buy you all the safety you need. After that, pet gets SoV, FA, and 2 weapons handed to it. These pets are absolute monsters, and with full MR debuffs, charm lasts a long time. DPS from the pet is truly obscene - I have read posts claiming over 1k dps. I have not parsed one, so I am not sure it is quite that high.<br />
<br />
All the debuffs last a long time. Malosinia goes for ~20 min, Tash for 14, and Ensnare for 14. Every 10 minutes, break charm intentionally to redebuff. I have never lost a chanter to the pet of doom when using this strategy.<br />
<br />
The downside is that not all mobs are charmable, so sometimes you have to hunt around for one. Hard adventures are definitely winnable without the use of charm, but they take lot longer to complete. With pet, they run around 40-45 min. usually... without, it's more like 70-80.<br />
<br />
As for dungeons, Guk is definitely tough. Very long and packed full of casters. Ruj is probably the easiest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmmm.  On a side note, none of the charmable mobs in any of the LDON mission hard or easy are snarable.  In each theme, there is one mob model (wolves in Ruja for instance) that are both charmable and completely immune to changes in run speed.  It's balanced like that to add to the risk of charming hasted mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Sithrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Yeah, some of the mobs are not snarable... I always forget about those wolves in Ruj and end up trying to root the first one of the night. Snare is handy, though not central to the strat (which works in all kinds of fun places, not just in LDoN). The real key is breaking charm on a regular basis so that the chance of it dropping at a bad time is minimized. A TD3 chanter's charm on a Tashed/Malosinia'd pet is pretty reliable.<br />
<br />
Also, if you slow the mob right after the charm is broken, the safety factor shoots up again. You can always cure it once everything is back under control.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Hmm did a collect on hard today, collect 29 fragments in mistmoore, completed with 30 mins remaining. Collect seems to be a viable choice now even for hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I have noticed that with less people in adventures mobs are more spread out. What would you think of a hard with 4 people if the mobs were more likely to come in ones and twos?<br />
<br />
Would it just be plain foolish to try a Hard with 4 people?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>mmshah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Yah Meku, I wouldnt try a hard with 4.  Ive done it with 5 and a bot 6th quite a bit thats doable, but less then 5 real players gets kinda tight.<br />
<br />
Also I simply wont even do a normal mission anymore unless Im totally bored out of my mind, Id just rather log.  I think normal missions are not only boring, but reinforce terrible habits.  Everyone go outs and pulls 5 mobs, ppl dont assist and all sorts of other really bad things because they can get away with it.  I think these bad habits are more deterimental then the benefits of getting Ldon points to spend.<br />
<br />
Hards on the other hand, require even well equipped ppl to play well and they are more points per time invested then normals and there are loots upgrades to be hand possibly.  Thats why Im fond of them anyway.</div></div><hr />
