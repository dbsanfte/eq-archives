Is that what you mean?</div></div><hr />

I use the right mouse button whenever I'm running, this allows you to do two things.. using your normal directional keys you can strafe side to side just useing the left and right keys without fumbling for another,  also it allows you to mouselook and run around without using the keyboard.    If your right mouse button is held down you can look around / steer by moving the mouse and also run forward by pressing the left mouse button while the right button is held down.</div></div><hr />

Even though it's a design problem in the way it calculates the run distance for each step, strafe-running allows you to run faster then you are supposed to for your current buffs, so is viewed as an exploit.  People on RZ get warned for it frequently (it's an escape/evasion technique when PvPing, especially for the PKs), and some have gotton banned.</div></div><hr />

If a GM sees you strafe-running, you will get a warning or banned.

That is absolutely rediculous, I would be pissed if I got banned for that. Maybe its something is unique to the RZ server, because I've been strafe running since I started and I've never had a problem with a GM bothering me. Oh well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Braslo</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 02:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Like i said, it's a big issue on the PvP servers.  The GMs on PvP servers are constantly being flooded with /petitions that are usually a result of people exploiting in PvP to kill players, or getting them killed by mobs.  People on PvP are CONSTANTLY doing illegal things to kill each other.  As a result, the GMs watch more closely what people are doing, and will slap warnings and bannings if they catch you cheating.  It takes to long to respond to /petitions in order to catch THAT cheater, so they have to catch the cheaters while it's actually happening some other time.<br />
<br />
The mechanics of the strafing... When EQ was designed, the world was developed based on squares, each square being a set size, say 5 feet for each square.  The distance that you can run was designed with the intent of running strait forward, so eash running step moved you 1 square, in this case 5 feet (further of course for jboots, sow, bard, etc), to get you to the next square.  When you strafe, you are moving diaginal 1 square instead of strait 1 square.  The problem is that when moving diaginal, you have to more 7 feet to get to that next square instead of the normal 5.  This in itself does not seem like a problem, until you put it into a chase scenario.  The person in front is strafe-running, so they are moving at 7 feet per step, but the mob chasing them is not smart enough to strafe, so he is stuck running at the normal 5 feet per step.  Basically you are taking advantage of a speed quirk to get away from a mob.  Falls into the same category as using a pathing issue to keep the mob from catching you.  In PvP it works pretty much the same, although the other player may be smart enough to also strafe, it's still using a design bug to intentionally go faster then the designers wanted you to.<br />
<br />
The GMs probably don't watch for it on the blue servers, because those servers don't have all of the same problems PvP do.  So even though the GMs may know about the issue, they are not watching for it because they are not getting /petitions about it every 6 hours from some new person that was PKed using it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brannuer</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 03:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">AHhh. I stumbled onto this awhile ago, because of some old flight sim AI I wondered about. In earlier flight sims, while heading at an enemy, if you side slipped, the other plane would turn in the direction your nose was pointing, *not* the direction you were moving - which left you in a great spot to get on his tail. <br />
<br />
While being beaten on one time, I wondered if the Mob's would have a similar prediction AI, and it seemed to work. A little while after that I figured I was wrong, but that it was probably because I was moving diagonally across a square on a map grid, thus in effect, covering more distance than what my speed should let me. Which is exactly what you confirmed. <br />
<br />
Why a game made so recently can't figure out the Pythagorean theorem and apply it to movement is beyond me .. kinda like allowing mobs to run through whole buildings asnd attack you through walls. Geez, the first Doom got that one right ...<br />
<br />
EDIT: Changed can to can't</div></div><hr />
