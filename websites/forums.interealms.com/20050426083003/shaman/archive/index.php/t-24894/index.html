<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>sudamor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've ran into a problem with the Epic 1.5 help and am looking for some assistance.<br />
<br />
Tasks Completed:<br />
[X] Epic 1.0<br />
[X] Hail Elder Spirit in Freeport<br />
[X] Kill Ancient Megalodon in Lake Rathe and Loot Lustrous Seaweed<br />
[X] Collect 2 Bleak Fungus<br />
[X] Collect 3 Twinkling Shrubs in Twilight Sea and Combine into Tied Twinkling Shrub<br />
[X] Kill Gnashing Shark and Loot Brittle Burned Bark<br />
[X] Talk to Wunshi Kashra in ST and obtain Thatched Medicine Bag<br />
<br />
I'm stuck at the following Task:<br />
[ ] Go to the Warrens and Hail Wilslik Gissu<br />
<br />
When I try to hail her she doesn't respond, she only turns towards me in anticipation.  The only difference that I can tell, when looking at the guide, is that I ONLY killed the Gnashing Sharks - this was done by CoHing me after I did the hail and paci-pulling the Gnashing Shark.  Could this be the problem, or do you think something else is amiss?<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated<br />
<br />
Thanks, <br />
<br />
Sud</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Most of the epic 1.5 mobs don't respond to hails - it worried me at first. Just go ahead with the rest of the script, thats all I did and it was ok.<br />
<br />
Use the line &quot;teh elder spirit sent me&quot; as noted in the walk-through<br />
<br />
Note: It worked for me, your mileage may vary :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Itzkul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You just got to say the whole &quot;the eldar spirit sent me&quot; thing and the NPC will talk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>sudamor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sorry for the confusion.  I did try say &quot;The elder spirit sent me&quot; and still didn't get a response.  In addition, I tried the next line, &quot;There is not much time&quot; - still nothing.  Additionally, I was not invis - I checked this 3 or 4 times.  Lastly, I camped and camp back in - nothing.<br />

Bingo - in Fungus Grove and Cobalt Scar, it's just loots; in Lake Rathe and Twilight Sea, it's local hand-ins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>sudamor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think that's the solution.  I just checked my bank via magelo and the seaweed isn't twine wrapped.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Yermit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm haveing the same problem...<br />
<br />
I've completed everything up to this point and Wilslik Gissu will not talk to me...<br />
<br />
I double checked my inventory and all my turn ins are completed.<br />
<br />
I have<br />
<br />
Twine-Wrapped Lustrous Seaweed<br />
Tied Twinkling Shrubs<br />
Brittle Burned Bark<br />
Thatched Medicine Bag<br />
<br />
I did a /bug on it and hopeing to hear back soon....<br />
<br />
is the quest broken I was told it might be</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Twine-Wrapped Lustrous Seaweed<br />
Tied Twinkling Shrubs<br />
Brittle Burned Bark<br />
Thatched Medicine Bag<br />
<br />
Um, did you do the part where you chat Tikl Huk, gather 3x Twinkling Shrub, and chat Tikl Huk again?<br />
<br />
And once you have your Thatched Medicine Bag and all the components, you need to go to the Warrens. Wilslik Gissu is at 605, 226. You say, 'The Elder Spirit of Enlightenment sent me.'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Yermit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If you re-read my post I did talk with Tikl Huk and giveing him the 3 shrubs is where you get the Tied Twinkling Shrubs....  also I did go to Warrens.... Wilslik Gissu will not talk to me...<br />
<br />
I'm kinda agrivated with the whole stinking quest right now, I have no clue what to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well, at the risk of aggravating you further let me correct my copy and paste error:<br />
<br />
Did you do the part where you chat Lupot Nukl, loot 2x Bleak Fungus, and then chat Lupot Nukl again?<br />
<br />
Because I did read your post a couple of times, and you should, prior to any combines, have 2x Bleak Fungus + 1x Twine-wrapped Lustrous Seaweed + 1x Brittle Burned Bark + 1x Tied Twinkling Shrubs PLUS the Thatched Medicen Bag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">ps, Going through your magelo, I do see Tied Twinkling Shrubs, Twine-wrapped Lustrous Seaweed, and 2x Bleak Fungus. What I don't see is any Brittle Burned Bark. I guess that's in the bank or something?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Yermit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">This is what I got... if you don't see it in Magelo its cuz I'm a lazy bastard and haven't updated it in a week or so... I'm down to my last few kills, and this road block is why I'm so agrivated hehehe <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">So, let me understand this:<br />
<br />
1. Did you combine the 2 x Bleak Fungus (unstacked) with the Twine-wrapped Lustrous Seaweed in your Thatched Medicine Bag to create Shadowed Pulp?<br />
<br />
2. Did you combine the Brittle Burned Bark with the Tied Twinkling Shrubs in your Thatched Medicine Bag to create Brittle Twigs?<br />
<br />
3. Did you go to Wilslik Gissu in the Warrens and say 'I have completed the first step'?<br />
<br />
4. Did Wilslik Gissu say 'Nicely done, friend. You have done good work. Now, give me both of those pieces and I will fashion what you need to return to the spirit.'?<br />
<br />
5. Did you give Shadowed Pulp and the Brittle Twigs to Wilskik Gissu?<br />
<br />
6. Did Wilslik Gissu say 'Take these and return to the spirit!'?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jowjo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I had a similar problem. But I had not done the Fungus Grove part. Once I got the fungus, and hailed the frog, the Lizard in the Warrens would talk to me.<br />
<br />
If I were you, for sanitys sake, go back and rehail everyone, and follow all the text. Then try the warrens again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Yermit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I have not combined anything, the walkthrough says to not combine anything till after takling to Wilslik Gissu.  When I went to talk to her I get no response from her at all.  Thats where I'm stuck... I don't want to combine anything untill talking to Wilslik Gissu and she's giveing me the cold shoulder.<br />
<br />
<br />
If I could get past talking to Wilslik Gissu I'd be good to go....<br />
<br />
I'm out of town till friday gonna try to rehail everyone again and see what happens... I hate quests..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Question: In Fungus Grove, after you looted 2 x Bleak Fungus, did you do the following:<br />
<br />
Hail Lupot Nukla again.<br />
<br />
Lupot Nukla says 'Surprising. Didn't think you'd be up to the task and be able to muster the knowledge to figure it out. If you have both with you, hurry along. The spirit is in great need of the potion.' <br />
<br />
- because that's all that I can think of that might be missing. I asked this up above, and don't see a direct confirmation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Do you have any extras of some peices like 3 of the bleak fungus for example? For what ever reason that seems to cause problems too. Make sure you've got EXACTLY the right item and quanities and that you hailed the guy like samanna pointed out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Yermit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I just got back in town, I ran around and talked to everyone all over again... and Wilslik Gissu talked to me... which means I brain farted something(oops)...  Everything is straightened out... thanks guys</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Boon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I ran into a different problem but thought I would just post under this thread.<br />
<br />
I have everything completed except for the turn in to Eternal Spirit in PoSky and the fight with the swarmfiend.  Yesterday afternoon I got a port / corpse summon up to island 4 and found the spirit and handed in the potion of sustenance.  To my dismay he ate it! No text no talisman, however I did hear the standard quest completion horns thing.<br />
<br />
When doing quest turn in's I like to leave a backpack slot open, just so I know I had an open slot to receive the item. So, I did that and I checked many times to make sure neither item was anywhere in my bags.<br />
<br />
So I am waiting on a petition, been over 24 hours now, but no biggy i'll keep waiting.  Just wanted to see if anyone else has heard of or experienced this problem.<br />
<br />
I had with me in my inventory at the time, corruption powder, ring of the undead spiritcharmer (or whatever its called) and the talisman of patience.  My only thought is that somehow having one of those or a combination of those items in my inventory at the time of the hand in messed it up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Unlikely - I had ring and talisman in my inventory as well when I did my hand in. <br />
<br />
You say you were not invis, you found the correct mob, you turned it in... Check your log for text like this:<br />
<br />
[Tue Oct 05 22:07:59 2004] You are too far away from Eternal Spirit to trade.<br />
[Tue Oct 05 22:08:15 2004] Eternal Spirit beams and looks at you with pride. 'Greetings, shaman.  I am both glad to see you and somewhat sad.  I know you are here to retrieve my talisman -- which is the reason for my weeping heart.  I do understand the importance of taking it for the Ruchu.  My heart does warm, though, at the sight of a shaman in pursuit of great things.  I am envious.  Here, take the talisman and protect it with your life.  I should like to see it again after all has been set right.'<br />
[Tue Oct 05 22:08:25 2004] You tell your raid, 'woot, Blessed Talisman of Wisdom'<br />
<br />
- I don't remember if it was on my cursor or in inventory... but if you have that text, you should have received the talisman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Boon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I didn't get any text after the hand in.  I definately didn't get the talisman in inventory or on cursor.  Can't think of any reason why I shouldn't have gotten the talisman.<br />
<br />
Wasn't invis, no illusion, i've done every other step, had an open slot, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Boon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I just go a response from a GM and they gave me my potion back.  However I am hesitant to try again.  Any thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Well... might want to wait until someone else has done it, or until a server reset, in case the mob is bugged somehow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Boon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Found out I didn't finish the text with the Elder Spirit.  I didn't say the last phrase and get the last bit of text.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Glad it was that siple.<br />
<br />
REPEAT WARNING: a checklist is just a checklist; use it to track what phase you're on, but even with a checklist, one should take the quest seriously, and do each step fully and (where required) in order.</div></div><hr />
