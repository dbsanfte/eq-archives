<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Asdrubeal-CT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all , <br />
    Some friends talked me into starting to play again i have payed for my account for awhile and going to transfer my shaman to the server they are located on Hes only lvl 32 my friends on that server are lvl 60 so they have some basic gear saved up for me right know just waiting for the trade to go through<br />
<br />
    My Question is When in a group do you go for your best Wisdom set up or do you go AC incase you guys get argo , and when solo depending on the tactic you use did you go ac or wisdom / mana ..... I use to carey around two different sets of armor depending on what i was doing that what i would wear know days there are acouple expansion out and mobs have more hp and hit harder to what i have been reading so i was wondering what kind of set up people use around my lvl .<br />
<br />
<br />
    My other idea was to find a good medium in between both that i could use that away i wont be oom or dead and not caring around a ton of extra stuff<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wacko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would question why you would bother transferring a level 32 character. Since you have level 60 friends, they can spend a few days(read 3-4 days) PLing you up to the 30s easily. Will be faster than transferring and saves you $50.<br />
<br />
As for your question, I believe it depends on where your group hunts. If indoors, I'd recommend AC first. If outdoors, focus mainly on wis, but with a light touch of AC :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">bah , i hear people saying 3-4 days ot PL to 30+  i have never seen it :p<br />
<br />
i think if you didnt sleep for 3 days you might  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would suggest taking a different line of items.<br />
First try to get the focus items. The level 2 ones should not be very expensive and they help a lot when leveling.<br />
After that try to get a good mix with HP, AC and mana on your equipment . Your wisdom will be less important then mana adding gear.<br />
And pick up some decent weapons.<br />
<br />
All this can be done &quot;relativly&quot; cheap but for 5K pp you should have a good set of items</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It's easy to PL to 30+ in 3-4 days /played.  I have PL'd a druid to 30 with 1 day /played, so 24 hours, and a cleric to 24 with 16 hours /played.  Compare that to the glacier bear, grizzlenot, or spectral courier camps and it's not that bad 8^)<br />
<br />
I buff with HoS/Guardian/AGI/STA, haste and chloro, slow the mobs for him, and sic the pet when the mobs get to half health.  Find mobs that are just barely red so the melee damage adds up pretty fast and treat the n00b like a tank, regardless of class.<br />
<br />
This technique really starts to lose steam around level 25-28 with caster types.  I could PL to level 20 in about 6-8 hours played, it takes 16 more hours to get to 30.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Holdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">plvlin 101:(did this recently for a cleric)<br />
<br />
Had a shaman and a mage(or you could just use a druid).  Buffed with focus(using group form) and with a 25pt ds from the mage.  Cleric would go grab 4 mobs and hit each one once before the ds would kill the mobs.  Cleric went from 12 to 26 in about 3 hours.  Concentrate on yellow/low reds, because killing anything higher is a waste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Crashem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think I got a twink to 30th in about 5 hours played.  Just get every hp buff known to man, throw a ds on him and watch him go.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also if you have acess to an enchanter there's weird stuff you can do with mem blur (never tried this myself so I don't know the details), and if you are want to PL a caster you have to tank for them after level 20 or so.  Just go find mobs that agro regardless of level (yeti in DL for instance), let them beat on you until they are within an inch of their life, then have the caster nuke them.  Its not as fast as PLing melees, but it still works pretty well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Toreden_Demonslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Usualy when thay say 3-4 days its not mon to thursday, atlest not me and my friends, its the /played. My monk is 59 with 10 days played but those 10 days are over 3 years =)<br />
<br />
But to level quick, get 40 quick with the help of your friend, then group with him while he cuts trought greens untill you are 50 or so, then play as you like, with him grouped or by yourself.</div></div><hr />
