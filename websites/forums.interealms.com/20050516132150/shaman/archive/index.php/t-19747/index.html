<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zeddgara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Did two normals and one hard tonight and RARELY did any bodies have cash on them and uncommonly did they have any items. We almost cleared one of the dungeons completely and the net split was about 60 plat.<br />
<br />
That's a severe cash nerf if so. But I did all North Ro's so maybe it's exclusive to that dungeon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd say that was about normal. We usually net 50-100pp on normals, with Takish being one of those at the lower end of that scale, yes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It was dorked up Tue night for sure.  Sadly I didn't notice it until halfway thru the adventure.  2-boxing Shammy/Cleric doesn't afford the luxury of paying attention to anything but NO DROP items :P  Hopefully this is just a temporary thing to get peeps to GoD, or possibly just a bug from the release.  The money was decent in LDoNs, but I don't think it was enough to justify that bad of a nerf.  Once I started to keep track, 1 in every 4 mobs dropped coin....and the split was pretty crappy.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">A couple people mentioned a cash nerf last night as well, I don't think it's just a perception thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Da Mighty Akymeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Did 2 N Ro adventures last night - splits were 54pp and 61pp - way lower than usual even for N Ro ( usually around the 100pp mark ) and no named either ( but hey that happens all the time ). Asked in guild and most doing LDONs reckon PP had been crappy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Same thing noticed on the SK boards, too.  So, it looks like it's true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vladigar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I did 2 EC adventures last night and a NRO adventure the night before and the splits were 20-30 plat. It's been nerfed alright.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gaesekki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just finished an EF normal and total plat was about 1200 after sales.<br />
<br />
Had 3 sapphires and 2 rubys drop though....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Haneb Bobanen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I did four Tak adventures yesterday and the cash was pretty crap.  Also had 2 augs drop through the 4 adventures and two nameds (both on the same adventure).  Had one good split (about 150pp).  The rest where well under 100pp, most in the 50pp - 60pp range.  Something is shadey...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Walknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have noticed that if your average lvl is below yours, it will yield lower amounts of cash.  Like exp, I think plat varies by the difficulty of the adventure.  The difficulty varies by your group average lvl.  It may have been bugged before and has since been fixed with the launch of GoD.  /shrug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I dont know about the lvls thing. My 2 friends and i do these alot and whatever combo we bring is all lvl 65's and we just rotate gems and call them out when they drop. I was noticing both nights i didnt tend to loot again til the next adventure. I'd normally get a couple/few gems per with the three of us taking turns. <br />
<br />
   I know perception can effect thinking running slower , attacking slower and stuff like that but we've been doing 100's of these together and my normal about of looting per night is something thats easy to pay attention too. <br />
<br />
  The added thing is we do them in a pretty set amount of time each night  and the mission from the last two nights were longer than usual but less gems. For example last night We did a rescue and was at the far far end so was longer than usual and the collection took 10 minutes for one last drop. Not claiming anything about the drop rates of collections just pointing out so people dont think maybe we normally take 40 minutes and did two 20 minutes ones and i'm claiming less gems. We actually had ones that took longer and less gems. This was from two nights of doing them. Will see if was just couple bad luck nights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I hope this isn't true or it's only a temporary bug.  I've got a lot of things I'd like to buy with adventure points, and nerfing the drops may make people stop doing adventures...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I doubt to many 65's are gonna stop doing ldons cuz they get 50pp less per adventure. Most i'm sure do them for the adventure points, since its fairly easy for anyone to farm 150pp in less time than it takes to do an ldon if they're 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I too have noticed a drop in cash.  I am normally ML since I am just absolutely drop dead secksay.  Ok, you got me, it's just the CHA buff, but still, I do ML very often.<br />
<br />
Basically, up until a few days ago, all mobs dropped cash.  Well, ok, not ALL mobs, but pretty much every mob.  Now, it's pretty rare that a mob drops cash . . . maybe one in 4 drops cash.<br />
<br />
Certainly, I am seeing an increase in loot that is sellable - more gems, jewelry etc that in some adventures makes up for it.<br />
<br />
The thing is, you have to remember the &quot;lost&quot; loot that occurs in a Collect Adventure.  Those Adv loots are taking up the slot that would &quot;normally&quot; be something worth selling.  Some people don't agree, but seriously . . . do a MK and Collect back to back with the same group, same theme, etc . . . I guarantee the MK will come up with more sellable loot.<br />
<br />
When all the mobs were dropping cash, the difference wasn't that noticeable, but with the loss of the cash drop, the difference in loot between MK/Assasinate/Rescue and Collect has become noticeable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Rubitt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">have not be able to do ldon since god went live (i get droped to much now and until i get that solved its not worth it).  However i have done alot of adventures before that and alot of mling.<br />
<br />
from my experience coin varries by dungeon with mir being the best (avg ~200x6) and mmc being the worst (avg ~100x6) others seem to fall inbetween some where.  I can confirm that on average collect missions produce least, though this may also just be atributed to needing the least kills to complete (dont keep track of # of kills).<br />
<br />
will keep an eye out on drops once i get up an runing again but a few adventures of 60x6 in a night is definatly signifigantly lower than what i am use to.  rng can be a factor but with 50-60 rng calcs/adventure you shouldnt see that signifgant a change.  would be curious to hear what people are geting in mir.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">There's a thread about this on the monk board too.  Interesting!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Just to chime in, i did a run with my SK last night and almost no cash at all dropped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">One the other hand, I did a run in EC the other day and had a record split. I swear every other mob dropped 20 pp or a big gem. <br />
<br />
Then did 2 in N Ro, which is usually decent, and only got 50-80, shrug. Makes very little difference to me. Win the roll on one item, sell it for half the current bazaar price, and you earn 10 LDoN cash-runs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Rakji</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">You know, this game really pisses me off sometimes. I have played since the day eq went live, but in 5 years I have never got rich. I don't play the get rich in the bazzar game, that isn't fun to me. I will sell things I don't need, but the cash never adds up to anything major. I have managed to get all my spells, etc. so I'm not crying poor or anything, but WHY IN THE HELL does SoE think because some have so much plat that at 65 we should ALL have to suffer with 50pp per hour loot. WTH is wrong with people making a couple hundred plat each during an LDoN run???<br />
<br />
Because of the Yantis issues, and farming, duping, etc. players like me that log in to group and have some fun killing stuff with other like minded people have to suffer with a few coppers to spend on food, or have to make a career out of buying low selling high in the bazzar. Some will say if you want to make plat, you have to do what it takes, but I say &quot;what is wrong with us making a little plat for our efforts over a few hours of play time?&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I ML a lot on my Beastlord (something about usually having 70 available slots and a propensity for handing out research crap) and noiced this...<br />
<br />
In Mistmoore, the only things that ever dropped plat were mummies. in Takish Hiz, it was the earth elemental types. In both cases, those mobs dropped HG type cash. The spawned mobs dropped ~5pp average, as well.<br />
<br />
Your best chance for cash seems to be while running a hard. We had 3 rubies, 2 sapphires, and a blue diamond drop in a hard Mistmoore level 50, plus lots of blood weapons and other cash loots. <br />
<br />
Rakji, I agree. I don't have the patience to farm loot and try to pawn it off and play Bazaar stocks. I don't want millions of plat, I just want a steady account of 5k or so, i'd be happy. Oh well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I did one the other night, split was 9pp. I thought the guy was holding out on us. lol<br />
Never occured to me they would nerf the cash drops, my bad for not giving them enough credit. They will nerf anything and everything that is good in the game eventually. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Romidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">This is very interesting to me. My wife and I have been doing LDoN exclusively for months. We haven't played in about 2 weeks (due to some RSI issues with my wrist...) and played for the first time yesterday.<br />
<br />
It was only our second Rujarkian adventure (we have 60 in several others, just worked out that way) and we were surprised by how poor the loot was. I went into the dungeon with 66 platinum and I came out with... 66 platinum. We do have split on, but not a single mob we killed dropped coin.<br />
<br />
We got very little loot to split also - I think it amounted to a total of 200 platinum (we have a master looter for adventures and split afterwards) - not each, total.<br />
<br />
We blamed in on Ruj - just figured there was less coin there. Nothing else has changed for us - we've been doing only level 65 Normal dungeons and are used to pulling out at least double what we did in this Ruj adventure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">And did you hear that charisma buffs help roots last longer too....<br />
<br />
Did about 6 LDoNs over the weekend. Lowest was 30plat per person, highest was 252 plat per person...<br />
<br />
Funnily enough though, the lowest splits had the highest number of augments drop...prolly just RNG though</div></div><hr />

I wonder if they supplemented loot to sell over straight plat droping, a hand off ya know?<br />
<br />
I dont know, i rarely loot anymore, but i happen to this morning and thats what crossed my mind.</div></div><hr />

Considering that our split last night was 17 pp - after a hard mission, which one would think would have a little better money reward - I would tend to think it is just a straight nerf, and not a trade off.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Isn't this as it always is?  When they come out with a new expansion, they try to make playing in the old ones suck so everyone flocks to the new ones and makes them look like a success.  How would it look if NOBODY went to GoD?  Usually they just make the xp in the new ones so much better, but it seems they have just made the pp drops in LDON suck:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Ok, was just wondering. My problem on this topic is i tend to go &quot; forget the loot, had a great time, take care /gate</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Grumbash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Yes, been doing alot of LDONs since the GOD expansion came out. Yes, looks like they nerfed the cash drops.  Also noted a slight decrease in exp, but could be wrong there, but didn't feel like I was getting the amount I was use to.<br />
<br />
I am assuming they nerfed LDONs to force peeps to explore GoD zones. LDON expansion was too successful, so they needed to destroy many of the incentives.  A bit depressing, but still doing LDONs for the points and group fun. Will probably always do LDONs unless they nerf the point system (Sshh, don't tell SOE).<br />
<br />
More I learn about the GoD expansion, the more I'm hating it.  Ya I bought it.  I like challenge like the next guy, but GoD is a bit too much for my tastes. If your a Shaman, GoD isn't for you.<br />
<br />
I'm just telling ya my viewpoint on the matter.  Some of you probably love the expansion and get a lot out of it.<br />

Now in regards to LDON, that was worth the money.<br />

I was thinking the same about ldon xp nerf.  Before I was getting about 50% of an AA per ldon.  Now, sometimes as low as 30%, never about 45%.  Not sure if we are just getting better luck at collection drop rates or what, but the loot and xp have slowed.  Not a big deal since I go to BOT if I want fast, brainless xp and other places to farm.  The points are nice since some of the stuff can be REALLY good in Ldon with the right augs and such.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I haven't noticed a change in xp for adventures since GoD came out.<br />
<br />
However, ever since the change to Collections missions I've noticed my xp per adventure has dropped significantly when I do a collection -  usually 30 to 35%.  However, if I do a slaughter (never do the other 2), I get about 40 to 50%.  My guess is, since the number of mobs you have to kill for collections is so low now (usually), it seems like the xp  has been nerfed when in reality you are just killing less mobs and therefore getting less xp per adventure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agree, was going to say the same thing.  In addition, most adventures are going by much faster now because everyone knows what to do, they've learned the expansion and its much easier than it was, less time = less xps.<br />
<br />
I also agree on the cash nerf.  I only recently started looting with my rogue and was afraid everyone would get the impression I was stealing when I never even pick pockets.  Even on a slaughter 60 the other day, we got less than 100p split, in the early days it would have easily been way above 100p.</div></div><hr />

I'm seeing splits as low as 25p ea even with some people disbanding before the split - where it used to be 150-250p average.<br />
<br />
I don't think LDoN cash was that high to begin with considering what you average farmer can do in the same amount of time and don't think it needed nerfing.  /bug and /feedback.</div></div><hr />

Just fishing alone nets way more then the current LDON cash drops are, it's ridiculously low now for 6 people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Amarusia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Well, I can say that I thank all of you for this thread as that explains alot.  It also makes me feel very bad in that I also was beginning to think that something fishy had happened with one of our group memebers the other day.<br />
<br />
My husband and I hooked up with 4 others and did adventures all day long.  XP was great, but loot literally stinks....split on each one was less than 20pp each.  We normally do not play with pick up groups (burned too many times) but we thought we would give it a chance with this rogue that we found.<br />
<br />
After the 3rd adventure, I became suspicious about the possiblity of the rogue pickpocketing, but never to the point of saying anything.  The last time we did an adventure (day before GoD) loot was great...so what would I think.??<br />
<br />
In any case, thanks for clearing that up, as bad as it sucks....Now I will go hang my head in shame for even thinking something might be amiss.</div></div><hr />
