<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Thought I'd post this question here just out of curiousity.  The only part of CT I know is 4C (temple or whatever you happen to call it on your server :P).<br />
<br />
Level 60 shaman/level 60 warrior, both with very good equipment. <br />
<br />
Whereabouts in CT would be a good place to duo for alt xp?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Reason I'm asking is I'm sick of xping in FG :P  Xp there is ok duoed, about a yellow every 45 mins, but looking for a new spot to help kill the boredom factor.  Any other suggestions would be appreciated~</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rigu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Wynch and I do sewers. the ring of slime place, wiz pyramid, and zone in, so I hope you can do those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Mobs here have a totally insane amounts of HP.  I think the time it would take you to drop them would definitely not be worth your while here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">the mobs also drop quite nice equipment though :)<br />
<br />
while the exp would probably be slower then other places, the drops are often better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Rigu :P<br />
<br />
Ok thanks for the advice all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">While they drops may be better in CT, they are friggin rare as all hell.  War/Shm duoing in there 'might' be able to get 5 mobs killed per spawn cycle.  That doesn't add up to a whole lot of rares, especially in places where rares have fixed PH's.<br />
<br />
I can't count the entire nites i have spent in CT seeing no rares at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">other than for the novelty, i dont think there would be extremely good xp for 2 people there :) me a bard and a necro did extremely well for some reason(dot the hell outta stuff : ), but war/shm gonna have low dmg output for those mobs</div></div><hr />

Umm I regularly keep 4 mobs down solo with no problems.<br />
The exp modifier here more then makes up for the difficulty of the kills. Adding a single melee partner is the perfect compliment.<br />
Horse + Canni5 = nonstop mana.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't expect too many good nameds though with just a duo.</div></div><hr />

Heh, you must be doing different mobs than me, because occasionally torpor can not keep up with the damage output of some of those lizards...especially warders +.  Admittedly, i've been playing my warrior and shaman together since 45, so I don't know all the tricks some of you epicified uber shamans have for soloing either :P<br />
<br />
Like I said, if you can only do a few spawns per cycle, you're not hitting rares all that often and it's gonna be real slow.  Probably not worth the time there.</div></div><hr />
