<br />
One thing I've tried to figure out is: of the planes that we know about so far, are there any aside from Knowledge that we can run around and explore in and are not KOS?? I suspect Tranquility, I'm sure PoNighmare's is bad, what about Justice? What about Innovation? What other planes?<br />
<br />
I just made 55 the other day and wanted to go exploring on my own this weekend but so much data is scattered... just hoping to get a bit of a &quot;heads up&quot; before going in.<br />
<br />
Thanks !</div></div><hr />

<br />
Plane of Knowledge:<br />
non-combat zone (like Bazaar/Nexus)<br />
lots of merchants and quest givers<br />
everything is non-kos, in fact i think most of it was indifferent, so probably always be non-kos.<br />
<br />
Plane of Tranquility:<br />
non-combat zone (like Bazaar/Nexus)<br />
quest givers and some merchants (fairly low NPCs population)<br />
everything is non-kos, don't remember if they were indif or not<br />
<br />
Plane of Disease:<br />
combat zone<br />
everything I saw and conned was kos, from multiple characters (some people might be non-kos based on diety, but i highly doubt it).  most things near the first part of the zone do not see invis, I don't know about further in.<br />
<br />
Plane of Inovation:<br />
combat zone<br />
everything I saw and conned was kos, from multiple characters (some people might be non-kos based on diety, but i highly doubt it).  most things near the first part of the zone see thru invis, I don't know about further in.<br />
<br />
Plane of Justice:<br />
combat and quest zone<br />
everything near the zone in appears to be indifferent, and you can talk to the prisinors for stories and quests.  Further in things start to become KoS.  I don't know if they see invis or not, didn't check far enough.<br />
<br />
Plane of Nightmares:<br />
combat zone<br />
everything I saw and conned was kos, from multiple characters (some people might be non-kos based on diety, but i highly doubt it).  most things near the first part of the zone see thru invis, I don't know about further in.</div></div><hr />
