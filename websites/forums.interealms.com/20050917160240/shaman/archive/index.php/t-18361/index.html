<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fumeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I havent spent alot of time in this zone, but I hear its good soloing in the basement.  Can anyone share some solo spots, tips or tricks?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Spritabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">At work, so I'll just share the essentials:<br />
If you have tactics flag, soloing the Diakus is more fun, in my humble opinion.<br />
Now that's out of the way, there's really only 5 things you need to know: <br />
<br />
- Root-rotting is the way to go, unless you're Uber I guess.<br />
<br />
- *A Valorian Sentry* is immune to changes in its movement speed. So either prepare for some real excitement. If you see one of these, just don't bother with him, is my advice. <br />
<br />
- Nothing I've XPed off here mitigates slow, but that's kinda off-set by the fact they usually come in pairs. It does make it less of a hassle to re-root them.<br />
<br />
- Most guards come in pairs. If you get more than 2, you are probably in the wrong place. This makes soloing and splitting fun - I recommend using malos on both targets to decrease the chance on root breaking. VP is your friend here, as in so many other places.<br />
<br />
- Invis is your friends. Except for the odd suit of armour and the house in the NE corner, nothing sees invis. Con as you go. <br />
<br />
Hope this helps =)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">mobs around the entrance mitigate slow. A good camp spot for you, if you're just starting out in hoh would be:<br />
Zone in. Go straight to the 4-way split. Turn right. Follow the path to the end, where it T's. Take another right. Follow that path, and it'll curve left(past a spot with 2 buildings, 1 on each side of you with wrulans in front) Keep going and you'll see a building with 3 wrulans guarding the entrance. Go inside that building, downstairs. Don't bother with the first room, as they are all unrootable. Go into the next room. These are all rootable and slowable, but they come in pairs(all mobs here come in pairs.) solo away, root/dot is your friend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">How do these compare to Golems in PoV in terms of avg hit, HP, exp, etc.?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Nothing I've XPed off here mitigates slow,<br />
<br />
The suits of armor (I forget their name - animated guardian I think) partially mitigate slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Average hit on these seem to be around the same as PoV golems, but without the annoying glass shards proc. Can't really comment no the exp, cause when I'm here, I'm normally just fooling around. HP are also about the same as PoV</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>papiraul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've only done AA there.. The suits at the entrance gives you 5AA per kill at lvl 65..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh yeah, forgot about those. But.. I only killed those while grouping - I seem to recall some of them are also immune to root? Not sure, it's been a while =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope they are rootable all of them..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>kittybuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I've only done AA there.. The suits at the entrance gives you 5AA per kill at lvl 65..<br />
<br />
You sure it is 5 AA a kill because i went there and was surely not getting 5 AA a kill.. dunno thou</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Skwerlbot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">5% aa seems feasible...i get 5-6% in tactics solo a kill</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I spent the last 6 levels, and 12 aa or so in HoH, it's still great regular xp at 61, and aa is too. I never solod here, if you plan on soloing, I wouldn't bother with the black guards at zone in, cause they run really fast...the humans downstairs are slower, but as said, you won't be able to single pull (valorian sentries immunes to changes in run speed too). I'd recommend just grouping, I'm getting an aa in less than two hours, I doubt you could get them faster solo, not sure though. <br />
<br />
Also, loot is MUCH better in basement, the guards drop crap, but the guys downstairs drop a lot of vendor stuff. The other day, spent about 4-5 hours there, got 2 1/2 aa's, 3 spectrals dropped (lucky there-I'd guess you'd normally only see 1 or 2 in that time), 4 ethereal parchments, and I got about 500 pp or so from vendor stuff - this is a great spot in my opinion, I'll be here a while hehe :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gonjinnx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I find you get much more EXP off the Basement. Also I dual box my druid to snare and harmony but I get a good 6%aa per kill at 62 solo and when I solo with my druid I get about 5% per kill. Much better to duo with a class that can pas/Har you can single pull none stop.  Duoing I usually pull the 2 at a time and we just go to work on them they don't resist anything once malo on them so have FUN duo I get about 2-3% per kill on both char. GL HOH is awesome EXP !!! even solo just not much on loot.</div></div><hr />
