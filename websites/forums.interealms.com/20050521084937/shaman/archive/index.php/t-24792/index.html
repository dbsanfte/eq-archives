<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mulleteer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">HI <br />
<br />
Can anyone who has tried this combo give me your feelings on it.  Both for 2boxing and duoing.<br />
<br />
I am curious how this combo starts to hold up as you get lvl 50 plus.<br />
<br />
I am guessing its a great combo early on.  Thinking about me and my wife rolling 2 which i would play with her and 2box at some points.<br />
<br />
Mullet</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Its about identical to duo'ing with a rogue or rng.  Snare/Stun axes, however, can provide some very good aggro.  ranger/rogue/zerker all seem to have about the same dmg mitigation as far as I can tell.<br />
<br />
Honestly, if you don't want to duo with a traditional tank class, I'd probably recommend ranger, due to the added utility of their spells, the ability to track, etc..<br />
<br />
Zerker's seem to be a fun diversion right now, nothing more hehe.  They cannot do 1 thing that defines them over another class.  <br />
<br />
But...I kinda like my zerker.  He's a nice change of pace from playing a shaman.  I can pretty much take aggro at will, which is fun, and the style of the class is appealing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I had good experiences with duoing with a berzerker.  They have the ability to stun and snare, and they can put out decent DPS.  They hold aggro well and seem to be relatively tough, but it may just be that the one that I duo'd with is really well equipped too :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I hadn't considered berserker shaman combo until now.  The combo seems to make sense with the bulk of the utility placed on the shaman and the lacking DPS is covered.  I still like the ranger combo better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I duoed with a Berserker in Nobles' Causeway today. No complaints at all. Even took out a (blue) named.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">you could prolly have soloed that name samanna =p<br />
i have doued with a berzerker friend...he was lacking gear the last time we did the dou so, at the time,  i was thinking a ranger would do better.<br />
<br />
snare+stun are 2 handy tools to have comeing from 1 toon.<br />
<br />
my advice would be play 2 classes that are fun...if she or you like the zerker go for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I tried it solo before I grabbed the Zerker. :)<br />
<br />
Had him fully debuffed: MD, VP, Malos, Turgurs, and dots and dogs cooking, but he started summoning me, and I had to stop doing damage and could about keep up against his damage with Q &amp; Tnarg's, so after one Can5 I gated out just about oom with him at 68%.<br />
<br />
But I'm certainly willing to take instruction as to what I should have done differently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I tried out a Berserker and found it to be the single most boring class in EQ, hands down.<br />
<br />
I liked duoing with my monk, but my best duo partner was my SK.</div></div><hr />

That wouldn't be Pixt Trent (a kyv), would it?  I've only killed him once, barely.  Three other times, I had to gate off or I died.  He is able to land many blows despite being slowed (doesn't hit too hard but many times), to the point I have to heal myself more than do damage.  Anyway, I don't know what the trick is to kill him.  I've seen bards and necros handle that one easily.  Other named like Ridgerunner Drunt and that agressive murkglider, are much easier to handle solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">you could prolly have soloed that name samanna =p <br />
i was just ribbing you a little =)<br />
i'll keep my eye out for that named though, sounds like a fun fight.  if i have any luck i'll let you know, but most likely i'll let you know when i die *snicker*</div></div><hr />
