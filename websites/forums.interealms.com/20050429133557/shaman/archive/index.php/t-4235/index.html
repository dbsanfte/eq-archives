<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I saw this idea over at eqtraders and decided to add my own sections, namely a few smithing sections, alchemy and baking. <br />
<br />
Here are a few screenshots of my 'help file' =)<br />

If anyone wants it send me a personal message and I can send you a link to the files.  I didn't have time to finish the baking section so I left it out, I'm hoping to finish it tomorrow during the day hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hey that's really good.<br />
<br />
Makes me wonder why they don't have a notebook you can use to store info in. <br />
<br />
Cheers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've just added all baking recipes to the original zip, and also edited the batch files so that it renames the original help file instead of overwriting it.  Here's some more screen shots for anyone interested<br />

Anyone who already has this zip should get it again because I made some sweeping changes and generally cleaned it up.  Hmm now for the vendors ...<br />
<br />
<br />
edit: Oh and this stuff is really easy to do (just time consuming). If you look at the html files, Verant is using pared down code without &lt;html&gt; tags. All you need to do is surround your content with &lt;body&gt; tags and you're good to go. Use colors to make it easier to look at in-game.  PM me the files and I will test it and add it to the zip. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Update for anyone interested: I still have no official word from Verant regarding the legality of this mod, so to be safe I have discontinued updates until I find out for sure.  Sorry to all those who were waiting for the rest of the tradeskills but I think other people are coming out with solutions to get around the limitations of the EULA, so there is light at the end of the tunnel.<br />
<br />
I'm fairly sure that they cannot tell when someone is using this mod, so to those that have it please use it discretely.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I've taken down the files until further notice.  =(</div></div><hr />

Actually, EQ does have an in-game notebook. Just use /note then type your notes.   :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">&lt;-----------------------still noob after all these years.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually there is a difference the Maps mod is only using a JPG background and doesn't actually alter any of the content. Whereas Curst's excellent mod, amends the help HTML files, and without the batch files would get re-downloaded every time you logged in.<br />
<br />
I hope that they decide to give us some spare HTML hooks that we can use for our own purpose.<br />
<br />
/OT I wonder how they will react to the map mod now that they are planning to bring out their own EQ-atlas map book thingy.<br />
<br />
Please let us know when you put the files back up Curst they are really good. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Good news :) Official response from GM's is that this mod is perfectly legal.  Here's what a guide said about it and a quote from a GM, posted on EQToolbox<br />
