This is why the eqshaman ebay site shouldn't have a link to these forums.</div></div><hr />

ahh, the niceness of the boards is evident again.<br />
<br />
last night i decided to work on my epic again (new server character)at lvl 54.  could not come up with the exact words to get the spirit to talk.<br />
<br />
pop'ed on the boards, went to quests/equipment forum.  epic thread.  clicked on link, and down.<br />
<br />
i take it you think shaman boards should not have a working link to the shaman epic walkthru?<br />
<br />
pop'ed over to allakazaams and they had the wording i needed.  this post was mostly for the people that thought the shaman board should have a working link.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Lets put it another way...<br />
<br />
We are not affiliated with that site.<br />
<br />
This is the website for this community... its being worked on as well so I dont think they have an epic walkthrough on there.<br />

That is not what you asked :p<br />
<br />
So I brought up my handy dandy web search engine and look what I found... http://pub59.ezboard.com/fhandsoffateguildfrm18.showMessage?topicID=14.topic<br />
<br />
Your welcome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">how about this?<br />
<br />
http://66.223.110.214/shaman/epic/1begin.html<br />
<br />
that way you can view walk thru without frames, and pretend it is not with people you are not affiliated with.</div></div><hr />

The eqshaman.com site is a shaman site sponsored by a scumbag ebayer.  The eqshaman.com site has a link to this site's (the shaman's crucible hosted by interealms.com) forums, a link that causes people to think that this site is associated with eqshaman.com.  <br />
<br />
My point was that the eqshaman.com site shouldn't be leeching off of the shaman's crucible forums.  <br />
<br />
Innocent people like you are obviously being mislead that eqshaman is somehow related to this board and that is a stigma that this board does not need.  This is NOT a scumbag ebayer sponsored board.<br />
<br />
This entire mess has been hashed out in detail on this thread: http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=12033&amp;highlight=eqshaman</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>kowalsky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">remember that eqshaman.com was a referenced/ wellknowed site for the shaman communaute before it was bought and turned in what you dislike now.<br />
<br />
the link to the forum has always been there as far as i know and that's even how i discovered this forum in my young days of EQ.<br />
<br />
as for the link issue, it's just a bad coding/ site redesign.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">dont forget Shaman of Justice, still there &amp; still the most up-to-date of the 3 main sites. (well, in my opinion dated 3rd Jun)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Shaman of Justice is, without a doubt, my favorite Shammy site (aside from this one of course)!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Here, here.  Good job on Shaman of Justice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The problem is that the stickied thread on this board has a broken link.  Could one of the mods, please pick a different link (one of those from this thread maybe) and update the sticky thread?  I come directly to this board, and have been reading it for a long time, and to have the stickied thread have a broken link to the complete walkthrough was disappointing to say the least. Especially while I was trying to figure out where Woe/Envy/Marr's promise could be found other than &quot;Rathe Mountains&quot;.  I got it all worked out, but it'd be nice to have the link actually go someplace useful! :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I like Shaman of Justice site too, but it is too bad Fuudce is not aware that Combat Agility is an archetype aaxp skill for Shamans (and a damn good one too).<br />
