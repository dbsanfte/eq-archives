<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Elessar Elfstone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yea it's a drop, not a quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Never been to PoS so question? what level are these Bees. i'm 50 what kind of help would i need if any.  I have NO clue lol thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Samoht_BB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You're 50 and flagged for Plane of Storm?<br />
<br />
Must be Uber guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gavving</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">He didn't say he was flagged for PoS.  <br />
<br />
Plane of Storms is a 60+ zone.   At level 50 a mob there can kill you in 3 hits.   Imagine a zone where stuff hits as hard as Kunark dragons (if not harder), and they have WAY more hit points than kunark dragons ever thought about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks for the info Gavving that is exactly the info I needed. Oh and BTW Samoht just so ya know i don't belong to a guild lol as I said, I had no clue.  Thought this was the place to get info and i got it from Gavving Thanks again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>vinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Plane of Storms-- the new newbie paradise.<br />
Imagine moss snakes that hit for 340 and poison for 600.  Ya, welcome to East Commons 2003.<br />
<br />
It is nice to have so many exp zones now though.  PoS is great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Foreststalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ooooh! Nice!  Hehe, ok I'm interested now!  Anyone know if the bees summon, how much they hit for, if they can be solo pulled at 61, and how rare this ring is?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gildain Shadowwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">LMAO Vinx haha.  Ya the hit hard, think sometimes for 300+ or so.  They are doable with a slower and healer....but better with a full group.  Not too shaby experience either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Viken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">They definately hit harder then Kunark dragons but they dont cast and they have half the hitpoints.<br />
<br />
Anyway, they fixed the drop location on these. Nice loot like this wasn't designed to drop from mobs that can be cleared with 3 people. I don't know where they moved it to but it must have stayed in Plane of Storms.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Chade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You can't solo pull these, unless you are tricky....  I've had 100% success with Harmony of Nature, and the geometry of where they live lets you pull singles if you are good at wall splitting and snare... ;)<br />
<br />
Singles are pretty easy if you take your time... <br />
<br />
They hit WAY harder than 300...  i think 656 for them on the hardest hits, FAST...<br />
<br />
I pulled/tanked (me = 5700hp)  these for a group of 4, but only because they were slowed and we had KEI... and USE A 2 HANDER, they riposte a lot.  My room mate is my pocket cleric, and when i tanked these using my BoF and Swifty he had fits, throwing 4-5 CHs a fight some of which were bloody close.   After the 2 hander, 2-3 CHs a fight, and no close calls...  Infact, with KEI he was starting to nuke...  Group was Ranger, Cleric, Shaman, Monk...  I'd suggest sane people bring a full group, and a proper tank! ;)<br />
<br />
HP?  i'd guess 25k?  guessing...  They took about 1.5 minutes to die... and they DO summon...<br />
<br />
For the drops...  Rare as stink for the time i spent there...  maybe 1 in 75 wasps will have a drop?  and then you have a 1 in 4 chance of getting the ring as the drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Viken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Single pulling is extremely easy with harmony and bind sight. I killed hundreds upon hundreds of these for two weeks straight (got ring and belt but was trying to get cloak) and from what I observed the drop rate is about 1 in 45 to 1 in 50. However, it's all changed now. You won't find the ring on the bees.<br />
<br />
Using 2H instead of duel wield goes for pretty much anything in PoP. It makes a very noticable difference on the damage you take from riposts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Drops were all removed from the bee's, making a very lucritive item camp totally useless - just like 99% of the 5 easier to access planes. FT2 crowns, focus stat cloaks, 41% haste belts,  veng1 rings should not have dropped randomly from xp trash.. but dam a clone of aow dropping loot WORSE then that was a real smart idea on verants end for RvR /sarcasm off.<br />
<br />
Dunno what they're thinking with some of the itemization ganks they're pulling off. PoStorms bee's was only a small area they're nerfing the **** out of every week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Hawkwind</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The ring I believe drops off the Giant Shore Lord (forget actual name), I remember a few weeks back a guildmate of mine was awarded the ring (unelss I am thinking of another Vengeance ring, and no not the one from Aerin'Dar either hehe). I missed it but from what I heard it was one fun battle :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ladas Sindarin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Lord Jeplak drops it, the lord of the ocean giants.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Myrdale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">*Drools over that ring*<br />
That will be my insperation to get to Lvl 60 =P</div></div><hr />
