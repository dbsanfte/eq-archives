<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kamor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First off i wanted to thank any of you for your help here.  A few months ago i started a Shaman alt, mostly because I enjoyed grouping with them so much. Well after messing around with the class for a while I've really come to enjoy playing it.<br />
   <br />
 Currently trying to save up enough cash for an ikky bp and an sbs.  Was also thinking of crested spaulders for shoulder slot.  Im not loaded down with plat so please no crazy suggestion that cost a small fortune or require a mini raid to get =).<br />

Get yourself a couple of Enchanted Gold bars and a couple of Imbued Ivories and go see your friendly neighborhood Jewelcrafter.  They can make you a pair of Imbued Golden Ivory earrings (AC3, WIS4, cold2).  Total cost 50-100pp.<br />
<br />
The imbued Paltinum Ivory Necklace would be an upgrade for you as well.  Plat bar is about 100pp though.<br />
<br />
Got to get ourself a new headpiece!  :D  Anything!<br />
You can get the Totemic Helm yourself at lvl 35.  Check out EQShaman.com for a good write-up on camping the Glacier Bear.  Or you can get a JB Helm for pretty cheap.  I got one for 350pp (I'm on Drinal also) last week.<br />
<br />
JB Boots would be much better.<br />
