<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Start of the day:<br />
Skill 152<br />
about 1200pp in bank<br />
<br />
bought 115 of each for the grow potions.<br />
80 successes, 35 failures, not a bad rate I guess.<br />
only 6 skill raises!<br />
0pp in bank account &gt;&lt;<br />
<br />
Usually i've been getting an average of about 2-3 skill raises per stack of 20, but today really blow that out of the water.<br />
Did i get exceptionally unlucky or is this a usual for alchemy after 150?  <br />
<br />
Averages out to 200pp per skill point, with another 22 to go... that's a fair bit of cash ... was hoping to finish sooner, since I've already spent 12-15k on the damn skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zoichi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just wait till you hit 175 skill.  <br />
<br />
My advice?  Dont waste your money on a tradeskill where you master it, but people only want to buy sow, IU,  and a few gates.  Just my 2 cps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sounds about right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>engelica</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I forgot at what number,  i think it was after 160 or so. but i started just making gates, i got like 1 point for every other stack i made</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mogur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">12-15k?<br />
<br />
/sigh<br />
<br />
you young'ins got off easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I got from like 70 to 180 in 10k.<br />
<br />
Always had wis 255.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>DvenMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yea you guys are lucky,<br />
I had 170 skill pre-sol =) where it was gate potions to get you to 170 noy a 18pp combine grow potion. But i did use them to re max me at 180. Worth it? hmm only if your guild supports you i sell alot of potions to guild members and i got like 1-2 regualr gate potion buyers outside the guild. Also got the philosophers stone which in theory atleast makes my skill 198. I do notice reduced failures with it so i think it does push it over the 180 cap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mogur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">try 80-100k just to get to 82.. max before kunark :P<br />
<br />
this was when everything took components.. like lev potion was a lightstone+40p or something herb</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>engelica</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i started alchemy, i guess after the first upgrade, no rat tails or bat fur :)<br />
i did spend all the plat i had to get to 60 and quit for the longest time, then after they lower the herb prices i started up again, slowly.<br />
i spent like 12k to get from 60 to 160 pre-sol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Razco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">just dinged to 58 last night.... so i max at 170 ... been keeping up with my skill per level ... it averages 1200pp per 6 points  ( grow potions) which pretty much your just blowing cash because you cant sell these bad boys to vendor or player.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I got to 60'ish in alchemy and have stopped there until there is not a single droppable item that would be an improvement to what I or my monk have.  At that point (i.e. when money become effectively worthless) I may try and advance it a little bit.  As is there is no decent enough reason for me to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">15k to 158? Damn, I had spent well over that just getting to about 110.<br />
<br />
Alchemy raises go in major streaks. When I was making flurry quickness potions to go from 163 to 170, I got 3 raises in the first dozen attempts. Then I went 40 with no increases at all.<br />
<br />
163-170 cost me 8500pp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">That 12-15k was a completely random estimate.  I worked up to sow potions a year ago, then did some more into my 60's a few months after that, and up to 100 a couple months ago.  May be more, may be less, I don't really remember.  Probably 20k, but I'd like to tell myself I haven't spent that much cash on alchemy =)  Just recently going from 103 and up, guild needs the ds potions, and I figure since I'm so close I may as well work on some gate potions.  Guild bank is paying for it all, but if I'm gonna run another 10k getting over 170, I may shelve it for a while.<br />
<br />
Looks like it's gonna cost me, so I think I may just try a stack or 2 a week or so from here out and see how it goes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Brodda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">heh.  I must have spent 15k to get to 30ish prekunark.  Just yesterday I spent 20k to get it up to 170.  Talk about crazy easy now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">yeah I did from 70-150 on roughly 8k or so.  I had been at skill 70 for like a year, I had no intention of spending tens of thousands of pp for gate potions.  However, 8k is more manageable for me.<br />
<br />
Titans Potions = good.  They are a complete powerskilling solution, sell back for nearly nothing to vendor.  Not saleable for their cost to players... so all my small friends have tons of them.<br />
<br />
I am 6  for 6 on gate potions at 150 skill.   :)<br />
