<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">In replying to another thread it just came to me.<br />
<br />
I now know where the 100/75/47 came from and why . . . and why it should go away.<br />
<br />
Many of us have said all along that Shaman were healers at their inception but somewhere along the way this was lost.  I agree.<br />
<br />
In order to understand the healing ratio, we have to go back to the days of original EQ.  Back *before* the level cap was raised from 50.  Back *before* Turgurs.<br />
<br />
In those days, our maximum Slow was a 50% Slow.  We didn't have Stoicism or Torpor.  We didn't have our 75% heal.<br />
<br />
At that time, Clerics big &quot;blast&quot; heal was Superior Healing, ours was Greater Healing.  Oddly enough, that puts us at right around 50% (51% to be exact) of the Cleric heal.  But remember, we could Slow, and *nothing* mitigated Slow.<br />
<br />
Now, we also had &quot;Incapacitate&quot; . . . and I'd be willing to bet that in the minds and calculations of the Devs *at that time* the effect of Incapacitate plus Slow was such that Shaman needed to heal only 47% as well as a Cleric to be a Main Healer.  And surprisingly, at that time, this formula WORKED.<br />
<br />
Fast forward to now . . . you have many changes in Devs, many expansions and new spells and abilities.  I'd be willing to bet that none of the new Devs even know *why* that ratio exists.  They simply know that this is the ratio that was passed to them as being &quot;right&quot; and that any changes to it would &quot;break&quot; EQ balance.  And while that message might have been perfectly correct when it was written, I think we can all see how *wrong* it is in the context of todays EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Interesting idea.  I can completely see that working.   I've been playing with some numbers, but i was basing it all on our 75% slow forgetting that it didn't exist then.  Thanks for pointing this out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Interesting interpretation, given that, if you are correct, the original Devs thought that the &quot;sum&quot; of our &quot;healing&quot; (means damage mitigation via slow plus damage mitigation via incapacitate plus actual heal spell) should equal 100% of a cleric's &quot;sum&quot;. <br />
<br />
In other words, shaman should NOT be balanced as backup healers, they should be balanced as PRIMARY healers, once all factors are weighted. Hehe I can already hear the gnashing of teeth over on the cleric boards over THAT little tidbit.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jeones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My recollection is we healed the same as druids until they complained very loudly that no one wanted them in groups.  There was some big petition or some such that they put together.  This occurred after the release of Luclin.</div></div><hr />

Their DS spells would assist in killing mobs faster and therefore party members have less damage done to them.  Since I'm not a Druid, I don't really know enough about their class to to make these kinds of judgements.  I'm sure another part of that 75% was their evac spells.  Something along the lines that if they get into a situation where things are going very badly they can simply remove their entire group from the situation.<br />
<br />
My basic premise though is that the healing percentages we seem strapped with were developed during the original EQ era.  The data I find seems to indicate that this is the case.  As such, these percentages are badly outdated and need to be seriously revised to be more realistic in todays EQ.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dude this is the most logical thing I've heard and appeals to me greatly.  Were I a dev this would change my mind 100%.<br />
<br />
I definitely think your hypothesis is very correct, and should be the basis for balancing priests in the future, or at least in future games. =)</div></div><hr />

I doubt evac would have played into this.  MoB damage was sufficiently lower back then to assume that unslowed MoBs taking something like 1/4 of their maximum damage output in guaranteed damage would have killed the MoB fast enough to warrant the difference.  If any druid ability scaled in back then, it would have been snare.<br />
<br />
The overall theory you have for the shaman ratio is an interesting thought.  I'm glad I read it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Joril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">the druids factor was their damage shield.  They could help lower the fight time (thus reduce the need for healing) by putting a DS on the MT.  which means the druid DS and shaman slow were considered more or less equal and balancing when coupled with our healing abilities.  before kunark shaman and druid healed equally.<br />
<br />
this was a pretty innovative way to think of it and you are probably correct.  the new devs prolly got those precentages, but not why they were set.<br />
<br />
Druids did raise a huge stink and got their heal upgraded.  They also upgraded the shaman one....  well the devs considered it a update.<br />
<br />
no one seems to remember before kunark anymore.  shaman and druids also could nuke for the roughly the same damage.  shamans even out did druids in some of the earlier levels.  who could nuke for more flipped back and forth until the last set of spells and druids got a VERY small edge.  the biggest difference being they could nuke a couple of ways and we could nuke only with ice.  but we had 2 dot lines and they had one.<br />
<br />
the percentage healing differences are ludicrus and always have been.  clerics should have a clear and significant advantage, but shaman and druids should be equal!  id settle for 60 to 65 percent of a clerics total though, im not greedy &gt; )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Actually Druids out-nuked us by quite a bit in the original design.  At L50, Druids had 2 nukes that hit for 612 each, while we had one nuke that hit for 430.  Of interest, the Druid nukes were designed to work together, as the nuke also had a debuff for the opposing nuke built in.  I found that rather interesting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ok this is something thats been bugging me for a looong time.<br />
<br />
We heal 47% of a clerics abilities now that i can understand as Clerics are very much a 1 trick pony.<br />
<br />
But why oh why oh why do we only heal roughly 60% (cant be bothered to work it our exactly) of a ****ing druid.<br />
<br />
Druids are 1 trick ponies ? I think not.<br />
<br />
Going back a few expansions and years before druids started whining especially in the pre RoK era about druids not getting groups is because most of the druids didnt want to get groups because they were such powerful soloers and grouping only slowed them down.<br />
Then all of a sudden druids found out they couldnt solo everything and they whined about not being able to group because it was at this time disadvantageous to them to solo.<br />
Yes we can slow better than any other class out there (although only just nowadays) but we do everything else nearly worse than every other class.<br />
Please dont bring up manna regeneration because that is mostly only really useful for soloing or pulling the groups butt out of the fire.<br />
If youre in a group and the main healer if its not you is oom then the party aint gonna move but if youre oom (unlikely but hey you never know) then tough as long as you got enough manna to slow the next mob thats all theyre worried about.<br />
Ok example of druid soloing against shaman.<br />
When SoL had been out for a while ME was full of Druids with a DC wolf whiping out mobs a lot quicker and efficiently than a Shaman cannibalising his arse off could.<br />
Bah going to shut up now but droods really piss me off as you may notice.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Oukast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Funny people don't mention the Cleric &quot;Mark&quot; Line of spells...that's damage mitigation to a degree...not &quot;just&quot; healing...<br />
<br />
Or the Uber Cleric spell that gives either 10 or 20% damage mitigation (chanters might also get this)...i think clerics have plenty of damage mitigating spells...one trick pony...not really... Clerics are uber useful for those that know how to play them...personally I'd love to be able to melee as well as a Cleric...they proc like crazy...<br />
<br />
Druids and bards just suck...and I think they should die...don't get me started on them...<br />
<br />
So if you look at the numbers, Beast Lords and Chanters mitigate slow / damage better than we do...where does that leave us?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">But why oh why oh why do we only heal roughly 60% (cant be bothered to work it our exactly) of a ****ing druid.<br />
<br />
I can answer that.<br />
<br />
First, re-read my initial post carefully.  My basic premise is that these percentages were developed during the original EQ era.  That's very important.<br />
<br />
If you follow my logic, you'll see that given what I believe the Dev's line of thinking was for these percentages a Shaman was a Healer equal to a Cleric in the original EQ era.  Not 60% of a Druid.  Not 47% of a Cleric.  100%.  We were an equal Healer.  Yes, we did it differently, by debuffing (Slowing / Incapacitating) the mob, but the overall effect was that we healed equal to a Cleric because mobs we faced were doing less than half the damage of mobs faced by a Cleric healed party.<br />
<br />
I don't make any extension beyond the original era other than to mention that the Dev team has changed radically over time and as we all well know, class balance has broken down.<br />
<br />
My whole point is that if my surmise is correct, that the percentages were developed in the original EQ era, then there is a drastic need to revisit those numbers now.  The data seems to support my surmise, and with some work by a knowledgeable Druid, it could definitely be shown where these percentages were developed in the original EQ era.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Funny people don't mention the Cleric &quot;Mark&quot; Line of spells...that's damage mitigation to a degree...not &quot;just&quot; healing...<br />
<br />
I don't argue that point, what I was trying to show however was that the &quot;healing bible&quot; percentages were developed during the original EQ era, and that during that era, these percentages were fair and balanced.  The Cleric &quot;Mark&quot; line didn't start until after the L50 cap was raised.<br />
<br />
I agree with the majority that these percentages need to be reviewed.  What I hope is that a Dev will read this and begin to ask himself about those percentages.  I believe that the percentages are something that have been handed down for so long, through so many Devs, that no one there even questions them any more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kolmirg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Your numbers are slightly off.  Before Kunark the biggest shaman slow was Togor's Insects (L39).  At level 50 this was a 65~70% slow.  A few weeks before Kunark Togor's got rescaled so that it was 70% at level 60 and much less at level 50.  The Ice Giants had a good day after that particular patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">My numbers may be slightly off, I thought I remembered Togors being only 50% max.  I can't tell for sure, Lucy spell history apparently doesn't go back to the original EQ era.  There is no entry for changing Togors to the L60 cap, though there is one where it went from 60 to 65.<br />
<br />
Even so, that is enough to tell me that the most Togors ever did at L50 was a 60% Slow.  It has always increased by 1% per level.<br />
<br />
None of this is really enough to fudge my numbers by significantly.  I think my premise is correct, and needs to be brought to a Devs attention so that some sort of explanation can be rendered.</div></div><hr />

as you can see we actually out nuked druids for a large part of the time.  the only anomoly is the druids not getting a new nuke at 39, but instead getting a stronger one then us at 44.  that does fit the pattern though.  if you follow the pattern we should have gotten a bigger nuke at 44 and again post 50.  but of course the game changed radically post 50 and kunark.  that doesnt change the fact that we should have stayed fairly close in nuking power to druids.</div></div><hr />

I might cross swords with you on that, but it's irrelevant to the conversation, since I was really only interested in healing here.<br />
<br />
Ok, I'll bite.  ;)<br />
<br />
Pre-Kunark, Druids out-nuked Shaman for 26 levels, Shaman out-nuked Druids for 20 levels and we were even for 4.  It looks to me like it was fairly even, but Druids in general were better nukers and in the endgame then, Druids were definitely better nukers.<br />
<br />
Still doesn't make a whit to healing, but there you have it.</div></div><hr />

Nice observation.  The only real advantage Druids had over Shaman at that point was Group Chloroplast, at least insofar as healing was concerned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Joril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">not true.  Druids brought evac to groups for one thing.  the only place to hunt for 45 plus was lower guk, sol b, and the planes (when they were added, they were an addition and not part of release).  Planes were a major guild affair, so we will forget about them for the moment.  in the other two locations evac was a VERY important skill brought to the table.  zone lines were not close, you fought way in deep through twisty sharp cornered tunnels.  there was no GY.  you died, you had to go get a spare set of gear from the bank and fight your way back.  Or pray there was a cleric near by that you could talk into having their entire group fight to you and res, which usually meant losing your camp spot, so most didnt do that.  rogues didnt have sos and invis was extremely unrealiable, which meant the very real possibility of dying again.  death meant MUCH more back then to, ALOT more exp was lost.  not to mention if you could get someone to drag your corpse, they might just loot it and leave you hanging.<br />
<br />
now lets talk snare.  oh yeah druids had snare to.  ever have a frog run from ya and argo a whole train back?  then your praying your druid (or wizard) was smart enough to have that last bit of mana saved for a evac, cause if not.. well read above.  <br />
<br />
shaman brought an equal, but different set of skills to the table.  we evened out with druids on alternate abilities. which is why we healed the same and for all practicable purposes nuked the same.  though druids were the favorite class of half of the population it seemed and the devs (they still are the favored class of the devs). on any given day you could find twice the number of druids then any other class and sometimes twice the number of several classes combined.<br />
<br />
i agree healing needs to be upgraded more to equal druids again (or pretty damn close).  its wrong to just compare healing as the only thing a druid or shaman brings to a group.  the only class balanced around healing is clerics, as it should be.<br />
<br />
i am a shaman.  i can heal, but i can also do dps, CC, and alot of other useful things.  the trouble in todays EQ is that i cant do ANY of those things to point that it affects anything.  shaman as a class use to make a difference in a group.  now it doesnt matter if a shaman is present or not, a group wouldnt know the difference.  im not saying i want to be required for a group.  i want to be wanted for a group for something other then friendship or they just want 6 people.  healing alone is not going to make that happen.  <br />
<br />
dont feel sorry for druids, they have NEVER been a class that wasnt desired, though alot felt that way.  they are the ones who would turn down groups, because they could solo so much better and get faster exp. people would remember their names and when druids WANTED to group it was pay back time.  druids still made a great addition to any group, just most people didnt want to group with that druid that KS'd a named or turned them down repeatedly in the past.  druids made their bed, they can darn well sleep in it.<br />
<br />
can ya tell im sorta anti druid?  cant stand to here druids (and wizards) with max AA's cry because no one wants to group with them.  its not because their class was EVER hurting for utility or desireability for a group.<br />
<br />
ok, i derailed this thread enough. sorry.  got on a roll.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I don't like or dislike druids, but I was talking healing.<br />
<br />
In original EQ, each priest brought a unique flavor to their group.  Clerics had CH and Rez.  Shaman had Slow / Stat buffs (which meant something then).  Druids had Evacs / Damage Shield.<br />
<br />
Each was able to function as a healer for their group.<br />
<br />
That is no longer the case.  I think I know why.  I'd like to hear a Dev acknowledge it and tell us what will be done about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Sudedor, excellent walk down memory lane. It rang the bell of memory for me; filling in some lost perceptions of class balance.<br />
<br />
Joril, your antagonism of druids skews the facts/reality. Druids were 'useful' in groups because of evacs, snare, healing, ds, buffs and PORTABILITY. They shared portability with wizards, as well as evac, which made the 2 classes competitive for that extra group spot. Before the holy trinity, the base group was formed around the holy quad: tank, cleric, chanter and shaman. 2 spots left. For dungeons this meant a porter. Someone to get you out and more likely someone to get you back after a wipe or death of at least one member (usually chanter) for CR.<br />
<br />
There were so many druids because, simply put, druids were a very easy class to play. Their tools at the time were ideal for the player who wanted to level fast, solo primary and be independent. Amazing that the type of individual who is basically anti-social gravitated to the class, giving the class a bad reputation.<br />
<br />
Druids in their development did lose significant group desirability. Their heals did not progress with content and their group contributions could be done better, more efficiently by any number of classes. Clerics beat them healing, shaman healed as well plus brought SLOW. Wizards brought portability and better dps as well as snare. Mages had better dps and better ds.<br />
<br />
In effect, before the big heal bump for druids, they were in the same boat of 'not needed' as shaman find themselves now.<br />
<br />
Sorry to get off topic here, but if you are going to hate 'druids' at least keep it to the individuals whose druid toons were the arses ... not the class in general. <br />
<br />
Back to topic: In looking at your the basic class balance argument, I wonder if the devs back then realized that once you combined a cleric, shaman and druid into a group that the group became extremely viable in content above what was intended, at X level, to be doable? Pure speculation, but it would follow the dev history of not understanding the overall consequences of the game character development.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I suspect you are right.<br />
<br />
They saw what happened when you put a Shaman *and* a Cleric in the same group for X content.  And they didn't like it.<br />
<br />
Now, in that situation, the Shaman was able to provide not only a Slow, to make the situation manageable, but he provided some DPS as well.  Basically a Shaman was able to do *more* than they intended because there were often 2 priests in any given group due to simple class numbers.<br />
<br />
Now, we *need* 2 priests in a group simply to keep people alive, and because of the changes in mitigation and healing, there are only 2 classes capable of filling that role.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, Shaman isn't one of them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are paraphrasing what I said about druids.  I havent skewed anything.  They brought more to the group then basic healing.  where we differ is that the druids never lost their group desirability.  it was the class as a whole that drove people to not want a druid.  it wasnt some lack of power on their end.  Druids were not wanted, they were never not needed.  big difference.  Druids whined louder then just about any other class, only difference is that they were listened to.  that doesnt make what they were whining about true.  <br />
<br />
people stopped wanting a druid because they got tired of hearing from druids.. sorry i can make more exp soloing, i dont need to group.  then when the druids suddenly wanted a group, they couldnt understand why they couldnt get them.  it HAD to be because their class was underpowered, not becuase of their sparkling personalities.  just because most people believed the world was flat, doesnt mean it is.......<br />
<br />
I said I was semi anti-druid, not that I hated them.  There are alot of great druids and a well played druid (like any class) is a pleasure to group with.  I judge individuals for who they are and the class for what it is.  Druids were lacking in healing, just like shaman and both classes needed a serious upgrade.  one got it and one didnt.  I am personally glad druids are better healers. last thing i want is to wind up in a CH chain (would probably make me retire faster then anything else).  that doesnt mean they were lacking in their other utility areas.<br />

there has never been a holy quad.  a chanter has ALWAYS been the better class choice over a shaman if you wanted CC, slow, and dps.  our heals was the only thing that made us more desirable IF a cleric (or a druid) wasnt available.  it has always been a holy trinity.  chanters liked having shaman along, they didnt need to have us along.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">preKunark shaman capped out at a 65% slow at level 50.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">just on a side note druids always where better at nukes in that they got the bigger nuke first, we also got a slightly better nuke in the next level , but it was general worse than what a druid nuke would have been at the same level, it was only better cause they didnt get a nuke that level. <br />
<br />
that said it was much closer than is now. see level 44  430 and 450. (the 450 was a added one though wasnt in orignal eq)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I always thought the big change was the pace. At a certain point in time the tank could take a certain amount of battering while I landed slow and then still be standing when I got to healing. As mob DPS increases relative to hitpoints that buffer becomes smaller, and the ability of a shaman's heals to extend it or recover from damage done also shrinks.<br />
<br />
Of course druid DS didn't even come close to scaling with mob damage and group DPS.<br />
<br />
This is also why when I read the EQ2 plan of, &quot;many classes doing things in different but equal ways&quot; I laugh gently. That's precisely what the original designers would have said about priest balance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">It wasnt until the end that druids outnuked us, before kunark.  here is a very fast level/damage comparison.  its also based on max damage, as all the spells increase in power as you gained levels, but not enough to invalidate the comparison.  since i used max damage for both us and druids.  skip means that class did not get a new direct damage spell that level.  I did not include AE, DD vs summon, or dots.  i was talking straight nuking power, not specialized damage.<br />

as you can see we actually out nuked druids for a large part of the time.  the only anomoly is the druids not getting a new nuke at 39, but instead getting a stronger one then us at 44.  that does fit the pattern though.  if you follow the pattern we should have gotten a bigger nuke at 44 and again post 50.  but of course the game changed radically post 50 and kunark.  that doesnt change the fact that we should have stayed fairly close in nuking power to druids.<br />
Your leaving out a main factor here, most levels that druids get a direct one target nuke they also get access to a AOE (true AOE not crap like ours) nuke that is on par with the single target version, which is why they were more powerful soloers, Quad kiting was, and still is, a powerful way to level. Those AOE nukes are what allowed that, and gave druids a leg up in groups because quite simply back then chanters were rare, lull spells were broken, and mez rarely lasted longer than a few seconds.</div></div><hr />

AE spells were not a group friendly spell pre-kunark.  so i purposely (and even stated why) I left them out.  Chanters were no more rare pre-kunark, then they are now.  If anyone used a AE spell in a group they usually didnt last in that group very long.  AE pulling groups didnt really come into their own until luclin.  pre-kunark int casters simply didnt have the hps, ac, or rune spells to survive casting AE's in dungeons.  I dont remember clerics having any group heal spells either for that matter, but then i never really paid that much attention to cleric spells.  this is of course not counting the fact that the only 2 dungeons you could hunt in post 45 were ALWAYS packed.  you could walk from one end of lower guk to the other usually and not find a single mob up.</div></div><hr />
