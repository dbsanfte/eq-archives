If anyone regularly gets more than 1 blue/hr, post the make-up of your group: number of members, typical levels, class types, etc.  Also where and what you hunt.<br />
<br />
Also, I'm a troll (lvl 56), so I don't know how much that's affecting me.  If it's a 20% penalty, then I'd be getting 1.25 blues/hr.  Still not a great amount.  <br />
<br />
If you want to know, I think 2-2.5 blues/hr is acceptable.</div></div><hr />

I think thats the going rate to be honest with you.<br />
<br />
The best XP I've had was in a group with a WIZ, PAL Ranger Cleric and rogue. Big time DPS. The cleric and I had C3 as well.<br />
<br />
The best camp that I've seen has been in PoD, the courtyard I think it was. I got abuot 7 percent in half an hour!. Fighting mobs that were mostly red to me. It was a great group. But I've never been able to get in a courtyard one since, probably because I'm too low a level (only 54).<br />
<br />
I just wish I had stayed in that group for the rest of my life. I'd be level 1000 by now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Psycotika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Best PoP xp Ive had was with Me, 58 sk and a 64 rogue RL friend. we were at docks in pon and the xp just flowed in.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>yadaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">uhhh my best grp was wiz, sk (me :D), shm, rog, clr, wiz hehe was very fun<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>malikaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Best by far was. rogue, cleric, me, warr, monk and mage. DPS was stupid. This was in POI which in my opinion is best plane</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Krakur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The best group I had was a regular group in PoD for a while.<br />
<br />
61 Shaman (Me, no torpor/malo/epic)(had pony, jbb, alpha dog)<br />
59 Ranger (AM3 / EQ)<br />
60 Ranger (Swiftwind + Primal Battlehammer)<br />
60 Pally (Windblade)<br />
60 Cleric<br />
59 Wizard (SCF 3)<br />
<br />
We would do RCY for hours and hours.. Started out there with them at 58, got 61 within 2 weeks, grouping with the same folks regularily. We would have RCY clear and if CCY wasn't camped we'd pull most of that too before our side was repopping. The dps was incredible, and having a knight tank allows me to slow on mob incoming without taking a single hit. This allows everyone to get right on the mob, saves everyone mana and we just keep rolling through the mobs like they were fire beetles :P<br />
<br />
Doh forgot to add.. I'd get about 2.5 gold in a 4-5 hour session here, also depending if CCY was camped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Minimeeee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i think the best ive ever done was duo with a 57 SK in PoN...he wasnt used to pulling PoN so i just pulled it to speed things up since i used to pull alot as a wizard quadding here. I made 40% exp in 4 hours doing this, maybe even less time cuz c3 didnt wear off if i remember correct...very extended c3 obviously. Basically i just camped a little south of waterfall and pulled trashmobs to a hill on the wall. This was when i was also 57. Keep in mind i have good gear excluding epic...jbb horse etc. I think this exp is pretty insane...Sks are easily the best class for shammys to duo with. Pallys prolly come in second.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Getan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I normaly hit the planes with my Cleric. Depending on how many people and what lvls I either hit PoJ or PoN. My usual group is 55 War, 56 Sham and 60 Cler. <br />
<br />
This group breezes through prisoners, creatures and guards in PoJ for 1% aaxp every 2.5 kills. That translates to 1% xp every 10 kills for my cleric at lvl 60 but at 59 it was 15 kills per 1%. If you factor in 20% penalty that would mean about 18 kills for 1% aaxp at 59.<br />
<br />
I've also duoed with a lvl 60 SK in PoJ against the same mobs. My aaxp rate was about 1% aaxp per 1.25 mobs as long as they were dark blue. needless to say, aaxp went by much faster duoed with the SK.<br />
<br />
PoN was a different story. I normaly pull yard trash like Treats, Arachnids and Ravens while in PoN. When the War and Sham were 54 and 55 respectively, it would take 15 mins to kill one Raven so xp really sucked. Now that they are 55 and 56 respectively, things go a lot faster but I prefer having a 4th group member to speed up kills. With 4 people, I get 1% aaxp every 1.5 kills. Thats 6 kills per 1% xp at 60 for my cleric. 1 Blue of regular xp is approximately 4% xp. so that means 24 kills per blue bulb. With a 20% penalty it would be closer to 30 kills per blue bulb so you'd have to kill 30 mobs an hour to get a blue bulb at lvl 60 killing yard trash while in a group of 4.<br />
<br />
Assuming you could duo in PoN I'd estimate 1% aaxp every .75 to 1 kills. Using the same calculations that would be 1 % xp for a lvl 60 cleric every 3-4 kills or 1 blue bulb every 12-16 kills. Add in racial penalty and you get 1 blue bulb every 14-20 kills.<br />
<br />
Hope this made sence</div></div><hr />

Sounds like terrible exp to me.   I get 1% regular exp every 2 kills at level 59 solo on flies in PoD.<br />
<br />
Can get a full group of 55-60 and get 1% noremal exp per kill just about in the factory in PoI.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It all depends on how quickly you can kill stuff. If it takes 10 mins for you to kill 2 flies and my group can kill 10 mobs in the same time then we break even. If you can kill flies faster you get better xp. If you can't, we do. XP per kill is only part of the equation. Other factors include kills per minute, number of trains to avoid, deaths, over pulls and other reasons for downtime.</div></div><hr />

We fought past the pulsings and made our way to the corrupted knights area.

You my friend have hit the nail on the head!! Pet groups are where it is at! Forget the wizzies and such just make a group with pet classes and the world is there for the picking.  Must have a Necro in PoD to fear kite, or you can just slow and let pets tank. I usually take guildies to PoD and let them group with my 62 necro and fear kite all day long all the while they are soaking up the xp.<br />
Try it out sometime!</div></div><hr />

I was in PoN once with a Group and got 1 yellow each hour. This was because the Puller was chainpulling. We had 1 mob to 5% when the next was already there so we had incomming all the time.<br />
Nothing is worse then a lazy puller who sits down after each fight chatting or whatever.</div></div><hr />

The only reason I understand having down time and thats due to Mana not waiting on a monk or whoever is pulling to stand back up. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>qhor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The standard PoN or PoD group I used to join had a makeup about like<br />
this:<br />
<br />
cleric<br />
enchanter<br />
shaman<br />
tank (usually warrior)<br />
dps<br />
dps<br />
<br />
I don't join those groups anymore.  Four of the Six of us don't do much<br />
damage (shaman is mediocre, warrior is mediocre, enchanter is mediocre,<br />
cleric is nil) so the kills take a while.  Slow experience and whatnot.<br />
<br />
I dung 58 a couple weeks back and started working on AA since I was<br />
bummed on not having any 59 or 60 spells to look forward to.  With<br />
Kragg's and Cannibalize IV, plus the Earring of the Solstice I just bought<br />
and Mental Clarity II i'm usually able to both slow and heal, as well as<br />
toss the occasional DoT without any enchanter brain buffs.  I<br />
prefer to group with a Beastlord or Necromancer or even a SK for their<br />
mana regens.  (BL crack, Necro mana taps and twitches, SK mana tap)<br />
These classes also add sick DPS.<br />
<br />
So when I have the time and drive to do some experience grinding I try<br />
to get a group that looks something like this:<br />
<br />
Tank - I don't group much with warriors, considering how much better<br />
     Knights are at holding taunt.  Paladins are nice since they can res,<br />
     and I usually don't have clerics in my groups anymore.<br />
Healer/Slower - Yours truly<br />
DPS<br />
DPS<br />
DPS<br />
DPS<br />
<br />
Rolls pretty nicely.  Had an all-pet group with SK (he had his baby<br />
skeleton out), necro, mage, shaman, beastlord, necro.  That was pretty<br />
fun.<br />
<br />
General tips...<br />
<br />
Find a couple people who like to grind experience in the same hours you<br />
do.  Schedule groups, much easier and more efficient than going LFG.<br />
<br />
When you start a group (or join someone else's) ask beforehand how<br />
long people are going to stay, and ask them to be courteous and find<br />
a replacement before they leave.  Downtime hunting LFG's kills your<br />
experience rate.<br />
<br />
If the experience is sucking, for whatever reason, it's time to excuse<br />
yourself and find a replacement.  Don't waste your time in bad groups.<br />
<br />
Contrary to popular belief, not only charmers can solo in PoP.  Solo the<br />
zoneout in PoJ on off hours.  Root/rot trash in PoN if you're hard pressed.<br />
Heck, soloing in Katta, though outdated is still ok experience. <br />
Your experience per hour rate is significantly lower than PoP groups, but<br />
you can roll at your own pace, don't have to sit LFG and don't have<br />
much downtime.  Or find a partner, BL or necromancer works great, and<br />
explore tier 1 planes for a decent place to exp.<br />
<br />
Alls I got.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>nornez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">yeap 1 blue an hour of full on xp (i.e not split with aaxp) blows chunks... first off you need a proper camp &amp; not just clearing yard trash... best regular camps in tier 1 POP IMHO are factory hands down best xp, PON gobbie camp &amp; PPOD LCY or RCY... those are the 4 camps I log on &amp; hope to get a group in.<br />
<br />
For melee type damage, the best tanks are pally's number 1 &amp; SKs not far behind (but SK is the better puller with FD). I like the addition of the ranger also (especially for snare) for the good DPS. I guess then a beastlord (mind candy, good DPS), monk, rogue &amp; last &amp; definately least a warrior. Warriors just can't get or hang onto agro... it's kinda sad, I shiver at the thought of a warrior MT. First choice would be pally / SK melee combo.<br />
<br />
For casters, I have been grouping lots with mage's &amp; have really come to like that addition to the group... smoking pet, mod-rods &amp; DPS (oh yeah weaps for my pet too). I would take a wizzie next if no mage is avaiable. Necros can be nice &amp; hacve worked out well in the groups I have been in with them. Last &amp; definately least is the chanter... too much over lap although the thought of mezz &amp; mind candy is nice.<br />
<br />
Bards are another favourite of mine if we have the other areas covered (just too much utility there that won't go to waste)... MT secondary melee &amp; FD puller if required.<br />
<br />
So my ideal group i think would look like this... shammy, cleric, pally, SK, mage, bard. That looks kind of unconventional but this group I think is going places &amp; scoring great xp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Tallanas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Best group ever? <br />
<br />
Me, 59/60 Shaman - 60 Necro - 61 SK<br />
<br />
We held RCY in Disease for hours and hours, and the xp was awesome... Until this, I never knew how spectacularly awesome necros were... Our necro healed the entire time, and i just malo'd/slowed, dotted and nuked to my heart's content. SK made sure i just could NOT get aggro.<br />
<br />
Great fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Jzak, hate to disappoint you but grouping at your level thats about the rate you will find (assuming tier1 PoP or other expansions).<br />
<br />
If you really want the rate you describe, you will need some toys (jbb, horse, fungi, epic, lots of ac / hp) and be prepared to solo.  Mid to high 50's grouping is pretty slow xp a lot of the time.<br />
<br />
If you have access to T2+ planes though, nevermind what I said and make sure to group there :)  I was pretty disappointed with most T1 trash mob xp compared to just a good ole kunark dungeon crawl or some good solo spots.<br />
<br />
I think at 56 I was getting a yellow about every 2 - 2.5 hours solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Wooja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I try to keep the PoN/PoD groups as small as possible but still have good DPS.  Usually, it is me (61 shammy), 61 SK, 61 rogue, and sometimes a 4th member.  We do the gargoyles in the fort, or just yard trash usually.  The gargs are fairly dangerous, though, and if you&#8217;re not careful you can lose somebody pretty fast.  Gargs also resist slow fairly often, so they need to be debuffed.<br />
<br />
Sometimes we add a chanter and a cleric to that mix, and we chain pull whatever mobs we can find on hedge side.  We try to avoid getting over 5 members, though.  The fun part is that I get to be the puller for a change.  The tank pulls the first mob and engages, then after that I pull with slow and bring mobs back to camp, where the chanter mezzes.  Once mezzed, I will usually malosini just for the heck of it, and then I&#8217;m off to pull again.  Once we have 4 or so mobs in camp, I&#8217;ll stop and cannibalize a bit, maybe adding a DoT and refreshing slow on some of the mezzed mobs if the melee types are a little slow killing.  I recommend having a pally or SK tank for this since a warrior has to taunt several times before breaking mezz, and that either slows things down or makes life hard on your chanter.  I&#8217;m not knocking warriors here &#8211; I leveled one to 60 myself.  =)  As long as the tank has decent AC and doesn&#8217;t drain the cleric, the only limitation is the chanter&#8217;s mana.  We usually do it in 30-45 minute runs before the chanter needs a med break, and sometimes we don&#8217;t have to stop at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Astraa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Since I totally dislike PoN and PoD, I group mostly in PoI with guildies =P normal group is 57 Shaman (me), 61 Cleric, 61 Enchanter, 58 Monk, 63 Warrior, and a 6th. Enchanter keeps a mob from outside charmed, which makes the mobs drop fast =P<br />
The xp might not be the best we could get (it is way more than 1 blue an hour though), but we get along, have fun =P don't fight over loot, and can keep the golems clear by ourselves. Beats any xp hands down in my book.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>shinreineko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">By far the best xp I ever got was duoing with my 60 druid friend in PoD, he would charm rats and use those to tank, while I dotted/nuked. Was unbelieveable xp, I was there one day for about an hour and a half and got nearly like 34% xp (I was 52 at the time). The guy is a crazy puller though lol, more than once we had 4-5 mobs on root park, but made for some hella great xp.<br />
<br />
Last night I was duoing with a 57 Necro in PoN killing mostly Tree's and Spiders by kiting and that was good xp too, as a 54 Shaman I got about 17% xp in an hour and 20 minutes or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">cool thread to see resurrected. Good trio groups are *the* best if you can get into a good rhythm imho. Druids in trios when they are charming make good trio classes.<br />
<br />
We can slow effectively at around level 57 in tier2, which in a full group you will almost get 1 percent per kill (give or take depending on your level) which is the best exp I've seen since nadox in my 40s. Most of the grinding is in valor doing razorfiend camps or glolems and crawlers in the northern part of the zone. Storms is equally as good as well.</div></div><hr />
