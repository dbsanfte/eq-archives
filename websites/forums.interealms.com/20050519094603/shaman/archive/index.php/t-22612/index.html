<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is it possible to autojoin a chat channel so that the channel is allocated a particular number rather than the next available?<br />
<br />
Ie. Could I allocate serverwide.crucible to channel 9 ?<br />
<br />
<br />
This would make it much easier for raid slowed messages etc, I wouldnt have to change the chat number of them each raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Since channels get numbers from what order they are joined in, you have to put 8 channels in front of the one you want located at #9. The only way is to have 8 other channels you participate in or simply make 8 dummy channels.<br />
<br />
If you first put in your standard channels for debuffs and friends at the beginning and put random channels later on it get easier to manage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You could make a hotkey to join all your channels also.  Thats what I do.  I know I like to have a friends channel, raid channel, FA cast on % t channel, etc.. in a particular ordre.  <br />
<br />
Having it as a hotkey allows me to change the join order in game if I want to change windows and stuff without having to edit the ini file each time.  Never really did like autojoin for that reason.</div></div><hr />

Actually, evertime you put in an autojoin line in EQ, you overwrite the old one. So everytime you write one you have to write in all previous channels you still want to join.<br />
<br />
So if you first type /autojoin channel1<br />
<br />
And then type /autojoin channel2<br />
<br />
You will only autojoin channel2 since channel one is overwritten by the new input. So, to autojoin a bunch of channels you have to set them in the same line like this:<br />
<br />
/autojoin channel1:password,channel2:password,channel3...<br />
<br />
Or you could just edit your eqclient.ini in your Everquest directory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah, for this reason I keep a social with my /autojoin stuff, so I can update it and refresh for next time. You know, passwords change, channels are no longer worth the time, new channels come along...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>7ekno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Or you could just edit your eqclient.ini in your Everquest directory.<br />
<br />
<br />
Its a little unknown secret, but you can set global and character autojoins ....<br />
<br />
The autojoin command in the EQCLIENT.INI file is a global autojoin that effects all characters on all accounts on all servers ....<br />
<br />
There are now character specific .INI files that you can put your autojoin command in that just effects that character, from memory (I am at work) the file name is something like Server_charactername.INI ... so mine would be called something like Quellious_Tekno.INI (there is also one for UI information per character too) ...<br />
<br />
Happy autojoining,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I just have three autojoin channels, one for my two brothers and I to converse in, one for some select friends and I to chat in, and the crucible. =)<br />
<br />
Whenever there is a raid channel I will join it first to make it /4, if there is a shaman only channel for the raid I will join it next so it's /5, and if they FORCE me to - I'll join the healer's channel as /6. =P<br />
<br />
I also have a seperate window open for /rs, /4, /5, /6. That way I can focus on what's happening on the raid, although sometimes I overlook tells/group chat. =\</div></div><hr />
