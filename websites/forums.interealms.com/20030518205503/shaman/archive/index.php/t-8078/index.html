<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Crug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well I was looking at some of the ogre cultural armor stats (wow) and I kind of want some of that for me shaman.  Only problem is there are no ogre smiths on Xegony that I know of.  So can anyone help me out by telling me where I can find adamantite ore?  I am already working on my shaman's smithing skill (If I can't buy it I'll MAKE it) but I can't find anything on where adamantite ore is sold.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It should be in Oggok now.  if not, head to Neriak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Crug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">D'oh I hope it's not in Neriak I am KOS there.  Shouldn't of helped the halflings ;_;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Walknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think the problem with Ogre Smiths is that the skill check for trade skill increases checked against Int.  Ogres were lacking to say the least in that area.  Since they now have made it the higher of Wis or Int it doesnt much matter what race you are anymore.  This change was made years later and with the cost and time required to get Smithing up, most High lvl Ogres dont care to mess with it.  This is just my opinion on why you dont see many Ogre or Troll Smiths.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think smithing skill ups also check strength, which is probably the best stat for ogres to boost. Especially shamans.<br />
<br />
Best place for more details is http://eqtraders.com/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Krenk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Skilling up still only uses INT checks. While a combine success now uses INT or WIS, which ever is higher. All tradeskills also have a secondary check for success, in the case of smithing it is STR.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Skilling up now uses the higher of Int or Wis, was changed a while ago after mucho aggro from priest casters to the devs.<br />
<br />
A secondary stat (str in case of smithing) + your skill level relative to the items trivial level now determines success rate.<br />
<br />
If you want to argue about it go to EQTraders forums and post your opinion there, make sure you have your fire resist gear on when you do :). <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Azhdarkhos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">So close and yet so far...<br />
<br />
Official word, given at many a Fan Faire, and backed up by an *enormous* amount of in-game testing by players (info found at www.eqtraders.com):<br />
<br />
Skill-up rate is determined by the highest of Int, Wis, or a Secondary Stat if the tradeskill in question has one (Str for smithing, Dex for Fletching, maybe others in the future).  In this instance, an ogre smith would use the highest of Int (not likely), Wis or Str to determine rate of Skill-up.  For an ogre shaman, Str will likely be the determining stat since it's easy to buff Str to ungodly levels as a high level shaman.<br />
<br />
Success rate is determined *solely* by skill level - no other stat affects success rate.  Geerlok and similar devices that have a bonus to a tradeskill add to your effective skill for purposes of determining chance of success on a combine.  Such items do not affect whether or not you can get skill-ups on items that are near trivial point, nor do they give any bonus to chance for skill-up.  At present, these type of items do not stack with each other (i.e. if you have one item with +5% and another with +15%, you would only get the +15% to your skill level.)<br />
<br />
Both of these have been extensively tested by players on live servers and have been found to be true.  For more information, checkout the various FAQs and such found at www.eqtraders.com, on the main site and in the various forums.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Walknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">How ever it is today, I dont think it was like that way back when..so I think my theory still holds water. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Makelike</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">This might help dunno if you could ever find them in game but worth a try. ;) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Azhdarkhos has it right on. With one stipulation, Str has to be 175 or higher to become a factor in the equation at all. Which isn't a problem for an Ogre Shaman smith. :) Adamantite is still in Neriak unless they just changed it, all the way in the back of the 3rd Gate and Ogre  Shaman start KOS back there, found that out the hard way back at lvl 9. The best way to find a GM Ogre smith on Xegony is to post a request for one on the Xegony section of EQ traders:<br />
http://pub147.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfrm53<br />
Also they'll be much likelier to give you a better price if you contact them there rather than in the Bazaar. The road to becoming a GM smith is actualy worth the journey now, but it's very, very expensive and/or time consuming, bewarned. It's way better to find a smith if all you're interested in is a single suit of the good stuff. Good luck to you and good hunting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Krudler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'm not positive but you might want to look for Barbarian smiths making Fierce Heraldic plate (Rallos Zek armor) <br />
<br />
Assuming that Rallos Zek is your diety... There's a couple Barb smiths on my server that worship RZ and I think they can make Crimson splintmail or whatever it is.. the difference is just in the gems they use I believe. I'm not a smith so I'm not positive, but I'm pretty sure that's what I was told.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ghanimaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">barbarians can only make helanic plate or artificer's chain. Humans make fierce heraldic plate but it's not much use to shamans since it's plate... An ogre shaman can only wear ogre smithed stuff as far as the &quot;blue diamond&quot; armors go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">As for where to find smithin stuff in general, try the EQ Traders Smithing Supplies (http://www.eqtraders.com/location/smithing.htm).  On Karana there are also sometimes folks selling it in the Bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">As a 224 skill ogre smith, I can assure you that skilling up on smithing doesnt rely on INT if your STR or WIS is higher.<br />
<br />
The ore issue is finally being addressed. It was brought up at the last fan faire, along with vah shir spiritstones. The devs were open to both ideas. Kitties got their port stone, so I would expect an ore vendor in ogguk any patch now.<br />
<br />
I'm on drinal btw, if anyone is looking for any of this armor, send me a tell in game.</div></div><hr />
