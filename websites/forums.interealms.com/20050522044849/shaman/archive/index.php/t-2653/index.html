<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was hunting in my lil spot last night and noticed that after 1000's of nathy's. guards, I am dubious to a majority of the (good) guards, and indifferent to the bankers. Poked my nose in the bard guild and they still hate me (yay for Lcea kills).<br />
<br />
Anyone got a good breakdown of the factions in Katta? Whut are the bankers on? What faction is needed for the BSoW quest? Any other quests worthwhile in Katta?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ahhh and I have all those shissar organs in my bank still, was that EB item quest in katta?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Haha...sorry, don't mean to get off topic, but I just saw your title under your username.  That's hilarious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes, the EB quest item is in Katta, however I am not sure who gives the quest.<br />
<br />
I am not sure on any other quest as well because I like to Kill everything that roams Katta.:p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Krak - these &quot;nathys&quot; guards you are hunting - they are in Katta also?<br />
<br />
I'm asking as I've been looking into raising katta faction myself, but the only suggestions I've had so far involve killing Seru guards.<br />
<br />
(Not that that's a bad thing, just investigating alternatives.)<br />
<br />
I've only been to Katta once so far, that was to help a friend do the Cloak of Truth quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Killing Coterie in Tenbrous Mountains raises Katta faction.  While your at it, collect the fangs, dust and other vampire parts.  Once you can go in Katta, you can hand those in for faction as well.  Congratulations on your accomplishment Krakster.  Must have taken forever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Boraman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Bankers should be on Katta Citizen's faction.<br />
<br />
Guards are on Validus custodious faction.<br />
<br />
Mages are on Magus Conlegium faction. <br />
<br />
The Quest NPCs (and Lcea?) are on Concilium Universus faction.  I have yet to find anything that will raise it besides doing quests which you cant do if your KoS (unless you charm buts its waaaaaayyyyyy slow).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>bakkal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I pl'd a SK from 30-38 killing the Hand of Seru's in Marus Seru/Neth Lair.<br />
<br />
10 total spawns. <br />
<br />
I'd imagine we killed it 100 times. (1000 hits is a good guess)<br />
<br />
Went from Max KOS to dubious. Back to scowling now after I started killing in Katta (talking about the guards<br />
<br />
1000 faction hits is a lot when you're farming greens. Hardly even notice when you're PL'ing a melee.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Grippa, there is a big bad evil enchanter that lives on the top level of Katta. ( my understanding of the story is that Lcea and Nathy ((not his full name btw)) are at odds with each other in the town.<br />
<br />
As you walk up the ledge from below, and get to the top, its that first building on ya left. 2 guards by the door and 2 sonic wolfs that see invis (sow and hug the wall and they wont agro). Any npc's that spawn in there give a + Validus custodious. (and a + cotiere faction, lol i am apprehensive with vamps lol)<br />
<br />
I bet my indifference with the bankers comes from the few nathy slayings I have been on. <br />
<br />
Hmmmm... I am max ally with half of seru and kos with the other. Lol. Gunna explore somemore in katta tonight to see where else I am kos.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Padraic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The eb neckpeice is in Katta.  I'm not sure what to call the building.  I call it the palace.  I've heard it called the garden building  It's up fairly close to the Ten Mts zone.  Big garden in front of it, surrounded by walls.  When you first walk into the building, nice red carpet, and stairs straight ahead.<br />
<br />
To either side of the room are doorways.  To the left, is the quest giver for the Shield of Bane Warding, and the Shaman Trainer.  The guy who gives the amulet of the grey wastes is through the right doorway.  Go down the hall.  I think the second door on the right.  Hail him, he gives out 2 quests I think.  Pretty apparent which one you want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Nathyn Illuminous - dude in house at top of ramp.<br />
His faction opposes Validus Custodus (the folks in the building near the graveyard I think and most of the guards), Coterie (vamps), Hand of Seru and Shoulder of Seru.  <br />
<br />
Killing Nathyn factioned folks does not affect Concillium Universus (Big castle with garden out front) which is most of your quest givers.  It also has no effect on the Magus faction.  It will get you non kos to most of the guards in town, as they appear to be Validus Custodus faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>guice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I remember that guy. He drops the +100 CHA robe, doesn't he?<br />
<br />
Anyway, I got to threatening with my IKS MNK runing the Earing quest in Seru. :)<br />
<br />
Just got earing 1 and 2, and I'm threatening to some guards. I then killed Nathyn and some guards. Not sure what happened with faction after that.<br />
<br />
Then we killed the bard. L something Katta. I don't think that helped my faction there. :)</div></div><hr />

I PL'd an sk from 56 to 60 (grats to karnij, sol ro's newest gravelord!) killing katta guards :D.  I have also been soloing there ever since I was 54.  I am now max kos to all related katta factions, and max ally to all related seru factions.  I'd say I have killed about 4000 guards :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I call that building the cathedral, cuz it has big stained glass windows.<br />
<br />
Drenic Garrison is the EB quest guy.  My iksar friend handed in the organs WHILE FIGHTING Drenic, having chanter charm him and then invis iksar on turn-in.  My ogre was not KOS but could not do quest, so bard friend invised me after i opened up trade window -- success.  I think they may have nerfed that.<br />
<br />
The quest to gain faction you can do with the WORST katta faction is handing in pyrrohitite stones to a dorf in his own little room...Berk Thurstone, in dorf section.  They weight 10 each and do not stack!  They are somewhat but not really really uncommon drops off sonic wolves in tenebrous mountains.  Good luck. ;)<br />
<br />
Do that and enough coterie/seru killing and you can hand in at the mage tower coterie blood or ashes, four at a time, to Avir Sternbla or something on the 2nd or 3rd floor of the mage tower in Katta to get faction and a bit of coin and very cheap gems.  A barbarian in the warrior guild will take either the blood or the ashes, not sure which, so experiment.<br />
<br />
Also don't remember if you get able to do the following before or after the barbarian.<br />
<br />
Corporal Kent in warrior guild gives the shrieking substances quest.  He gives you a heavy box to fill with 8 of them(fall off sonic wolves in tenebrous just like the pyrrhotite, but stack and are not so heavy); combine it and it fits into a bag when combined.  You get faction and throwing items -- bane damage to vampyre waters--like holy water.<br />
<br />
Nathyn Illuminous is the guy in his house by the zone to tenebrous who drops the 100 cha robe.  His guards are on his own faction, as are the sonic wolves in his yard.  Killing him and his boys won't hurt your faction around the rest of Katta, and in fact gives some positive faction.  However, you do your killing outside probably, so if you're KOS, you're right by a bunch of guards including a roamer.  These guys are high level guards than the ones down below by the bank that most people kill.  Nathyn will completely kick your ass even with a full group, so don't get carried away.<br />
<br />
I've done all this stuff over a period of months, handing in literally hundreds of quest items and killing many seru and coterie for days on end, and my ogre shaman still cannot buy or sell or get many quests in Katta, though he could bank and walk through freely from day one absolutely everywhere.</div></div><hr />
