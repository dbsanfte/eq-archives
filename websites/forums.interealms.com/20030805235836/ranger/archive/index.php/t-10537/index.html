<br />
I mean rangers are masters of the wild so it would only make sense that we would know how to work with animals.<br />
We could get it at lvl 6 and could be able to charm animals up to 1/2 our own lvl and it would have a set duration it would last from 6-15 it would last 5 mins 16-30 it would last 10 mins 31-40 it would last 15 mins 41-50 20 mins 51-55 25 mins 56-59 30 mins 60 = dire charm type effect<br />
it would make perfect sense also and probaly not that hard to code and base reuse time would be 10 minutes.</div></div><hr />

I don't have anything to say about LoH except that it has been a paladin ability for ever in DnD which is probably why it was added.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sarvak GladeSha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Honestly I dont think track is all that big of a deal I play a ranger and rarely use it about the only time I use it is when im running through a zone and hit it real quick to see if anything is up which could easily be done as a druid etc.<br />
I rarely if ever get asked to track something. Using it to find blues etc I dont ever even bother using it. Because if your 40+ you should already have mapped out what zones your going to be doing till you get to 60 and alternates if those are camped.<br />
Tracksort big freakin whoop its not hard to scroll down the list.<br />
<br />
The fact still remains that no matter how sucky it might be all the other hybrids get a class only skill and we dont and VI needs to fix it.</div></div><hr />

I'll win a track race against any other tracker class with our filters, sorts, and pure RANGE anyday.  I don't know your level, Sarvak, or your tracking skill, but I have maxxed out Tracking skill, and its a pure PAIN in the arse to scroll down through a fully popped zone looking for one specific mob or mob type in a sea of other mobs.  If I know the approximate level of the mob, i can use the filters and sort the list to minimize my search time, which means faster kills.<br />
<br />
Want to see how useful ranger tracking can be?  Head up to Scarlet Desert and look for named Revenants.  I went up there with some friends who usually used a Druid to track, and I flat out found more nameds faster than the Druid ever could.  Hell, we even stayed there longer because I kept finding another named up as we were leaving.<br />

Is it super duper defining?  Not really...but don't knock it until you've really tried it.</div></div><hr />

How much time does it take for you to learn all you need to know in a new zone?  It would seem to me that it might take a long time, too long for me personally.  I like a little bit of variety and an element of the unexpected now and then.  Guess that's one of the reasons I like my track so much...:D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>goson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I can only assume that you are trying to be funny Sarvak. If you actually play a ranger and dont use track then you are a crappy ranger. The only rangers I have seen that do this are the same rangers that dont use bows and try and get the highest ac gear they can find so they can tank. Make a warrior if thats what you want cause a ranger, in EQ,  is designed as an archer and a tracker. I know in my guild ranger tracking is essential in finding the high end mobs. Sure a druid can track to see if something is up, but he has no idea if its close or not and does not have anywhere close to the tracking range that a ranger has. When we get the word for trackers to find the mob, its a race between rangers to track that guy down. If you dont do this now then I fear you will have a hard time filling the role of a ranger if you get in a nice endgame guild. Hey, just my opinion too. Maybe there will be other rangers in the guild that can do all the work and let you pretend to be a warrior. Oh well, to each his own i guess.</div></div><hr />

when you are trying to beat out other guilds for spawns or trying to see what is up for your 6 person group so other ppl dont get the spawn first b4 you, then track is very important.  I &lt;3 track, I can't live without Track.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sarvak...if you continue to play the game to the named raid level, you'll find very good uses for track. Trust me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Ticharary</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">You are totally blowing this out of proportion. I track when I want to find certain mobs for a camp, then I'm done. I track if I'm in a large outdoor area and pulling back to group (track group member). I track if someone shouts is soandso up. But my biggest use for track is in the bazaar =p I wouldn't wanna have to try to find that one person selling that one item without it.<br />
But it's not that great, and tracksort...hmm...thats not as great as some of you are saying. Me, I'll scroll coz I'm either not that lazy to use scroll or too lazy to switch to /tracksort. LoH is a great tool, and HT is as well. SK's and Pally's who don't think so are stupid. What does a Ranger who is soloing do at 20% hp....Run. A Pally can cast LoH and keep going ; a SK has HT so he is hurting &lt;mob&gt; and healing himself. I think these are useful skills to there class. Too bad their DPS sucks ass hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Jaysenn Stormra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Tracksort finds you the closest mob, filters out green crud you don't want to be bothered with, our larger tracking range means if it's in the zone, we'll be the first to know where it is.<br />
<br />
Track rocketh, that and (believe it or not) forage are the two things I miss the most when not playing my ranger. Need to find a zoneout in a place you're new to? Note the name of an NPC (usefully soulbinders frequently in PoP who are green) track, escape. Peachy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Jalim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I use tracksort a TON when soloing. I filter out everything except what I am after (dark blues). If you want to you can then sort by con and get the highest level dark blues on top, and go hit them, or go get the lowest dark blue cons. When you are in a zone with other non-rangers looking for the same mobs you can simply blow them away by cutting down on the amount of searching you have to do on your track list. <br />
<br />
I have a hard time believeing that anyone has every rare mob for every zone mapped out in their head with the spawn times constantly memorized. Even if you did there are *tons* of wandering rares, with people after them. Pretty hard to memorize the paths of rares and how long it takes them to run their course and where they will be at any moment :)  Tracking is one of the best things about a ranger. I have played with a friends druid, and their maxed tracking is pitiful.<br />

A Bard with max Track 1500 TU<br />
A Druid with max Track 1980 TU.<br />
A Ranger with max Track 3480 TU.<br />
We can track over twice the distance as a Bard and +1000 more TU than a Druid.<br />

I dont ever recall some one shouting for some one to LoH them, let alone HT them (i have seen Paly's and SK's shout for SoW). <br />
I quess when in groups it is expected for each class to automatically use their innate abbility (Ranger-Track to pull/Radar, Paly- LoH for last second heal, SK- HT for crucial damage).<br />
<br />
Now, I have only once been asked for my tracking services, an Iksar Monk shouted for help finding Kwinn the Outlander in FV. Took 45min till he spawned, but I took it as a challange (Ranger VS da world, Ranger wins :p ) and had fun.<br />
<br />
Unless your prey is static, you'll need a way to find it.<br />
I wouldnt trade Track for anything and if you think we can simply be replace by a Bard/Druid Tracker, the results will be short comming.  ;) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Zax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Well i've assisted others a LOT using track to find specific MOBS they need.  I personally use it all the time.  I've just made 50 and the skill is maxed.  I usually use it set to distance.  Keeps me and my party aware of whats close that can be a threat or possiably a target for us.  If a specific mob is needed the track sort options, if used, make it a snap to find it.  As far as Class Specific ability goes I would like to see Rangers be able to do more damage with a bow at earlier stages.  We after all are Rangers and that is supposed to be our strong point.  I understand that we get AA skills endless quiver and trueshot later on but i dont belive we should have to wait for a decent damage level  until the mobs we are after have 3 million hp's lol.  Rangers should be given the ability to do superior damage with a bow above and beyone all other bow using classes.  Just my two cents worth.     Give me a shout on Terris Thule if i can be of any assistance if its named Zax something or other its probably me lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>entilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Defenders of the track, i agree with you.  our track is awesome and makes us the perfect scouters in outdoor zones.  But yeesh, exactly who was saying that in order to have a class defining ability that our track would be nerfed?<br />
<br />
That said, i'd have to side with Blaizes main point of not feeling like we have a defining class ability on the lines of LoH and HT (i don't care what you say about HT but LoH does in fact ROCK!).  I am hesitant to call our special track our defining ability.  It is more of a convenience skill, albeit a good one.  The improvements granted over the druid/bard are necessary simply because of the range; in fact without the sorting options, being able to track a whole zone would make it worse than druid/bard track in more situations than not.  But unless the only thing you do every time you play EQ is track named mobs in large outdoor zones and run your group from spot to spot or you solo exclusively or never ever hunt in a dungeon, you just don't rely on it as often as you think.  I would wager that most of the time a group is camping somewhere stationary and basically killing the things that are closest, in which case track is used more to see if a named has popped, especially in dungeons and hence the druid/bard track is just as good.  Oh, and yes my druid gets asked to track AND sow too.<br />
<br />
Not sure what the class skill should be, but animal-skill or archery sounds fine.  I'll side more with Zax as well, if archery is to be our forte, they need to make it better for us from the get-go.... and not just after 108 levels (60 + AAs).  <br />
<br />
My idea for a skill would be a self-only-insta-sow/cheeta (on a timer of course) for crossing terrain and in combat for quick get-aways (would help survivability just as LoH and in some sense HT do in combat). Also makes sense to me that rangers should be one of the faster runners in the game to begin with. Personally I think the game designers just lacked imagination in desigining our class, all you have to do is read the description of Rangers in the PoP book to see this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Jalim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Ya know, I am FINE with SoW, but....<br />
<br />
Would it really be all that class unbalancing to make rangers the king of outdoor land-travel? Or at least give us an added Spirit of Cheeta or Scale of Wolf &quot;Ability&quot; (not spell) that would be on a refresh timer? <br />
<br />
I never really considered this until I just saw that idea above. Rangers do not have a gate spell or port spells, and I can understand that. But we ARE part druid, and since they are kings of movement, I don't think it is terribly unreasonable to think rangers would be at least on par with the land movement abilitys of druids, if not above them. Sort of falls in line with our added tracking ability I would think. <br />
<br />
Bards would still be the overall kings of speed on land of course, and I am fine with that too. But I don't see why an outdoor only very fast self only sow, with a refresh timer etc, would be very unbalancing.  Even if that button type ability was a scale of the wolf type speed that only worked until you attacked. <br />
<br />
I dunno, there is most likely some reason why it wouldn't work. Please inform me :)  .   Really though, I don't have any complaints worth mentioning. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Valorindel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Not to pee in anyone's cheerios or anything, but I know I knew what I was getting into when I rolled my ranger. I didn't get a combat ability (ie. Lay of Hands, Harm Touch) but I got a utility skill in tracking in which is unmatched by any other class in the game that gets it. Now, the only thing I don't like is that more than one ranger is redundant in most situations if all you need is a tracker. Where as another LoH or HT in an encounter would never hurt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Eldowin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">well I think track is more than enough for me, I wouldn't mind something to make traveling easier, but I don't need it, we got pop and luclin ports, what more do we need? a window where you just click the zone's name?<br />
<br />
I think the reason some of you are undervaluing track is that it doesn't save your butt when your adrenaline is pumping, it just makes life easier. I don't always use track, but I definately appreciate it when I have it.<br />
<br />
When I am hunting in dawnshroud I never needed track, when I did large zelniaks I just stood in a nice spot where they all wandered. When I did hoppers it was easy, they all spawn in a cave, so no need. But try going to jaggedpine, I couldn't even stand tracking dark blue griffons until I filtered all the light blues and greens, then set tracksort to distance and I was finding them easy, and if there were other people hunting I could tell if they had a griffon ussually because their name would be right next to that of the giffon, so I would go check the next farthest one, it was soooo much easier.<br />
<br />
Next comes quest mobs and rare spawns and such, for example the named mobs in dawnshroud/tenebrous/scarlet desert for twilight armor quests, trying to get enough of these guys to get the pieces for any twilight piece is a lto of effort, so you need to kll a lot, without track I would be 60 by the time I got all the pieces. Here track is invaluable.<br />
<br />
next is the simple convenience, drop into qeynos hills some time and track hadden or whatever the FB earring guy's name is, save 5 minutes running to his spawn point. Just passing through a zone? hit track see if there are any nameds up and kill em, might get something useful, and a much better chance than just hoping something will aggro you.<br />
<br />
I think the point at which I really realised how useful track is, was when I was playing classes who didn't have it, the two most valuable skills in the game IMO are track and feign death, too bad no classes have both... Anyways, it does depend on your playstyle a lot as well, if you grouped in the kunark fast track your whole life you probably didn't need to track much, just keep the pulls coming. If you hunted in guk it would be nice to know when camps/rares are uncamped/up without having to travel there and lose your old camp. If you did everfrost mammoths when there was competition, you know it helped. If you like to do quests, or look for named mobs just because, you will love your track.<br />
<br />
so although it isn't as obvious as HT/LoH I am quite content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Icye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">BLAH LoH junk HT junk Tracking Priceless.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Kishin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">HT/LoH are 72 minute abilities.<br />
<br />
i have a RL friend playing a Shadowknight.  and i can't count the number of times he's ranted to me about rangers asking for this very thing - a &quot;class-defining ability&quot; that parallels LoH/HT.  they only use these abilities when the sh... crap hits the fan.  are they nice abilities? yeah.  but the 72 minute refresh timer sucks mad cow.<br />
<br />
LoH doesn't become a great ability until it turns into the insta-cast CH(luclin aa).  HT doesn't become a great ability until the refresh timer is reduced (PoP aa) and the damage is drastically increased (luclin/pop aa).  I've been using track from day one in many different ways.  for me, it has always been a great ability.<br />
<br />
and while i wouldn't take tracking over Raltar's super mega uber death touch ability, i would take it over HT.  or LoH.  or a pet ability.  or all three together.  Tracking is that vital to my play style.  it lets us free-range hunt.  there's no way i could have hunted wandering mobs in EW to 51 without it.  notice who you see soloing in jpf.  rangers, druids, bards.  tracking classes.<br />
<br />
doesn't matter in the bazaar though.  when the list of traders pops up after your search, right-click on the name of the one you want to buy from, and your character will be pointed towards that trader.  it's like the spell &quot;locate corpse&quot; or &quot;sense animals&quot;.  <br />
<br />
as far as being like druids, we're further from our parent caster than Pallies or SKs.  if you want a 72-min refresh ability, ding 55 and get trueshot.  <br />
<br />
ranjas R ub4r!  no wonder the wish list is so short.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Kishin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">oh! i just got a great analogy.<br />
<br />
imagine you get the 2-min duration trueshot ability at level 1.  but that instead of am3 improving all archery, it was only applied during your trueshot /disc.  now imagine that half of your class AAs are related to improving trueshot, despite the fact that it's not really a significant overall dps increase due to its horrendous refresh timer.  that you need to dump a large number of AA points into it before it really becomes a worthwhile addition to your ability list.  and this is all despite the fact that trueshot had been part of your repertoire since day one.<br />
<br />
That's what Harm Touch is.  Still want it?  LoH gets good with fewer AAs, but it's essentially the same pattern.<br />
<br />
i personally think a level one Trueshot would be badass, and would be appropriate but for the fact that it's a level 55 velious ability.  but i would certainly not give up the current state of am3 for it.</div></div><hr />

One of the better things as a ranger is that we are one of the only classes that can duel weld and fight similar as a warrior and have the power to fear. Well fear animals anyway.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Shelgeyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">my biggest use for track is in the bazaar =p I wouldn't wanna have to try to find that one person selling that one item without it.<br />
&lt;blink&gt; ummm, are you aware that when you have your bazaar window open and find &quot;that one person selling that one item&quot; you can right click on that person's name and automatically turn to face him/her???<br />
<br />
Honestly, I've seen people ask druids (yes, DRUIDS) to track a trader in the bazaar - why? All I can figure out is that some people don't bother to read simple instructions printed on the screen in front of their faces.<br />

/rant off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Tygraon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I have one question<br />
<br />
Why, when someone ask what is the SPECIAL ranger ability, always, some m....... say &quot;ranger have track and spell&quot;.<br />
<br />
First : pally and sk receive spells from their caster parents too.  I can read and read my spell book, i don't see something special.<br />
<br />
Secondo : track is just fine for be disturbed by a f....... greedy asking you to track a mob because he drop &quot;&quot;&quot;The UBER&quot;&quot;&quot; item they need; generally it is in the other side of Norath, they don't know the name and hope you know the name of all named (and their drops) for all eq zone&quot;.<br />
<br />
The ranger don't have special ability and probably never grab one; Full stop and end of the story.  Or maybe we can receive a flying Pikatchu purple/red giving 5% bonus in begging and fishing  :D .<br />
<br />

PS : sorry for my english.</div></div><hr />
