Just read this on Casters realm.<br />
<br />
Can any test Shaman confirm that this is true for our pets?<br />
<br />
If so, Suspend minion just got a hell of a boost.<br />
<br />
Can you imagine the uproar when a Shaman rolls for a nice dropable weapon as a NBG upgrade for their pet? Can't wait 8)<br />

I did actually scan the titles on the first page for 'zoning pets' and didn't see anything matching.  Assuming that such a cool thing would have an obvious title and active discussion going, I went ahead and posted.<br />
<br />
At least now people can go straight to the obvious title, get a link to the active discussion, and get a chuckle out of my lack of message board skills on the way. 8)</div></div><hr />
