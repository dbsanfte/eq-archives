<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Made several stat potions for my baby beastlord.  Can't get potions with overlapping stat effects to stack.<br />
<br />
Accuracy wouldn't stack on Power, etc.<br />
<br />
Am I mis-remembering that these used to?  I seem to recall that they could be stacked to mitigate some of the negative effects?  <br />
<br />
It's been ages and ages since I played with a stat potion... and might be never again if this is the case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Never could stack the ones with neg effects if another potion had the same effect.<br />
<br />
They fixed the null potions and some others to be able to stack with some spells. But, it's been so long since i've used any of them i can't remember how they all worked now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I recall stacking potions with +stats and potions with -stats once so that overall I had 2 potion drinks for a single stat upgrade (was dex for procs and weapon skills, stacked Cohesion and Power).  So you COULD do it once upon a time.</div></div><hr />
