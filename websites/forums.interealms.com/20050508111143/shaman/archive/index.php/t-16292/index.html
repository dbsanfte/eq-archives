<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have spent my first three AA points on improved natural run speed and I had planned on spending my next three points on regeneration.  But a friend made what seemed like a good argument for spending those three points on stamina instead, to get the extra hit points.  My goal at the moment is to get canni five.  Any opinions on which of these two options are best on my journey to canni five?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Another vote for metabolism 3. If your dead set on one of the 2 do innate regen. Innate sta is only going to give you a small amount of hps and eventually as your gear improves it will become worthless once you can hit the sta cap buffed or even unbuffed like I do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Innate Stamina is pretty damned close to being useless. At 65, it will increase your maximum HP by about 30 HP. And thats only if with full gear and buffs you are still below 255. If you are over 255, its less. A lot less.<br />
<br />
Innate Regen 3 will at least get you 30 HP per minute in HP regen.<br />
<br />
Innate Metabolism 3 is almost a must if you ever plan to get a horse or lizzy.<br />
<br />
I personally went with RS3, Regen3 and Metab3. I know its 3 more AA than you need to spend, but they are all nice.</div></div><hr />

Introduction of stat food and lizzards and horses which eat tons</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I once thought that it was a waste... but it comes down to this.  Most people that play alot, find that they tend to run out of food and water alot.  Alot of us use the stat food, cause while it's more expensive, provides us stats.  Normal daily consuption of food and water is not that bad, however, while in exp groups and such where you will need to putting out the damage and keeping up with the mana regen, alot of us switch to using horses/lizards.  Now, while this in itself is not a problem, the problem comes with the horse/lizard comsuming YOUR FOOD/WATER.  I don't know exact figures, but you will run out of food/water alot quicker than if you were not on a horse.  I personally keep at least a stack of Halas 10lb meat pies and some type of water on me, but it's gotten to the point where I go through food/water so fast.  I have to literally restock food supplies once a week.  So, using only 3AAs for metabolism will decrease the food/water that is consumed by you and your horse/lizard by 50%.  In the long run, it saves alot of money that you would normally use on food.<br />
<br />
Of course, this isn't for those that don't use horses/lizards, but I think that once you get into certain aspects of the game, you will like the extra regen you get on the horse.  I know that during the warlord fight in PoEb, on my horse standing near a bard, I can chain cast both of our AE rains for just about the whole fight, using a rod and hitting canni5 as soon as I can at the beginning and everytime that I see it refresh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Wow, I didn’t expect so many people to recommend Innate Metabolism.  And to be honest, as a Vah Shir shaman who sits on his little green lizard, Pokey, every chance I get, I would certainly benefit from it.  And even when everyone was saying what a waste of AA points metabolism was, I was planning on buying it at some point.  But I must admit that it never occurred to buy it before Canni 5.  I guess this throws another option into the mix, but its certainly food for thought.  <br />
<br />
Thanks for the help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Metabolism or Regen, but definietly not Sta.  I maxed my sta out long before I hit elemental planes.  Metabolism is that good.  Especially when your too lazy to summon some food and water so the stat food stays.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Training any kind of innate stat increase AA (innate wis, sta, etc...) is a waste of points imho.  There is a shaman in my guild, for reasons I just cannot comprehend, decided to spend 30AA on innate wis and stamina.  They have higher unbuffed stamina and wis than me, which I guess is nice for your magelo, but with kei we both cap our wis, and with spirit of boar we both cap our stamina.  Great use of 30aa...<br />
<br />
I did innate regen and runspeed, but that was long before I had a horse or used stat food.  I have since gone back and trained innate metab3, and if I had the opportunity, I would have done it over regen3 when I was just starting AA.<br />
<br />
Another alternative is tanaan crafting mastery if you are a tradeskiller or plan to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Weight Watchers3, run3, and Regen3 are all very good to have for their costs.  Since POP came out and all the stat foods are around etc, I'd go with Weight Watchers 3 over regen 3.  When mobs hit for 600, 3 points of regen doesn't look so important anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Weight Watchers3, run3, and Regen3 are all very good to have for their costs.

<br />
I'd agree with nearly everything said there, but I would still recommend Regen3 over Metabolism3 as an AA investment for someone just starting out their AA path.  We are constantly smacking the Canni4 key, meaning just about all the time we are running below 100% health, moreso than any other class in the game in my opinion.  An extra 3 hp per tick won't offset mob damage in any noticeable fashion, but I do find it making a difference (however slight) as a constantly working passive boost to our hit points (&amp; thus indirectly our mana).  For those of us who were fortunate enough to wear a Fungi Tunic at one time or another, extra regen benefits are obvious.<br />
<br />
Food is cheap.  Even stat food is cheap.  If you run out, we can always summon bread &amp; water to make it through.  One minute of alternating Canni4 w/ a summon cast will set you up w/ enough to last a normal session.  <br />
<br />
I recommend getting Innate Metabolism much later on, after Canni5, RC1, VP1, &amp; some of the other great AA's.  YMMV.<br />
<br />
Take care,<br />
Frekkels</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gaesekki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Would definitely take metab over regen to start.  I waited quite awhile and regret it now that I see its' benefit.  Buy (or make) stat food and force feed.  If you are as forgetful as I am to force feed, it will definitely help you out.  <br />
<br />
Another bonus is that if you have or ever get a horse.  Ever hear the expression &quot;eats like a horse&quot;?  These things go through a LOT of food and drink without metab.  Get it as your second set of 3 in order to move on imho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Juff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">If I could redo my AAs, I'd take Metab3 over Regen3.  6 tick Q makes 3 regen/tick fairly moot.  I'd also concur with all stat increase AAs being a waste of AA points.</div></div><hr />

agree 100%</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>peleg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Looking back, metabolife would've been a good idea.  Those stupid misty picnics get spendy after a while... especially when you're too lazy to forcefeed (which of course I am).  Good thing I switched my drink over to Liquidised Meat instead of that fruity Afternoon Tea... much more affordable... <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I know it was said above, but I want to reinforce that sta over 255 is very much a waste of gear.  I finally woke up and got rid of my 15 sta bracer when I realized it was giving me 31 hps.  Because my stamina was too high.  *snort*<br />
<br />
Regen 3, Metabolism 3 (love that centi stew!) - I only wish I could shovel more points into regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Yodaopie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Another Vote for Metabo 3  and I have 3 points in innate wisdom but It wasnt me who put them there grumble :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Silverpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">RS3 -  because our guild does alot of indoor zones (bah LoDN and shrew)<br />
Innate Regen3 - because I chew alot<br />
Mental Clarity 3 - because I want to chew less<br />
<br />
Fast track to Canni 5 - see above  (into first of 5 AAs for canni atm)<br />
<br />
Next AA after Canni 5 - MGB or Dogs<br />
<br />
As far as the Metab 3 thing.  Bat wings and fish = fish rolls.  Banquet meals.  PoK fishing guy stands right across from the necro with the coffins.  Necro has the batwings, fishing barbarian has the fish.  Then I trot over to FP and get some Fuzzelcutters.  I can spend less than 20pp and get enough food and water for an entire day or more of sitting on my mount.  I used to spend that much on arrows for my warrior.  And I know clerics go thru 10 times that much with dots and food and water.  Metab can wait imo.  Doesnt help the raid if I am lom and low on hps but my bags are busting open with food, now does it :)   In a pinch, there is always summoned food/water.  ( But I havent ran out in a very long time.)<br />
<br />
After Canni 5 and MGB, I might just go for Metab, but the fish rolls and fuzzlecutters work for me, and any extras I just put on my monk.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Are you all SO hard up for cash that you can't afford to buy food drinks?  Is it just me or doesn't it seem a bit contradictory to tell someone that getting innate STA is a waste of AAs but spending AA on metabolism is worth it because STAT foods are expensive? :p<br />
<br />
I use Halas meat pies and Fuzzles drinks because I haven't found any decent drinks that have actual HP increases on them and +5 svall drinks/food stay in the bottom of my pack unless I really NEED those extra 10 to saves.   Day to day the Halas meat pies gimme 30hp and that's a nice lil bonus but even then no big deal overall IMO.<br />
<br />
Regen3 is kinda like giving yourself FT1.5 via AA when you factor cannis.  I'd say FT1.5 is a helluva lot more useful than cutting your food costs a few platinum pieces a week, personally.  Just buy 4 or 5 stacks of each at a time and you won't have to refill so often unless you are carrying THAT much junk around that you can't afford to fill a bag with food. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Gaesekki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Sciek, I agree with you that it not the price of the food but the convenience of having it last longer.  Besides, what is three hours of exp for the aa's needed?  Granted, when you are just starting out on aa's it means a lot (fast tracking to canV).....<br />
<br />
Get it now, get it later.  Your progression is your call.  However, I would consider it a very usefull 3aas spent in the long haul.<br />
<br />
Edit: Oh...and my bags are full of halas pies that I can't give away....darned skill ups for baking.  Eventually looking to make the platter where metab 3 is king.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">That's the thing though... Where it's a convenience at 65 when you have Q and can grind out an AA/hour... at level 60 or even lower when you're getting those first AAs I'd definately recommend Regen before Metabolism.<br />
<br />
Most likely you don't have any FT or perhaps a Solstice Earring for FT1 at that point, so Regen seems to me the more worthwhile of the two at that point.  Later on, sure 3 regen is a tiny drop when you have Torpor/Q and Canni5 but you obviously don't have Canni5 yet if you're trying to decide what to get in General AAs and there's a good chance you don't have Torpor/Q yet either. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Regeneration is useless once you scribe torpor or quiessence.  With the amount I cannibalize, a couple points per tick is a joke.<br />
<br />
Metabolism has been worthwhile for me.<br />
<br />
I spend a lot of time mounted, and food/drink goes fast.  I can burn thru a bag of food/drink in an evening or two.  Metabolism 3 and miraculous meals/drinks have extented the amount of time I can spend playiing vs resupplying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">But really the thing at the lower levels is cash.  You have none of it, you're saving what little you have for your spells, and obviously alot of us cannot resist the stats from the foods bought in bazaar.  Especially at that level, the 'minimal' statistics from those foods can mean alot.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I went meta3 because I already had natural iksar regen.  It has saved me thousands of plat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Once again, thanks for all the great posts.  It’s incredibly helpful to look at a question from so many different angles.  I decided to go ahead and spend my next three points on metabolism.  I will eventually buy regeneration as well, but I think metabolism will work well for me at the moment.  I’ve been big into trade skills since I first started this game over two years ago.  I wouldn’t be surprised if I’ve spent more time working trade skills on different characters than I have adventuring.  So I find it ironic that after making more Halas Pies than I ever care to remember and becoming a grand master brewer that I don’t use stat food or drink on my characters.  Money is not easy for me to come by, so this seems to be a good way to actually use the items I bake and brew and still not spend a lot of money I don’t have doing so.  And thanks to a friend’s research skill, I was able to scribe a copy of Torpor in my spell book last week for 4k pp.  So hopefully the use of that incredible spell, along with Replenishment, will take up the slack of not buying regeneration.</div></div><hr />

I regen about 63 hps a tick on my horse. That saves torpors and time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Go to Jaggedpine to either of the 2 cheese vendors. There are always stacks of patty melts on either of them from people who went there to do the baking combines and just sold back the successes. They cost about 2gp each. These are banquet sized meals, they last a long time. When I am hunting I leave the last 2 inventory slots devoid of packs and put one stack of water in one and one stack of patty melts in the other. In the top 2 slots of my first pack are my stat food/drink. I've gotten in the habit of trying to eat/drink every time I loot a mob. Only once in the past 2 months have I forgotten and then I only ate one of my stat food/drink. I solo all the time and never use my mount so maybe it would be more difficult to remember if you are grouped but you could get into the habit of trying to eat/drink after every pull. Of course with a mount you would have to carry more water and patty melts on you but the method would work just the same. <br />
The expense of buying stat food/drink is no longer an issue and you can avoid what I would consider the wasting of 3AA's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I've been using iron rations and water for 4 years now - on all my characters.</div></div><hr />

I regen about 63 hps a tick on my horse. That saves torpors and time.<br />
<br />
Regen is an amazing and probably the best a shaman can have up until the moment you scribe torpor. Once you have torpor the limiting factor on how much mana you can regen is no longer how fast you can regen the hps back. The limiting factor is how fast you can cann the hps down. As you get aa's/focus items to extend the duration and decrease the cost of torpor this becomes even more true. Get 65 and get q and you don't even have the snared side effect anymore. With q, scrm, crown of ambivolence, scm and a 15% mana pres item I have as much mana as I want to take the time to make and can spend just from using q. The regen provided by a aa just simply isn't needed once you have torpor or better.<br />
<br />
As far as stoicism goes I'm not sure where that stands since I was 65 with q before that was added. Looking at the numbers it's not as effecient as torpor/q but it is efficient enough to net an overall gain in mana. Maybe one of our younger shaman can comment on it.<br />
<br />
Basically cut and past from the holy trinity thread at http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=15542&amp;pagenumber=2 since it applies as well to regen as it does to fungi bp. Since the post has stated that he does have torpor I'd say that regen 3 wouldn't be the best choice. I'd go for Metabolism 3.</div></div><hr />
