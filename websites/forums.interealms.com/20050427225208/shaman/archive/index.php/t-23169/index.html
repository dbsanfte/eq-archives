Burnai's, these guys are wuss's they hit to the upper 60's maybe and have low hp's less then 1k I am guessing. Some can be light blue to a lvl 35, but it's not too often. The rockmasters are a bit tougher but that is all just a bit. The cenobites are tough at this level, they are clerics who will heal there friends and nuke you, if you are pl'ing kill these guys off, if not kill them quick.<br />
The Burnai's were my favorite thing to kill, back in the old day's I would hang out on the cliff near the OT zoneline and pull random mobs(Brutes, burnai's, goblins) giants if nothing else.<br />
<br />
For the upper 30's there is a tunnel near the DL zone that is filled with goblins these are the old gobby's from drog and nurg I believe. Not a bad place to go, at this point though I think your better of in DL or were ever since there are alot of casters and HT'ing nights. Good place to get those gobby skins and mineral salts.<br />
<br />
I remember hunting here in my mid 30's instead of OT like everyone else did. I took my necro here and I forgot how nice it is. First off I stay away from  the giants, I never liked the exp. I go after the brutes and burnie guys.</div></div><hr />
