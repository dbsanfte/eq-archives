It's a 333/tick HoT that gives 90 to Strength/Dexterity/Agility and raises the cap by the same amount now. The Endurance regen didn't make it live from what I can see.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now my question, for anyone who has this, is do the stat increases only last the 5 ticks?  Or is it a 5 tick HoT with a stat increase for some other period of time?  5 ticks for the stat increases just seems retarded to me, if that's the case.  I would imagine that having an extra 90 of each stat will do dick over a 5 tick period.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well I got the first level of this and I love it. Only thing that sucks is it doesn't stack with druids SotW. The info you have there must be for level 5 though, because when I use it, it only raises stats by about 30 I think, and yes the stat boost only lasts while the HoT is on. It is fairly nice though. I've wanted a group HoT for some time now and with a 12 min refresh it comes in very handy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can anyone test out the stacking/overwriting issues for ancestral aid?<br />
<br />
It's probably not a huge issue, but it seems wrong for diaku and rabid bear to be able to block (at least the first level of) a much more usefull spell just because a little str/dex.</div></div><hr />

Would it have killed them to put Cleave (30) and endurance regen on it?  I want it to heal, but I also want my melees to ooh and ahh like it's the 4th of July when they start raining down crits and burning through their endurance pool.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Endurance regeneration is useless.  I like the stat increase better.  If they actually changed the internal code so that having melee stats over 280 means anything, then this would boost dps slightly.<br />
<br />
It's also still a heal you can MGB, which is what everyone has been begging for.  I don't care about endurance regen, it's worthless.  If your tank runs out of endurance, he's probably not up to snuff to group with you and you should just get an SK or paladin instead.<br />
<br />
Will people here ever be satisfied with anything we're given, even when they ask for it?</div></div><hr />

There's a minor difference in HPs per tick and 1 less tick on the shaman buff, but the beasts get massive mana regen, whereas we get.... more useless stats??<br />
<br />
The melees i talked to about the endurance regen all said it would rock. Particularly in raid situations, which is what shamans have really needed for a long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">In one group I used this and they were &quot;Oh wow!&quot; when they saw the stats above their max, along with the hp regen.  In a different group later on they were ... silent... then I got &quot;Can you just give me FA?&quot;<br />
<br />
So... not sure what to make of this AA yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">There's a minor difference in HPs per tick and 1 less tick on the shaman buff, but the beasts get massive mana regen, whereas we get.... more useless stats??<br />
<br />
<br />
Quit with the class penis envy.  If you like another class's AA and buffs so much, then play that class.  We've never had mana regen and we may never get it.  We also don't need it, since you know what happens when more classes get mana regen abilities that can affect other group/raid members?  *GASP* They make spells cost more mana to cast or they make raids/mobs require more mana to kill.  They &quot;balance&quot; all this out as they go.  You may think you're getting something for free, but you aren't.<br />
<br />
If you start down the endurance regen path, then melees will essentially become hybrids and not pure melees anymore.  They'll start balancing encounters around endurance regen too and that will make things more tedious.<br />
<br />
We got an MGBable group heal, which is what we asked for.  I'm tired of coming here and reading complaint after complaint about what we should have because some other class has it and it makes them 10000 times better than us.  Can we can the pointless complaints until people actually have some levels and AA in this expansion to judge it on.<br />
<br />
That being said:  I have the second level of Ancestral Aid and I like it.  I use it when clerics are too lazy to cast EE or CR after using Divine Arbitration and the others in the group did notice the stat increases.  I also like I can cast it while running, it's good for healing up a little after kiting mobs around to root them while soloing.  I would like them to lower the recast time to about 10 minutes though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
IMO - the OoW AAs look very promising, and of course there are small issues that could make them even better (imo some dmg % or atk is better than the stats on Ancestral Aid), but as Jzak pointed out - we finally got a group HoT!<br />
<br />
@Shakula - level 2 and 3 is an upgrade to both stats, cap and heal (level three is 90 to stats/cap and a 333 heal)</div></div><hr />

<br />
level 1 is 30 to the stats and 278 HP per tick<br />
level 2 is 60 to the stats and 305 HP per tick<br />

i dont like the stats add its not worth it for the  few ticks this works and if you use the new fos and stam you over buff most people anyway? does this add more than the new fos stam over buff?, however if it did a cure per tick too (or the regen stam be nice but hey ho) that would be better, i like the cure and health regen idea.</div></div><hr />

Please clarify, does Diaku block the entire spell, HoT included, or just the stat increase.  Personnaly I could not care less about a 5 tick stat increase, the HoT is the reason I'd cast this.  I'd rather still keep Diaku up if the HoT will still land.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Stacking is always all or nothing. If you have diaku up the first level of ancestral aid will not land at all. If you have the second or third level it should overwrite diaku. Personally given how useless the stats are really and the only 33 point difference in what they heal overwriting diaku is probably the best reason to get the second level.<br />
<br />
I'm happy to have a group Hot aa but I have to say I'm rather disappointed with what we ended up with. Druid shaman and bst are all close enough together in amount healed thats pretty much a wash. Bsts get mana regen, druids get Ac/ds buff and shaman get stats over cap, wee. Clerics of corse end up with the much better HoT aa but thats not surprising or unexpected.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It isn't whining that we want what they have, its that we want something equivalent to what other classes get.   One class gets the massive mana regen, druids get a strong DS component, we get useless stats.   Thats the problem.  I don't want mana regen, I don't want a DS, I want an equivalent ability as the other classes, that being the Endurance Regen that was there originally.   660 additional mana or a 70 DS for 30 seconds is going to provide far more benefit in additional DPS than our increase of stats.<br />
<br />
If they don't want us to have Endurance Regen, which it appears the don't.  Then go with the idea of sticking the effects from Radiant Cure on it.  Ancestral Aid 1 would have Radiant Cure 1,  Ancestral Aid 2 would have Radiant Cure 2, Ancestral Aid 3 would have Radiant Cure 3.   That imo would make it an equivalent AA compared to the other classes.<br />
<br />
Basically Ancestral Aid 3 would look like this:<br />
<br />
1:  Decrease Curse Counter by 16 <br />
2:  Decrease Poison Counter by 16 <br />
3:  Decrease Disease Counter by 16 <br />
4:  Remove Detrimental(6) <br />
5:  Increase Hitpoints v2 by 333 per tick</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Cmon now you gotta be kidding me - in a good raid nobody's getting hit but the MA anyways, so thats only a DS on one person - but EVERYBODY can use 80 more pts of AGI.<br />
<br />
And who needs mana on raids?  Necro's pump the clerics, everyone else uses a horse/drog.<br />
