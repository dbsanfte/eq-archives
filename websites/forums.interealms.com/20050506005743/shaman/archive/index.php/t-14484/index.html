Does Charisma effect the chances of being resisted when casting the shaman slow line of spells?<br />
<br />
I would appreciate any help, thanks.<br />

Charisma only directly affects 2 things in the game.  The price vendors will sell to you at, and the chance for Divine Intervention to fire off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">also the amount of respect you'll get in shaman channel</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nevvyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Bah!  Ptui on Charisma.  Ptui ptui ptui.  Double ptui!<br />
<br />
For roleplaying reasons, I want the lowest charisma possible.  Nevvyn's a mean grizzled Northlander, and he's pissed whenever you talk to him.  Not as pissed as Prunezilla, but who is. ;)<br />
<br />
It 'supposedly' impacts more than just prices and divine intervention, like charm duration checks and whatnot.. but I think it's hogwash.<br />
<br />
So, to summarize, ptui!</div></div><hr />

'nuff said .. as a troll you don't need charisma as every cute female wood elf druid/bard/ranger is attacted to your cuddly, green butt...<br />
<br />
Sure it makes it hard to appear all bad ass in EC, but you will forever never be lonely !!<br />
<br />
BTW - Them female DEs are like hitting on a woman drinking tequila in a bar.. /DUCK</div></div><hr />

I haven't heard this before, glad I did. Does the person being casted on need good charisma for DI to work better or the caster that's casting the spell?</div></div><hr />

[QUOTE]Does Charisma effect the chances of being resisted when casting the shaman slow line of spells?<br />
[QUOTE]<br />
No.<br />
<br />
Charisma has very little effect on a shaman in battle.  There are a very few specific encounters where charisma will come into play, and by that time you will be ready for them.<br />
<br />
DO NOT WORRY about your base charisma stat.<br />
<br />
How does charisma affect your life as a shaman?<br />
With low charisma, you will pay more for vendor bought items, and receive less when you sell loot to vendors.  Instead of 1sp for a flask of water, w/ a low charisma you'll pay 1sp3cp.  Over time and with more expensive cash loots, this can add up.  But your base stat means nothing.  We get charisma buffs, and you can buy 2 opal encrusted steins for about 50pp (total) in the bazaar.  Equip both and even your ugly mug will get better prices (that's +50 to charisma with the steins alone).<br />
<br />
I have over the long time I've played Frekkels been equipped with various gear that has had my UNbuffed charisma in the 140's, and buffed (w/ steins equipped) at well over 200.  <br />
<br />
In my current gear, my unbuffed charisma is 52 as a barbarian!  I have noticed NO difference in my combat effectiveness with a charisma in the 140's OR at 52.  When I go to buy/sell, I unequip my -25 cha Brain of Cazic Thule and self buff Unfailing Revarence to get my charisma over 105, which is what you want to generally get best merchant prices.<br />
<br />
Another effect of charisma:<br />
We get Befriend Animal (a severely limited animal only charm spell) at level 29. This spell is at best a novelty for our class from levels 29-34, and a higher charisma will effect your ability to stick this spell on whatever light blue or green con animal you are charming.  This particular use for charisma for us is so minimal that it should have NO EFFECT on your decisions for gear/stats.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, do NOT worry about your low charisma except for its affect on your bank balance.  Buy the steins and keep those for when you are dealing with NPC merchants.  Buff your own charisma as well when doing that.  But DON'T worry about buffing your charisma when you are fighting.  Charisma is NOT a stat that you should be concerned about in an operational sense while playing.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Spot on, Frekkels.<br />
<br />
Just an additional clarification -- for every faction level (apprehensive, indifferent, amiable, etc.) there's a charisma at which you get &quot;best price&quot; from vendors and further CHA becomes useless.<br />
<br />
At indifferent, that CHA is 105.  Since PoK merchants are pretty much always indifferent, that's a number to keep in mind.<br />
<br />
BTW, the only time I can think that cranking CHA up higher is useful in buying is there's no limit (AFAIK) to how much it'll help in buying skill points from your trainer.<br />
<br />
But that's it.<br />
<br />
PS -- I walk around with a CHA of 57.  Just my buff gets me to 112, so I have no gear anymore.  However, several of my characters I just set up with enough Opal Steins to hit 105.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't need no stinkin charisma, I'm a TROLL, women love me cause I'm HUGE....<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Huge huh? .. but small where it really matters ....<br />
<br />
/cackles gleefully</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Duurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">As per the Dev corner some time ago, CHA and lull based spells, basically the higher your CHA, the more forgiving the mob may be if you cast some Lull based spell on it, even if it lands or is resisted.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, since shaman don't have any lull based spells (last time I checked), then it doesn't really matter. I've been in HoT as main slower and tested this to a point. I found that CHA over 120 didn't matter, some mobs after being slowed would keep on MT, other mobs would tear my head off after first cast and resisted.<br />
<br />
So I just keep up CHA as a junk buff slow behind insta-sow. <br />
<br />
Duurg</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I heard your sow gets faster as your charisma increases.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why is charisma still one of the 'preferred' stats upon shaman creation?  /boggle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">shh nobody say aything i'm gonna make a rumor<br />
<br />
charisma effects resist rates on slows and fire nukes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Lesiter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I haven't heard this before, glad I did. Does the person being casted on need good charisma for DI to work better or the caster that's casting the spell?<br />
<br />
<br />
It's the person you're casting on.  So the higher the tank's cha, the better chance for DI to fire off.<br />
<br />
Edit: on a side note, there was a good discussion on CHA and Divine intervention on The Steel Warrior a while back.  The thread's gone now, unfortunately.  Might want to check the cleric forums though at eqcleric.gameglow.com</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Why is charisma still one of the 'preferred' stats upon shaman creation?  /boggle<br />
<br />
I assume because of Charm. Shamans had Charm in EQ beta, and still have Befriend Animal, Charm Animal. I think CHA helps determine when charm breaks; it won't have any effect on resists. But like Frekkels said, they're just novelty spells for us, so CHA doesn't mean squat to Shamans and it really should not be a highlighted stat at char creation. Other classes have oddball preferred stats too, like Necros and Dex.</div></div><hr />
