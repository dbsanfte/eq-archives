<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was reading a couple of threads and wondered how many people prefer alchemy the way it was originally conceived (not talking about the borked implementation): herb+dropped component, or the way it was revamped: herb+herb.<br />
<br />
As the original alchemy is stubbornly hanging on in the shady back streets of Shar Vahl, i wondered if anyone else would miss it if it were gone...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd like a mix.  Store-bought for the bulk of the stuff.  Some dropped for extremely useful potions, like Stinging Wort.</div></div><hr />

I would.  And for 1 potion in particular - Vampiric Spirit.  Mod Rod in a bottle.  Can't always have a mage around to summon them, so this is the next best thing.  They are no where near as cost effective as the summoned item, but they do work in a pinch.  And that quick 60mana (instant) and gate are just enough to save you from what has turned into a very bad situation.<br />
<br />
And I would rather pay the extra expense, for personal use, for a stack of Vox's Vitality (no component, insta-click EB) and Grolun's Impunity (no component, insta-click lev) than to have to carry around the components for either, or waste a spell diamond for either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm fine with dropped components, but only as long as they are stackable.  I would have made many of the potion that required greater light stones (it was one of the componentless ones, I forget which) except that I don't have room to save all the GLSs in my bank until I can make a trip out to Shar Vahl.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Need normal lightstones. Used for componentless lev.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lumppy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Who really cares. I have put 10 times as much work into my baking as my alchemy. Alchemy is the most stupid skill that is in the game. It ranks right up there will learning how to speak in different tongues.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heh would be nice if you could make a 31 point damage shield pie, wouldn't it. Or a gate to Kunark pudding? How about levitate cake? Invis to undead biscuits? SoW chow? Haste paste? <br />
<br />
The main thing that's dumb about alchemy is the cost. Apart from that it's a pretty damn useful skill.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the contribution though...</div></div><hr />
