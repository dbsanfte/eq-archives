----------------------------------<br />
Mistmoore and SplitPaw revamps live for all servers<br />
New and improved Lavastorm!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Item Changes<br />
----------------------------------<br />
<br />
- Many Epic 2.0 effects have been modified.  Please see the EQforums at Eqforums.station.sony.com for details.<br />
- These items are now primary and secondary slot usable:<br />
	Totem of Shattered Hope<br />
	Wand of Twisted Fate<br />
	Infernal Staff of Fiery Fate<br />
	Bazu Claw Hammer<br />
- Increased the drop rates on some items from Planes of Power zones that were too rare<br />
- The ending effect (casts when the rune wears off) of the Enchanter 1.5 and 2.0 epics has been changed so that it won't cause initial aggro on surrounding NPCs.  It will only lower the enchanter's hate on NPCs in the area of effect that are already aggro on him/her.<br />
- Mace of Grim Tidings is now No-Drop<br />
- Added a Globe of Discordant Energy drop to Anguish. <br />
- Fixed the combine for the cleric epic 1.5, AA points should now be rewarded.  People who missed their AAs can hail Tavon to receive their AAs, if they have spoken to Natvil already.<br />
- Revised the various Anguish armor sets. Some pieces now have effects added<br />
- Earring of Eternal Flame - This item now has the focus effect of Flame of the Lightbringer<br />
- Anuek Dagger of Eye Gouging - This item now has a +12% mod to backstab.<br />
- Deathwhisper - This item now has +2 mana regen and +2 regen<br />
- Upgraded the +damage augments from Tacvi<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Spell, Discipline &amp; AA Changes<br />
----------------------------------<br />
<br />
- The skills windows will now show the modified skill of the player, including buffs/item mods, etc.<br />
- Added a negative resist modifier to Crippling Strike, Stunning Kick, and Eye Gouge.<br />
- Modified Hastened Purification of the Body to reduce the base time.<br />
- The spell, Elemental Simulacrum Recourse, should no longer be removed when the recipient is hit in melee.<br />
- Hide will work while levitated again.<br />
- Tiny companion will again switch target to the pet correctly.<br />
- An exploit with Lifeburn has been corrected.<br />
- /stopsong, /cast, and anything starting a song other than /melody now clears the /melody buffer as intended.<br />
- Bard Chants should once again generate the correct amount of hate.<br />
- Fixed problem with the Ranger AA Guardian of the Forest where if you had maxed buffs this AA would not reset if it did not take.<br />
- High level shaman pet should now automatically dual wield.<br />
- Modified the effect slots for Hobble of Spirits so that it will stack with other contact innates.<br />
<br />
<br />
Code Changes<br />
----------------------------------<br />
<br />
- Players will now receive a message when they are too close for ranged weapons to be used when /autofire is being used.<br />
- Ranged weapons are no longer subject to additional z-distance limit checks.<br />
- Server side collision fixes have corrected various problems in certain areas in new zones such as the ramp entering Abysmal that was causing warping problems for NPCs.<br />
<br />
<br />
Event Changes<br />
----------------------------------<br />
<br />
- Players can now select a type of LDoN Adventure (Rescue, etc.) when requesting one from the Recruiter.<br />
- Lowered combat regeneration of the Dragorn and Bazu forms in the Trial of Adaptation.<br />
- Modified the spawn timer on the Tyrant of Nightmare in the Plane of Nightmare and the Decaying Lightcrawler in the Plane of Disease.  Both should make more frequent appearances.<br />
- Lowered spell resists significantly in all MPG Raid and Single Group trials.<br />
- Fixed some oddness that happened sometimes when Memblurring Hanvar. <br />
- The non-loot dropping version of Arch Magus Vangl will be easier than the loot dropping version.<br />
<br />
<br />
Miscellaneous<br />
----------------------------------<br />
<br />
- Changed the level 70 bard /who title from Performer to Harold, er, Herald.<br />

&quot;naaa naaa hows it feel naa naa&quot;<br />
<br />
on second thoughts if that was the case i'd start getting the sinking feeling that shamans and beastlords would be emalgamating into 1 class</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It just says &quot;High level shaman pet&quot;.<br />

Wonder what that actually means.  Is it just the last pet or does it go further back?  61?  55?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">from what I understand of SOE lingo concerning EQ, &quot;High Level&quot; to them is typically 50+, so this precedent seems to point in this direction.<br />
<br />
this time I think it just seems to note that first couple of pets will not dual wield, but the others will, but that just me hoping for the younger generation, I have 67 pet, so he's my concern :)<br />

Hi, whichever dev reads this. <br />
<br />
When the 85/15 rule was revamped a little while ago, I'm about 99% sure that I saw a post from a dev, saying that Madronoa in Natimbi not letting unflagged people port was a bug, and that it would be fixed soon. As of yesterday, she would not let people without ikk4/uqua pieces port, even when that person was the only unflagged, in a raid of 20-25 people. Having to have the unflagged run through KT and then CoH'd or dragged by a rogue is a PITA, to be honest, so I was wondering what the ETA on this fix is, or did you change your mind, and decide not to go through with it? <br />

I just fixed this on Test. Madronoa will now teleport 85/15'ed people into Qvic also. It won't make it into the patch, but we'll update Natimbi in the following few days to get this live.</div></div><hr />

Oh wow, no kidding. That's awesome!<br />
<br />
I'm especially curious about Splitpaw and Mistmoore, though. Has anybody been in-game or heard anything about how these new zones are?<br />

Anyone know what the intended level ranges are for the splitpaw and mist revamps?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyways the big thing is they need to upgrade LDON, MOBS/LOOT/MISSIONS....even fix the raid option so even smaller guilds have the option of doing them.<br />
<br />
Woot my pet can dual wield, who gives a F**K ! Our pets dont last 2 seconds the easiest zones in OOW. I never use useless pet unless  I have nothing beter to do or use it to help farm for cash. <br />

He shouldn't take the place of a real tank but you should have time to react when a mob starts hitting him.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Shenen Alquimista</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">just a few observations from me:<br />
<br />
yes, pet DW is working .. tested it out by giving him 1 weapon, and he was slashing AND biting.<br />
<br />
MM revamp is awesome .. at 68, I still made 2% regular exp there off yard trash mobs in about 10 minutes.  Everything outside of the castle is blue, hits for about 200-300.  Once you get inside of the castle there's blue-yellow cons hitting for about 800.  Red con rares hit for 1k+.  Some insane 1 groupable drops coming out of MM on the level of about 200/200 equipment - i.e. expect a nerf inc :P  I've also been seeing 40hp augs dropping, and are NOT nodrop.<br />
<br />
Epic 1.5 clicky - now increases crit dmg instead of chance to crit, recast cut down from 10 minutes to 6, and duration seems to have increased.  Before patch I only seemed to get 7-8 ticks, now I get a 10 tick duration every time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Wow, it's about time for them to give pet DW. My shaman(retired) has 3 backpack full of rusty's and various cheap weapons. Now I'm curious if this would effect our swarm pet? That would be nice....... I know though don't count on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">the changes to the pets also seems to be affecting at least the advanced spirit pets.  I turned on my pet hits last night in Anguish for a late augment run, and we pulled the very last augment dude (the first lieutenant).  In the 20 seconds that my pets were up, they did 4600 dmg, not counting procs.  Before, whenever they were parsed, they were doing about 6.5k dmg to an Msha in the minute that they were up.  And the anguish mobs are all deep red to me.  Seems their dmg intake went up alot.  Always good for me :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Cant say anything about mistmoore, since there was an enormous crowd at the zonein, and the trains were running on schedule ;)<br />
Lavastorm looks great.  I assume its a preview of what Dragons is going to look like.  If so, we're in for a treat.</div></div><hr />

I noticed that the buff icon for Fateseer's Boon now goes to bard song window. Man I hope they don't put it back to main buff window.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Zexxon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Now if they would just put bard songs like Selo's and Blade of the Dance in the bard song window. ;)</div></div><hr />

It's like being lvl 30 all over again :) Horrendous pathing &amp; adds that pop out of nowhere in the castle...  Didn't get any of the new goodies, was only there for 45 mins this morning. Zone was empty except for my little group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>m970456</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">They already upgraded the dog's hp, he has around 4k now. I base this on my 2k heal healing half of his HP from nothing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Don't think so.  I was using the 67 pet tonight and he was at about 19% health.  Popped off a 2100 heal and he went up to 93% or so.  I had new focus on him, no pet toys.  No way he was at 4k with no buffs.  Were you fighting?  If so, your 2k heal probably only healed half because he took damage while you healed or something.  I'll test it further, but it doesn't appear to be 4k base HP's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Koda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Is Dire Wolf still in MM..for the young shaman 1.0 epic with the revamp?..any see if they moved that mob?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Shamylamy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">He does have 4k HP, around 4200 I think. You just had an update problem or something cause I've seen it several times. He stays up alot longer in zones I visit and he can fully tank mobs in lower planes without needing a heal for a while. Also, dire wolf was supposed to be moved out into lfay though I haven't confirmed this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Retron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Don't think so.  I was using the 67 pet tonight and he was at about 19% health.  Popped off a 2100 heal and he went up to 93% or so.  <br />
I've just tested this in Everfrost - I summoned a new L67 pet, let the wolf get down to exactly 50% health then healed 1227 HPs to bring him back to full. I'd say he's still got the same 2450 HPs as before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Confirmed. Puppy went enraged, no buffs on, and one shot of Yoppa's healed him to 98</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Shamylamy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">I might have an update problem then. Or maybe he was buffed and I didn't notice. He has been tanking better for sure though. Maybe just because of higher level.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Shenen Alquimista</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">confirmed that Dire Wolf is no longer in MM .. that was one of the areas we explored and there's all new mobs down there now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Cant confirm. Like others already said, Pet still has the same low HP/AC as before. Max 2,4k HPs !!<br />
1 Yoppa of me (all Healing AAs) will almost CH pet !!!<br />
<br />
Maybe u got Virtue on your pet ?? ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
Dual Wielding : Works great now. Around 70% more dps of pet. Didnt try with Pet toys. Need to parse it again then :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Shamylamy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Yeah I tried it unbuffed and it was one healed with just yoppas. I'm guessing either he got hit immediately after I healed to make it look like 50%, or he had someone ninja buff him when I wasn't paying attention. Sorry about that, heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">I did a few quick tests today and the level 49 pet does duel wield but the level 44 doesn't seem to.  <br />
<br />
It may be that his skill is just too low for it to show up in the limited tests I did though.  I had Scooby kill about a dozen mobs and didn't see an offhand bite attacks when equiped with just one primary hand weapon like I did with the 49 pet.</div></div><hr />
