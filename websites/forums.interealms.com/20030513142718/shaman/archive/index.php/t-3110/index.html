<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jedafix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So after reading about these quests i read a few posts that say &quot;Im stuck at low amiable&quot; and a few that say &quot;troll shammy inny and i did em all&quot; so i am wondering if anyone can give me a definative yes/no on this. Can a troll shaman worshipping innoruuk do the cudgel quest? And yes, i looked around before posting and saw conflicting answers so id really like to hear from someone who has done this quest as an inny troll. Thank you so much. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Arisai/Miser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">absolutely yes, if you would like to meet me in-game on innoruuk to verify thats cool :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Skab Wumpuss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The begining cudgels are definetly possible.  You say you can confirm this, what cudgel do you currently have?  I guess what I am asking is how high into the line of cudgels are troll/inny able to go.  Our faction maxes at, please correct me if im wrong, at very high Warmly, just like the other factions of cabalis.  If I cannot have the 8th cudgel because I am not at Ally faction, the rest of the quests are useless to me.  So if you have the 8th and are a troll/inny please post here, I would really like to know!<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Skab Wumpuss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hehe, notice I said useless to me, maby not to you.  Also look in my gear, I have a OPT in range, so yes 10wis would be useless since I have 5ac 20sta 18wis there right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">better range slots out there that are much cheaper/easier to optain.</div></div><hr />

I would hazard a guess that the effect on the last cudgel is quite nice for us non-ubers :)</div></div><hr />
