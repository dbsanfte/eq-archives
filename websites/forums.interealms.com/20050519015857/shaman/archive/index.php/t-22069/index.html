<br />
What is Stockholm syndrome? <br />
<br />
The term &quot;Stockholm syndrome&quot; was first coined by Professor Nils Bejerot to explain the phenomenon of hostages bonding with their captors. In Stockholm, Sweden in 1973, two bank robbers held four people hostages for six days. The Norrmalmstorg Bank robbery received wide publicity because the hostages came to care about their captors and perceive them as protecting them against the police.<br />
<br />
There is no precise, universally accepted definition of Stockholm syndrome. It generally refers to a cluster of symptoms often observed in hostages, cult members, battered women and victims of sexual and physical abuse. These symptoms include:<br />
<br />
-Emotional bonding with the captor/abuser <br />
-Seeking favor and approval from the perpetrator <br />
-Depending on the perpetrator for security and purpose of existence <br />
-Befriending and caring for the captor <br />
-Resenting police and proper authorities for their rescue attempts <br />
-Losing one's own identify in order to identify with the captor/abuser <br />
-Seeing things from the perspective of the perpetrator <br />
-Valuing every small gesture of kindness, such as letting them live <br />
-Refusing to seek freedom even given the opportunity <br />

<br />
imho, that is often what is demonstrated on this board.<br />
<br />
it is why so many continue to play EQ; even when they have started to dislike the game.<br />
<br />
worse, it is why people just love it, and defend him, when Brenlo posts on this board, without actually doing a thing.   can you shrink your pet yet?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Walgurorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't know about you, but I don't consider pet shrink high up on my list of priorities.  I still play EQ because I enjoy playing with my friends there.  This may or may not be playing my Shaman of course, but it's a game so I do what is fun for me at the time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I also have a ratty old pair I have had since I remember. Patches on the butt, ripped off pocket, and comfortable as my own skin. <br />
<br />
Guess which pair I like better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Walgurorf, pet shrink is the ONLY shaman problem, that i know of; that has been identified as a problem by Sony.<br />
<br />
but you are correct.  it is like sex and air.  not a big deal.<br />
<br />
unless you aren't getting any.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Shaman class issues don't exist when I log in and play.  If they did, I wouldn't be entertained very well would I?  IMO, you pay $$$ to play EQ, when a person gets it in their mind that the product is not worth the money, then they cancel and move on.  No scientific explanation needed other than bang for your buck :D<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Monjay-Tunare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">And contrary to the popular belief, Its easy to quit playing EQ, Havent even had much of a desire to return. <br />
<br />
Reading the drama on the crucible however, thats a different story, I still read at least daily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Haven't seen drama in a long time here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'm just sorta curious still about how things will turn out.  I haven't logged on in weeks.  I haven't wanted to actually.  The last time I did after my other long break it was just awful: same problems, less people on, and trying to get a group together for new content was still impossible.  I ended up going to Halls of Testing and soloing the wurms there just to see if I could.  I could.  So yay, I roxxor old content.  Too bad nobody wants me for new.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Am I the only one that finds pet shrink very low on the priority list?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Nydara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Pet Shrink might be low on all our lists but it still isnt fixed and its known and acknowledged by Sony...think they will really do anything about the truely important stuff? Doubt it. Does that change why I still play? Nope.<br />
Do I expect OoW to be worth buying? (ie no bugs, quests that work, content that doesnt make alot of classes worthless) Nope. I have spent all the money I will on EQ expansions. All I will give them now is my monthly fee till I find another MMO that has the same draw this one did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I've never had any desire to shrink my pet. Don't know what the big deal is, and don't care. I don't play my shammy much as I used to as I'm busy getting my ranger aa's and flags so that he can stay alive longer for me to heal him when I resume douing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Bonestomper makes an excellent point about Pet Shrink.(Yes his post wasnt about pet shrink as such but most replies seem to think it was)<br />
<br />
If you were to ask as SoE rep what is broken with Shaman he would say Pet Shrink and nothing else as they will not admit that Shaman are &quot;broken&quot; <br />
So our 1 and only problem is Pet Shrink and what have SoE done about it ?<br />
Sweet FA.<br />
So when you look at it like that it means SoE care less about Shaman than you actually thought they did.<br />

<br />
But hey, guess what. Its gonna have bugs. So is WoW. So does CoH. So will Widgets 2005, or whatever the hell else is boming out. Its the nature of the games.<br />
<br />
I am extremely encouraged by SOEs recent discussions and changes. This is the best online game there is right now. Thats why I play it. I dont give the whole Stockholm thing a BIT of consideration whatsoever. I think the BIGGEST problem with EQ overall is that its been out too long, and people want to make a change. I really wish all the EQ bashing would start to tone down. I mean, bugs are bugs, but sheesh, I have gotten 5 years of MAD fun outta this &quot;hostage crisis&quot; game despite the bugs, despite the balance issues, despite the lack of a decent CR system, and despite the whole &quot;EQ Sucks&quot; statements I read every other  post on every other  thread. Dont like EQ, go play another game. More bandwidth for me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From my point of view its not the bugs etc that are bringing EQ down.<br />
Its Sonys attitude to the bugs.<br />
<br />
Example mobs warping,pathing into walls where they summon you but you cant fight back or move etc.<br />
How long did this take Sony to fix ?<br />
More than 5 mins ?<br />
Anyone here care to bet that if Players could pull mobs into walls and hit them without the mobs hitting the players the servers would have been down 5 mins after Sony discovered this.<br />
Going back to pet shrink a very minor problem but how long has it been broken now ?.<br />
Everyone could see that Warriors were pretty useless non raid wise and needed a hand.<br />
How long did it take Sony to fix this ?.<br />
Months and then only after lots of venomous complaining by warriors.<br />
How long did it take Shaman to get a tiny upgrade on their heals ?<br />
How long had shaman been asking for this and proving with numbers etc that they needed it ?.<br />
Could quote lots more examples.<br />

<br />
<br />
i do also, but i find a lot of the problems people complain about to be low on my priority list and not even problems. i guess i'm different.</div></div><hr />

Yes, I know, there are bugs in the game, and instead of actually working on them, I am sure all the SOE programmers are smoking a big hookah in the Conference room. I mean, stuff NEVER gets fixed. How long has my 2HB animation sucked? I DEMAND they pull every programmer they have at SOE off whatever they are doing and FIX THAT NOW!!<br />
