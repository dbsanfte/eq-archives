<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As Sony rapdily advances the roll out of yet another EQ expansion, they do so without fixing grevious issues in previous expansions.  For shamans, there are still a number of major issues unaddressed.  My list is (in no particular order):<br />
<br />
1. Rabid Bear is unusable, as is Hastened Rabidity.  Add to this the waste of 18AA points on Alchemy Mastery (when rangers get Archery Mastery, /boggle), and a major component of the class defining AA's for shamans are a complete waste.<br />
<br />
2. Shaman DPS is still rather poor.  This is apparently exacerbated by the apparent nerf of DoTs discussed in this thread: http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=16045.  Even the DPS from shaman rains is severely limited because they still hit the caster and are limited to 4 targets.<br />
<br />
3. Slow mitigation and high slow resists has reduced the debuffing role of shamans with no compensation.  Shaman's major contribution has been reduced to buffer.  Recent changes to the Hole, for example, reinforce this.<br />
<br />
When LoY came out, Sony made an attempt to placate shaman concerns by changeing our 60+ spell line up moderately and introducing mildly useful alchemy potions (although I can't remember how long its been since I've sold an illusion potion in the bazaar).  However, major issues that make playing a shaman still fun after 6 expansions have not been addressed.<br />
<br />
I propose a general shaman boycott of LDoN.  Why put up with yet more dungeons filled with mitigated and highly resistant mobs?  Why rack up all those AA points with nothing to spend them on?  I'm keeping my $22.50 (or whatever the amount is) unitl Sony responds to our concerns.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">No chance!  This dungeon crawling expansion is like a dream come true and I want to be there, already pre ordered :)<br />
<br />
Besides, mitigating slows makes the game more interesting and people dont invite me to groups expecting high dps yet I still get zillions of tells from people I dont know.  We also have tons of useful AAs for me to be worried that two of them suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>bakkal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I will be buying LDON. I completely disagree with you on your concerns.  We are not a powerhouse class and never have been. We'll never land the huge critical blasts of a wizard or backstab for 1k+ like a Rogue.  Our ability to adapt to situations through dotting, buffing Ferine, general buffing of a raid for added damage/hit points.  Our healing, nuking makes us a complete jack of all trades class.  Rabid Bear?  Doesn't bother me in the least.  I won't buy it, but it's a &quot;fun AA&quot; imo.  With Alchemy Mastery, some people really enjoy trade skills and this puts them in a class all their own for better success on trade skills.  I don't do trade skills at all, but it's another path people take who enjoy trade skills to be a true master of an ability that others can't.  You compared Alchemy Mastery to Archery Mastery... Where exactly do Rangers get Canni5? Oh guess you forgot to mention _OUR_ class defining AA that made us so good.  We can do a lot of things pretty well and I've always been pleased with the class.  &quot;I won't buy LDON until they fix Rabid Bear, AE rains, and Alchemy Mastery?&quot;  Whatever makes you happy I guess... What if they had never introduced either of those AA's and hadn't even put them in.  You wouldn't even notice most likely.  Just another cry me a river story about someone who would rather complain than just play a game and enjoy it.  If you sit up nights worrying about AA's like rabid bear, then you have made the bed you sleep in.  If you want to play a game with a versatile class, shaman is the way to go.<br />
<br />
Keep on complaining though I guess. Nobody will listen to the concerns because they aren't concerns.  They are just trivial issues that people bring up in order to make themselves feel as a visionary to a class that's balanced and fun to play.  Get off the soap box and have fun with a video game.  If you don't like Shamans, don't play one.  Most of us enjoy it.  The vocal people make us seem generally unhappy when the truth is those that play a Shaman really enjoy it.  You are in the minority.<br />
<br />
As far as the final tick of the dot.  An issue I suppose if it stays how it is, but with the quick damage low tick dots introduced in LDON, it's probably more in line with what we should be.  They have addressed the concern of Dot's being useless by making them do more damage in shorter periods of time.  While you are busy mentioning how much less damage we'll be doing from one less tick... Picture a lower aggro higher damage DOT on at the same time and it will begin to make sense.  Will they leave it one less tick? Who knows. They may even add a little more damage with a shorter duration on those spells.<br />
<br />
Complain when they change, complain when they don't.  As Joe Pesci said in Goodfellas &quot;Some people are just content to be a jerk&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I could care less about DPS, I want Curses to do something cool. like anti spell haste (casting slow), Weaken (Reduces damage bonus and damage interval by 5% or something), and perhaps some sort of spell that makes the mob proc a short duration stun on himself or something... There was so much creativity that could be applied to curses and they completely blew it by just giving us another line of damage spells.<br />
<br />
I don't want to be a crappy necromancer with slows and buffs, I want reduce impossible monsters to killable state, die doing it, and be regarded as a hero, like it's always been.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm all for LDoN, it looks like a blast.<br />
<br />
For #1, rabid bear sucks, always has, likely always will.  Every class has useless aa's that sit around in the bottom of the pile.<br />
<br />
For #2, I hardly think the last tick of the epic dot being bugged down 12 pts of damage is a nerf, and we are not a big dps class to start.  I have no problems with my damage contributions.<br />
<br />
For #3, it's a big annoyance, especially if you do higher tier3 bosses+ PoP stuff.  Outside of that, it's not much of a big deal, and I don't think it will play a huge factor in ldon.  Time will tell, of course.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is funny though that you find it unacceptable. If you can't see the funny side of that then I can't help you. <br />
<br />
Maybe you should just complain that seeing as how every time you used to cast malos you could get slow in first time, and SoE know that, so they should just assume that if you have both spells in your spellbook you shouldn't have to cast Malos. Then, as they know once you slowed the mob it is as good as dead they should just save you the bother of having to do anything else. I propose that when a 65 Shaman with a full spell book targets a mob, a simple check against the spellbook and skills is done. If requirements are met the mob should just die. To save further issues the loot should automatically appear in inventory. Future releases can then have a menu popup when you log on, asking which zone you would like to go to, how long you intend to be there and are you soloing or grouping. Depending on your answers you can just be given the aa, loot can be calculated including current bazaar prices and your bank account can be populated accordingly.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Bailie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">The problem with Sony stopping everything they are doing to resolve bugs and implement tweaks and fixes to what some consider broken is that those who are not affected nor aware of the problems begin to feel the game is stagnant with no updates.<br />
<br />
Sony is stuck making the decision to develop new exspansions which introduce new content/skills/etc and the possiblity of drawing in new users or old users who have since quit the game.  Not to mention the additional benefit to current players with the new content/etc.. or they can take their time to fix broken things that maybe 100 people notice max and still complain because of the length of time it took to fix the broken things in the future place.<br />
<br />
They cant make everyone happy. :(<br />
<br />
In truth the customer server side should say &quot;fix the broken pieces because it negatively affects some!&quot; but as a large corp such as Sony it only makes sense that the person making the funding decisions probably has a goal to make more money and therefore chooses the exspansions over the improvements.<br />
<br />
I am not sure if that made any sense.  Guess what im trying to say is yeah it sucks they havent fixed alot of things, but I can understand why they havent and I opt for new content any day. :)</div></div><hr />

I’ve played four classes past 50th level now and none of them have been perfect.  They each have their strengths and weaknesses.  Its part of the fun of playing different classes.  I’d certainly love for shaman to be more powerful, as I would druids, rangers and beastlords when I’m playing those classes, but I’ve happily managed for this long so it’s never been one of my concerns.  <br />
<br />
As for LDoN, I’ve extremely excited about it.  I think it’s going to be the most exciting expansion yet.  An expansion where four to six players can log on, run strait into a dungeon and start having fun without having to worry about camps, what could be more fun than that?  I preordered my copy over a month ago.  And if anyone would like to get a mini sneak peak at what the expansion is like, here a link you might be interested in:<br />

OMG 12 less dmg from our drop. Dropping the dps from that 1 dot by less than 1 dps over the whole spell. Yeah we aren't great at dealing dps but we can still do descently with chain casting nukes or rains. If you want a dps class you shouldn't be a shaman tho.<br />

Personally I'm Happy we got slow mitigation in the game. Yes you read it right i'm HAPPY it's in. Why? It's simple. Slow mitigation has been in the game for ages when you stop and look at thing. Way back in the day you had to make things immune to magic make them immune to slow. That sucked badly because it eliminated a whole host of other things. Next step forward was specific spell imunity. Yeah mobs can be immune to slow but still nukable, stunable crippleable but it's still all or nothing. Next step forward was disease slows but that ment making things magic immune again and couldn't be set per mob but you did at least have full, partial and immune levels. Guess what they FINALLY got a slow mitigation system in that doesn't break alot of other things and allows for alot finer control of things. This is a GOOD thing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
True.  What hurts about slow mitigation is they went overboard and applied it to most of the mobs.  There is no way they would have released an expansion where over half of the mobs were immune to magic, but they certainly released one where over half the mobs mitigate slow.<br />

It is TOTALLY ridiculous that a level 65 Shaman who has just cast Malos on a regular experience mob can have Slow bounce twice in a row in BoT or anywhere. <br />

That is not acceptable. Mob resists are too high.<br />

In simple words so you can follow me here...........<br />

Will Sony ever fix all the bug, who knows.  It's a huge game and I like it.  To me it's worth the money to add another expansioin, to keep adding new servers, and to keep patching the game.<br />

Besides, a new zone helps thin out some of the crowded zones and camped zones a bit.  That alone would make me happy. Hell, I hope the new expansion will have another bazaar in it and get the lag out somewhat.  I'm kinda tired of running around there with my view on the floor. <br />

At level 50 in the old world shaman were gods. <br />

At level 60 in kunark shaman were also gods. <br />

At level 60 in luclin Shaman were still gods.<br />
<br />
At level 65 in plains of power Shaman are demigods.<br />

Gues what every other class in the game has a metric ****ton of problems and hates and whines and bitches and complaints too. If not about thier power relative to others then they bitch about punk ass druids. Shaman are not the best class in the game.

mitigating slows makes the game more interesting and people dont invite me to groups expecting high dps yet I still get zillions of tells from people I dont know. We also have tons of useful AAs for me to be worried that two of them suck<br />
<br />
I fail to see how mitigating slow makes the game more interesting - all it does is make other classes than ours essential and at the same time it makes one of our top spells redundant.<br />
<br />
Getting lots of tells from people you dont know is not neccessarily at good sign. These might be warriors that insist on getting an AGI or people that tell you when a group buff fades (= people that dont know anything about a shaman).<br />
<br />
Rabid Bear (+Hastend Rabidity) and Alchemy Mastery are not just two random AAs. They are some of our unique class skills. Sure we have lots of useful AAs to work on but those are shared with lots of other classes.<br />
<br />
Taraddar:<br />
<br />
Everyone has crap aa's. You think rogues find advanced disarm traps very useful. It would be nice to get it improved and the refresh time dropped but o well. Cann v owns for aa's.<br />
<br />
Just because a few other classes have bad class AAs doesnt mean we have to have them too. Rogues might find that skill useful in LDoN whereas I have a hard time seeing what can make Rabid Bear and Alchemy Mastery useful if they dont change those skills.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Wargbearjumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Quote from original post - Slow mitigation and high slow resists has reduced the debuffing role of shamans with no compensation. Shaman's major contribution has been reduced to buffer. Recent changes to the Hole, for example, reinforce this.<br />
<br />
<br />
I forget where, or from what source, but I remember reading something once about some &quot;under the table&quot; comments made by some Verant people &quot;Way back in the day&quot; where they basically hinted that Slowing in EQ was terribly overpowered in their opinions and that they would &quot;adjust&quot; it if they didn't think it would outrage a huge percentage of the player base.<br />
<br />
EQ has reached it's final stage, it's now an open, bought and payed for Beta Test for EQ2, they're adding tons of feature, content, etc. to see how people will react, with no consequence to themselves.   They'll see what works and put it into EQ2, and throw away the rest.   My thoughts on Slowing being slowly nerfed into a backseat debuff the way it has been is that maybe they are looking at making Slows a much smaller component of Future EQ product and are testing consumer response/performance now.<br />

We've got a rocket scientist here folks!  It's great to hear something I already knew.  How about you do a little experiment, Mr. Wizard, you try casting Slow over and over again on a BoT mob and see how much aggro you get with that(and how quick you die).  Now go do the same thing with Malosinia.  A resisted Malosinia doesn't generate nearly the same amount of aggro as a resisted Turgur's.  I can chain cast Malosinia and I won't generate enough hate to steal aggro from Warriors, let alone Paladins or SKs.  You try chain casting Slow and you're a smear on the back of the wall.<br />
<br />
So, you've got three choices:<br />
<br />
1.  Cast Malos, then cast Slow, then come to these boards and whine and complain about level 63+ mobs resists being too high after a -55 debuff.<br />
<br />
2.  Cast Malosinia, maybe get a few resists, cast Slow and land it nearly all the time and be happy with your class.<br />
<br />
3.  Cast Malos, Malosinia then Slow and land it nearly all the time, just a little later with the tank taking more damage and be happy with your class.<br />
<br />
It's about trade-offs and luck with the random number generator and thinking a little bit before you make inane little posts like the one above.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">I found this whole thread kinda funny.

<br />
Then I read the responses to the initial whines and now I feel better because most people pointed out the whines.<br />
<br />
If you don't like playing a shaman (or EQ), don't play it.  If you want to make helpful suggestions, go for it.  But if you just want to whine...save us all some time and do it offline.<br />
<br />
By the way somebody else already pointed this out, but in case anyone missed it...if you want to see a fairly neglected class, check out warriors.  And no, I'm not complaining about my warrior (I have lots of fun playing him too), but it's a fact that warriors have not gotten the attention from Sony over the past year or so that the casting classes have.  Are they broken?  I don't think so, but they do not add as much to a group as the other classes (all other classes.)  Do I have ideas on how to improve them?  Yes, but I'll save that for steelwarrior.  :)<br />

<br />
As pointed out by another poster, it used to be all or nothing, they made the MR so high it couldnt land, making us useless in that situation when it came to slowing.  It also means if I am the healer/backup healer I have to pay a little more attention because the mob is swinging faster, used to be you could slow, if it landed there was no challenge, the fight was over, now at least, there is some grey area in the middle, makes it more interesting for me.<br />
<br />
Getting lots of tells from people you dont know is not neccessarily at good sign. These might be warriors that insist on getting an AGI or people that tell you when a group buff fades (= people that dont know anything about a shaman).<br />
<br />
I didnt say I grouped with these people, I try to stay with guild groups, my point is that my class is loved, probably more than a majority of the classes.  Group desireability as well as soloability go a long way in this game, we get to play how we want.<br />
<br />
Rabid Bear (+Hastend Rabidity) and Alchemy Mastery are not just two random AAs. They are some of our unique class skills. Sure we have lots of useful AAs to work on but those are shared with lots of other classes.<br />
<br />
Still random as far as Im concerned, could they be better?  Sure they could but we have so many other good things going for us I dont think Ill spend any time worrying about it.  Probably just me, I also play a real melee class as well, anything like rabid bear on a priest class looks silly to me, I guess I just envision something different.<br />

For LDoN check out the latest mobhunter articles on mobhunter.com. Ok the author didn't say, it is complete crap and it is only his single opinion so far, but it is still a bit discouraging, as the 'dungeon feeling' itself seems to be lacking. So i wouldn't expect any fantastic, revolutionary new game design here. Would guess for the 'normal' expansion with a few  highlights, much regular stuff and some major crashes ...<br />

Not all AA skills are meant to be god like...some are just plain out fun..and some are useless...so, don't train in them...<br />
<br />
Shamans have ALWAYS been the prime buffers in grps...always have, always will...and mitigated mobs are still a hell of a lot easier to kill than unslowed mobs...so we are still useful...increased resistances make it reasonable to have more than 1 shaman on a raid....if everything was 75% slowed with no resists, why have more than 1 shaman on a raid?  This gives us all something to do..there is a strategy to getting the maximum debuffage on a mob.<br />
<br />
As far as DPS...we do some decent dps since they allowed for stacking of dots...toss on 4 dots at a time and count up the damage per tick you are doing....may not be flashy like a kill shot from a wizard, but it ain't too shabby.<br />
<br />
Only thing I'd like to see is an AA skill that increase the duration of our dots...<br />
<br />
Sure, I'd like to do the damage of a wizard, and the healing of a cleric and I'd like to port ppl too....we still ARE THE BEST DEBUFFERS in the game...but if every mob could be slowed 75% with no chance of resist, well, that would be sorta dull, now, wouldn't it?  :P<br />

3.  Cast Malos, Malosinia then Slow and land it nearly all the time, just a little later with the tank taking more damage and be happy with your class.<br />
<br />
<br />
I still fail to see why slow landing or not is an issue to get unhappy over but seems it is a pet peeve for you.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's about trade-offs and luck with the random number generator and thinking a little bit before you make inane little posts like the one above.<br />
<br />
What trade-offs? AGAIN mister know-it-all Landed malosinia=landed slow.<br />
The PoP mobs that require a Malosinia, tash, OOS, etc to slow are far and few on single group xp level.<br />
Only those who are of lower level then the zone they play in is designed for have major resist problems.<br />
<br />
But if malosinia works for you then by all means go for it girl, I will just use slow after malos. And at the end of the day lets ask the tank and the cleric what made them happier</div></div><hr />

&quot;if it landed there was no challenge, the fight was over, now at least, there is some grey area in the middle, makes it more interesting for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
This is only because you are consistenly getting single pulls because of Pacify and similar spells. Single pulls make this game easy not slowing a mob. And whats the difference between a shaman slowing (and mitigated) and an enchanter or other class capable of slowing (and mitigated)? I dont know but it sure isnt as big as when the slow isnt mitigated.<br />
<br />
How do you think the clerics would react if CH was sometimes mitigated?</div></div><hr />

<br />
ONE last time, MALOSINIA uses the same resist check as Turgurs.<br />
<br />
got it?? No??<br />
<br />
In simple words so you can follow me here...........<br />
<br />
If malosinia lands so would turgurs have landed.<br />
<br />
Telling people to use malosinia before turgurs is stupid beyond believe and only shows you have no clue how our spells really works.<br />
<br />
/steps from soapbox<br />
/walks away<br />
<br />
<br />
You are right in that it checks the same resist, BUT for some mobs (i.e. boss mobs or anything you want to slow as soon as possible without drawing unwanted agro from repeated slow attempts), I find it a good idea to malo, turgur, then if the slow didn't land, to malosinia before the next attempt at slow.<br />
<br />
YES, it's the same resist check, BUT because of the longish refresh time on Turgur's, you're better off trying to Malosinia while it refreshes.  If Malosinia lands, then you've got a better shot at slow landing (without having to recast slow repeatedly and draw unwanted agro).  If it doesn't land, then the only thing you've lost is some mana.<br />
<br />
I think this is a perfectly good situation to cast malosinia before (the second cast of) slow.  I'm sure there are other situations as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Matey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">There is a lot wrong with the spell lines of the shaman class but the resist rate on slow is not a part of thatPlease, tell us, what exactly this, &quot;a lot wrong with the spell lines of the shaman class&quot; then.  If you weren't agreeing with Thual, which is who EVERYONE ELSE was addressing.<br />
<br />
3 resisted malosinia's and that mob is at 25% and if i did not had a slow stick I would consider it a waste of mana to slow itI'd like to meet the kind of people who can get a mob down to 25% in any of the wings in BoT in 16.5 seconds, since that's how long it would take to cast Malosinia three times in a row.  Most of these types are going to be grouping somewhere else from what I've seen on my server.<br />
<br />
I still fail to see why slow landing or not is an issue to get unhappy over but seems it is a pet peeve for you.Who's unhappy?  You're the one insulting my intelligence about my class over the choice of using Malos or Malosinia.  If you didn't agree with the original poster's, Thaul, line of thinking of slow being resisted too much in BoT after casting Malos, why did you say that I have &quot;no clue how our spells really work&quot; because I have a different opinion on which malo* line spell to cast first.  That's a pretty big leap in logic IMO.<br />
<br />
What trade-offs?Read my post again, I listed three different options, some might consider them TRADE-OFFS for speed vs. resists.  Let me just sum them up again for you:<br />
<br />
1. Very quick slow, but you have to be lucky with the RNG.<br />
2. Slightly slower slow landing but more likely to stick on the first slow cast.<br />
3. Longer slow time but almost always guaranteed to stick slow, very slight chance Malosinia will get resisted, and the same chance as option 2 for slow landing.<br />
<br />
I don't know if you've tried both Malos/Malosinia before slow options but I did, when I dinged 65, first thing I did in BoT was try both Malos and Malosinia.  I found I got more slow resists only using Malos than dealing with a resists for Malosinia and then casting slow.  It's not proof that either method works better but I did find one method worked better for me, than another.  I've never called you stupid, a girl, or clueless about every spell you use in EQ, for using Malos over Malosinia.<br />
<br />
But if malosinia works for you then by all means go for it girl, I will just use slow after malos. And at the end of the day lets ask the tank and the cleric what made them happierAnd I'll use Malosinia then slow and people will still be just as happy.</div></div><hr />

Well, clearly if there's no exp and no loot, nobody's going to go.  I'm just commenting on the person above that said nobody would go unless the exp is the same as BoT or better.  I know lots of people who that's not true for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u80"><b>Discordja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p80">Point is tho, lots of people != majority.  There are many places in the game that are much more fun than sitting in the PoTa pit or BoT grinding xp .. but how many of those places are camped?  If they are it's generally because all the other primo camp spots are filled up, not because they are &quot;fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
LDoN needs to spread out the population, move some of those players out of the planes and into some dungeons, but I don't think it can do it for the majority of players as xp/loot are the general driving factors as to why people choose the camp spots they do.<br />
<br />
Maybe if this was velious still and 60 really was a hard cap it might be different, but with the current AA drive most people won't sacrifice 1hr / aa for the sake of fun ..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u81"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p81">I fail to see how mitigating slow makes the game more interesting - all it does is make other classes than ours essential and at the same time it makes one of our top spells redundant.<br />
<br />
You have to consider raiding.. if a monster is going to do 25k damage max per round, if you slow it slightly to lets say 15% slowed, it's going to do about 4k less damage.. now if the mob uses procs for the 25k max damage you could be getting the guy do do 9k+ less damage per round just by slowing it.. (general reparm).. not everything is about bot minis mitigating slows..<br />
<br />
Getting lots of tells from people you dont know is not neccessarily at good sign. These might be warriors that insist on getting an AGI or people that tell you when a group buff fades (= people that dont know anything about a shaman).<br />

What would be a good sign? this is just a pot shot, nothing can make someone happy if when they get a tell from someone they don't know, they think to themselves, 'damn prolly idiots, or they'd want someone else'.. <br />
<br />
<br />
Rabid Bear (+Hastend Rabidity) and Alchemy Mastery are not just two random AAs. They are some of our unique class skills. Sure we have lots of useful AAs to work on but those are shared with lots of other classes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Alchemy Mastery is a MUST for us, we're the only ones who can do it we should be able to master it.. nothing wrong the AA, you can say we need better potions, but saying the AA should be taken away is wrong.<br />

From Mobhunter:<br />
<br />
You have 90 minutes currently to complete your adventure and it isn't so much about exploring and having an adventure than it is about not going the wrong way and finding a dead end and wasting time. For the most part there are dead ends that don't really affect you but there are some that if you go down, will pretty much mean you will fail the adventure.<br />
<br />
http://www.mobhunter.com/article.jsp?articleid=-399121834 (http://)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u83"><b>Daekar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p83">Not all classes are based on ability to crank out good dps, shaman's fall under this catagory imo.  I'll be buying LDoN because dungeon crawling returning will add so much falvor at least for me.  Yeah it would be great if SoE focused on currently broken stuff instead of cranking out more broken stuff but I think it's apparent they wont ever completely stop that way of thinking heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u84"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p84">As great as they are though, models should NEVER be the best part of an expansion.<br />
<br />
<br />
Probably the next thing for me is the technology. It is nice in a lot of ways to be able to go and get a group, which probably will be easier than in the past because of the way it's done with just a few locations. <br />
<br />
<br />
Down somewhere below all that is the fun factor for me. Now, maybe my expectations were set a bit high in particular when they stated that each dungeon was not generated randomly and instead was made by hand by a designer. Of course it is hard to measure fun and it's different for everyone but for me it's actual adventure and immersion.<br />
<br />
<br />
For example, while it had been said before in interviews and I even asked Absor during our tour, if there were any really, different (named) mobs than the same ones room after room and he said yes. I have not seen any named creatures that weren't the last boss and target of the adventure in all my time in beta.<br />
<br />
<br />
This isn't helped by the fact it felt like I was in a cut and paste dungeon. By that I mean that it seems that the dungeon was made from pre-made dungeon pieces simply fitted together into a certain order. They aren't random, I mean someone had to work the cut and paste, but you'll see the same rooms and hallways repeatedly as you go through.<br />
<br />
Yeah, maybe LDoN will mean dungeon crawling will return.  But maybe it doesn't.<br />
<br />
The mobhunter article didn't sound encouraging :/</div></div><hr />

<br />
But damn, it IS fun. Mobhunter makes a big deal out of the time limit, and maybe that's the case at level 25 (Everyone's testing at level 65, lol), but it doesn't seem to be too horrible.</div></div><hr />

The problem with the PoJ trials wasn't that certain classes aren't wanted.  It's that people are stupid.  Depending on what classes you start out with, that determines which classes you want to add to fill out your group in a WELL ROUNDED way.  I've seen I_don't_know_how_many tards complain on this board that shaman suck in the exe trial in PoJ.  I have no idea what they are smoking, but I want some of what they got!  If you are level 60 and don't know how to put together a well rounded group you don't deserve to be flagged.  It'll be the same thing for this expansion I'm sure.  We'll have tards running here every week spouting off some bullsh** about the dungeons being too hard or not being able to do them in time, meanwhile you find out they have some stupid group like tank cleric cleric enchanter shaman shaman.  No **** you are going to run out of time with a group like that.  The expansion should NOT be dumbed down just for the idiots that don't know how to play and put together a decent dungeon crawling group.  My character grew up in dungeons, I know how to put together a good dungeon splunking (spelling?) group, and this expansion will hopefully bring back the good old dungeon crawls where you had to know how to CC and work as a group or wipe.</div></div><hr />

Assuming you weren't being sarcastic, resisted Malosinia generates nowhere *near* the hate of a resisted slow. Course, if you're soloing, there's no one to hate but you and dawg...

<br />
I think we have a major difference in attitude here.  I'd prefer to play with friends - regardless of what classes they play - than have to turn away a mate because 'sorry we need more dps' or whatever.  And I'm happy to play in groups with strange class mixes because that adds to variety and requires different tactics.<br />
<br />
If LDoN sets up racing against the clock as the benchmark for success in a dungeon raid then isn't that dumbing it down?  You've reduced the game to one single problem: the group's ability to do dps.  It would be nice if alternative methods of beating a dungeon were possible.<br />
<br />
Another problem has occurred to me: I play in a group of adults, and its very common for any one of them to have to go afk because a child wants attention, a spouse needs a quick hand or something.  Its a shame if we are doomed to failure in LoDN because we are mature people with responsibilities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u97"><b>Bendarin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p97">The deal with LDoN is that you can make any group work.  You dont really need the Holy Trinity.  I never turn down a friend in a group regardless of class because I think I need X.  We adjust the group strategy.  I also play a mage, imagine my joy when we figured out a pet group could own<br />
<br />
The time limits are another obstacle you have to get thru and man when you are trying to get to the end and someone checks the time..  OMG we have 5 minutes left, then the adrenaline kicks in again.  Remember the first time you zoned out of EC into the scary WC?  I still remember not even making it to the guard outpost cause we were too nervous to go on.  This expansion adds excitement again.  <br />

I am an adult with 2 kids, 2 cats (1 18 years old with skin cancer and bowel control problems), 1 dog, and a wife who calls it &quot;that damn computer&quot;.

<br />
Perhaps this is the key to the design.  If the dungeons required skill then 'Billy-Bob zerg' who gets his gear raiding with a large herd of his friends, and his exp by grinding in DL style PoP zones would be excluded.<br />
<br />
So instead we have a mind-numbing dps race against time, with the 'excitement' (I use the term loosely) being whether you can get to the end of the track in time.<br />
<br />
I hate this: why is a lower dps group, but one that is extremely tough and can therefore grind down the toughest mobs, suddenly (after 4 years) an invalid concept?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u101"><b>Gaesekki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p101">Personally, many of my guildmates and myself are eagerly awaiting this expansion.  When we are not raiding, it is basically just an exp grind in order to up the aa count - which gets very tedious.  We have found some nice areas to do this in that are not very crowded, have nice exp gains and good loot for use and plat.  However, that too becomes a mind numbing practice.  <br />
<br />
This gives an opportunity to accomplish something on our off days of raiding.  We can start and attempt to finish various dungeons without the worries that accompany the opened up PoP zones.  Perhaps raids can be said to be finished, but I do not agree.  The first few encounters are exciting and then it is relagated to farm status.  We can perhaps get two groups and do the same dungeon (different instances) - gambling anybody?  We can attempt various group compositions for fun and a challenge.  The fact that you can organinze, start and finish on a timetable is appealing to me.  <br />

So now we had 4 people in a 6 people adventure and it was tough, but so much fun. We would get 3 or 4 at a time and I was able to use my uber cc skills rooting mobs all over, etc.<br />
<br />
We got low on time and made a charge for the goal, pacifying etc trying to finish. Was just crazy, but more fun than I've had in EQ in a long time. We lost that one, but all left happy and amazed what we were able to do. I think it will be a great expansion.</div></div><hr />

Crusty, you make a great point.  DPS contests will relegate shamans to &quot;hey man can you buff us?&quot; status, given our tools.  I seriously doubt that the new curse DoT with its 4 tick recast time will help.  When you have multiple mobs you're trying to kill, not being able to apply your one really good rapid damage spell on a rooted mob will greatly limit its usefulness.<br />

Sony should loose the timed dungeon concept.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u105"><b>Jeones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p105">I have a feeling that the time limit is more for technical reasons then game play reasons.  Remember these are private zones that are created for a group of people.  What would happen if people just went in and stayed?  How many of these zones can they support at any given time?  One would hope that they can give us enough time to enjoy it.</div></div><hr />

I have no idea what they are smoking, but I want some of what they got! If you are level 60 and don't know how to put together a well rounded group you don't deserve to be flagged. '<br />

The exec trial was a nasty business for shaman because we were not wanted/needed. We could not heal, tank or add DPS. The mobs being unslowable made our only job buffing before the encounter. Shaman had to wait til someone pitied them to walk them thru the trials because they had virtually nothing to add...enter LDoN. Since enchanters can slow plus add massive dps with charming-- and beastlords can slow plus add massive dps with their pets and melee abilities, why would anyone take a shaman into a timed dps event?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u108"><b>Chernobul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p108">i just gotta ask you guys, is it the same to be strong in one area of a class and equally balanced in another area with the other classes as it is to be kinda spread out and not really completely own in any area and still be looked on as we are way too powerful?<br />
<br />
i don't know if that makes sense, but i think someone can make some of it</div></div><hr />

You have 90 minutes currently to complete your adventure and it isn't so much about exploring and having an adventure than it is about not going the wrong way and finding a dead end and wasting time. For the most part there are dead ends that don't really affect you but there are some that if you go down, will pretty much mean you will fail the adventure.<br />

I know this, and I could have been more specific, but at the time of my reply the NDA was in effect.<br />
<br />
It's not a run, nor is it a crawl. The dungeons I went to were not slow, but they weren't fast neither, because no one knew the layout of the dungeons.<br />
<br />
I would expect that as people become more familiar with the layouts, the time spent will decrrease.</div></div><hr />
