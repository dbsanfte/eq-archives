<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>phileepae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am very confused about some people in posts.  They speak of this thing of a canni hotkey? okay i know what cannibalize is and i know what a hotkey is, i'm no newb to this game, but i am a newb to shammies, i have a 27 atm.  Also, they speak of mana dance or something? :confused: *** is that? like sitting down before the tick or something? please explain :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Geal Icehammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can make a hotkey to stand cast Canni wait for the spell to cast then sit back down. It should look something like this.<br />
/sit off<br />
/cast 3 (what ever slot canni is in)<br />
/pause 27 (2.7 sec pause varies with canni spell and lag)<br />
/sit on<br />
<br />
Canni Dancing is timing your casting so that you are sitting during the med tick every 6 seconds. So you wait for the tick then hit your hotkey.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The hotkey is simply a /cast button that you can use tp speed your Canabalizing.  You can also put /stand /cast /sit in there and use it to do the mana dance and use the spell gem only if you're already standing.<br />
<br />
The mana dance is when you stand, canabalize and sit down before the next tick starts, so you get both the mana from the Cana and the regen from sitting.  Watch yer HP's, and when they move, quickly stand, cast and sit back down.  Personally, I never did this myself, as I found it too much of a pain to do it quickly and effeciently.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I never saw a use for it, I just have my first two hotkeys can and sit/stand. 2 1 2 *shrugs* Though I have had problems with acidentily hitting sit when I get agro, maybe that would help.</div></div><hr />
