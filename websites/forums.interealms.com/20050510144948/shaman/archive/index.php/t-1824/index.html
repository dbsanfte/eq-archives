<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gamil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ok so according to my last post of targets for us baby shaman to /flex about the dino in OOT was posted so...<br />
<br />
first attempt:<br />
<br />
get to island, get pet up no buffs on pet wasnt quite rdy. he wasnt up anyhow. he pops jump gun get 4 resists on slow pet goes down i run him round island hitting him with ebolt and plagues, also tagging him with JBB as i can. get him to just under half before i had to gate (<br />
<br />
buffs: Agil, HoS, Sta, SoW, Guardian<br />
<br />
<br />
second time:<br />
<br />
get to island get pup out buff pet with Hos and sow, malo/slow Dino woo hoo looking good...pet on gain agor with ebolt,plauge couple JBB shots...run his arse around the island...needless to say i only got 2 ebolts off on him i was worring bout keeping pet alive to deal most dmg..got him to just before half before i had to gate (<br />
<br />
buffs this time: same as above plus HB(had just left a raid) <br />
<br />
didnt matter much both times when i gated i had about 200hps left<br />
<br />
so my question, what am i doing wrong/can he really be done at 51?<br />
<br />
gear is in ma sig</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Regen is a pretty powerful buff for a shaman, odd you left it off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gamil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">had chloro up both times, but the second tiem it didnt matter i didnt have time to cani or sit, first time i dunno *** went wrong i think if i woulda let pet tank more or even had no pet and didnt jump the gun i coulda done it<br />
<br />
/shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zabi Bbuzzin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">never hunted him but since you say you had no time to stop and canni maybe after u dot him root him and let him sit there for a few, while u regen mana and hp.  if you have a pet and he gets ownt easily, call him off while he is rooted and let pet attack when root breaks until u refresh.  make sure pet is sowed so he can get away from mob before being hit and aggroed again.<br />
<br />
also if oom and low hp, bind wound if you have 201 bind wound skill at 51.  get 75 hp per bind at 201 i believe.<br />
<br />
good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>flinx_21</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">just a silly newbie of 47 but...<br />
<br />
<br />
I think I would try to buff and park my pet on a safe spot on a different island(like maybe the siren rocks in the middle)<br />
<br />
then run to the island after buffing your self and medded to full<br />
<br />
then do the resist debuff, dot N rot thingie<br />
<br />
trying to med to FM as you can<br />
<br />
then when he was at 1/2 life I would summon your pet to your side and sic him on the dino<br />
<br />
never done it but that is how I would try<br />
<br />
IMO you and doggie need to be buffed  but if you don't have the agro you might as well leave your dog at home<br />
<br />
he might be pretty and warm in those cold Halas nights  but a tank he ain't<br />
hope these newbies words help<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Stop throwing ebolts on him.<br />
<br />
I just rooted him and used jbb.  I think I ended up dropping plague too.  I didn't bother with the dog.  <br />
<br />
He's kind of resistant, so using a malisement isn't a bad idea.  Time your slows too.<br />
<br />
I did him at 50.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I must be a n00b ! <br />
<br />
What is OTT ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I did him at 52 (if memory serves).  I tried all the stuff you mentioned, but ended up oom and kiting.  Canni'd enough mana to root him over and over and just JBB'd him to death - it took forever.  I have heard of folks root/rotting him with just disease dots also, but I have not had much luck with that method.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>thorvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hehe, OTT should be OOT, or Ocean of Tears.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nothenon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I've killed the Allizewsaur using just disease dots and JBB.  Didn't try until 55 though.  Maybe I was just unlucky, but even at 55, I found Malosi, slow, and Ebolt rather hard to land.<br />
<br />
I led off with Insidious Decay, then Plague, Scourge, reapplying as needed, and clicking on the JBB when I wasn't cannibalizing.  Only buffs I had up were Talisman, Regrowth, Stamina and SoW. The fights took a very long time, but I'd usually end up with 80 to 90% health, and 60 to 70% mana.<br />
<br />
It's nice to be able to say I've killed him, but it didn't seem worth it as far as gaining experience or loot.  Total of 5 kills netted me a ruby, and a few snake scales and some lizard meat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">He can be done at 50. He was doable before kunark ever came out. That means no high AC, no JBB, no Turgurs.<br />
One of the few great challenges of the Old world.<br />
<br />
With enough determination, time, and skill you can kite him to death with just Dog and spells. As mentioned, the pet is NOT a tank, so make sure you keep aggro on you at all times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">What's the spawn timer on the Ali?<br />
<br />
So the challange is to do this without the epic or with it?<br />
<br />
Gonna have to try it soon<br />
<br />
[Whoohoo! I'm not a Lurker anymore!]</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Can we get to 201 skill in bind wounds??  I thought our max was 200.  And if we can do we get all the benefits of 201+ skill, ie. 70% bind capability?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">YES!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>sinladar orchammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Allizewsaur can be done with or with out epic.<br />
<br />
The problem with doing him with the epic is we need to be within melee range to cast it.  Which means we get double taps (even with slow) and a good chance to have the casting interuppted.<br />
<br />
I parked dog on far side of the island, buffed dog with RH/HoS/Regen/Alacrity.  Buffed myself with HoS/Regen/RH/Rage.  Sent in doggy first, then slowed, then dropped Epic.  Rooted, dropped Ebolt and Plague.  Re-rooted and cannadanced for mana.  When root broke I kited with dog on his heels and JBB nukes.<br />
<br />
Fun kill to do when bored.  Though CR can be a pain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>jannia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I was a bad Shaman. I neglected my Bind Wounds until last week when I was lv42. There was one too many close calls in a group hunt so the next morning I bought 10 stacks of bandages, gated to the Bazzar and started learning the skill. I would Canni down to 1/2 health bubble and bandage myself up. It didn't take very long to get the skill from 1 to 151. But I did have to find a remote spot in the Bazzar because of all the drive-by heals. LOL! One time a Dwarven fighter came over and started to bandage me. I told him what I was doing and he laughed pretty hard. Gave me 5 stacks of bandages for my lessons.</div></div><hr />

YES! <br />
<br />
Heh, was this an answer to my question about bind wounds getting to 201 or not?  :D <br />
<br />
thanks!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>2hawks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I did Ali some where around 53 -54. I did him with Root Rot and Jbb, though I did not Jbb as much. I would Plague, enstill, ebolt. I would reapply enstill as needed, then I would reapply Plague and ebolt when plague wore off. I would Canni in between enstills and Dots. I would rarely use the JBB as it would break the root 2 out of 5 times and I could better use that time healing and canni'ing.<br />
<br />
The battles would take about 10 minutes.<br />
<br />
BTW the Dino is a random spawn off of the lil lizzies running around the island, so you need to keep moving and killing till he spawns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">hehehe I killed that Dino a LONG time ago.  Was my big accomplishment for quite some time.<br />
<br />
I was 49 and used disease dot and root.   Then at the end I let pet bite him and I ran around oom.   I think it took me like 45 sad sad minutes to do it and he dropped... NOTHING!  lol  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Raikor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Been thinking about this lizzy for the last couple of levels when I stick my head in OOT vs. SFs. Sounds very doable and fun! Gonna go check it out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, the placeholder is an isle goblin sacrifice.  If the lizard doesn't spawn 6 minutes after he was last killed, run around the island until you find the goblin sacrifice, and kill it.  Either the lizard or the goblin will spawn 6 minutes later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Shenlon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">thnx Noth, was just about to point that out :) used to farm this guy with a 60 necro my friend let me use now and again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>dominan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">hmm... with the BD pricing skyrocketing, this might be a good way to make some money solo. What's the spawn time on this lizard?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Buuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">How hard does this guy hit, and does he summon? If he is easier, or the same as the corrupted sea fury you shouldn;t really have a problem doing him with JBB unless his resists are bad. <br />
<br />
This is how I soloed corrupted, so not sure if it would work the same but I imagine it would. I slowed pulled to pet and began tanking. Threw on a plague and started JBBing. When HP got a bit low (half hp -2 bubs) I threw a sup heal on myself. Refreshed slow and just kept on JBBing. With horse I never really went low on mana until eventually the cyc dropped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Oishii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">spawn time is about 5mins or so... although Allizewsaur also has a PH (a goblin sacrifice) that can spawn.  It's annoying to run around the island looking for that little goblin!  Also fun when you are running around thinking the PH might be up and then suddenly the dino pops right on top of you ^_^<br />
<br />
I have camped him a bit recently and it seems they have lowered the drop rates of gems quite a bit... I used to be able to get a lot of gems off of him, but now all I get are snake skins and lizard meat :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Shenlon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">if you are gonna camp him, make sure you got slows timed and his spawn timed, cuz you don't want him poppin on top of you :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Serj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I attempted this Dino at 51 just to see if I was able to.<br />
<br />
I had no JBB and no buffs on, but my Iksar Regen BP helped a lot.  I started off with Malosi &amp; slow.  Malosi was resisted a couple times, but it finally stuck on the 3rd or 4th try.  Slow stuck right after.  Then like a moron I used Ebolt &amp; plague, but that ran me out of mana WAY to fast.  The whole time I was rooting him and running out of range to med.  eventually I got enough mana to recast plague and root and continued this method until he was dead.<br />
<br />
The fight lasted anywhere from 30-60 minutes and I had a friend over annoying me the whole time hoping root would break and everytime he wished it would break it did.  I also had around 174 wis and no right click item except my black fur boots.<br />
<br />
I will be going back and killing him again just for spite &amp; to cut down my time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Spraggon - Krakster's &quot;YES&quot; was the answer to your bind wound question :) My bind wound skill is currently at 202, and I can bind to 70%.<br />
<br />
Which was quite a nice surprise as I didn't get any skill raises for about 10 levels (I maxed it at 200 at low 40s), then the other day, at level 54, I got 2 increases in 5 minutes. Maybe it was just bad luck, or maybe we can't get to 201+ until later than level 51?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Fenril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Bind Wound is capped at 200 until you reach 50.<br />
<br />
At 51, you can train it again to 210 if I remember right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Zabi Bbuzzin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">more about bw: at 51 u can get it to 202, each level after that bw goes up 2 pts to a max of 210.</div></div><hr />
