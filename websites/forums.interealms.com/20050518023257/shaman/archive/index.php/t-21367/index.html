<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Walknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, since I felt Shaman had been left behind/forgotten, I felt the need to try and refresh the game for me by playing another class for a while.  So I re-roled a new class and got him to lvl 56 (with a little help).<br />
<br />
That new class would be a Berzerker!   HAHAHAHAHA  /snort<br />
<br />
HAHAHAHAHA!<br />
<br />
/cry</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Y'know, I get the feeling Berserkers are actually pretty good, but since each and every single one i've met has been powerleveled to at least 55 in under a week, nobody really knows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">From what I've read, as odd as it sounds, they're more broken than Shamans are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Don't worry, so were beastlords.  Then it was if they gave them every fix ever suggested to make them better, and BLAMMO.  They buff better than a shaman, have better avoidance than a monk, solo better than a necro, and outdamage most classes.<br />
<br />
Not as a slam to beastlords - I'm glad they have a lot of possibilities for fun.  Just pointing it out since  - if history repeats itself - berzerkers will get a lot of fixing all at once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">For instance the Zerkers snare ability is limited to PVE. Thats great on a PVP server.</div></div><hr />
