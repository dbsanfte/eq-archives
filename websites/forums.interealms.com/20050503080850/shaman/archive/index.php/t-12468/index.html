Same as any other FD PLer... kick the mob or mobs until it enters &quot;flee&quot; mode.<br />
FD and finish it/them with the shammy.</div></div><hr />

/nod thank you<br />
<br />
any suggestions on zones? startin a level 1 on new acct</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>joofntool</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">was thinking newbie zone then PAULD.<br />
<br />
i wanted a more open zone....spacially and population then that tho</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dazma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You need to be FD before the mob starts to run, ideally find mobs that don't run.<br />
<br />
Anywhere packed with undead is good for this, couple of Good zones for this are:<br />
<br />
Kurns<br />
City of Mist<br />
<br />
Last time I tried it did Upper guk inbetween Kurns and CoM, not too bad as long as you pull 3-4 froggies a time (so they don't run when there pounded down low), beat em all down then FD, and have the shammy nuke away! he will take a bit of a beating but its good for his defence.<br />
<br />
Only problem u will get is a lack of skill raises (mainly Defence / offence weapon / Casting) but easily sorted by soloing (no PL!) a bit every couple of lvls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Any n00b zone 1-6<br />
Kurn's Tower 6-13<br />
Paludal 13-25 (I know they run but it's worth it)<br />
Not sure the fastest route after that; Sol A perhaps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've done this exact thing (FD PL) from 1 -&gt; (nearly) 60.<br />
<br />
Using a druid to damage shield PL works best 1 -&gt; 25, so I did that.<br />
<br />
Then:<br />
25 -&gt; 45 CoM (now your JBB works so finishing the mobs off is sooooo much easier)<br />
45 -&gt; 51 KC (now you have the good slow and sheal so you can take on tougher stuff)<br />
51 -&gt; 58 Torgiran Mines at bridge (trolls are great xp and easy to single pull)<br />
58 -&gt; 60 PoN<br />
<br />
You could technically skip the Mines and do PoN starting at 51 and level much faster since you have a 61 sk who tanks and holds agro faaaaaaaaaaar better than the 58 monk I'm using.  I'd just suggest getting a JBB (free finish off damage) and a horse so you can regen mana automatically while outdoors.<br />
<br />
Also, it doesn't matter if the mobs flees- just root it before it dies and you'll get full xp if your sk is FD'd.  I do this all the time- pet tanks while the JBB does the last couple % of damage.  Ez pz.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shantan Maverick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I pl'd my shaman up to 54 with my 55 at the time SK.  I tried doing the FD thing but I got frustrated at how often I wouldn't get xp, not sure if I was FDing too late or what.<br />
<br />
What I did was I got kei on my shaman and used my SK to taunt while the shaman chain casted his best nuke.  At 40% I would finish it off with the SK.  Usually the mob would lose interest in the SK around 70% or so, which was cool because my defense skill was always maxed before I dinged.<br />
<br />
I got most of my xp in Paludal, lizards outside CT, CoM, Crystal Caverns, and HHK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">There's a better way to powerlevel from 1 to 30...<br />
<br />
Grab a 10-dose Kilva's Skin of Flame.  Make the SK drink it.<br />
<br />
Have the SK pull a bunch of mobs that are maybe yellow/slightly red to shaman.<br />
<br />
Have shaman burst of flame or poke each mob once without getting agro.<br />
<br />
Have SK sit down a lot.  Mobs hit SK and get hurt for 31 dmg a hit or so.<br />
<br />
Rinse and repeat.<br />
<br />
(This technique works because no one gets credit for DS damage)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>EQScott</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You can take the mob down to flee-mode have the SK FD and have the Shaman hotkey:<br />
<br />
/assist SK<br />
/cast Root<br />
<br />
As long as you gain aggro again, you will get the exp.  When you cast Root, the mob will turn and reaggro.<br />
<br />
As far as good zones with exp modifers:<br />
<br />
10-25  Paludual - Move from Phlargs to Bandits (heavily camped now)<br />
<br />
25-35  Not so sure I would do Sol A...those casters make PL'ing a PITA.  I hit Dalnir on the first floor for a bit until low 30's, and that wasn't too bad, good exp and it's always empty.  It's all what you prefer.<br />
<br />
35ish to 44ish  Nurga (until they turn LB)  once you hit 41, you can group the two chars and just plow through the mobs...  Shaman gets almost all the exp because they are green to the SK.<br />
<br />
45 - 50's  FG pulling Shrooms  (slow sticks 95% of the time)  Shrooms are around 46-49.  You can duo or PL.  About 10% of the Shrooms run, so if you are PL'ing it's nice not to have root all the time.  Get the Shroom down to 5% though and have a DoT on it, with dog-dog.  They can easily rip through your shaman below 50, even when slowed.  Always have DR.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
so for the shamn to see any xp with my 61 sk he needs to be 41?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>paragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">for lower levels (thinking of undead that don't run)<br />
<br />
skels by mino caves in steamfont this should take you to about 9 or 10.<br />
<br />
yard trash in unrest this should take you to about 16 or 17.<br />
<br />
after that I can't think of any mobs that won't run on you, maybe rathe mts?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Was there a note about this in the patch message? Can anyone confirm this?<br />
<br />
Shaman gets almost all the exp because they are green to the SK. <br />
That is incorrect - xp is still split, the sk will receive no xp from greens but will still take most of the xp away from the shaman.  You're far better off FD PLing because then the xp is never split.<br />

Correct me if I am wrong, but don't you have to be 45 for the JBB to work??<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">FoB and Kerns Tower are both great locations to PL.<br />
<br />
FoB has a large number of undead and scorpions which do not run.<br />
<br />
Kerns is just full of undead.<br />
<br />
A significant problem with PL a shaman is working on mele skills.  Chose a method that will get your mele skills up to reasonble levels or your shaman will be a crip.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i found this to be sadly true<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
this is the tactic that im using. Pull with SK. NO DS ON AT ALL. SK's back to a mob. shaman melee mob from behind and cast on it.  if the shaman gets agro i have the SK cast one of his terror lines of spells.<br />
<br />
So the SK is taking all the Hits....and the shammy is meleein/casting from da back with no agro.<br />
<br />
I tried the DS attempt.  Seems that yes, my SK's total damage on the mob did include the DS damage.<br />
<br />
I tried the FD tactic and it was really a pain to get it timed right so i would FD close to when the mob was about to flee, but not in flee mode yet.<br />
<br />
And another thing...many said to melee the mob down with my SK then have the shaman finish it off.<br />
<br />
Im doin the opposite a.t.m.<br />
<br />
SK pull.<br />
SK keep agro, his back to mob so no repost.<br />
Shammy get it to 49% from the back.<br />
SK turn around and finish it off.<br />
No FD required.<br />
<br />
Goy my shammy from 5-12 in about 2.5hrs or so in KURNS last night doin this.  It may take a little longer with this tactic verus FD (the shammy is missign alot and scoring smaller hits on a mob cause its red). But with SK holding agro and the shammy /assist /autoattack on................you can practically pull a mob and go afk till its at 50% and its time for the SK to finish it off.<br />
<br />
This works for me with no headahces of...&quot;will the shammy get the xp on this red con i spent 4mins meleeing?&quot;<br />
<br />
thankudrvthruplzthnx</div></div><hr />

<br />
In order to get exp:<br />
<br />
Your shaman needs to have AGGRO after a successful FD.  If the mob is in flee mode, this is NOT aggro.<br />
<br />
If you want to regain aggro after a mob is fleeing, have your Shaman cast Root.  The mob will automatically reaggro on your Shaman.  Then kill mob with your Shaman.  If you Root, regain aggro, and root breaks, you can still kill in flee mode and get the exp.<br />
<br />
Important, stay FD until after mob is dead.</div></div><hr />
