<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I tried to post this on EQ Live, but my account has apparently run out so I can't.  In the grand tradition of Chicken Little, I offer my assessment of OoW shaman spells:<br />
<br />
Shaman dps will still be completely inadequate.  Even with the GoD slow, shaman input to a group will be minimal.  Shaman buffs as they currenlty exist for OoW are underpowered or completely useless.  The new shaman pet will remain far behind any other pets if past design is any guide to what developers have in mind.<br />
<br />
Basically, OoW shaman design takes the old shaman model, which is broken and simply inflates it.  There is so much wrong with the old model. The design problems have been discussed ad naseum  both on EQ Live and in much more detail at the Shaman's Crucible.  Yet the OoW design shows that not one concern has been seriously thought about or addressed.  Even the recent upgrades to HoT spells change nothing about how shamans stack up to other classes.<br />
<br />
GoD was a failure, even Smedley admits that.  Its failure was felt hardest by shamans because they have been declining in relative power for years.  OoW promises to place the final nail in the shaman coffin unless something drastic is done to save the class.<br />
<br />
P.S.  Just for the record, I voiced similar concerns about Luclin, Ykesha, LDoN, PoP, and Gates, pointing out each time how the proposed new shaman spells eroded relative shaman power.  Yet in most instances, the spell lineups seen in Lucy went live with the release of the expansion, and each time I was reprimanded by the shaman community for voicing concerns about spells before they were finalized.  Now, as an outsider, my comments can be dismissed as irrelevant, and perhaps they are.</div></div><hr />
