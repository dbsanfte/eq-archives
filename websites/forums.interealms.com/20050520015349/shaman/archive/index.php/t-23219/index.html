<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>brindelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all I'm a recently turned 65 shaman from Sullon Zek, I just came back to the server after about a year hiatus.<br />
<br />
Interesting thing about SZ is that nobody really sells 65 spells anymore, or MQ runes.  So I'm trying to think of a way that I can get my 65 spells without going to legends to joining a different guild.<br />
<br />
Currently I'm in a small guild of about 20 ranging in levels from 55-65 with max 8 or 9 people on at a time.<br />
<br />
Is there any relatively easy ways to get runes, using maybe a chanter and his chanting ability.<br />
<br />
PS: I can live without getting uber gear but casual players not being able to get spells is a drag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well there are two options for pop spells:<br />
<br />
1.  Farm loot, then buy the spells.  While the runes are no drop, the spells are not.  So, go to veksar with a bud or two and farm 36% haste belts, or something like that.  Should be able to get 1-2 per night, and they sell well.  <br />
<br />
2.  Farm runes in bot.  If you have one group, pick a wing and do the named in each wing.  They occasionally drop runes and ornate armor.  If your guild can muster 2-3 groups, you can also do the bot tower named, which drop better ornate pieces, and a better chance at runes.  1 person in each group needs their tower key to admit the group though.<br />
<br />
If you are talking GoD spells... well good luck there hehe.<br />
<br />
The sewer missions, experience version that you get from Gamesh in Barindu are easy, but you have a low chance of spell drops.  Probably the best one is the &quot;lair&quot; mission, where you kill 30 mobs or so, move down a hallway to a room, and hope that the sludge eating fly has popped.  He will occasionally drop a GoD rune.<br />
<br />
A better drop rate, but significantly harder mission set, is the vxed/tipt instanced missions.  If you can get a solid lvl 65 group with an enchanter, you can farm the beginning of the missions for named mobs.  You'll want a tracker also, and probably a monk or bard to pull the named to the zone line.  I got Daluda's Mending this way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The easiest way is to kill the minis in Bot (Oreen Wavecrasher et. al.).  This is what probably 90% of casters/priests/hybrids who didn't buy the spell or MQ rune did.  I'm not sure of the viability of this method on a Zek though.  And yes, you and an enchanter can duo these (enc could probably solo with a little luck), but expect one of you to die if charm breaks while fighting the nameds.  A cleric or druid would be a welcome addition to doing this; anyone else would be unnecessary and would probably require an additional tank since the enchanter pet wouldn't hold aggro with more than three people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I just got all but one of my druids runes and all of my pally friends runes in a week doing bot wing names. Should be easy enough for your to do with a group from your guild. We have a 65 Clr, 63 Pal, 65 Dru, 65 Sham, 65 Monk, 65 Enc. Charm a pet and let the monk or pally tank as needed. Heck the druid even tanked Oreen for 45% when the monk and pally got summoned onto the pad (kinda my bad there, bad spirit call timing). <br />
<br />
Monk has 6.5k fully buffed hp, pally about 6.2k, and everyone else has less. I have the best gear and AA's of all of them if you want a comparison.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zeltaria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Try getting groups in BOT, some of the named that spawn can drop runes, though rarely. And if you have enough people in your guild you can do BOT tower bosses &amp;  named. 12 hour spawn time on the bosses I think, and you have to work your way up through alot of giants. My guild is fairly small and it takes about 3 good groups for bosses which usually drop ornate molds and runes and spectrals. There's probably other places that can drop them, but I think BOT is about your best bet besides spending a ton of pp in the bazaar if the spells are even for sale. Good luck and have patience, it takes a long time to get them.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Tactics is seriously underrated as a loot/spell farming zone too. There are a good number of mini-nameds who are on REGULAR spawn timers with PHs just like the ones in BoT. They drop runes, specs, molds, and decent gear (Armorer once dropped a Rune and a Plate Sleeve mold, and I have seen him drop that caster halo thing a few times with a rune).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>CasmussSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Brindelin. What team are you on? If you're good or neut, ask other goods or neuts, they've been holed up in BoT for the past year and have plenty of those things as well as tons of ornate pieces banked. You have to look around a bit, but they can be found.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">if you are evil join hate, if you are good or n00t then Cas is kinda right, goods dont spend to much time in bot that I know of. but with the right flag you can solo some rune dropping mobs. (rare as hell but you get exp and loots while you farm)</div></div><hr />
