<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>eq_newb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i am new to everquest. my first and only character is now a lvl 17 barb shaman. i been soloing the whole time mostly with exception of a quick group or 2. i have been in everfrost the whole time and there dont seem to be much more to do except a shaman or mountaineer here or there. 2 questions....i need advice on where to go now, and i have 30 trainings unused and wonder what to use them on. the first question...i just bought SoL, but my graphics card and memory is kinda crappy so its really slow moving. i know to go to paludal caverns,but im worried the lag is going to be bad there and its gonna suck to play. so is there anywahere else to go. id still like to solo a bit too. about the practices, from soloing so much, the things id like to train like meditate, or channelling etc, i cant because i guess i maxed the available skill out for my level, so i dont know what to use it on. someone mentioned i should use it on piercing, which is only a 3 now because i been using a sambata warhammer that someone gave me. the person said that piercing weapons are the best for shamans so im wondering if this is true. sorry for the long message, but any advice would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KaisonIcebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">pudial is the quickes experance at that lvl  but  you could move to  the overthere  killing near the outpost will take ya to 20  from there head to lake of 111 omen stick arounf to 30 the timerious deep to 35 at the gorila icberg thats bout your quickest rout with out hitting  sol or sov zone's<br />
<br />
dont wast any points on medite or chaneling  they will raise quick enough with out any help onve you have put your 1 point in them to get em going your set .<br />
<br />
the reison  the preson told ya to go pericing is the shaman epic  is a spear <br />
start grouping some  we can solo through to 65  but your missing  half the game solo. your streangth is making a group  its best your far more powerful with 5 friends to take care of.<br />
<br />
your your points on your less used skills  casting skills the most important  save your self some to train specilization and alchemy at 30 (alchemy avaible at 25 but cheaper to wait to 30 if ya plane to work on it) sujest alteration for your specilization it covers all your heals buffs and debuffs..<br />
<br />
2hb should not be ignored it can be a powerful tool wile solo. and percing so you can effective use the best shaman wepon avalible to a shaman the spear of fate. with out a  very strong guild backing them.<br />
<br />
make some friends you wont go far alone</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Koraden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just a word to the previous poster, Good info.<br />
<br />
If english is not your first language, then bravo. If it is, then i suggest you take more care in spelling your posts. Not to be a spelling nazi, but when 9/10 words are spelt incorrectly, it makes the post very hard to read.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you want to stay in the old world, East Karanas and Unrest are two spots that come to mind. EK has a lot of blues at that level and you get to practice dodging giants! <br />
Unrest might be a bit rough as that level, you're a bit high to solo outside the house and I don't know if enough people still go there to group inside. It's a pretty good intro do dungeons though and it's a lot less painful to learn about trains in your teens in Unrest than in your 40s in Karnors. <br />
 Lake of Ill Omen might not be bad now that all the doods have moved on to Paludal and could get you into your low 30s either solo or in a group. I think I'd stay away from Overthere at that level unless you have PoP or know your way around Kunark.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd suggest trying paudal.  Adjust your clipping plane down, turn off spell effects, etc... to reduce lag.  Turn off as many new models in the options screen (before you log in) will help a lot also.<br />
<br />
You should be able to solo the fiends quite nicely at 17. Just keep cure disease handy.  My druid tanked the fiends from 15 to 20 :-)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I like to solo most of the time myself, because I have kids and go AFK without nitice all the time.  AFK = Away from keyboard<br />
<br />
I would recomend that you do spend quite a bit of time in groups to learn the skills you will nead to participate in a group.  Shaman play significantly different within a group and it can take some effort and practice to get the skills down.  Also,  I would tell you group that you are very new to EQ.  Most people will be more then happy to help, encourage, teach, a new player who is honestly trying to learn.<br />
<br />
Solo play can be a very efficient use of time but it is not nearly as fun as participating in a good dungeon crawl with a group of skilled people that are all pushed to the limits.<br />
<br />
This board is also a great resource.  If someone tells you somthing and you don't understand, then just come post a question about it on the crucible and we have a great crowd of people willing to help.  Just try and make your question clear and with details.  Even if all the advice is not the same,  at least you can gain insight into how different shaman aproch the same problem.<br />
<br />
Have a great adventure.</div></div><hr />
