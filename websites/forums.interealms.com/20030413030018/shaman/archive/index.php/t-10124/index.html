<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jeones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have finished  getting a Child's Tear from the Plane of Fear.<br />
<br />
Ashen Rage was raiding the zone and Lucifuge (a Bard) was there and noticed an Iksar broodling was up and untouched. <br />
<br />
By the time I got near the zone in for Fear, the raid was ended but the zone had been cleared.<br />
<br />
Lucifuge joined me and KILLED me so I was naked as a baby lizard.<br />
<br />
Next he cleared the way so I could zone in to Fear unscathed.<br />
<br />
Naked with SoW and Invisibility I zoned in and ran to the west wall, followed the west wall south, followed the south wall east, and the east wall north to the /loc that he gave me.<br />
<br />
I killed the poor little bastard and gated out.<br />
<br />
I was the only one in the zone at the time.<br />
<br />
BIG thanks to Lucifuge Of Ashen Rage!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bigcat Daddy-o</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">haha! I bet the adrenaline was going pretty strong on that run!<br />
Will I make it? Will he despawn? Am I going the right way? Omg, was that a scareling or just tree waving? I love those blood pumping events with big pay off. <br />
I would like a few of my own, but this is your thread, and your moment. <br />
Grats on the tear!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fenweir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I can second on how that almost exact run is very adreniline pumping as i had to run to back wall on my monk for Whistling Fist quest.  It was full spawn though and i had to find a way to get close to Cazic Thule and talk to him without agroeing his buddies.  Talk about sweat   lol, gratz:o</div></div><hr />
