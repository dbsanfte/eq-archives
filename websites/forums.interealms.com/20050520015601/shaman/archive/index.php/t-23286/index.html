<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tebion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">hi<br />
<br />
i have problems curing tash atm (since the second last patch imo), normally a cast of either Disinfecting, Nadox or Rc2 (dont have 3 yet) was enough to cure tash.<br />
<br />
Am i the only one with the problem, that<br />
-) if i cast rc while having someone outside my group targetted only a few if any chars are cured<br />
-) i sometimes need 3 casts of DA to cure it (same with nadox)<br />
<br />
or am i just getting old and cannot count any more?  ;) <br />
<br />
disclaimer: this is no &quot;omgosh we are stealthnerfed again&quot; whatever whine thread, its just something that came to my attention and i wanted to ask if i am the only one having that impression/problem :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nzaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I had no problems curing it last night in a guk dungeon I did.  It cured with no problem with rc 1 and disinfecting aura.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Curing outside of group with RC or Nadox does not work. Another possibility is that you have another AE on you that sucks up all the cure counters so none left to cure Tash (ala the zonewide AE in Uqua).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think hes saying his group wasn't even getting the cure while having someone else targeted which is what normally happens with your group only spells. <br />
<br />
I've been having a lot of issues with group spells lately not taking hold, mostly on horse back. I clicked my druids replenishment BP three times the other night and he was the only one getting hit. Had to drop the horse then do it again for it to take hold on everyone. Its really really annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tebion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">yes, as darkpaw says, i meant my own group of course, hehe (and it wasnt the uqua ae either, curing 99 counters every 60 seconds, O_o ;))<br />
<br />
and i never use my mount in group/raidsituations, and i think neither of my group did (and my tash wasnt cured, either).<br />
<br />
and it didnt happen every time, just sometimes, really weird :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It's not just on horseback. I've had problems with group spells (for example haste on my enchanter) skipping people.  It happens on or off the horse and the people can be standing right next to me.<br />
<br />
Were you shrunk?    On one raid my enchanter had to click off gnome illusion to get group spells to stick reliably.  Maybe it was coincidence but after I clicked off gnome, eveyone of my group spells stuck on my groupmates (and other groups on the raid).  That was a couple of patches ago.  I haven't noticed a problem since then but I haven't been gnomed much since then either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've had problems shrunk, on horseback, touching a wall, etc.  Been pretty screwy recently.  <br />
Had myself targeted and mgb'd fo7 and it only buffed me.  Was shrunk and on horseback at the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Walknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">RC has always bugged me.  I have to have myself targeted for it to remove anything.  All my other group spells will cast without any target and land on me and my group only, but unless I have myself targeted, RC wont work on others in my group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">No problems here in ldon or GoD</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Exeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I haven't had problems with radient cure, but, I've been having trouble with mgb since the last patch.  On a raid in UP the other night I hit my MGB Fo7 and it hit 4 of 60+ people.<br />
<br />
Exeley.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Also had problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Had it on me in (f)Uqua the other night and could not get rid of it.  RC3'd a few times, used DA a few, and got nada.  For having one poison counter, it sure is a bugger.<br />
<br />
Not sure if the zone AE messed with my cures, but I do know casting any group spell near a wall can mess things up since the glorious DX9 patches.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tebion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Naagruz: if you had the zonewide ae ABOVE tash in your bufflist its clear why you couldnt cure it.<br />
you have to cure it (3x99 counters) before you can cure tash ... and try curing that in 60 seconds, hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yeah, I know that.  I usually make sure that zonewide ends up near the bottom somewhere and get my top 2 slots clear for other stuff.<br />
<br />
In this case the zonewide was about 3 up from the bottom.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">It looks like cures (just like dispelling) doesn't always start with buffslot_1, but it's more of a random thing perhaps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I have had no problems using RC3 to cure Tash and what have you in any LDoN theme or in Tipt; haven't used it anywhere else lately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I haven't had problems curing that I have noticed, but I have had the same problems with the geometry (or whatnot) messing up my group buffs to where only I get them or only a few do. Usually simply clicking off my horse fixes this problem. It really sucks burning MGB Fo7 on 1-2 people. =\</div></div><hr />
