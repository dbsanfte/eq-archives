<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ludgurorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">it sure seems like newbie barbarians and cats got the best of pop and iksars got little.  or maybe it is that now barbarians will have to share their hunting zone with everyone else now.<br />
<br />
my logic: as a new shaman i remember being scared silly trying to get out of everfrost to hunt and having to brave the run to Qeynos. Now with the pop port system Level 1's can choose what newbie zone they want with thoughts only as faction and how crowded it is.  Level 1's can basically start in any zone they want. Except for iksars and evil races who have fewer choices.<br />
<br />
I always thought our barbarian newbie zone was good as it provided more money than others I used. The downside was that the number of reasonable mobs at some levels got scarce.  Now you can start and when you run out of mobs go to crushbone or rivervale. etc.<br />
<br />
i am sure someone will post on the best newbie paths now that travel time and risk is basically removed from the equation.<br />
<br />
Iksars however cant beam into as many cities with impunity.  Another example of rampant specism against iksars.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>paragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">unfortunately it is just as hard for any dark race to be accepted (DE, troll, ogre) that is one of the reasons it says on the starting char that a cirtain race/class combos are easy, or difficult.<br />
<br />
I suppose it is similar to choosing a troll shaman and not putting any points into wisdom. it can be done, but it is hard.<br />
<br />
but iksars should chin up, I played almost every race/class combo up to about lvl 10 at one point or another and the iksar, by far, have the easiest job of it. FOB is one of the best newbie zones I have ever played in.</div></div><hr />
