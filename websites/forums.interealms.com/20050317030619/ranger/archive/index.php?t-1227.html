 Brilliant. My faith in government is restored. Or something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BTW, one current and 8 former IRS employees have claimed some form of reparations credit.   If they cant even understand the tax code themselves, what hope do we have? =)</div></div><hr />

Go after the ones perpetrating it and teach them how to make small pebbles out of big boulders, for life.  <br />

Its not about ripping off the government, its about ripping off the people foolish (and greedy) enough to buy into this hogwash.  Of course I've been in favor of serious jail time for financial fraud perps for a long time.  Country club prisons and short sentences encourage this type of abuse.</div></div><hr />

Wow, I guess you've never made a mistake in your tax return, or had bad advice, huh?<br />
<br />
DId you know that if you call the IRS helpline for tax advice, you have only about a 50% chance of getting the right answer? If you called them and asked &quot;Where do I put the reparations credit on my return?&quot; chances are, you're not going to be told that the credit doesn't exist. You'll get some over-worked helpline person who will give you his best guess. You put that on your return, mail it in and get money back. Fraud, yes. Evil, no.<br />
<br />
Take the money back, plus interest and a fine. Fraud may be fraud but it IS only money. Lets save the making boulders into rocks for people who actually hurt someone.</div></div><hr />

The ones charging the fee for telling people about &quot;this wonderful new and totally bogus feature&quot; in the tax code.<br />
<br />
Those foolish enough to actually believe something like that would be going down without huge media coverage, and who filed a claim for the reparations should only be required to repay the money, plus interest and fine.<br />
<br />
I am responsible for my actions, you are responsible for your actions, they are responsible for their actions.  You don't get off scot free because you received bad advice from a scam artist and acted on it without checking it out.</div></div><hr />

  You don't get off scot free because you received bad advice from a scam artist and acted on it without checking it out. My point is that even if you check it out with an &quot;official source&quot; you only have a 50% chance of getting the right answer.<br />

The IRS creates its own problems.</div></div><hr />

I find it interesting that this has been brought to the surface so recent after that law suit against large cooperations that have their roots in slavery trade.... <br />
The law suit against corporations was filed about a month ago. This scam has been going on for at least three years.</div></div><hr />
