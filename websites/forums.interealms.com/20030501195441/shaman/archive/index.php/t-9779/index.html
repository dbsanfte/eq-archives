I think alchemy could be fixed by makig the high end of Alchemy (even the use or the AA skill) a needed skill as components for other skills like tailoring or smithing; What I mean is, if there was a recepie for a smithed bp for example that required not only the components for the bp itself but a potion that would be trivial at skill 200 or so. The reward could be something really good thus making alchemy a more sought after skill.<br />
<br />
What you all think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think there are a TON of different ways to make alchemy a viable tradeskill... but Verant doesn't seem to want to make it so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ZernSaintwinter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">haven't you heard? alchemy is working as intended. that is why they have time to work on a new expanstion. legacey of somethingie. i tell ya it is really pissing me OFF! <br />
<br />
 If it is working like they want it, then why is no one using it? i have made most all the potions listed and NO ONE wants them(except sow. and then they bulk at the price) it has sooo much that it could offer the game. ok ok i will stop now. i know i am preaching to the choir.<br />

edit: some one once suggested that we stop making potion or boycot alchemy. i have to ask, who would noticed if we did?<br />
<br />
 sorry, my /rant off most be bugged. maybe the will fix it in the next expanstion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I was wondering too if someone would notice if VI would do /removetradeskill alchemy. I'm affraid it would be 1-2% of your server popolution. If not less.</div></div><hr />

Odd, I find that I get a small, but steady income from selling potions in the bazaar. Shrink, Grow, and Concentration potions sell fairly steadily, at a decent but not outrageous profit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fonzerelli SZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">They need to make potions that are rare, combinations of items that are dropped from mobs. Rez potions would be nice. Maybe make them 40 second cast time or something so its not overpowered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>VeldamirVZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">aww, come on, can't we have a 0 cast time 100pct rez potion?<br />
<br />
PLEASE!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rebelheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well its sad Alchemy is useless..but if its useful like smithing and tailoring...people will all just go after it and all the sudden u found competition everywhere (alchemy is a money sunk skill, not even time comsuming)<br />
If you got 20k plat u can get to 180 easily...=(<br />
perhaps revamp skill cap to 250 and you can only get to 200 to 250 with herb that drop from mob, thus make it work like other trade skills.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, this is clearly marked as a Druid AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Stardestroyer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">what about a 85% rez potion? with like a min casting time or something, would make a lot of soloers happy</div></div><hr />
