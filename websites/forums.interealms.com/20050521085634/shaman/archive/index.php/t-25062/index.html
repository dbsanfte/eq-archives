Could you please move all the threads on WOW and EQ2 to their relevant forum spots . I , amongst others are getting a tad annoyed that folk keep coming on here and posting in the general forum when there is clearly  areas for this to be posted . <br />
I feel this has become a page where folk keep coming over and saying EQ2 and WOW are great , leave EQ and join us type threads , when this is an EQ site , and people come here to primarily read about in-game EQ issues . I feel sorry for new memebers to this board , when the first thing they see is somebody raving about EQ2/WOW and slating EQ .<br />

Thanks in advance for any response .</div></div><hr />

<br />
IRVINE, Calif. - November 24, 2004 - Blizzard Entertainment® today announced that World of Warcraft® has become an instant success, achieving epic sales figures in less than 24 hours. Launched Tuesday, November 23rd, the company's subscription-based massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) sold-through to consumers an estimated 250,000* copies of the game. At retailers across the country, players lined up for blocks at midnight to purchase the game, which sold out in many stores nationwide after only one day on store shelves. <br />
<br />
In just the first day alone, over 200,000 players created World of Warcraft accounts, and over 100,000 were already playing the game concurrently as of 5:00 p.m. PST on Tuesday. The account-creation and concurrent-user populations are both record numbers for a MMORPG on its first day of launch, making World of Warcraft the fastest-growing online game in history. World of Warcraft is expected to continue to shatter records and achieve a record-setting week-one population in the days ahead. With dozens of World of Warcraft servers already filled to capacity, Blizzard is deploying additional servers rapidly to match the growing player base. <br />
<br />
&quot;We had a lot of confidence in World of Warcraft, but the success on day one far exceeded our expectations,&quot; said Mike Morhaime, president of Blizzard Entertainment. &quot;We are extremely happy that players are enjoying our game, and we are doing everything we can to meet the demand and maintain a fun and smooth game experience for everyone playing.&quot; <br />
<br />
Retailers across North America, including Wal-Mart, EB, GameStop, and others are reporting that hundreds of their stores have sold out of World of Warcraft due to the demand. If consumers have not yet purchased their copy of World of Warcraft, they are advised to call ahead to make sure their store has copies still in stock. <br />
<br />
&quot;World of Warcraft has once again shown that Blizzard consistently delivers the best games in the industry,&quot; said Robert McKenzie, vice president of merchandising at GameStop. &quot;It sold better than any other PC game this year - in fact, World of Warcraft enjoyed the best day-one sell-through GameStop has ever seen on a PC title!&quot; <br />
<br />
Sorry, could not resist.  :P</div></div><hr />

Conversly, I too went to my local retail outlets, (Wal-Mart, Target, Babbages) but found no copies, all of them having been sold out long before I had gotten off work.<br />
Perhaps its a regional thing /shrug.<br />

<br />
Thanks in advance for any response .<br />
<br />
If you bothered to actually count them or read them, you would have found that in the first three pages of the General forum there are only three or four threads involving EQ2 or WoW.  One of them was started just *yesterday* and another one was actually a conversation between EQ1, EQ2, and WoW players comparing the games and making predictions about their successes.  That thread in particular would ha-ve been useful for EQ1 players to use as reference in case they may have interest in EQ2 or WoW.  It was not solely about EQ2 or WoW or any other game, so now that it has been moved any player not solely seeking information about said other games will not find the thread.<br />
<br />
I would worry much more about other unrelated to the general Shaman in EQ threads such as who to duo with, BoT two-boxing, dev ideas, patch messages...perhaps there should be forums created for those discussions too or have them moved to the appropriate forum?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grobbles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">maybe thats your opinion Jaidin , but theres a place set aside to discuss WOW and EQ2 , and if people want to find out about them and compare them to EQ1 , then thats the place to do it . Not in the general EQ1 section where we debate ingame issues , dev ideas , patch messages and other matters relating to ingame EQ .<br />
It isnt particulary hard to navigate around a board to find a topic you want , especially as everything here is clutter free.<br />
Also the Mods must sort of agree with me or they wouldnt have moved it , they wouldnt do it just because one person asked and 2 others agreed .<br />

Actually, no the General forum is for general Shaman issues, not general EQ issues.  I know that the other forums exist, which is why I specifically mentioned other posts that are *not* &quot;general Shaman discussion&quot; and should hence be moved to those other forums.<br />
<br />
Clutter free you say?  I don't know exactly what you mean by that, but there sure is a heck of a lot of less than useful and duplicate/redundant posts in these forums - always have been and it's the same on every other message board.<br />
<br />
What about the players who solely play EQ2 for example and have never touched EQ1 but have found this site.  Should they post in the EQ2 forum about how annoying any post that mentions EQ1 is and how it should be moved to the General forum?</div></div><hr />

So is this forum for General EQ related stuff or General EQ Shaman related stuff ?.<br />
Personally as the site is called The Shamans Crucible i know which one i think it is.<br />

haha Uthgar!<br />
<br />
I highly doubt they are doing any kind of excessive stat padding or exaggeration.  I heard NUMEROUS first hand reports via friends and strangers alike on message boards and IRC channels about places like Wal-Mart and Target especially running out quickly.<br />
<br />
The local Best Buy I went to Tuesday morning at about 10:30 had about 6 out of 8 or 10 CEs left and had a 4x4 display and then some of the regular edition - easily I'd say between 100-150 copies without too many appearing to have sold... but the story had only just opened thirty minutes prior.<br />
<br />
I went to another Best Buy near where I work Wednesday to pick up another copy of the game for a European friend.  It would be improbably that this store had received any fewer copies than the first one I went to given it's location and how busy it is.  Their 4x4 display was gone and I'll ballpark that they had moved well over 100 units if they had the same amount as the first store.  I almost panicked because I could not even find the game at first.</div></div><hr />

Well, there are EQ2 and WoW forums here, so I would think that EQ2 or WoW posts would go there myself.<br />
<br />
This board was not started how many years ago because WoW or EQ2 existed, otherwise I would see your point.<br />

I am still a shaman at heart. Do they no longer want me around? Well screw them. <br />
<br />
Then I realised that while I might not log onto Eq any time soon. I have 6 years of experiance in Eq. I can tell people how to go damn near anywhere in the game. <br />
<br />
And I can certainly tell people to go places on the board as well. <br />
<br />
If you don't want to hear me talk about WoW or something else. then don't open my damn posts. And skim over what I say.<br />
<br />
Wow at the moment has the magic that EQ has lost. Try it out. It is that good.<br />

I'm all for that. Then I can just hit the EQ area if I so decide.<br />
<br />
I'm just tired of my friends trying to get me into EQ2, nag, nag, nag. I only have time for one game, and I've already selected EQ as that game. I really don't care to learn about other games that I won't be playing. There's too much I still don't know about EQ.</div></div><hr />

I can certainly understand this feeling. Long time EQ1 players are getting tired of being pestered to move on and aren't interested in hearing about the new games. EQ2/WoW people are feeling frustrated because they are being asked to not talk about their games in the community they have participated in for a long time.<br />
<br />
I think it's important that you limit this to only games that the community shows an interest in and that have a Shaman class, though. Give EQ1, EQ2, and WoW each their own General, Equipment, Spells, Quests, and Tradeskills board. Consolidate the Hunting Grounds forums into a single one for each game too (None of them are very active anyway). For games that either people show little interest in, but do have Shaman (i.e. Lineage II, Dark Age of Camelot, EQOA) or have a slight following, but no Shaman (City of Heroes, Horizons), dedicate a single forum to each the way we have been. But the key is always to let the community control the direction of the board. The goal is to retain long standing community members so that their collective experience and knowledge can continue to benefit new comers down the road.<br />

I guess my point is that everyone needs to relax, smile and not read the stuff ya don't want to read, play whatever makes ya happy and do not assume someone else is a freakin idiot cuz they cant see that EQ is dead or that EQ2 sux or that WoW is the second coming.....<br />

Personally, I dont mind the EQ2 and WoW stuff being all lumped into this forum. If I feel like someone is REALLY going over the top with the Rah-Rah gushing, I WILL let them know, heh. <br />
<br />
I love the idea of seperate boards though, Something like:<br />
<br />
Everquest I -<br />
 General, Spells, Med Cab, Quests<br />
<br />
Everquest II<br />
 General, Spells, Med Cab, Quests<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft-<br />
 General, Spells, Med Cab, Quests<br />
<br />
The &quot;leveling&quot; series of forums can be done in the other 2 new games also, and just keep them all in the same places. So the &quot;Leveling 20-30&quot; forum will have information from all 3 games on possible methods to level up in each. <br />
<br />
Then, a couple catch-all forums for non-game related stuff, and we are GTG. <br />
<br />
I realize this is a lot of work, though, for whoever sets up the boards overall forum &quot;tree&quot;. A lot of new moderators would have to be generous enough to donate some time to keep them warm and fluffy, as well.

I now think that the idea of running concurrent EQ1 , EQ2 and WoW forum spots (along with other worthwhile games ) is a feasable and worthwhile option , that way we appriciate the options available to us .<br />

If i sounded negative in my origunal post then I cant change that , but solid options/idea's are  available where I think theres 'room for improvement ' now. ( there seems a decent amount of response from both retired eq players and others) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Looks good Samanna <br />
<br />
I've played most the online games at some point.  When I do play other games, my charactors/Avatars end up looking just like my EQ accounts.    On EQ II and WoW, I created Troll Shaman's (currently both lvl 10's).    <br />
<br />
But when I want to look up information about Shaman's, I've always come back to the Crucible.    It would be great to keep it that way by allowing the Shaman prespective for all games to be expressed at &quot;The Shaman's Cruicible&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Setanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">I do intend to play WoW as well as EQ (not EQII tho thanks anyway) - preorder went in today. But I do think the Forums should be kept seperate. If everything for all three games (and I guess CoH / LineageII, Mir3 et al when they get their store release over here in Europe next year) were heaped in on top of each other in General, you'd never find anything. The Crucible is an accumulation of info on 5 years of EQ. That's entirely enough to try wade through, without trying to have to filter out irrelevant (for an EQ player) WoW stuff.<br />
<br />
Would think it would be equally valid the other way around. When I do get playing WoW do I really want to spend my time digging through EQ posts trying to find a few WoW gems? Its not like you can always tell by the title:<br />
<br />
Shaman...a young man's calling<br />
Very interesting read <br />
Can I have your stuff? <br />
Be the first kid on your block with a cool Surname <br />
A potential solution <br />
<br />
All the above could basically be about any game. If they turn out to be EQ posts and I'm looking for EQ posts I'll probably be happy enough. If they turn out to be SWG posts I'll be annoyed at the amount of my time being wasted.</div></div><hr />

If you loved Morrowind you have to log into EQ2 at least once to look around, particularly South Qeynos. I'm sure they either stole the artists that made that game or based the art on that game. <br />

Sam, with all due respect, you havent been run out of the main forum with heaps of negitive rep bumps and direct attacks specificly cause you love WoW and are over EQ1. If you even mention WoW in the &quot; general &quot; forum you can expect it. I try to support the EQ1 people and put positive feedback into my posts in this forum, but god forbid the words World of Warcraft come out of my mouth. And as far as there only being marginal information about other classes and other games, well bro, thats cause there was no other worthy game that people played. WoW is a quality game that has one over a lot of people.<br />
<br />
So take sud's post with that in mind, i think a few of us are tired of dealing with forced segrigation which causes us to have a short fuses on things of this nature.<br />
<br />

Me personaly i have accepted it. Some people have trouble letting go of the past and in return will attack anything new and different and reject you for supporting it.

The proposed changes would greatly increase the visibility of posts about WoW, not decrease them. This was always a site about EQ1 shamans, but now we are proposing having large subsections for WoW and EQ2 shamans, that's better than having all your posts on WoW shamans shuffled off to that one WoW forum so I don't see why you are complaining.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">Well I will offer my 2 cents. <br />
<br />
Wow seems to have captured the spirit of old EQ minus much of the suck. <br />
<br />
I love EQ. The memories I have of it are strong and filled with many many many years of good things. But I also remember the gradual slide into Monty Haulism. I remember the propogation of the uberguild and forced camping and other unrealistic, combatitive game design choices.<br />
<br />
Bottlenecks over camps and spawns. Training. Griefing. Killstealing. <br />
<br />
All of this is simply and fairly elegently addressed in WoW. Is it a perfect game? Nah. But it really is a fantastic try. If you have not tried it, don't walk to the store, run. <br />
<br />
As for The Shaman's crucible. Well. I don't care if I am playing a thief. or a warrior. Or any other class in any other game. I have been a shaman and an active poster here for going on 6 years. (I lost my login in the server move) <br />
<br />
To ignore people who have helped make the Crucible a fun (yet contentious) place over the years; because they have moved on to another game, would be a gross mistake.  <br />
<br />
Once again my 2 cents. Take it as you will. <br />

Holy crap, nearly famous! :)  Thanks!  I've been enjoying EQ2 so much that I would recommend it to anyone currently playing EQ1 and burned out.  I won't go over what has been said, but WoW and EQ2 both bring back that original EQ feel.  Pick up EQ2, make a character in Qeynos, then when you get to about level 9 or 10, head to Blackburrow and you will totally see what I mean.<br />
<br />
It's too bad that the player base for the two games has to be divided though!  I don't want to play both games at the same time (WoW and EQ2) but I have EQ1 friends who have moved to WoW instead of EQ2, and others that moved to EQ2 over WoW.<br />
<br />
You can't directly compare WoW and EQ2 to EQ1 - we all know what EQ1 is and that's not really going to change.  If you enjoy EQ1 there's not much reason to leave.  EQ2 and WoW are very different than EQ1, equally *as good* but they are young!  All I wanted out of my next MMORPG was for it to be as good as EQ1, no matter how, so there was some future to the game.<br />
<br />
Anyway, not too sure why I wrote all that but it would be nice to see a bit more traffic for the Shamans of EQ2 and WoW.  I expect in the next few months there will be, whether there are new forums here or not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think that anyone wants to drive them away, but the forums as they stand are EQ1 related, and discussion about aspects of shaman from EQ2 or WoW are obviously inappropriate there, since those shaman are pretty much completely separate classes. Setting up three distinct areas for each of the games seems a reasonable compromise.<br />
<br />
Nobody gets offended by excitement btw, what they do get offended by is the evangelists who run around expressing that excitement by saying that the game the other guy plays sucks. Sort of like they are in a new gang and want to prove their loyalty by dissing their old gang, or the other guys down the street. You don't see much of it from people who have gone over to EQ2, but that attitude seems pretty prevalent among posters who have moved to WoW (it probably reflects the type of personalities attracted to each of those games). That sort of thing is not constructive, and it is simple trolling. I play all three games btw, and they all have their strong points and their weaknesses (and as you probably know, I'm going to say so when I feel like it ;) ). And all three are good solid games, but depending on your playstyle, offer more or less to each individual.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Whak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">I can certainly understand this feeling. Long time EQ1 players are getting tired of being pestered to move on and aren't interested in hearing about the new games. EQ2/WoW people are feeling frustrated because they are being asked to not talk about their games in the community they have participated in for a long time.<br />
<br />
I think it's important that you limit this to only games that the community shows an interest in and that have a Shaman class, though. Give EQ1, EQ2, and WoW each their own General, Equipment, Spells, Quests, and Tradeskills board. Consolidate the Hunting Grounds forums into a single one for each game too (None of them are very active anyway). For games that either people show little interest in, but do have Shaman (i.e. Lineage II, Dark Age of Camelot, EQOA) or have a slight following, but no Shaman (City of Heroes, Horizons), dedicate a single forum to each the way we have been. But the key is always to let the community control the direction of the board. The goal is to retain long standing community members so that their collective experience and knowledge can continue to benefit new comers down the road.<br />
<br />
My 2cp,<br />
-Tok<br />
<br />
This excellent suggestion and the subsequent supporting posts exemplify what I have come to realize is a Shamanic approach to facing a challenge.  The urge to pull a pack of lone wolves (or bears depending on your mood) into a circle and come to some sort of compromise that continues to provide wisdom, strength and security while not diminishing the individual is very strong.  While I haven't contributed anything to this community, I still feel a part of it because my experience in EQ has been enriched (and at times diminished) through exposure to this forum.  The open exchange of ideas, sharing of wisdom and frequent displays of dissatisfaction with the status-quo have helped shape the kind of player I have become.  I hope to continue to play and to share the fun of these games with my fellow Shamans (in whatever software form we take) for some time.<br />

I agree, and by the same token, I dont think we need TOO many forums, especially not TOO many &quot;General&quot; forums. For example, some of the suggestions here have 5 &quot;General&quot; forums, I think thats 2 too many, myself. A General EQ1, General EQ2, and General WoW.

That's my vote, for what it counts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u83"><b>Brothur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p83">For all of those that want all of the Shaman information combined into one forum, I have one question for you.<br />
<br />
Are you freaking stupid?<br />
<br />
Have you ever gone to a library or any other place where there is any amount of information to sift through?  C'mon, really now, there MUST be some seperation of the information to be useful at all.  <br />
<br />
Just imagine, looking for quest information and having to sort through all of the the EQ2 and WoW and EQ1 posts to find one that you may want to attemp.<br />
<br />
Again imagine seeing in the General section that there is a patch coming and you change your play schedule to accomidate this only to find out that the patch was for another game.<br />
<br />
Seriously, adding new sections isn't treating WoW and EQ2 players like they are Lepars.  All that people want is to find the information that they are looking for and not listen to how much their game sucks and that they &quot;have&quot; to try this awsome new game.<br />
<br />
I will be likely trying WoW in a couple of months after all of the hype has worn off, but don't care to hear all the propoganda about the other new games in EQ1 forums.  <br />
<br />
When I am looking for the information, I would love a place to look at it without being mixed in with non-pertanet information.  Seperating the forums is a great idea, I completly support it.<br />
<br />
Just my opinion.  Like it, love it or hate it....</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm pretty busy at work this weekend, so I am not going to tackle this project until this weekend.<br />
<br />
Thanks, Glori. I'm looking forward to using them.<br />
<br />
I was so sure I'd play a different class in EQ2. Been there, done that, why do it again?<br />
<br />
But no, some mystical force possessed me, and suddenly there was a baby shaman all ready to explore the new world.<br />
<br />
I always valued the Crucible community, and would love it to be extended to include new games as fully as it does EQ1.<br />
<br />
Here's hoping you get time to set this up for us soon.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">Sorry for the delay in setting up the new forums. I need to get some clarification from Sunmoon and he's moving into a new home during the holidays.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty much offline as well, I'm visiting my parents in Texas. I hope to get to it after the new year.</div></div><hr />
