<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Groans</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I am the type that likes cool looking places and cool looking mobs to kill. I don't really care about the xp grind anymore, just wondering where I could see some really cool looking things at level 40, solo. Or mid 20's with a shammy, bst, and a warrior. Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Farrdaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've been going off the beaten path lately myself.  I'm leveling my shammy much differently than my Wiz or Monk.  While at 40 you're getting a little high (but xp is still fine at 41) StoneBurnt has been a lot of fun and I'm looking to head to JagedPine soon.  While JP gets a fair number of people a busy day in SB is 5 people.  The trick to SB is just finding the paths and working with the flow.  <br />
<br />
Tenebrous Mountains, now this is a scenic spot that you must keep your head turning at all times.  Mons Letalis is another like this.  I didn't spend anytime here as a wiz as the terrain didn't favor a wiz but looks like the shammy will work out better.<br />
<br />
I've always been a fan of EW but the lag I get at times make it unplayable for me.  I like being able to look out at the ocean.<br />
<br />
I've run around most of the zone's (well just about all i can get too) and for looks these are my favorites.  <br />
<br />
Skyshrine is neat too with it's HUGE hallways and with the mob revamp you could actually start at the pool room at around 20ish.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tymson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I found Tenebrous Mountains at 44 and am now 1/2 way through 46 after about 2 hours of play there.  I found that the 44 pet can solo the Dire Sonic Wolves with the help of a slow and VoS dot.  I highly recomend it!  Just watch for the caters, and make sure you found a safe pull spot!  Adds here are not fun!  <br />
<br />
Just if you're feeling adventerous...  I would have tried this closer to 40 if I'd have known about it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Liley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Tenebrous is also good to collect skulls from the reanimated Vah Shir for the Shield of Bane Warding quest =)  Nice to start the quest when you can gain some experience too!  Good hunting =):D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>ajgala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">How about Twilight Sea?  It is a great looking zone.  Find the hole in the sea and swim north to a hidden section.   You'll likely need enduring breath (and invisiblity to avoid this killer fish).<br />
<br />
It will be different and probably abandoned.  You might like it.</div></div><hr />
