<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Target is self, like all mage spells except the new Modrods. But it can be dropped so it's just a matter of mage handing the belt out to whomever needs it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">would this gate to bind point, rather than to the Swamp?<br />
<br />
sounds like competition for translocate spells, rather than for our gate potions.  not that our gate potions have much market, anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Lyam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">So tell me should I get my Alchemy skill maxed again?<br />
<br />
The potion market just got a kick in the kahoolies.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">hmm, those things have been advertiesed as &quot;emergency outs&quot; for people stuck somwhere in PoP quests. Just one problem, they are no rent. So you go LD, losse your group - and your escape item has conviniently dissipated in the mean time.<br />
I think once people realize that gate potions will ahve a great market again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Stonienogg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">seems i read this summonable gate item requires a reagent... that being Quintessence of Knowledge, the one new alchemy item we can make so far. it works with other quested gate items as well, so it seems we're not being left out of the loop completely in the buyable-gate-ability market.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Morbific</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The Plane of Knowledge will hamper sales for gate potions. Travel has just become much easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>HordainPrima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I agree with Shamuofxev, we'renot out of the market by a long shot - if we were why this QoK reagent?<br />

Also consider this from the &quot;front office&quot; having to do with acquiring Character flags in PoP and also getting the #^$@ outta Dodge to be able to capitalize on that Flag:<br />
<br />
1) all raiders must have the ability to gate. that means melee, have a gate potion of some kind on you during poop raids. Make sure you have some way out on pop raids in particular.<br />
<br />
2)all pop raids will use /raid, all other issues not withstanding.<br />
<br />
http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=12803<br />
<br />
apparently the use of the raid window was assumed in a number of poop events, you have to be in the raid to have various flags set.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If you go LD -- no rent items stick around for 30 minutes in case you log back in... so theoretically, you could go LD and continually log back in within 30 minutes and never lose a NO RENT item.  If you intentionally camp -- it's gone immediately though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sateeva</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Quintessence of Knowledge is used to recharge the 5 charge gate belt obtained through a PoP quest. Shamans are the only ones that can make Quintessence of Knowledge, so our worth has gone up a bit. <br />

My son plays a warrior and he has all the items but the Creeping silk strands that drops Off of slimes in POD. Once he gets this I'll post some more info on it.<br />
<br />
Hopefully we shaman will want to stock up on Quintessence of Knowledge, time will tell.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Sateeva</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Ok my son has his gate talisman now.  To use the gate effect you must have Quintessence of Knowledge on you. After using it, it eats one of the Quintessence of Knowledges and the charges on the item now says 4 left. I'm guessing that once the charges are gone you have to recharge it with a mana battery. It cost 110pp to make 1 Quintessence of Knowledge plus the item recharge after 5 uses, makes this very cost effective. Will find out more about the recharging soon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not even close to true.<br />
<br />
It is 30 minutes period. It doesn't matter if you left the character because of a LD, camping, the zone you are in crashing, or the whole server coming down.</div></div><hr />
