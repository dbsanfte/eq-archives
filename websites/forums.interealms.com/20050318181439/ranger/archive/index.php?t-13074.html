<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mortok</div><div class="date">10-31-2002, 03:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So far a lot of the gear dropping in the 1st and 2nd tier planes are tradeable.  How is everyone feeling about this?  In Luclin is seemed like everything was No Drop (same with a lot of Velious).  <br />
<br />
Personally I like it cause it allows people to upgrade and also hand down the items to fellow guildmates or just sell it to people who aren't in a guild (such as myself)   :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sasandra</div><div class="date">10-31-2002, 03:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">personaly I like the recomended/required level item that are dropable over no drop items, no drop only causes lots of wasted items, there are numerous people in my guild that have stuff banked that they will never use again that would be nice upgrades to other guild members, if they were dropable that is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elindel</div><div class="date">10-31-2002, 03:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem is that alot of the first and second tier gear is well, crap for a level 50.  Which means it gets destroyed or sold to a merchant.  Itemization on the lower end named has been kind of strange.  But there are also some solid items floating around out there.<br />
<br />
Overall tradable gear is much nicer than no drop just due to the amount of stuff rotting away in banks or destroyed.</div></div><hr />

I wonder if that will be the case in the higher tier planes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sasandra</div><div class="date">10-31-2002, 03:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well hopefully the understated the gear and it will be upgraded, I do agree that most of the gear is a joke though, mobs that give NToV guilds a run for their money droping loot not even good enough to be considered twink gear.</div></div><hr />
