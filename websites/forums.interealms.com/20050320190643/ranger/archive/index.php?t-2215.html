Girls made to show underwear at school dance<br />
<br />
LOS ANGELES, California (Reuters) -- Angry parents demanded the resignation of a California high school vice principal Tuesday because she lifted the skirts of teenage girls at a dance in front of men and male classmates to make sure they were wearing &quot;appropriate&quot; underwear. <br />
<br />
Parents at Rancho Bernardo High School in suburban San Diego say the vice principal, Rita Wilson, made the girls prove that they were not wearing thong underwear before they were allowed into the dance on Friday. <br />
<br />
In some cases, said Rancho Bernardo parent Kim Teal, girls also were made to partially undress if Wilson or another teacher suspected that they weren't wearing bras. <br />
<br />
&quot;These girls feel violated,&quot; said Teal, whose daughter Rebecca, a sophomore, was asked about her underwear but escaped a search after telling Wilson that she was not wearing a thong. &quot;One girl just cried after having to tell her father this story, she was hiding her head in a sweatshirt,&quot; Teal said. &quot;After a while the girls finally got the idea that they shouldn't say 'thong' when they were asked. <br />
<br />
  <br />
Wilson and Paul Gentle, Rancho Bernardo's principal, were unavailable for comment on the skirt-lifting. But earlier Gentle told local KGTV that he was looking into the situation and planned a meeting with the offended parents. <br />
<br />
Don Phillips, superintendent of the Poway Unified School District, said students, staff and others were being interviewed to determine what happened at the dance, which he said was attended by about 725 pupils. <br />
<br />
&quot;The principal is talking with the parents involved,&quot; he said. &quot;We are taking this seriously and want to ensure that any actions to be taken are based on the facts of the situation.&quot; <br />
<br />
 <br />
Teal, a 43-year-old attorney, said she was told about the skirt-lifting after the dance by her daughter, whose friends were forced to lift their skirts in front of boys, teachers and police officers standing at the door. <br />
<br />
She said hundreds of girls attended the dance, which had a &quot;blast from the past&quot; theme and that most of those wearing skirts or dresses reported being grilled about their underwear or forced to show them to Wilson or another teacher. <br />
<br />
Teachers also checked several boys who were wearing toga-style costumes, Teal said, and girls were often asked about their bras. &quot;I just got a call from one mom who said her daughter was wearing a poodle skirt and an off-the-shoulder top and a teacher reached right out and grabbed the front of it and pulled it down to check,&quot; Teal said. <br />
<br />
Teal said she and other parents would meet with Gentle to demand the resignation of Wilson and any other teachers willingly involved. If Wilson does not resign, she said, the parents were prepared to file a lawsuit against the school district for violating the civil rights of their daughters.</div></div><hr />

If I were one of those parents, I'd be first in line to demand that the district fire her WITH prejudice, so she couldn't just go out and get a job elsewhere.

I'm graduating in two week and will be provisionally certified to teach in NYS.  As a teacher I would never go along with such a policy and would fight it.  If I were a parent I'd be just as outraged.  The personal environment of a school is an important part of successful school.  When young girls have to fear this in school, whether it's and extracurricular activity or not, is just plain despicable.  I hope many people loose their jobs and are prosecuted for their actions in this.  I'm not sure how it is in California, but for a teacher to get hired in NY, they have to submit fingerprints to NYS.  They are used as part of a background check through the FBI.  Hopefully this will weed out the &quot;bad teachers&quot; here and you won't have that problem.  I would also think that  the school would be held responsible for any counseling that these students must go through to get past this.  If teachers are willing supporting such a rediculous policy, then they are unworthy of cleaning the toilets at the local McDonalds.  If the teachers are being forced to enforce such a stupid dress code, then industrial action needs to be taken against the school.  I can hardly even believe this would happen.  That completely breaks the trust between the school and the community.</div></div><hr />

This is totally ridiculous and the Vice Principle and any teacher involved should not be allowed to teach again.  I would have left the dance and went and told my father so that he could go there that night.  Things wouldn't have been pretty but these crude actions would have stopped.</div></div><hr />

Just rediculously bad judgement. I certainly saw plenty of that in high school. Once an unreasonable / illogical person gets an idea stuck in their head, they sometimes go to all lengths to do what they think is right...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mortec</div><div class="date">05-08-2002, 09:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Totally unacceptable! As said. If this is school policy, then something is major wrong and thus actions must be taken. If this is just a really bad idea from the teachers/principals etc. actions must be taken against those. I agree to some extent that school should have a dress code. Whats appropriate and whats not. (Like t-shirts saying 'pornstar' on the chest, and fits 12 years olds.) what the hell is wrong with manufacturers these days!!<br />
I live in Norway and there is currently alot of fuzz going on over here about how much the school is to 'dictate' pupil clothing. It should be rules, but this example is WAY over the top. If I had a daughter and her teacher did this, there would be some serious whooping coming that teachers way.. (all out on the legal stuff, and maybe a baseball bat one late evening (j/k))</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Emer</div><div class="date">05-11-2002, 02:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not entirely the same thing but reminds me of the &quot;strip search&quot; held at a middle school a few blocks from where I live a few years ago.<br />
<br />
http://www.onlineathens.com/1998/013198/0131.a3stripsearch.html<br />
<br />
Heads rolled for that one and every child involved got $5000 for it, with the remaining 2 that held out and sued an undisclosed amount.  <br />
<br />
One of my friends is a police officer in the town and one of his daughters was one that was searched.  He said he had no problem with it.  I do.<br />
<br />
Although it's a stretch searching for stolen articles versus checking types of underwear, it's all a bit inapropriate.  Trying to imagine what they were trying to accomplish is what confuses me mostly.  Keeping somone from flashing perhaps?  I know that when I was in high school I wasn't all that interested in showing my entire class in one setting my wobbly bits.<br />
<br />
And what exactly is &quot;appropriate&quot; underwear anyway?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Albadia Fii</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 06:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First off.. this is a teenage perspective. So take it with a grain of salt if you will...<br />
<br />
To start with this bugged me. School admin's have *no* right to ask what kind of underwear you have on. It is a personal choice, and not something that is their business whatsoever. I dont think this is an issue dealing with a homosexual VP, as it is with an Administrator on a power trip.<br />
<br />
I will in no way deny that things happen at dances that you old people (no offense) would find offensive. And she is right, lots of times when dancing (Freaking, grinding, call it what you will)... youll get a flash, or a grab. But thats her choice is it not? And has nothing to do with what kind of underwear she is wearing. If they're both wearin a big smile......<br />
<br />
Thirdly, that is plain as day harassment. Even in private it would be... but multiplied because it is in front of male students (good night for them), a police officer, and other Admin's. Im outraged more that this *can* happen, than that it *did* happen<br />
<br />
Anyway...  Penny for your thoughts, my two cents, take it as you will and buy yourself some gum.<br />

I tried to give her the bennifit of the doubt and thought maybe she had just shown a case of bad judgment. Now that she is trying to defend her actions and justify them I see my first emotion was the right one, she is guilty of continuous bad judgment and lack of common sense. She should NOT be allowed to be in charge of children of any age again. Time for her to get some new carrier training....</div></div><hr />

<br />
This makes me laugh it's so stupid. If she had it to do over agian she wouldn't &quot;think about the girls' privacy&quot; or something logical like that. No! She would refuse to supervise the dance.<br />
<br />
I sure as heck HOPE this has ruined her career. The worst part is she'll probably end up at a small college teaching future teachers.</div></div><hr />
