<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Level 65, Spell Casting Reinforcement Mastery.  I have a Sparkling Gem of Fortune attached to my Silver Charm of Tranquility.  It has the effect extended blessing 4 - 10% to all beneficial spell durations.<br />
<br />
I went to Halas where I have no lag and damaged myself down to ~1700 health then cast Quies on myself to see how much it was healing.<br />
<br />
Cast 01: 1715 - 4305 = 2590 (8)<br />
Cast 02: 1738 - 4309 = 2571 (8)<br />
Cast 03: 1704 - 4256 = 2552 (8)<br />
Cast 04: 1670 - 4222 = 2552 (8)<br />
Cast 05: 1715 - 4267 = 2552 (8)<br />
Cast 06: 1599 - 3832 = 2233 (7)<br />
Cast 07: 1723 - 3994 = 2289 (7)<br />
Cast 08: 1705 - 3957 = 2252 (7)<br />
Cast 09: 1709 - 4242 = 2526 (8)<br />
Cast 10: 1716 - 3968 = 2252 (7)<br />
<br />
<br />
Then I removed my Silver Charm of Tranquilty, and attached Sparkling Gem of Fortune, and put it in my bag and did another 10 casts.<br />
<br />
Cast 01: 1699 - 3632 = 1933 (6)<br />
Cast 02: 1706 - 3639 = 1933 (6)<br />
Cast 03: 1713 - 3646 = 1933 (6)<br />
Cast 04: 1717 - 3650 = 1933 (6)<br />
Cast 05: 1705 - 3638 = 1933 (6)<br />
Cast 06: 1693 - 3626 = 1933 (6)<br />
Cast 07: 1681 - 3614 = 1933 (6)<br />
Cast 08: 1688 - 3621 = 1933 (6)<br />
Cast 09: 1714 - 3647 = 1933 (6)<br />
Cast 10: 1702 - 3925 = 2223 (7)<br />
<br />
The numbers are a little strange but I assume that is because of my regen... Barbarian standing regen, regen 3 aa, aura of battle x 1, aura of health x 2 and composure.. magelo says thats 19 standing, though I don't know if thats accurate or not.<br />
<br />
It seems to me that the aug is definately adding ticks in many cases for me.  With SCRM alone the 7th tick was rare, with SCRM + Extended Blessing 4 I am getting an 8th tick half the time and a 7th tick always.<br />
<br />
Small sample size, but enough for me to conclude for myself it is adding some benefits to Quiescence.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">7 ticks definitely..strange that 2.4 seconds adds an 8th tick though.<br />
definitely worth getting if its adding an 8th tick 50-60% of the time.<br />
<br />
Wonder if its maybe giving a bit more than the 10% extension :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Perhaps the focus effect is being applied AFTER the SCRM. <br />
<br />
My personal thinking on the way Torpor/Q work is that the buff lasts for a certain number of seconds, and if a tick happens while the buff is up you get the effect.  That would account for the extra mystery tick (ie: you finish casting just as a tick lands).<br />
<br />
Assuming that is correct (and it is an assumption, I know):<br />
<br />
Normal = 24 seconds (24 seconds)<br />
SCR3 = 30 seconds (30 seconds)<br />
SCRM = 36 seconds (36 seconds)<br />
SCRM + EB4 = 36 + 3.6 = (39.6 seconds)<br />
<br />
That extra 3.6 seconds would be a pretty sizeable amont of time for an extra tick to happen in.<br />
<br />
I could be completely wrong here -- I've never really thought about it much.  Henora's test shows me enough to believe its worth getting, though.  Assuming it doesn't get auto-nerfed by tomorrow, anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
do there any possible error there ? like there may some client side error on extra tick, sometime your HP pump up from extra tick heal but few second later your hp drop back after update from server; so maybe good to wait few second to record final hp. maybe this bug already fixed ? I don't play EQ anymore so can't test it myself</div></div><hr />

The way I've calculated it is to add up my buff extenders (65% with crown and SCRM) thus  ending up with 24sec*1.65 = 39.6.<br />
If on the other hand the 15% isn't added until after aa extensions duration is 36sec*1.15 = 41.4<br />
<br />
I guess I'll have to parse it - I always get lots and lots of healing outta Q :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can someone who has SCRM and EB4 test the duration of FA?  This should tell us whether the EB4 effect is computed before or after the benefits of SCRM are added.  If FA lasts 6.5*1.5*1.1=10.725 mins (10 min 43 secs), then BA4 is applied to Base + SCRM.  If FA lasts 6.5*1.6=10.400 mins (10 min 24 secs) then BA4 is applied to Base only.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Since the question has come up again in private conversation, here are the results of a slightly longer sample.  I did this one with a partner.  :)<br />
<br />
Quiescence with SCRM and the 10% Extended Blessing Augment.<br />
Out of 39 casts, we got:<br />
8 ticks - 21 times<br />
7 ticks - 18 times<br />
<br />
and to answer a question above... I waited for my hp to move upward on a tick, then cast Q (QB3, 3.0 cast time).   I recorded the HP ending total at the last jump of 300, by watching my HPs increase, then recording the total immediately previous to a tick where I only gain 19hps(my standing regen).</div></div><hr />

There is no need to post data. Focus effects that do the same thing (spell duration extension in this case) do not, have not, and will never stack.</div></div><hr />

6 seconds (4 ticks, 19.4 remaining)<br />
6 seconds (5 ticks, 13.4 remaining)<br />
6 seconds (6 ticks, 7.4 remaining)<br />
6 seconds (7 ticks, 1.4 remaining)<br />
buff still up, not sure if it lasts full duration of tick (8 ticks)<br />
<br />
I didnt think this was right, but after my model above, i guess it works out.  I assumed 38.4 second duration of spell (24*1.5 + 24*1.1).  I'm not sure to what detail the game takes time.<br />
<br />
38.4 second Q=2.3 in 6 chance of getting an 8th tick, ~38%.<br />
39.6 second Q=3.5 in 6 chance of getting an 8th tick, ~58%.<br />
<br />
Henora's &quot;parse&quot; showed 21 8-ticks and 18 7-ticks, this represents a ~54% rate of getting 8 ticks.<br />
<br />
So either:<br />
a. Henora is a really lucky person and somehow the planets align every time Q is cast <br />
OR<br />
b. the 10% extension is applied AFTER SCR/SCRM</div></div><hr />

Megumi, did you ever confirm the ticks from SCRM + 20%? Jinheim reports 8 ticks always. Has anyone else tested?<br />

I got them both, and can run them over just to see, what I did try out when I got Breath of Trushar though was to just check how long the HoT stayed on me, and with SCRM+Eterninostrum I was affected 46-48 seconds - I didn't do the damage, since it was late and I didn't feel like waiting around for can5 to be usable several times.<br />
Before Trushar 1 canni5 was not enough, I had to canni 4 a few times to get full healing out of Q, and well it only got &quot;worse&quot; :)<br />
I'll try to remember to run it over tonight when I got off from work.</div></div><hr />

Okay, now that the servers are back up:<br />
<br />
Cast 01: 3174 - 5654 = 2480 (8)<br />
Cast 02: 3430 - 5900 = 2470 (8)<br />
Cast 03: 3630 - 6100 = 2470 (8)<br />
Cast 04: 3339 - 5809 = 2470 (8)<br />
Cast 05: 3915 - 6385 = 2470 (8)<br />
Cast 06: 3239 - 5709 = 2470 (8)<br />

The effect changed but that stats changed too -- adding attack+20, regen+8, mana regen+8, and damage shield+8.  Making it remain essentially the same and keeping it in line with the patch message.<br />

Latest info posted at http://morelight.org/samanna/focus.html#duration - scroll down a bit for the Q tables. I've linked to posts claiming a particular duration for Q based on AA/Focus items. I'll do my own testing to see if I can wrangle a 7th tick out of Q with just SCRM before I get my EB4 aug.<br />
<br />
Anyone more bored than me want to check my math? :)</div></div><hr />

With the mouse over spell timers we can now test this conclusively.  For instance,  with my Extended Blessing aug and SCRM I have noticed that it will add exactly 1 tick to Q (an extra 6 seconds).<br />
<br />
edit:  I've noticed that spell timers only use 6 second increments, so for instance Q will tick down from 42 seconds to 36 seconds etc.  You won't see anything in between.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Sigh well i'm out of the game and i guess it's time for me to share a very old trick. THE PHANTOM TICK.<br />
<br />
Here goes. Ever notice when u cast torpor or Q that sometimes u get an EXTRA tick?<br />
Well it SEEMS like a random occurence but it's not :P<br />
<br />
See it's te way ticks are counted.<br />
<br />
So... u begin to cast a spell and u MUST make sure the spell lands within the first 1.5 to 2 seconds of the tick.<br />
<br />
Here is an example<br />
<br />
1...2...3...4...5...6 (Here u get the heal from the spell / damage from any dot currently on you)<br />
<br />
HOWEVER<br />
<br />
If you get q to LAND ON YOU AFTER second 6 but before second 8 it won't count that tick but u will get healed at the end of it. So by the time second 12 comes around u receive the healing but this PARTIAL tick didn't get counted as part of the 4 standard ticks. It gets ignored but u get the benefit from it.<br />
<br />
WARNING: Failure to land the spell withing the first 2 seconds causes screwy things like hp going up but then goign down at the end of tick 5 :( . time it right and u will get it every time. Ideally landit on the 7th second or less as long as it's after second 6 :P<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Take Stoicism. Perfect spell to cast cause it has a 1 tick cast time(6 seconds)<br />
<br />
Now a shaman with no aa and nothign to make casting tiem shorter at 44 shoudl try this. U stand up and u wait for the end of a tick (when u see your hp move up. Now u count about say half a second and begin to cast. Now sit down and watch. LO and behold your hp will go up for FIVE ticks.<br />
<br />
I realize this is harder and harder to do as ppl get funkier aa and items that shorten cast times but if u get your math right u can always extend your torp / q/ stoic by a tick on top of items /aa.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps i only shared this with a few ppl while i played but now they have all mostly left :(<br />
<br />
Good luck and hope this helps u all :)<br />
<br />
<br />

Soulstorm<br />

<br />
Edit : I realize this type of countign means u must be soloing cause u must watch your hp bar and count but hey soloers need all the help they can get :P</div></div><hr />

Thats nifty and all, but...man, what a hassle.<br />

If an extra tick of Q is going to make or break the encounter, I'm probably not up to it anyway, and groups (the ones I'm in, anyway) move way to fast to bother with this.<br />

Interesting info, tho.<br />
<br />
That is why this is best used by a 44+ shaman who has stoic and doesn't have any items that affect cast time yet. Can make a WORLD of a difference to a soloing shaman of that level. I tore through the seafuries in OOT using this and my downtime was minimized :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Still a usefull BUG :D<br />

Honestly, that is how I felt about the whole &quot;Canni Dance&quot; trick. I used it some, when I was REALLY down on mana and needed it baddly, but honestly, overall, I rarely used it. <br />
<br />
This trick is the same way. <br />
<br />
Of course, I still wear my Crowm of Ambiv, basically JUST for that extra tick (that, and EP Chain Helm is one of our RAREST drops), but hey, thats totally passive. I have enough &quot;active&quot; abilities (Canni, recast FA on melee) to worry about.</div></div><hr />

Heh this isn't as bad it's like ONE cannidance. See u use this when u got no man u chain cast canni 2 or 3 and then slap this and sit down<br />
 then get up and cast again and u are fully healed with 90% mana :)<br />

The dance has to be done every tick.<br />
