<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Man shaman really are good in this game. This wolform i just got is astounding and this new weapon proc is sweet with its snare and extra damage. Im diggin it big time so far, im glad that interdweebs are all horny... and very scarey ... bunch of people or i never would have quit my hunter till much later.<br />
<br />
Oh yea, i have a 99% win rate in PvP too and the 1 lose i had, i was able to avenge. It was vs a hunter a level higher then me and i lost cause i got a lil paniced. That pet isnt really as big a boost in DPS as i thought it would be vs me and my healings and stuff, but just the fact that your fighting 2 foes is a lil intimidating. Im very satisfied with my choice to play on a &quot; red &quot; server so far. I hope the PVP ganking in contested zones doesnt get frustrating though.<br />
<br />
Anyway, just tooting my shaman horn cause im loving it :)</div></div><hr />

PvP has been fun so far but it seems i never fight anyone my level or lower. Im always being jumped by higher levels. I now travel with guildies in contested zones. We have quest nights for the zones where we get all the quests for the particular zone then we run through them. Kinda like mini raids. My group has gotten pretty effecient at killing higher level characters that want to take us on.<br />
<br />
One of our quests required us to kill dryads for a drop. There was a player named Dryad there protecting the NPC dryads. He surprised us the first time but we had revenge. It was a good idea on his part hehe gota give him credit.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Melkiah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I always get jumped by gangs of paladin... <br />
good rule of thumb is 'for every pladin you see, there are at least 2 or 3 of his buddies hiding in teh bushes'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I can only imagine!  I play on a blue server, but there was a dwarf pally schmucking around my shaman last night, following her around for a little while (level ??, of course).  I finally figured he was hoping I'd drop an offensive totem, I'm guessing that would trip my PvP flag and let him destroy me.  *snort*  I wonder how it is people manage to get a rush out of unfair fights? <br />
<br />
Glad you're lovin it, Litgruv.  This game is far too fun for my health.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">One thing i noticed about hillsbrad is that Tarren Mill has better protection than even the Xroads. Tarren Mill has a LOT of guards. there some hiddn also like the ones in the barn. Tarren mill gets attacked sure then they turn tail and run.<br />
