<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Patito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been working on a nice guide to the Hole. Some of the old ones are out dated or their website is down now. You can see it so far here: http://patrek.8m.com/thehole/map.html<br />
<br />
I'd like any feedback and suggestions you guys have. I'm going to do some close up maps to some of the harder parts, like in the city and the undead tower with mob locations when I get a chance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Actually, the Hole was just modified so that the higher level rock golems can be mezzed using rapture or dazzle.  The old world limit was just removed per last patch - like yesterday.<br />
<br />
Moreover, my understanding is that brell worshipping halfling are still fine.  I think that was just one of those rumors.  I guess I should verify it myself, but I've seen a number of posts from folks who say they did just check this.  <br />
<br />
The map was nice though.</div></div><hr />

The best place that I've found for IGS so far is the room just south of the red &quot;4&quot;.  Pulled around 10 sets out of there so far.  The city area should be good as well, but I think I've just had bad luck.  Mainly, you want the areas with the highest concentration of golems and revenants.<br />
<br />
Places that are fun xp for one group are 4, 6-8, and 11.  Lots of mobs to keep you busy in these areas.  Lots of golems too, which is always a bonus.  There's always somewhere to move that has mobs spawned.<br />
<br />
For lower level groups, the area around A, D, black 13-14 is pretty fun.  We called this the castle.  It's a fun place to crawl.  It's too easy for a high 50's group though.<br />
<br />
This is one of my favorite zones, although I haven't been there since it was changed.</div></div><hr />
