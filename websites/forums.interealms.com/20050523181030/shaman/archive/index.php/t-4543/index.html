<br />
pro's<br />
<br />
about the same hps as regular shrooms in FG .. <br />
<br />
they do NOT assits each other .. they stand there like morons .. <br />
<br />
they always con indiffernt and give no faction hits <br />
<br />
never crowded camp<br />
<br />
same amount of exp per mob<br />
<br />
con's<br />
<br />
they hit slightly harder <br />
<br />
its imossible to get to camp solo<br />
<br />
ya camp is past the invis bridge<br />
<br />
they have supper high PR .. even after malosini i couldnt land bane-o-nife<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
if i could bind there it would be heaven<br />
just a nice place to solo and grind out exp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hmmm, you talking about those four shrooms on the ledge?  I think I'd need a little more mobs to solo than that ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">theres about 40 of them  =D<br />
<br />
and theres 2 camps<br />
=D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ahhh, we usually are a little bored by the time we go over the bridge and don't tend to look that much farther.  I must say though, the bridge is major entertainment, the first couple o times you go over it :)<br />
<br />
I guess you could get a group to get you there and bind across the bridge (if you can bind in zone AND have a spiritstone or other port method)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">thanks for the tip<br />
<br />
btw, have you tried going bear form fighting them? wouldn't recommend others trying as I think they attack people in illusions :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wargbearjumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ummmm... The Bridge isn't a problem if you can survive the run to it solo....   just jump off the cliff and /q before you hit the ground... when you log back in, you're aggro free, and fall for about 300 HP.   Happy Hunting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I stayed at this camp spot myself for 3 days straight doing exp and farming Saps. On the 3rd day I died and had to get necro summoned out. :D <br />
This was about 2 months ago. The spot is very nice and secluded, but the shrooms do hit alot harder then FG ones do. The catch is that they still spend most their time casting worthless curses. They can hit for 250max IIRC. (or was is it 220?)<br />
<br />
They like to run more when low health and I had a few poof because of bad pathing/warping. Because they stay indifferent forever you can sit right in the middle of them all day long and kill.<br />
<br />
 (btw if anyone plans on doing this, and you aren't going after Lord Inquisitor Seru, you can sell the saps for good money to someone who is)</div></div><hr />
