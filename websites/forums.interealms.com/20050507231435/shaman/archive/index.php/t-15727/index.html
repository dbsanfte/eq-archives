<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Khend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Simple question....in a duo/partner situation, levels 20-65, does the SK utility more then make up for the overall lesser DPS and FD capability of a monk?  Or is the monk still a very good duo/partner to the shaman 20-65?<br />
<br />
Is the monk duo more dependent on uber gear vs SK?<br />
<br />
Would LDoN and the possible return of the dungeon crawl impact the choice?<br />
<br />
P.S. I did do a search and read what I could find, still looking for more info though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zakumara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sk has one more utility than monk...he can tank without the need of uber gear (plate armor) as monk tanking high level mob, it can be done but they have to be well equiped and have AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Monk is less gear dependant than the SK.<br />
<br />
SK has superior tanking ability<br />
<br />
Monk has NO taunt ability.<br />
<br />
SK has TONS of taunt ability with spells<br />
<br />
Both could FD pull for singles.<br />
<br />
I personally think that the SK is a superior choice.  Monks are better damage dealers than SK's but not as good tanks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">level 20-65 is an overly large range to say simply, Monks are better or SKs are better.  At lower levels up to say 40 or 45 it won't much matter either way IMO.  The monk will probably shine due to better DPS.  The SKs ability to tank and hold aggro won't be nearly as important at those levels.<br />
<br />
From 50ish onwards the SK will start to shine as the better tank, but depending on where you hunt it may not really matter enough to merit the loss of DPS.  Once you close in on and pass 60, the SK is the better choice for a duo partner without doubt.<br />
<br />
Going from level 20-65, I'd say at the lower end it won't matter. Towards the middle the Monk DPS will pull ahead enough to make him a better partner despite the tanking/aggro ability of the SK.  In the end though, the SK will be a far superior partner in a duo whether you're doing a dungeon crawl or outdoor xp in some PoP zone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The monk's ability to taunt is limited by his ability to proc.  That directly impacts how much aggro the duo partner shaman can draw before he finds himself tanking.<br />
<br />
A good SK, while if you've laid on the dots really heavy will sometimes have to fight to get aggro back, *will* get aggro back.<br />
<br />
SKs have nice bonuses also - they can cast a mana tap which regens the shaman's mana 200 a minute (hey it adds up~), can lifetap in case of emergency if **** is hitting the fan, and a well-timed HT/DT can save your ass. :P<br />
<br />
Not to mention you can snare kite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kayleigh88</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">my own personal experience and preference between sk and monk as a partner is that i prefer monk.<br />
<br />
i grouped once with an sk before as a duo. very nice person he was and i would group with him again but what i found was that it took his entire mana bar to keep taunt. No it was not because i was stealing taunt. I think it was because he was just use to playing that sort of style and i wanted to be polite and not tell him how to play. so i sat with him and chatted it up during the down times when he recovered mana.<br />
<br />
I have duoed with many a monk. The play styles go well together. Even with an average skill and equiped monk, fighting can be non stop.<br />

<br />
Can you outagro a Malosini, Turgurs, cripple, BoN and PoB?  Cause thats my standard starting line up when engaging a mob.  Now, I duo with a SK partner that is 61.  I can debuff and slow on incoming and the nasty doesnt even look my way.  Snare is a HUGE agro generator.  I can heal 2K hp on the SK immediatly after slowing and the mob doesnt even turn.  If I DO pull agro it takes about 2 seconds for the SK to reestablish control and take agro back.<br />
<br />
Im not saying that your monk or any monk doesnt have the ability to pull agro.  Anyone can pull agro.  what Im talking about is controlled taunt and 'agro on demand'.  If the mob is heading for the cleric, the SK can stop it dead in its tracks with spells that directly add hate ( Voice of Terris (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=1228&amp;source=Live) is a good example) to the SK.  <br />
<br />
A monk, no matter how well geared, cant hope to generate the amount of taunt that a SK can in as short amount of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I duoed almost my entire time playing eq with a monk partner. He probably has 600-800k or so in gear, but doens't have the big defensive AA's yet. If we want to go to BoT or tactics we need to get an SK/Pally to be effective.<br />
<br />
While the monk was a great partner leveling up, at the end you'll want someone that can take the abuse better and hold agro better. SK's rule at both.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Bukbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Necro looks really fun but necro tends to not be desired in groups<br />
<br />
<br />
A well played necro is incredible in a group.  They rarely go out of mana unless they're strained.  In the twenties they can help heal, mez a couple adds, snare, nuke - tapping and shock of poison - and fear.  They are really quite versatile.  People not wanting necros in their group is probably because they got stuck with a fear kiting necro that didn't know what he could add to a group.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately I've only played a few of the classes you mentioned to around 30 (Monk, Sk, necro - bard to 18?).  I hated the bard, too much damn clicking.  I just made him because I wanted a human bucket head.  The other three are still around and I think a duo with shammy would do best with an sk or necro.  They both add the utility pieces the other doesn't have.  If you want to be a tank go with SK, if you want to dot and cast go with necro.  Mages are always good too though.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>lordkaldron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'm a little biased since I duo-box a 65sk and 65shm but the Shadowknight blows away what a monk can do for small groups. We can duo in PoTactics, HoH, BoT, any zone that I have access to so far we can do. I highly doubt many monks can tank PoTactics ogres well. <br />
<br />
For the person that said the SK was using most his mana bar to taunt .... that sk was doing something horribly wrong! Usually a festering darkness or the likes will build up enough initial aggro that the SK can hold the entire battle. As for mana regen SK's also have Pact of Hate at 64 which is similar to necro's lich form and faster than KEI. They also have mental corruption which is a very nice mana tap. <br />
<br />
Overall, I have no complaints about my SK. Even as a support class I do get to tank ocassionally on raids (only were we need to build up serious hate on the mob generally). My weapons are 41dmg/31dly greatstaff of the four winds or 35/28 greater stormwatchers horn (which works out to more dmg due to the proc 100 lifetap proc), we do good damage and can even wip out the 49 necro pet where viable. <br />
<br />
Monks are great too but this has been my experience with my SK. Never have taunting issues EVER. I do have a monky friend with 1400ish AC, so there's no doubt they can tank PoS/PoV to some extent and some stuff in BoT should you desire to take that route.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">With reasonably attainable gear, the SK wins on all fronts.  If you have unlimited budget you may be able to equip a monk well enough to outdamage the SK handily, but you will still find keeping aggro very hard with the monk without sacrificing damage for aggro procs.  Monk usable, high damage weapons like SoFW are orders of magnitude more expensive than high damage SK weapons like windblades.  Plus the SK offers snare and lifetaps etc.  As a 2 boxer of a 62 monk, I have to admit it is sad that monks have become little more than expensive-to-twink diet rogues.<br />
<br />
Once you set foot in PoP, it becomes very hard to keep a tanking monk alive. Honestly, SK would be my first choice and then probably rogue before monk :/.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I don't mean to hijack the tread, but it seems that the SK vs. Monk question has been answered, and I have a related one.  I also went through this thought process when deciding what character to 2-box with my Shaman, and I decided on a Pally.  Not having much experience with SKs I just figured that the ability to self-heal, additional stackable buffs, stun and rez, would be a nice complement to the Shammy.  I also figured two &quot;good&quot; classes would be easier to play, although PoP makes this less of an issue (but still an issue, had my Iksar monk killed by a deputy when he got to close to the guards in Misty Thicket, doh).<br />
<br />
I realize that the Pally probably has lower DPS than the SK or Monk (except maybe against undead), but I figured with the dog and offensive spells of the Shammy what I really need is someone to shield him from the mobs, so he can slow, debuff and dot without getting killed.<br />
<br />
How do the rest of you feel about the SK vs. Pally question, which is a better 2-box mate for a Shaman?  I've got to admit, on more than one occassion I've imagined what it would be like to have an Ogre SK standing between my Shammy and the mobs.  But my Pally seems to do just fine.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sithrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">SK all the way. It's such a joy to be able to be able to slow and then pour on the poison DoTs and never have to worry about aggro. Not to mention, the ability to split spawns is great in PoP... plus snare. If I didn't have to deal with the utter horror of reflagging, I'd probably make an SK to 2-box with my shaman.<br />
<br />
Necro is an outstanding class as well, don't sell them short. Necro/shaman duo is great for non-summoning PoP mobs, just aggro kite all day long and rake in the xp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I hit buttons about as much with my shaman as my bard.  Maybe more.  And yeah, I twist 3-4 songs routinely on my bard (admittedly one usually drops a for a sec here and there when running a 4-twist even under the best circumstances).<br />
<br />
As a side to this - I think Shaman/SK/Bard is an AWESOME trio... :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jendain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">i'll say it again just to confirm.<br />
<br />
a monk needs good gear and defensive AA's to compare to a SK in tanking.<br />
SKs also get more naked HP, which needs to be augmented by more high-end gear on the monk side (but then you could get gear like that for the SK and still have the same HP difference duh).<br />
<br />
i have no problems holding aggro over tash/slow from a chanter in PoE where i've seen warriors lose aggro and struggle to get it back. but then your local SK doesn't either and he has utility spells (grouptap, snare) to further enhance his desirability (sp).<br />
<br />
if i were to start from scratch and look for a 2box/team partner for a shaman, i'd pick a SK or Paladin. Cultural armor dropped in price so much it's not even funny, that makes a nice base until you get thurg gear or ornate later. Monks don't get cultural armor so SK / Pal are choice again. easy bazaar equipping.<br />
<br />
that said, i still tank fine ;)</div></div><hr />

Silu, you're in a good guild but you must group w/ some really crappy tanks and some really awesome monks, based on your comments here and the other recent monk/sk thread.  I dropped a 60 monk post nerf to start 2 boxing w/ an sk and man oh man what a difference.  Granted my perspective is that of a casual bazaar player, not a raider, but sk smokes monk in nearly every single category.  The only advantages the monk has worth mentioning is:<br />
<br />
1) DPS - this is an advantage but not nearly so great as many people think.  My friend's 62 monk using an Amy staff parses only slightly ahead of my 62 sk w/ same buffs + pet using Windblade, and he has waaaaaay more aa's.<br />
<br />
2) Instant FD.  There's only been a few times where having a 1 sec FD has gotten me killed over an instant FD (remember, I don't raid).  In the event FD does fail on the sk, she has the hp/AC to take a serious beating anyways so who cares.<br />
<br />
Tanking, hp/AC, utility (snare, corpse summon, group hp/mana regen, group attack buff, awesome self healing, instant invis, ivu, etc... etc...) just flat out smoke the monk.<br />
<br />
I love(d) the monk class, but I don't know what I was thinking not using a spellbook initially.  Pure melee are so hosed.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>BomBoom Babatbatbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I chose monk and havent had any regrets..  I can see in PoP where an SK maybe more beneficial but again it comes down to str/weaknesses.  Monks have great DPS would say lvl 20 - 60 atleast 2x the DPS of an SK.  60-65 with windblade and spells/skeleton the sk closes the gap a little.  You sacrifice the ability to tank / taunt for damage.  IMO shamans tank just fine when they have to.  <br />
<br />
But it all comes down to preference.  Do you like SK's?  then choose SK.  Do you like Monks.. Choose a monk :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Thunder to kind of answer your questions. I have 65 pally my friend plays 62 sk. If an sk tells you they can hold aggro better than a pally they are just puffing up their chest. All i mean by that is take out better and say equal. If my sk friend or I the palidan want to hold aggro we do it. <br />
<br />
   My pally co do alot to save groups with group heal, heal over times and such, The SK can keep it from getting to that by the tools they have to pull. They really tank about the same. THe sk can tap in different ways to alleviate some of the damage i can stun it and let Q catch up or let my own heal cast. <br />
  <br />
    The difference i find at higher lvl that I cant do much about is the burst damage an SK can do than i cant do as a pally. Vs undead they get the same undead nuke. Vs live i dont have much to cast to do damage sk's can stack spears and have dot options when a mob needs to be dead now. Not to mention the Big ht they can drop with some aa's being spent.<br />
<br />
  But on busy pulls i can heal the shaman back up while he cans and dots to help increase his damage and my group heal with some aa and heal4 does a nice amount. With some aa i can complete heal for my LOH and get some nice group heal aa can use also. However if you want real burst dps palidan isnt for you. Even with slay undead 3 you may see some big 5k slay here and there but in terms of dps increase isnt as big as you might think. But i live through alot of **** with my shaman/palidan combo so i have fun while i play and for me thats the bottom line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>fyreniyce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">my main is a 65 monk, and i sometimes 2 box with a 65 shaman.  they are similarly equipped, and by no means uber.  but if i have a virtue, we can kill downstairs bot mobs fairly easily.  by keeping quiescence on me, i almost never need a heal. i malo on the pull, and slow immediately after. and almost never get agro on the shaman. even if i do, it's only a couple hits, which is not a big deal even with the shaman unvirtue'd.  i have cs3 ca3 and lr5 that's the extent of my defensive aa's<br />
<br />
but i also agree that it's not a huge difference either. if you like sk's, pick them instead.  but in this setup, i only have on caster, and it makes 2 boxing a lot simpler.  with hotkeys putting pet on mob when i cast slow, and hotkey'd heals. i don't even have to canni with c3 and horse. and throw in the occassional nuke/dot.<br />
of course i'm no expert, that's just how i do it. i'm caster ignorant</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">My monk made it to 61 before the mitigation changes, I then started my SK, and I am happy I did - he's 65 now, a few aa's and bazaar gear, a bit on the expensive side, but only bazaar, and I've tanked some heavy hitters with him that I would dread to tank with my monk.<br />
On the taunt side in HoH for example I can pull with malos, drop a festering and then slow, and the mob won't even notice there's someone slowing him, not to mention I can then add a dot or two, without even straining to keep aggro. For mana regen SK's are powerful as well, Mental corruption alone gives 100 mana per proc, Pact of hate is a lich form giving 15 mana per tick (for 32 health).<br />

What exactly did they do? Monk has almost as many hps and much higher ac than the SK. Just can't tank.<br />

Right now, I suppose I would go with the SK for the greater utility (snare + tanking).  I am not generally a fan of duoing with a melee class beyond 1st tier PoP though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I played a 61 Monk and a 25 or so SK. I also had a 63 Enchanter so when I speak of aggro, I speak from experience.<br />
<br />
Monk is close to a dead class. Post nerf the middle of the road types were truly fubared, whereas people in Time Guilds (like the guy with 6 pieces of Quarm gear) are still doing fine.  Sure you can wait to see what the new &quot;melee spells&quot; are gonna do, but if you think that SoE is going to have a seamless and problem free implementation I have swamp land for sale in the Gobi Desert.<br />
<br />
SK's generate HUGE aggro. In a standard HoH group the Lizard SK (From The Hand on Xev) was a pulling and aggro holding machine. (I was playing my Enchanter). I literally had to TRY and steal aggro from him because Tash + Slow wasn't doing it. <br />
<br />
As much as it pains me to say this: SK &gt; Monk. (Insofar as duo options).<br />
<br />
As far as DPS, shoot, you forget the Sk gets that skeleton. Two pets + SK + Shaman = dead stuff. Plus healing isn't too tough with their taps. (Which also p!ss off the MOB). The one down side is mana regen for the SK. I don't have any advice other than grab a KEI. <br />
<br />
Their Epic (if you are so inclined) is one group doable (from what I have read) at 65. It looks very cool as well if that is your cup of tea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">The higher level you get, the more an SK would over shadow a monk.<br />
<br />
Aside from all the reasons listed above, snare/FD is a far supieror splitting tool than insta-FD as long as mobs are snarable.<br />
<br />
To date, the SK is the only class who can hold agro with me putting 1200/tick worth of dots on a mob and STILL maintain dps (paladins have to stun/FoL non-stop, SKs actually have time to use combat spells and melee).<br />
<br />
When KEI isn't availible, SKs have their own Lich spell.<br />
<br />
The SK compliments a shaman perfectly in every way by providing us with every important ability we lack--snare, FD pull, and massive melee damage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
An sk I doubt I would be able to say the same about, there is an sk I group with often 1800AC 9k hps.. and basically plate classes are meant to take damage not to avoid it.. so you end up spending more mana on healing... so purely from a duoing/xp grinding standpoint I would go with monk because their dps is big.. <br />
<br />
now if you do ldon a lot then sks are definetly beter, those mobs don't hit hard, the AC makes a big difference and the aggro is really nice benefit. Also sometimes you can get 2 sks and they can can do their group mana thing.. (they have a spell that costs 200mana gives the group 200health 100mana.. so 2 of them can do it w/o loosing any mana chaining it..)..<br />
<br />
Another thing to keep in mind is fd pulling is easy but the monk shines in bad situations where they can mend up, and also they can FD while stunned something an sk cannot do..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">There is a misconception about SK DPS. It's very high in the hands of a competent SK. Pet + DoTs + Spears + melee = higher than warrior DPS. Not to mention supreme aggro generation and lock. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately superior mitigation, great avoidance, snare and great FD spells made monks obsolete in PoP. Not to mention almost warrior like HP, within a few precentages at the endgame.<br />
<br />
Choice is simple: SK all the way ... well, until they get nerfed and monks made gods again! <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Devnull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Yeah, for now an SK is a vastly superior choice to a monk. Anything a monk can do, an SK can do better.<br />
<br />
Pull? Sure, the SK's feign has a casting time, but snare and clicky invis more than make up for it. Pet pulling can be very useful as well.<br />
<br />
Tank? Not even close. It's like comparing Ranger healing to druid healing. SK wins easily. On a side note, monks do not have an avoidance advantage. This is a myth that's been repeated so often, it's taken on a life of its own. The only reason a monk gets hit less is because block fires about 8% of the time, while parry fires about 4% (when maxxed). <br />
<br />
DPS? A well-geared SK does surprisingly well here, and SK weapons are much easier to come by than the monk equivalents.<br />
<br />
Of course, the impending melee changes may fix this... if you still have any faith left in Sony (e.g. you don't play a melee class).</div></div><hr />

Only if you're considering evasive skills to be part of 'avoidance'. Most of the melee discussions consider avoidance to be how often a mob misses you... perhaps I should have simply said that monks don't get missed any more often than, say, a warrior.</div></div><hr />

Monks and BL's dont get parry. Block is what makes up for the lack of parry, so therefore the two are comparable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are correct, as far as a naked monk of level 'x' with the same AC as a naked warrior of level 'x' vs the exact same mob, they should get 'soandso tries to hit YOU, but misses!' the same amount, as far as I'm aware there are no different inherent defense tables between classes, its all skill/level based. I was more pointing out an annoying nitpicking point than anything. However, originally, monks did have an avoidance advantage. Pre-50 monk defense caps higher than anyone else IIRC, which gives them an avoidance advantage, pre-50, due to having a higher naked AC (more defense) than a warrior of the same level. This was negated with Kunark and the 252 cap, again, IIRC. Its been over a year since I played my monk and was on top of 'what skills when' type knowledge.<br />
<br />
In further response to your post however, I think its a little odd to not include defensive skills in a discussion about avoidance, since all defensive skills add to avoidance by 'mitigating' a hit into a miss/riposte and they are not static between the classes. <br />
<br />
Which is all completely off-topic. On topic, I say rogue. =p<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Another echo here for Shadowknight superiority over the monk.<br />
<br />
The monk has better dps at lower levels.  You can duel wield a 16/22 h2h weapon and a 14/20 (is that entwood stats?) 1h blunt for dps while the SK is limited to something like a windblade with it's 50/44 ratio.  The duel wield is going to do more damage.<br />
<br />
Once you get higher level, the DPS difference between the classes isn't going to be that huge.  Ornate Greatblades (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=25981) are going to the twinks in our guild nowadays.  Shadowknights have a pet that adds to DPS.  Their spear spells add ok dps too.  SKs have lifetaps and dots they can cast for more dps as well.  And if you give a SK c5, minimal FT, and Mental Corruption buff, a SK keeps from going oom.  Monks get REBB (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=25220) for real dps in comparison, and flying kick.  It fairly well balances out.<br />
<br />
So what's each got at 60+ where you'll be spending most of your EQ existance?<br />
Monk has slightly better dps.<br />
Monk has stonestance (nearly immortal for 8 seconds) or voiddance (immortal for 8 seconds longer reuse) + mend for instant heal.<br />
Monk has instant feign.<br />
Monk has sneak.<br />
<br />
Shadowknight has instant invis circlet which lessens the imporance of sneak.<br />
SK has harmshield for 18 seconds which makes you 99% immortal which lessens the importance of stonestance and mend for emergencies.<br />
SK has the ability to bash mobs that are level 55 and lower to interupt spells.<br />
SK has snare (which is good in it's own right to stop runners, but also is vastly more effective for general mob feign splitting)<br />
SK can get super harm touch for ~8k DD every 40 minutes (very effective on gaters and named/boss mobs)<br />
SK has the ability to heal himself in combat very effectively with Lifetaps, Lifetap damage over time, and Lifetap procs.<br />
SK has superior ability to mitigate damage.<br />
SK has massive massive taunt ability.<br />
SK has a minor group heal + mana spell to help entire group effectiveness.<br />
<br />
To sum up quickly though:<br />
-monk has better dps.<br />
-shadowknight has very effective taunt spells, self heal spells, superior pulling utility, and more utility spells.</div></div><hr />

It's a useful differentiation when you're parsing. It shows that there is no innate advantage to simply being a monk when it comes to being missed. Lots of folks will hype up 'monk avoidance' when discussing class balance, without ever realizing that it amounts to Block firing ~8% of the time while Parry works ~4% of the time (witness posts in this thread and comparable discussions).</div></div><hr />

True, which is why I used past tense. However, the 'myth' of superior monk raw avoidance (not block-parry/dodge/riposte based) is based in fact, it just dissappears post 50.<br />

*shrug* As long as its pointed out that the monk's current 'superior avoidance' is solely due to having block instead of parry (which we've done quite nicely in this thread), it's six of one half dozen of the other as far as I'm concerned, they will get less 'soandso hits YOU for xxx damage' than a same AC/level parry based class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">well since I have boxed with BOTH a monk and SK I'll add my 2c, though most of it has probably been covered already.<br />
<br />
the big factors that I compared were:<br />
monk is EASIER to play, being a non caster and that makes it a good partner for a caster 2boxing.  they are also better DPS.  easier FD.  they totally lack utility, but if you are boxing with a shaman you get a boatload of utility with the shaman.<br />
<br />
SK is definitely more challenging and more work to play than the monk.  worse dps or harder to achieve dps til the end game, harder to gear well, but a better tank partner that can hold agro and take a beating once you get into really hard mobs.  substantial survivability and utility.<br />
<br />
after 2boxing a good deal with my main 65 well geared shaman and a 60 monk...  and using a well geared friend's 65 SK to compare, I ultimately chose to go with my own SK over the monk.  I truly like and miss the monk, but aside from the easy dps of the monk I was able to do a lot more of what I wanted to do by partnering with the SK.  the dps was very frustrating at times even with shaman goodness buffs for dps increases until finally getting a really good 2h.  it's not very hard to get decent weapons for a monk that will let you deal good dps.<br />
<br />
<br />
in the end I'd say it's about what fits your style and as well what sort of things do you want to be able to do with your duo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
note these are very great geared people so if you are only buying the gear then it definetly might be different.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Shadrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Ok, I have a decent amount of experience with both Shadowknights and Monks.  My main was a human monk for a long time, and I created a shadowknight a couple of years ago.  I'll speak mostly to the gear issue, which a previous poster brought up.<br />
<br />
My ogre shadowknight couldn't be agnostic (like my idiot warrior), so I have a full set of fulvous cultural armor.  For those of you who haven't checked that out, it's pretty decent armor, especially for shadowknights, because each piece gives hp and mana in addition to VERY decent AC.  All in all, it's very decent armor and is EASY to find.  Average price per piece, maybe 4k on Ayonae Ro.<br />
<br />
For weapons, I have a war marshal's bladed staff for 2hs and a sceptre of lightnight for 1hb - 25/25.  The WMBS is (I think) 31/28 - just about the best droppable 2hs in the game.  I think I paid about 7k for it - they're always available in the bazaar for that price.  I paid 2k for that sceptre of lightnight - it's so cheap because it's sk/pal only.  That and a shield is a nice tanking combo for when I need the extra AC.<br />
<br />
So I was able to fully outfit my shadowknight with extremely nice weapons and armor for maybe 50k.  Throw in another 50k for slots the cultural amor won't cover (rings, earrings, etc.).  That's 100k for some of the better droppable gear for a shadowknight - mostly better gear than I can get for my stupid agnostic ogre warrior at 10 times the cost.  Almost all the pieces give me relevant stat boosts and raw hp/mana.<br />
<br />
Now, let's look at the same situation for a monk.  My poor human monk has no cultural armor.  He has to share armor with two wis classes, druids and beastlords.  The majority of his armor is wearable by caster classes and is geared toward them.  I think Darrick's wis is about 180 - that comes in real handy  :rolleyes:  And about 800 raw mana on top of that  :mad:  Most of the really good monk items are OBSCENELY expensive, like flayed barbarian skin leggings for 150k.  There must be a lot of monk twinks out there, which makes no sense because we suck, but the gear prices are just stupid.  A 50k fungi is a REQUISITE for a monk, so figure I've conservatively spent 350k on my monk's gear to get him a decent number of hps/resists.  But, his wisdom and mana are also nicely boosted  :confused: <br />
<br />
On to weapons - any long-time monk's favorite topic.  The best tradeable monk weapon is the staff of flowing waters - I can't remember the damage/delay but it's quite decent.  Something like 40/33.  Comparable to the WMBS for the shadowknight, actually a little better.  If you can find one for less than 100k you're doing extremely well on Ayonae Ro.  Even the old standby, the tranquil staff at 29/30 from Kunark is still going for 15k.  A good 1-hander combo is the copper hammer of striking (about 15k) plus the waning light katar (about 20k).  Monk weapons are so stupidly overpriced it isn't even funny.  Figure on spending 50k plus on weapons or pulling your hair out waiting for Raster for our retarded epic quest.<br />
<br />
So once you figure in the cost of gear, you're probably looking at spending 4-5 times as much outfitting the monk as the shadowknight in comparable gear.  <br />
<br />
Once you've gotten that little investment out of the way, expect the shadowknight to outperform the monk in almost every conceivable way.  The nerf to monk mitigation was absolutely vicious.  Without stellar gear, your monk won't be able to take nearly the beating that a shadowknight can, and the dps difference isn't an issue if your monk died halfway through the fight.  His hp will be lower, his utility is zero, and his taunt is dependant almost entirely upon weapon procs, making it completely unreliable.  Monks benefit greatly from shaman buffs, however, so it greatly increases a monk's power to group with a shaman.  It just helps the shadowknight almost as much, so that point is probably a wash.<br />
<br />
If I had to do it over again, I'd have left the monk in the closet and levelled up my shadowknight.  In a duo with a shaman, I think they're clearly a better option.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong - my main was a monk for a long time and I love the class.  But SOE has just dorked things up so much right now I have no desire to play him any more.  MAYBE the upcoming melee patch will address the monk's shortcomings, but I'm not too optimistic based on what's coming out of the test server right now.  We monks have begun referring to the new melee &quot;USE YOUR SPECIAL ACTION BUTTON RIGHT NOW BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE!&quot; feature as &quot;whack-a-mole.&quot;<br />
<br />
Either combo is quite powerful and fun; I've two-boxed extensively with both.  I just the shadowknight is a better option, in large part because of the easier/cheaper access to really good gear.  Plus, ogres are much more handsome that humies  :p <br />

The Monk does good DPS and can tank Old World blues just fine as long as they are slowed. Even unslowed Old World blues are quite doable when fully buffed. However, almost any PoP mobs outside of PoJ, especially high blues and whites+, are a totally different story.

I didn't catch whether you said you were running both characters yourself or not.  I love monks, but they are hideously expensive to equip well.  A well played monk is still a very nice addition.  But, if your going to run both yourself, I'd recommend the sk over a monk.  Simply due to snare.  A snared mob incoming gives you the time to malo/slow on the mob before your attention MUST be focused on the tank again (for a moment at least).  And the snared mob is likely to keep aggro on the sk.<br />
Sk snares, runs back to camp, hits autoattack.  Switch to shaman, malo(s), slow, switch back to sk.  Sk hits casts next aggro spell, switch back to shaman.  Shaman casts dot, switch, etc etc etc.</div></div><hr />
