<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Arborealus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I would like to host a Coldain Ring Night this Saturday.  There are a significant number of members with various levels of the Coldain Insignia Rings 1st -7th who would like to work on their rings.  There are a significant number of people interested in beginning the Coldain Insignia Ring quests.<br />
<br />
This is your chance!!!<br />
<br />
I would like 2 solid groups to commit to 4 hours for the event.  This should give us time to accomplish 2 of each of the major quests (if the mobs are up when we get there).  If we are lucky with Gloradin and we have someone ready we may do one 8th Ring Quest (Orc War).<br />
<br />
If you are interested in participating and able to participate at this time please post Level and Class.  If you have Coldain Insignia Ring please include which ring you currently have in the post.  If you do not have a Coldain Insignia Ring but would like to start one please post to that effect.  If you have any pieces for the Coldain Quest (i.e. Pelts, Invasion Plans etc) please post what items you have.  All members of KoE and Petitioners are welcome to attend...Guests will be considered on an as needed basis.<br />
<br />
IMPORTANT:  Please understand that due to the nature of these quests not everyone who attends will get a Coldain Ring.  It is my intention, if we have sufficient interest, to make this a repeating event and get everyone up to the level of Ring they desire.  If you want a guarantee of a first Coldain Ring please bring 2 HQ Tundra Kodiak Pelts, 2 HQ Cougar Pelts and have your Tailoring skill at a minimum of 68 and I will show you how to start the quest.  Otherwise I will be happy to obtain the first ring and multi it to you with the second quest as mob spawn allows.<br />
<br />
What I would like to accomplish:[list=1]<br />
 Ideally do 2 of each spawn linked quest below the 8th and one 8th Ring Quest (Orc War) mobs permitting<br />
 Attack targets of opportunity as they present to obtain quest related items<br />
 Encourage interest in an ongoing periodic Coldain Insignia Ring quest night Monthly or perhaps even weekly if there is interest and commitment<br />
 Include as many Members and petitioners as possible (These are very good quests for assessing petitioner abilites and working on rapid combat adjustment skills) <br />
 Have Fun!!! If you haven't participated in these quests yet they are among the most enjoyable quests in the game.  They are fast paced, dynamic, and down right hiliarious at times.<br />
[/list=1] <br />
<br />
Meeting Place: Eastern Wastes at Tain Hammerfrost (Just over the first hill west of the bridge).  Note please don't speak to Tain when you arrive or you will get a very nasty suprise and guarantee a 4 hour delay on the 4th quest.<br />
<br />
Meeting Time: 5pm US Central Standard Time<br />
<br />
Who May Attend:  KoE members, petitioners and guests as needed  (minimum of 40th level)<br />
<br />
Must Have: One 55+ Main Tank, One 50+ Cleric<br />
<br />
I encourage you to learn as much as possible about the quests in advance.  Here (http://forums.interealms.com/ranger/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=21555) is an excellent walk through for the Coldain Insignia Ring Quests.  I will also be happy to send you a slightly more printer friendly version if you will send a request to me: arborealus@jam.rr.com<br />
<br />
The Ultimate Goal:<br />

<br />
Addendum:  For all you Robe wearing types whose fancy may be less tickled by the above ring.  Note that we will be wandering far and wide over Eastern Wastes and would certainly not be averse to capping Griffin's, Bunnies, etc. for the Coldain Shawl Quest</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chadias Spirithealer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hey there Arbor <br />
<br />
I would like to attend if I may. Here is the info you need:<br />
<br />
52 Druid<br />
Tailoring - 0 LOL I will start working on that asap<br />
Rings so far: None<br />
Parts aquired so far: None ( will get pelts together by then and have spares I hope for anyone who does not have any )<br />
<br />
I hope I got it all =)<br />
<br />
Thanks for doing this Arbor, I wanted to get this going and now is my chance so thank you!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hoarmurath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hello there!<br />
<br />
Count me in for Saturday, I would love to help out with ring quests for people, although I have no real desire at this time to work on them for myself.<br />
<br />
I do, however, need Snow Griffin eggs for my 3rd shawl quest, just in case we stumble across any Snow Griffins (which I can only seem to do when I am *not* looking for them).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Arsecn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Great idea Arb!  I am also at 0 in tailoring...  just being lazy, and i suppose i will go look online, but any pointers on raising the tailoring skill to 68?  Oh yeah, I plan on being there :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kindonini</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Howdy! :) The hubby and I would love to tag along and help you out. We currently have no desire to do the quests ourselves, but only wish to be there to help those that do. <br />
<br />
I will be there as Kindonini - 50 druid (for now, I regularly alternate between 49 and 50 ROFL) but the hubby says to let us know if you need a 48 pally(Neverflee) or a 51 shammy(Darkcast) more, as he loves his little guy and big guy equally.<br />
<br />
I will be available for ports as well, just give me a /tell at any time during the day if you will be needing a ride and we'll work something out. If I'm not on as Kindonini try Kinchantress.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>adrianis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i am a 45 shaman i am not in the guild yet but i am trying to join up may i come with you all to help i dont want ring just wanna help and get to know some more about KoE and their members. email me at trexemal@hotmail.com and tell me if im an appropriate level i really wanna help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Adelrune Argenti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Mexl would like to come along. Currently, he has no rings. However, he does have some invasion plans. He is currently sitting at level 47. I hope you can fit me in a group.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kilrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">ARGGG!!!<br />
<br />
I would love to do this but it is unlikely that I can make that time. :(<br />
<br />
I currently have ring 3 and all the parts to ring 5. Need to do the Tain quest and I'd be on my 6th ring after that is completed. If I can't attend I hope there are more of these. If I can attend I'll let ya know in game either today (Friday) or Saturday morning if there is still room. Great idea Arb!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Drolgin Steingrinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'll try to see if I can make it :)<br />
<br />
Have the first ring, have the knife made and the invasion plans ready.<br />
<br />
When I know more about my schedule, I'll post here - great idea, Arbo :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Infinate</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">This devoted lvl 50 cleric is at your services. I'll be there with pelts in hand for the 1st ring quest. One question on these questings though. At anytime do I need a container slot available?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Chadias Spirithealer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">we are having problems with our connection =( I couldnt stay connected too long sooooo we shall see. =( Also, since that ring isnt really for a Druid or caster type if I can get on I will just help out and not actually do that quest for me. Maybe later with my warrior though =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Arborealus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">At anytime do I need a container slot available? <br />
<br />
Nope, you won't a free general inventory slot</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kindonini</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I just wanted to take a moment to say Thank You! to everyone for a great time and for the Frozen Orb. I don't want to gush too much, but we (Neverflee and I) had soooooooo much fun! Count us in for the next time!<br />
