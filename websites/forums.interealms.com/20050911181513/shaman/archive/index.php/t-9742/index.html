<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As EQ gets more sophisticated my computer is starting to struggle. it is fine in the old world zones, and most of Kurnak and even Velious is not too bad, but in Luclin and PoP it is very slow and the graphics are very &quot;clunky&quot; - in places like Umbral Plains for example, it is almost unworkble because I have to look at the ground all the time....So, it is time to do some upgrading. I don't have a lot of cash to spend, so I need to prioritise.<br />
<br />
I have plenty of Hard disk space still available, and I have sufficient RAM (512Mb). It is really a toss up between CPU and Video card.<br />
<br />
Currently using a 800MHz PIII CPU and a 32MB GeForce2 MX200 graphics card. I am guessing that most of my problems are being caused by the graphics card, but I am no techie!<br />
<br />
If, as I suspect, I should upgrade the graphics card, what do you guys suggest? I don't want the latest and greatest, because that will cost too much, but I do want a significant upgrade.<br />
<br />
If I need to upgrade the CPU, I will get whatever I can get in PIII, because I don't think the M/B will support P4.<br />
<br />
Any advice gratefully received.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gruog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">At this point you are really looking at a mb, cpu and video card all at the same time to get any significant performance increase.   With a p3 I am going to assume you have at least a dma/66 hard drive so no need to worry about that (speed means more than space) and the ram you have is going to be sdram which highly limits what upgrading you can do.<br />
<br />
I would recommend a MSI K7T Turbo 2 motherboard it can handle 3 sticks of ram and any amd cpu and cost less than $80.  An 1800+  Athlon XP will run $75-ish range and provide plenty of power.  Always buy the boxed processor over an oem for the fan included and 3-year warranty vs 30 day.<br />
<br />
Video card is a little trickier.  EQ really likes nvidia cards over radeons but there are no decent budget nvidia cards.  If you are just talking money go for a radeon 8500LE which is plenty of power for less than $90.    If you play primarily EQ and no other games then you will want to spend the extra on  an nvidia card.  A Ti4200 will run about $130-150.</div></div><hr />
