<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I had a great site with a list of when mobs spawned after serverup, and respawn times. But I didn't bookmark it, apparently. <br />
<br />
Anyone got a URL? And specifically, will the Emp be up after patch today?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>darkark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think Emp was around 12 hours. It definantly wasn't straight away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jeis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">EMP is usually 0-8hrs after server up, and he is on a respawn timer of 6.5days +/- 6hrs. Basically same as VT. (used to be on server up and was 7days, but blocking of guilds getting to EMP stopped that)<br />
<br />
I used to have that link and will try to see if i can find it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks. I had a great site up at one time, it listed named mobs through PoP, with time up after server up, time up after last kill... I can't believe I didn't bookmark it. Time to search history (aargh).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Found it: http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?postid=83<br />
<br />
Interested in others, though, if anyone has one.<br />
<br />
Ssra spawns excluding AL/Rhag cycle - levels vary, 0-12 hr spawn, 6.5-7.5 day respawn<br />
<br />
Bummer, but in keeping with other posts, so probably accurate.</div></div><hr />
