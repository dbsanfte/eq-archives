<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Badz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have talked some friends into playing EQ.  I play on the TP server but I dont have any alt slots open.  Also, I want enjoy EQ again from the beginning with no twinking, etc.<br />
<br />
Since TP is the only server I have played on, I wanted to ask you what server you think we should start on?  I was thinking one of the older servers since there would not be so many lower level toons taking camping sights.  We will be a group of 5 so looking for others to make a group will not be an issue.<br />
<br />
Thank you for any suggestions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not real sure if your logic is correct regarding older servers ... I play on Karana, and there are STILL a ton of new characters in the game, especially with the advent of Frogloks and Berserkers. My housemate plays a level 35 Ranger, and even at her level, getting camps is hard. I don't know as though there's a real good way to pick a server. When I chose Karana, it was because that was where I had the most friends. If I had to choose again, I'm not entirely sure I'd have chosen Karana.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">just depends, maelin has a pretty low population all around, which can be good and bad.  It's probably going to suck at lower levels trying to get groups and whatnot.  I would say that the population of the server rests highly with the people level 60 and up.. mostly 65.  You can do and go almost everywhere and find open free areas, and it's pretty damn easy to find a pickup raid on just about anything, elementals/VT included.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh well, I like there, and the newb population is rather low with a fair amount of texans around to keep ya company.<br />
<br />
Though hmmm, rumor I'm hearing is Endorian, a time guild on luclin has a fair amount of austinites if that interests ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grixx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">the Test server.  There are probably just a few hundred (if that) that play there.  Peaceful, quiet, challenging.  Camps abandoned for miles.<br />

No, not test.  Test is a cess pool of some of the worst people ever to log into this god forsaken game.  The server is constantly down, plauged with problems and they item wipe every 3 months with a char wipe every 6 months.<br />
<br />
Seriously though, test is alright...till you start raiding.  The server is usually dropped on fridays and without some mobs being server up mobs your hurting for targets.  There are frequent bugs, moreso than you'll ever see on live.  We haven't been able to get a solid run on time for....better than a month now because of beta and now a current problem with the zone, apparently exclusive to test.  I've presonally lost all the gear off howjan x2, 1/2 the gear on my wizard once (why 1/2 i've no clue) and 1/2 the gear off a buddy's cleric once (again no idea why 1/2).  I had to eat one with howjan, and got a rollback from the other.  I ate it with my wizard...and the cleric I had to do some serious favor calling to get the **** back (I wouldn't have had it been the shm or wiz).  Dev treats us well but they are busy with their own stuff and arn't always around.  Right now I'm so pissed off about time I could spit fire, but they've an expansion to deal with...and it's only test.<br />
<br />
If you want to relax and kick back for some casual solo play or if you have a tight knit group of buddys that are coming over test is ok and would probably fit your needs....but if your looking for high end raiding and progression, test is definitly not where you want to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Maelin isn't too bad, even though it's not the server I play on.  Not too crowded, really, and it's a standard blue server.<br />
<br />
I play on Fironia Vie myself, and... Well, i really like it.  A lot of people roleplay (if thats your thing), but theres also a ton who do not because they are lured here by the thought of no no-drop items (Except for epics/epic quest related items)<br />
<br />
The downside is you can only have one character per account on Fironia Vie, so pick well.<br />
<br />
Either of those servers I think are pretty decent.   You'll meet a lot of jerks everywhere, though..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I agree with Detton...I'm on FV too, rather low population, with lack of no drop stuff it's very easy to nicely gear up a new character pretty cheaply. And while you're going to have twinks everywhere, the fact that you can only have one toon per account does mean less then other servers, so plenty of room at the low end. Even at the high end, there's room, as only 2 guilds are in time, with one just getting in like a month or two ago, and the other just killing quarm for the first time last week or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You may consider Venril Sathir.   I'm not sure what you want from the game, but camps here are always open.   Theres a catch.  Most everyone is euro.  Which means everyone is sleeping when i play.  The only american guild has just killed aow.<br />
The other catch is, your trapped.  No transfer, ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gegen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Stay away from xegony, more drama and problems than Courtney Love and Tommy Lee put together!Heck I cause some of the drama myself I should know! :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Slqmdooley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If you and your pals are starting out - the new server seems to be a safe bet - Morden Rasp<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I've played a bit on FV and found it to be quite fun. lots of newbs compared to torv and not many power levelers so ya can camps not taken up by one guy power leveling his twink.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">pvp is the way to go!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sullon One</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">there are about 4 people that play on SZ<br />
<br />
most zones are empty most of the time<br />
<br />
dear god i love my server :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Muggum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I play on Maelin..transfered there and I like it. People are friendly, fun and at first there was hardly no low to mid level people but that's changing now. It's not too hard at atll to find xp groups at any level now. Anyway, just my 2cp worth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">a different take would be an older server with plenty of traders and stuff for sale.<br />
<br />
i play on Prexus, and can't log on my trader at midnight central US, because there are already 550 traders.  while that might be a bit much, if you want to gear up in the bazaar, an older server with more traders may be the way to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Back when Kane Bayle (think its a euro server) started up about a year and a half ago, my wife and I started new characters there (both dual boxing), most zones were empty, but from time to time we would find some other people to adventure with.  <br />
<br />
Some uber guild moved there and powered to 65 at the time.  Good stuff in the bazaar was plentiful and cheap.  I had an enchanter as my main, did the stien quest for money and outfitted all 4 of our characters with the profits from that alone.<br />
<br />
Not sure if its changed much now (started playing the old characters again on Prexus when PoP was released), but I enjoyed the server a lot starting over.</div></div><hr />
