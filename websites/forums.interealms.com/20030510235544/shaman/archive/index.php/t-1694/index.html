Underbulks were rarely blue to me at 52.  almost always light blue<br />
Stonegrabbers were rarely light blue, usually green at 52<br />
Fiends were were usually light blue at 52<br />
<br />
Therefore I expect they would be blue to you at 45.  well separated, should be easy enough to avoid adds.<br />
<br />
This is all up near the named shissar that has the skelly slaves.  He is hard at 50, but very doable.  by 51 he is routine.  His slaves were almost all blue to me at 50, almost all light blue at 53.  I pulled underbulks and stuff while waiting for repops.<br />
<br />
Another place I really like is Grimling Forest   NOT the Grimlings in the camps!!  The roaming Grimlings are melee types, and the wolves and bears are good hunting, too.  The Southern side of zone has lower level mobs, working up to stuff on North side that still cons blue to me at 54 2 out of 3 times.<br />
<br />
<br />
And Dawnshroud Peaks has good stuff for your level.  <br />
<br />
Scarlet Desert?  I think you may want hunting partners at 45, and it is not a good pickup zone on my server.<br />
<br />
Good hunting!</div></div><hr />
