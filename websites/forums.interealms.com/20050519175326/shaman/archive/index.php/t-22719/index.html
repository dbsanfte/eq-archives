<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A very large number of Shadowknight spells, including many of our most used spells, are on disease resist.  When it comes to adding resist adjustments to the spells, our spells are generally equvilant to other hybrids' (whose spells are on other resists).  <br />
For easiest comparison, look at SK spear spells vs. ranger nukes (Ice or Fire - it makes no difference).  <br />
<br />
Disease is the only resist that is not debuffed by malo spells.  Although another line exists to debuff disease, it is rarely used for a number of reasons.  This puts shadowknights at a disadvantage in relation to other hybrids (and to an extent, all other classes), as our spells have equvilant resist adjusts, but the resist is debuffed less, meaning we are resisted more.  <br />
<br />
As a result of this, many SK's have been campaigning for resist adjustments to be added/altered for our spells or for an AA to innately add resist mods to our spells or various other things along those lines.  This is the wrong approach, however - a bandaid fix.  It would then mean our spells are potentially less resisted if the Malicious Decay line is used, and is simply the wrong approach to fixing the problem regardless.  <br />
<br />
To fix the problem is quite simple - add disease to the Malo spells and remove or replace the Malicious Decay line.  This isn't nerf to shamans - it's a boon, as you would achieve with one spell what currently requires two.  It also fixes one of the major gripes of the SK community.  A win-win situation for both classes.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The only noteworthy problem I can forsee is with the stacking of the new OoW spells - namely Putrid Decay, Scent of Midnight, and Malo (assuming it were to debuff disease).  Currently, Putrid Decay and Scent of Midnight both debuff Disease and Poison, stack with Malo, but not eachother or Malicious Decay.  This seems like it might be another problem, though (perhaps you've discussed it - I havn't had a chance to follow other class's boards as closely as I'd like lately due to RL schedule and computer problems).  <br />
<br />
Traditionally, necro Scent spells have stacked with all other resist debuffs (and debuffed fire also) and the Decay line has debuffed only disease, thus the above marks a notworthy and seeminly unwarrented change for both spell lines.  It also means that disease will potentially fall further behind still without the ability to stack the Decay and Scent lines.  Also, in the absence of a Necro, it will give poison a potential advantage over the other resists.  <br />
<br />
I'm not going to suggest anything regarding that issue at this time though.  <br />
<br />
EDIT:  Did some searching and it appears that it has been discussed, with no conclusive results...  Guess we'll have to leave that in the unknown category for now, unless someone wants to link something more revealing than what I've found.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Note that it could be argued that the fact that the Decay line is unresistable starting before the introduction of unresistable Malo spell would be a problem, but I can't forsee it being a serious one.  If it were deemed a noteworthy issue, it could be fairly easily resolved by leaving the lines separate pre-60, however.</div></div><hr />

... i just realised youre cut out to be an excellent shaman.  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Peace  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The part below that explains why.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Slein is a very productive member of the SK community and is a very helpful fellow with varied parses, equipment threads etc. I peruse his posts carefully and always take his advice when it comes to anything I do with my SK, thus making me a suck up :p <br />
Anyway, as a 2 boxer of a SK and shaman I do have a problem with being able to keep up the Decay line for debuffing mobs when my Sk is tanking. Malos is difficult enough to keep in my big 8, adding Malicious Decay is downright difficult if not impossible 90% of the time.<br />
I do see it as a unfair &quot;advantage&quot; of sorts that other classes have (especially hybrids) when Shaman toss a Malos out on a mob. It makes most hybrid nukes land more often, for full damage more often.<br />
I would be glad to see this added to our top 10 list at some point, I dont see it as a burning issue though, more of a convenience issue than anything, but I do think that its one that does need to be addressed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hail,<br />
<br />
I think it would be wonderful it Shadowknights put &quot;Adding disease debuff to Malos&quot; as one of their top ten issues. :D <br />
<br />
As it stands now, while I certainly sympathize with the SK's situation, I don't see it worth Shaman campaigning for this to be 'fixed'.  We would definitely appreciate an improvment to the Malo line in order to help those casting Disease based spells (including ourselves), but it isn't a pressing enough issue for our class at the moment to be in our own top ten list.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">What Frekkels said ... I only wish the top 10 SoE dialoge process was different so we have items like this included.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Adding Disease resist to Malo/Malos would be nice, as long as such an addition didnt add to the mana cost or cast time of the spell.  However such a change is not one that I would 'campaign' for untill we have had a few other issues addressed.<br />
<br />
I dont use disease based spells in exp groups.  My disease dots take far too long to be of any use in a exp situation.  If a group member is having difficulty landing disease based spells, I make the offer that I will be happy to put Maicious up, but it will take the spot of FA in my spell line up.  I leave it up to the group then, whether they want to have a resist or two in a spell or lose FA.  Most times my group will opt for FA.<br />
<br />
In a raid situation its not a problem to keep MD up, as I spend 90% of my time in debuff mode and the other 10% in rez buff mode.  Trash mobs might get a MD, as most trash dies too fast to bother with the time or expense of slow/malo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I wasn't really looking for shamans to campaign forsuch a change as I am looking for shaman support for the issue.  It's something that causes a considerable imbalance for SK's, and it's one of the most highly complained about issues facing our class (beyond the obvious tanking defeciency) - it's something that most SK's would actively support/persue, and that may even find it's way onto our top-10 list at some point, but by the nature of it being a change to shamans in order to benefit SK's (and other classes, including shamans also, but to a lesser extent) I didn't want to do much without first putting it up for debate here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jalelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If you want to get an improvement made to one of our spells that will make us more valuable to the group that you are in, then I think we should wish you the best and hope you succeed.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">They should have always been together. Its annoying to have one unresistable resisted debuff seperate from the other 4.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Some comments:<br />
<br />
1) Since the Malo line tends to get cut-and-pasted into the Malosinia line, this gives Mages an ability they never add before, which has been previously restricted to shaman.  A pretty minor point, I agree.<br />
<br />
2) The argument that a group with a shaman debuffing with Malo handicaps shadowknights could easily and logically be extended to an argument that a group with an enchanter debuffing with tash handicaps rangers, and therefore tash should be upgraded to debuff fire and cold as a ranger balance issue.  Then druids complain they only debuff fire, and that this is handicapping the rangers in their group.  Repeat for bards, and anyone else I've missed with a partial resist debuff.  I don't think I'm exaggerating too much here, I've seen many class balance flamewars start from a small upgrade to another class.<br />
<br />
3) From my experience, outside of 100% DR mobs, disease is already the least resisted spell type out there.  It's possible that spears were put on this resist for that reason.<br />
<br />
4) Lastly, this doesn't address more a fundamental problem, which is that if a mob isn't extremely susceptible to disease, it tends towards 100% DR.  100% DR mobs seem to be entirely too common out there, which affects shaman, SK spears, and necros very significantly.  Most of Veksar falls into this category, as do Crypt of Decay, Netherbians in Umbral Plains, Geonids and Sentient armors in wakening lands, that sort of thing.    Upgrading Malo won't affect that problem, 1000 DR - 50 is still 950 DR.  :)<br />
<br />
In short, I think it'd be neat if Malo did all five resists at once, but I also think that focusing on that isn't the right way to fix the problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Really if/when Sk's ask for this it'll come down to adding/changing shaman spells, addidng a resist mod to thier spears or SK's getting the Decay line themselves.  as much as any SK doesn't want to have to be a debuffer, they'd take it as better than nothing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">1 - Mages being able to debuff disease is fine - there's really no balance reason they shouldn't.<br />
<br />
2 - Malo not debuffing disease is very different from tash and other specific debuffs.  Malo debuffs everything EXCEPT disease, tash is specific to magic, and there are equivilant debuffs for other individual resists.  The same goes for druids' fire debuff and the like.  It's a simple fact that disease is debuffed less than any other resist on raids, and that fact is a handicap to shadowknights, and to a much lesser extent, shamans and necros.  <br />
<br />
3 - Not really true.  <br />
<br />
4 - Basically the same as #3... aside from not being entirely accurate, the fact that there are too many disease immune mobs in the world is another issue, but a content issue rather than a class issue.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Adding a resist mod to spears is not a good plan.  It's a bandaid fix to a deeper problem.  It would also mean that, in situations where the Decay line is used, shadowknights would then be MORE powerful than other hybrids' nukes, and that's as imbalanced as the current situation, not to mention that spears are only one line among many disease-based SK spells.  <br />
<br />
Giving SK's the decay line isn't good either - we already have a plethora of spells we're essentially required to keep memmed 100% of the time.  It's not fair for us to be required to keep another spell memmed in order to achieve equality with other classes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I think the big difference is that those classes don't have those abilities period. Shaman have an unresistable disease debuff, it just doesn't get used 99% of the time because:<br />
<br />
A) Don't have enough spell gems to justify keeping it up <br />
<br />
B) Barely have time to cast malos' and slow now before the mobs die better yet another debuff<br />
<br />
I do agree we have more pressing issues, but hey if the SK's want to take care of this one for us I'm all for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">BAH!   Ye've all got it backwards.   Add the other 4 resist debuffs to Malicious and ditch Malo :P<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Darjeelingx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Got my support.<br />
<br />
I think the person who wrote the original malaise line just forgot about disease. Or he could only get 4 resists onto one spell.<br />
<br />
I think it is a shaman issue as well as SK. Having disease on malx means we wont need to mem another spell to help VP work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>temuchintehkhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">yeah slein's very active on sk.org<br />
<br />
I play both, post on both.  ill be honest I like malicious decay because it's ****ing fast casting... for mobs I know beforehand I'll be grummusing I always make space for it because it's like tash before forlorn deeds on my chanter, it casts so fast and is so cheap that you can't really compare it to malo<br />
<br />
yeah I have no problem with adding -DR to malos line but am strongly opposed to getting rid of malicious decay... superfast and guaranteed disease debuff is situationally important enough for dis-based slows that it's important</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I've long wanted disease added to malo/malos, it would really help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
RP reason: Mages work with the elements.  They should be able to debuff fire, magic, and cold.  They shouldn't be able to debuff disease, that's part of the physical realm which is a shamanic forte.  <br />
<br />
Cynical reason: Debuffing disease is unique to the shaman class.  Giving it to another class dilutes that small advantage shaman have.<br />
<br />
It's a simple fact that disease is debuffed less than any other resist on raids, and that fact is a handicap to shadowknights, and to a much lesser extent, shamans and necros.<br />
<br />
This is not an issue with the spells.  The spell to debuff disease exists.  This is an education issue - people know that Malo helps wizards, they don't know that the decay line helps shadowknights - or they may simply not care.<br />
<br />
For that matter, even if the decay spells ARE cast on a raid, DR is still debuffed less than any other resist.  Malos / Malosinia stacks with Tash and HOS.  The Ro spells stack on top of all of that.  I may be mistaken here, but I'm pretty sure the only thing besides the decay spells that debuffs DR is Tuyen's Chant of the Plague.<br />
<br />
If you really want equality in DR debuffing compared to other resists, you should be campaigning to get MD a nice, say, 150 resist debuff.  Which I'd be all for, by the way.<br />
<br />
<br />
3 - Not really true.<br />
<br />
I presented an opinion as &quot;in my experience&quot; - how can you say &quot;not true&quot; to an opinion based on experience?  I've been casting disease based spells since 1999, I believe them to be less resisted than other damage types.  If you have actual data that shows disease spell resist rate across a wide variety of creature types, I will accept that as a counter argument.  I won't accept &quot;not true&quot; with nothing behind it.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Tudani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I definately wouldn't mind disease debuff being added to Malos.  The problem, however, for sk's is that you'd need us to have a disease debuff on malosinia as well to make it useful (since malosinia overwrites malos, and in raid situations at least, malosinia is always landed whenever possible).<br />
<br />
Now to do that, you have two options:<br />
1) Split the mage and shaman spell lines, giving shamans a line that debuffs all resists, and leaving mages on the current line.<br />
2) Add a disease debuff to the current sinia line, giving mages a new ability.<br />
<br />
Problems with these:<br />
1) Since (at least in my guild) mages are often the ones debuffing with malosinia (since they get the right click version of it), if malosinia continued to overwrite the new and improved malos you'd have to either talk to your guild and get the shamans to take that over, or you'd lose the benefits of having this disease debuff.  Asking the mages to give up debuffing might make them feel like they have even less utility (I don't play a mage, I'm not sure if they'd be happy to give that up or not, but it's something to think about).<br />
2) This gives mages a new ability, making them even closer in resist debuffing abilities to what shaman currently have, further eroding any edge that shaman might have.<br />
<br />
Possible solutions:<br />
1) Let malosinia and malos stack, so if a mage cast malosinia you'd retain the disease debuff aspect of malos.  Note: If you did this  you wouldn't have to split the spell lines, but I think shaman would still want them split (for convenience), in which case make the new shaman malosinia overwrite mages malosinia and malos.<br />
2) Same solution as 1 but do not split the spell lines.  This does add stacking issues for malicious decay though, as you wouldn't want that to overwrite malos either, leaving the possibility of having three buffs on the mob just to debuff resists from a shaman.<br />
<br />
I personally like number 1 better, including the stacking of malosinia and malos, and splitting the spell lines.  If I were you though, I'd also ask mages what they thought, as I'm sure they'll have an opinion either way.<br />
<br />
In the meantime I would suggest for the sk community to start asking your local shaman if they'd mind casting malicious decay for you.  I know I don't personally bother unless I need to disease slow a mob (or sometimes when soloing) because it doesn't benefit me much.  I have also never had an sk ask me to disease debuff mobs for them, or complain about resists on disease based spells.  If they had, I'd definately do it for raids at least, as it would give me something else useful to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I'm going to buck the trend here and say...<br />
<br />
Please KEEP Malicious Decay.<br />
<br />
The super-fast casting time of MD is a huge boon when soloing with VP. You can MD+VP an add very fast and very reliably. If MD is dropped we would loose that ability. Its also a nice fast-cast spell for tagging pulls - and again, if you tag and get an add you have a mob ready-prepped for a quick VP.<br />
<br />
I'd support adding DR debuff to the Malo(xxx) line, and making it not stack with MD, but wouldn't like to see us loose MD. Caanus has it right - scrap malos and add MR, FR, CR, PR to MD :)<br />
<br />
If its any consolation to the SKs, I will cast MD on most boss mobs on raids, and most trash is lucky if it even gets a malos the rate they die at anyway. In XP groups I can feel your pain, but then again I'd guess quite often there's nobody doing malos/malosinia in the group anyway. Shaman are hardly the most desirable class around right now, and mages tend to cast it only on resistant mobs or those with lots of hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Serranex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Caanus had it right. Add -FR/PR/MR/CR to Malicious Decay and remove our malos line.</div></div><hr />

As far as keeping the Decay line is concerned, that's fine, so long as it wouldn't stack with the malo lines - I can certainly see the concern for loosing the line.  <br />
<br />

<br />
RP is a crappy reason to hinder class balance in a game that's moved so far away from the &quot;RP&quot; part of MMORPG.  <br />
<br />
Cynical reason: Debuffing disease is unique to the shaman class. Giving it to another class dilutes that small advantage shaman have. <br />
<br />
Look into the Necro Scent of XXX line.  (Hell, I mentioned it in the original post.)<br />
<br />
This is not an issue with the spells. The spell to debuff disease exists. This is an education issue - people know that Malo helps wizards, they don't know that the decay line helps shadowknights - or they may simply not care. <br />
<br />
It's most definately an issue with spells.  It's simply not reasonable for shamans to add the Decay line into their debuff set in a lot of situations - there's barely enough time to malo/slow as it is, and casting decay would mean there's that much less time for canni, heals, or nukes, meaning the price paid for casting the Decay line in terms of lost time may actually proove larger than the benefit gained by casting it.  <br />
<br />
For that matter, even if the decay spells ARE cast on a raid, DR is still debuffed less than any other resist. Malos / Malosinia stacks with Tash and HOS. The Ro spells stack on top of all of that. I may be mistaken here, but I'm pretty sure the only thing besides the decay spells that debuffs DR is Tuyen's Chant of the Plague.<br />
<br />
See above mentioned Scent line.<br />
<br />
If you really want equality in DR debuffing compared to other resists, you should be campaigning to get MD a nice, say, 150 resist debuff. Which I'd be all for, by the way.<br />
<br />
No, that would leave us with the same problem as currently exists, except mean that in situations where the Decay line is useful (primarily longer fights), disease would then have an unfair advantage.  <br />
<br />
I presented an opinion as &quot;in my experience&quot; - how can you say &quot;not true&quot; to an opinion based on experience? I've been casting disease based spells since 1999, I believe them to be less resisted than other damage types. If you have actual data that shows disease spell resist rate across a wide variety of creature types, I will accept that as a counter argument. I won't accept &quot;not true&quot; with nothing behind it.<br />
<br />
Talk to Brael (SKO board admin) - he may have some actual data on the matter.  <br />
<br />
And we've seen recently that Sony is very open to changing content to fix issues, particularly issues which affect the knight community.<br />
<br />
Well, that would be an absolutely HUGE undertaking, at a time when there are a lot of issues that simply are going to take precedence.  As for SOE &quot;being open to fix content for knights&quot; - the problems with that statement will basically cause most knights to go into a suicidal rampage.  Reducing the frequency with which disease immune/resistant mobs are encountered in future content is already something we are pushing for.  <br />
<br />
I definately wouldn't mind disease debuff being added to Malos. The problem, however, for sk's is that you'd need us to have a disease debuff on malosinia as well to make it useful (since malosinia overwrites malos, and in raid situations at least, malosinia is always landed whenever possible).<br />
<br />
I'm aware of this issue, but I don't really see it to be a problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Jovec</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Trevurg, it sounds like a concern you have is that if DR is added to the Malos[inia] line, then MD might get changed to a less useful state (ie. lowering the amount it reduces DR), and the MD/VP combo wouldn't be as effective, and a Malos/VP combo is too time (and mana) consuming.<br />
<br />

  <br />
<br />
Cynical reason: Debuffing disease is unique to the shaman class.  Giving it to another class dilutes that small advantage shaman have.<br />
<br />
With all due respect, it's an advantage that is rarely used (discounting VP). If MD was cast for every EXP mob, this wouldn't be an issue, but I don't think Shaman want to devote a slot to MD for EXP grind sessions unless it's absolutely needed, especially with the Malos/Slow combo being such a time-consuming priority.  And the game has changed...typical exp mobs are high dps - low hp.  There is much less time over the course of an average fight.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is not an issue with the spells.  The spell to debuff disease exists.  This is an education issue - people know that Malo helps wizards, they don't know that the decay line helps shadowknights - or they may simply not care.<br />
The power of the spells come into play here.  Helping a wizard land a 2-4k nuke that could crit for much higher is noticable, casting haste and FA on melees is noticeable, helping a SK land a 600 or 800 hp spear is much less so, especially if it means one less slot available for a shaman nuke or dot.<br />
<br />
<br />
For that matter, even if the decay spells ARE cast on a raid, DR is still debuffed less than any other resist.  Malos / Malosinia stacks with Tash and HOS.  The Ro spells stack on top of all of that.  I may be mistaken here, but I'm pretty sure the only thing besides the decay spells that debuffs DR is Tuyen's Chant of the Plague.<br />
I think the key point is that on a raid, disease typically will get debuffed at least some.  For nearly all XP mobs, it doesn't get debuffed at all.<br />
<br />
<br />
]If you really want equality in DR debuffing compared to other resists, you should be campaigning to get MD a nice, say, 150 resist debuff.  Which I'd be all for, by the way.<br />
SKs only want equality on DR debuffing to that extent that it gets debuffed about the same as other resists do, barring special situations that call for a specific resist to be debuffed as much a possible.  If that makes sense. :)  Just as a typical exp mob with get the other 4 resists debuffed by Malos/Malosinia, so we'd like disease to be also.<br />
<br />
<br />
And we've seen recently that Sony is very open to changing content to fix issues, particularly issues which affect the knight community.<br />
This cannot be adequately fixed by content.  Lowering the DR on mobs, or adjusting the spell's resist rate, means that SKs will have an edge when there is no resist debuffing.  Right now, the opposite occurs on some key SK spells, and other classes not reliant on Disease spells have an advantage when Malos is cast.<br />
<br />
SKs aren't asking for Shaman to take this up as their holy crusade.  It's more an &quot;Hey, here's a problem that you may not have known of, here's what we think is the best solution, have any input?&quot; sort of thing.  It's up the shaman community to decide what shaman issues they want to see addressed.  SK.org has more than one thread where getting DR adding to Malos is discussed as a potential SK issue.<br />

I've been casting disease based spells since 1999, I believe them to be less resisted than other damage types.  If you have actual data that shows disease spell resist rate across a wide variety of creature types, I will accept that as a counter argument.  I won't accept &quot;not true&quot; with nothing behind it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Will you accept this as an argument?<br />

SK  disease nukes have absolutely ZERO resist modifiers where as Shaman can debuff then cast.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if the disease based shaman spells have resist modifiers.  I've just spent years playing and just now geting into the nitty gritty of how things work.<br />

The train of thought in almost any thread on the SK board de-rails often into tangental topics and back again.<br />
<br />
As part of the issue is SK tankability and lack of DPS this is covered as part of many issues and is frequently mentioned though only one thread (the one linking to here) is exclusively on the matter.<br />
<br />
To find discussions on the subject check any of the threads with discussing top 10 lists, SCS vs. REZ or an entire thread on it in Arena.  There is also a running multiple thread discussion thread in the suggestions area (Currently up to SK issues 2.9) that runs through all issue for open discussion.  You may have to skim through several pages to get to the portions talking about resists. <br />
<br />
SJ doesn't like people who do not follow the rules and treats people like that harshly.  It only goes to figure that on another class board he'd be quite sure to follow the local rules of decorum.  Plus he's not a bully, most of his posts are rational with a hint of his personal investment.  He does think about SK issues while brushing his teeth however (yes SK's brush), so one does have to wonder about him.  If he says an issue is worth discussing though it is discussed.</div></div><hr />

Your tenacious defense of your position is admirable, but you're bringing up issues that have already been discussed in this thread.<br />
<br />
These points have been made already on this thread:<br />
1. SKs should not have to become debuffers for their abilities to come in line with other hybrids who do not have to separately debuff to get their spell lines to land.  Every other hybrid can benefit from a shammy casting Malo.  Do shammies really want to load another debuff into their 8 spell slots just to accommodate a SK?<br />
2. SKs already have a bunch of spells they need to have perma-memmed and shouldn't be forced to lose a dmg/utility spell just to come in line with other hybrids.<br />
<br />
As to your specific point about Aura of Darkness - you're falling into the common trap for non-SKs who talk about how SKs have so much utility because of their auras.  The simple fact is that groups HATE it when SKs use their auras.  Most groups have too many buffs already and will immediately tell an SK to stop casting their auras because they are beyond weak.  So increasing the power of Aura of Darkness would be useless because SKs are told not to use it by their groups because it's annoying, and if they got any stronger, it would begin to infringe upon other debuffers.<br />
<br />
BTW, when you said &quot;And we've seen recently that Sony is very open to changing content to fix issues, particularly issues which affect the knight community,&quot; I almost coughed up a lung laughing.  Knights get frothing mad on this subject because Sony nerfed the content in spite of overwhelming knight community feedback that the content was fine and the tanking gap was the real problem.<br />
<br />
If you meant, &quot;Sony is very CLOSED to fixing issues which affect the knight community and very open to changing the game to prevent warrior burn-out,&quot; that would be more accurate.</div></div><hr />

Since malosinia overwrites malo/malos this would quickly negate the disease debuff, or if they were made to stack it would make some encounters too easy, and there would would still be a discrepancy between disease and the other resists.</div></div><hr />

Cool, someone joined the crucible just to argue with me.  That's a first.<br />
<br />

<br />
1) I'm going to have to disagree with this - shaman have had to deal with the fact that other classes get significant resist adjustments to their spells while shaman do not, because shaman have the malo line figured in.  This engenders a certain lack of sympathy.<br />
<br />
2) I don't want to load two debuffs, I just don't want DR added to a debuff line we share with mages.  I fully support the other four resists being added to the Decay line.<br />
<br />
2. SKs already have a bunch of spells they need to have perma-memmed and shouldn't be forced to lose a dmg/utility spell just to come in line with other hybrids.<br />
<br />
This is hardly unique to shadowknights.  I have, myself, six slots permanently occupied by Quiescence, Slow, Tnarg's Mending, Ferine Avatar, a root spell and Cannibalize.  The other two slots get hotloaded very frequently.<br />
<br />

<br />
Regardless of convenience issues, it's an ability you possess.  <br />
<br />

<br />
This isn't really the point, is it?  The point being that knights had a problem tanking in new content and the content was changed to make it knight tankable.  I'm sure the knight community would have preferred bringing their tanking abilities closer to those of a warrior, but Sony felt differently.<br />
<br />
If you meant, &quot;Sony is very CLOSED to fixing issues which affect the knight community and very open to changing the game to prevent warrior burn-out,&quot; that would be more accurate.<br />
<br />
Pretty much every class thinks they're being overlooked in favor of another class.  The whipping boy around here is beastlords, by the way, if you could work a couple of subtle BST slams into a post you'll fit right in.</div></div><hr />

SK's are tanks, asking them to also play a support role (debuffing) is changing the point. You also say you will not load a spell just for SK's.  <br />
<br />
As for having alot of spells memmed I understand.  Your defense is that you have that issue to.  The difference here is that you are telling another class that they need to find a way to switch in a debuff.  No one is telling you to find a way to switch in another spell.<br />
<br />
As for Sk's tanking ability: 1) It's only a huge issue in GoD, 2)Even warriors will tell you Sk's are fubared compared to both them and Pallies at this point.

Hybrids aren't as good at tanking as warriors, and haven't been since Verant realized that rubicite was a Bad Idea and introduced class armors.  They get spells instead.  I expect hybrid tanks to play a support role in addition to their tanking role, why else would I want one in a group?<br />

<br />
I quite agree with your assessment of the tanking gap, though I find your choice of words somewhat dramatic and I believe that both paladins AND shadowknights are second-rate tanks at this point.  Paladins tank of choice between the two due to useful secondary abilities (healing) while shadowknights are pretty much something I look for if I don't have anyone else who can snare.<br />
<br />
I'm also aware that GoD was tuned for level 70 characters, and my personal belief is that complaining about the tanking gap at level 65 will seem silly once we're all level 70 and things are where they're supposed to be.  But I do tend to take a long term view of things.</div></div><hr />

Pretty much everyone who mentioned that accompanied it with smileys and used a general tone which implied sarcasm/a lack of seriousness.  If you honestly believe that's either more logical, more reasonable, or more likely to happen, one must question your mental fortitude...<br />
<br />

<br />
So the fact that your class has a problem means you'd wish the same problem on another class?  Sounds kinda like &quot;Sony broke my toy, so now NOBODY gets to play&quot; syndrome...<br />
<br />
2. SKs already have a bunch of spells they need to have perma-memmed and shouldn't be forced to lose a dmg/utility spell just to come in line with other hybrids.<br />

<br />
Nobody said it was unique to SK's, but why should SK's be forced to have an ADDITIONAL spell perma-memmed when other classes (namely the other hybrids, to which we are generally compared for spell-power purposes) do not?<br />
<br />
As to your specific point about Aura of Darkness - you're falling into the common trap for non-SKs who talk about how SKs have so much utility because of their auras. The simple fact is that groups HATE it when SKs use their auras. <br />
<br />
Regardless of convenience issues, it's an ability you possess.<br />
<br />
Aura of Darkness does nothing to help us in this equation.  If we use Aura of Darkness, EVERYBODY gets a -10 improvement to resists - it debuffs everything, not just disease.  <br />
<br />
I'm generally able to click off torrent recourses, is the one associated with Aura of Darkness different from the one associated with the pain and hate line of spells? If so, that's a bug.<br />
<br />
No, you cannot.  It's true of all of our Aura spells and I doubt it's going to change.  That's beside the point, though, as the basis for the argument you're trying to justify with this is flawed.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Furthermore, you're ignoring the fact that, while this affects SK's the most by far, other classes, such as necros and *gasp* shamans, would benefit from this change too.  Giving SK's the debuff would address the only the most significant manifestation of the problem, and by the wrong means - it would be a bandaid fix.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As for it upgrading mages, it should.  When a mage uses malosinia, it causes the same imbalance for SK's as when a shaman uses malo.  There really isn't any compelling reason they shouldn't have it other than &quot;I don't want mages getting better at debuffing&quot; - I wouldn't consider that sufficient.  It's not like mages couldn't use any help they can get anyway, they're one of the most broken classes in EQ at the high end ATM, and there's really no balance (or even RP) reason that it would be a problem.<br />
<br />
Before you try to argue that druids have a fire debuff, chanters have a magic debuff, or whatever, so &quot;why shouldn't we just add all the other resists to theirs by that logic?&quot;: those are specific/supplementary - they don't cover basically everything but SK's (I.E. malo[sinia]), they cover a specific group of spells.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Why you're so intent on destroying this discussion is beyond me.  This was a good thread until it became an exchange with you.  Now it's just monotonous with numerous attempts to get off course.  <br />

You forgot mages and rangers.  Mages are in bad shape for the same reason SK's are - their power doesn't scale up as they progress well, so they're not bad at the low end, and they're gimps at the high end.  Rangers are in a similar position in that their power seems to be guaged by the power of a pre-EP ranger with an EP bow, so they're fine pre-EP's, but then their DPS degenerates as they progress until they're doing less DPS than a warrior.</div></div><hr />

Disagree if you wish, but you've been taking unprovoked shots at individual posters and SK's in general, while repetedly trying to get this thread off track.  That's the same stuff you're complaining about from SKO.  As for meaningful discussion on the topic about which you claim to disagree, you've yet to actually refute any of my points and have instead reverted to diversionary tactics and mud slinging - I'm waiting.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As for all of the people slamming SKO, we've got our share of idiots, I'm sure you do too, but for the most part, it's a productive community that is appreciated by its members - we just tend to be a different sort of lot from most of you folks.  SKO is more open/unrestricted than the Crucible and populated by a different group of people - for the most part, we're happy with it that way.  There are plenty of knowledgable posters and informative threads available to anyone who wishes to read them.  <br />
<br />
Personally, I prefer the tone and atmosphere of SKO to the Crucible - it feels more natural and casual; obviously many of you feel differently, and you're entitled to your opinion.  Nobody's trying to bring the SKO atmosphere to the Crucible, and nobody's putting down your boards for your different style, I don't see why you feel it's necessary to do so to us - the shadowknights in this thread have been nothing but respectful to your board policies and norms.  <br />
<br />
But I digress.  <br />
<br />
<br />

Nobody is asking for shamans to take this matter up as their holy crusade - nobody's even asking for you to fight for it all.  I merely started this thread to guage shaman opinion of a matter which is of notable importance to my class &amp; community and which effects shamans.  For the most part, this has been a productive discussion - I thank the majority who've made meaningful contributions.  You've brought to attention the desire to keep the Decay line, something which seems quite reasonable so long as it wouldn't stack with malo(sinia) should disease be added.  <br />
<br />
Unless anyone has anything else meaningful to add to this discussion, I'm done with this thread, but I'll keep reading in case someone has something worth commenting on to add.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Lot of good info in this thread.<br />
<br />
Here's the number one reason I never debuff disease, unless I specifically need it:<br />
<br />
- Spell gems.<br />
<br />
No other reason... the spell is cheap and fast to use.  Has more agro than Malos, but nothing I can't deal with... but it's just spells gems.  Unless I know a mob is disease slowable, or some other specific reason to debuff disease... it just doesn't happen.<br />
<br />
I see no harm at all adding DR debuff to a Malos upgrade.     Bump the overall mana cost a bit, bump up the debuff a bit (remember, an upgrade to Malos)... boom.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Wow I didnt even realize that Malos debuffed every resist except for Disease, I thought it debuffed them all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Disagree if you wish, but you've been taking unprovoked shots at individual posters and SK's in general, while repetedly trying to get this thread off track. That's the same stuff you're complaining about from SKO.<br />
<br />
Please, show me an unprovoked &quot;shot&quot; at an individual poster or SKs in general.<br />
<br />
Also, show me where I complained about threads going off track on SK.org.<br />
<br />
If you're going to put words in my mouth, at least back them up.  I haven't edited any of my posts.<br />
<br />
you've yet to actually refute any of my points<br />
<br />
I've presented my opinion on the matter of adding disease resist to malo several times, and given reasons why I believe it would be a bad thing.  You disagree with my opinions, and have presented your reasons why you think it would be a good thing.<br />
<br />
I believe adding disease resist debuffing to a spell line shared with mages hurts the shaman class.  That's an opinion.  You can disagree with it.<br />
<br />
I believe that changing one classes' spells in the name of balance for another class is a dangerous precedence to set.  That's also an opinion.  You can disagree with it.<br />
<br />
I believe that classes in general should wait to complain about class balance in GoD until after the expansion is released to bring everyone up to level 70.   AGAIN, opinion, and you can disagree with it.<br />
<br />
But &quot;refute&quot; ?  Neither of us can &quot;refute&quot; the other, because neither of us can PROVE an opinion right or wrong.  If you choose to deal in hard facts, that's something else.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">how in the hell does adding disease to the malo line weaken shaman vrs mages? <br />
we dont use disease spells in groups, other than VP what is the last disease spell you cast in an exp group? <br />
<br />
remind me again why it is shaman can debuff fire? oh yeah so we can land our lvl 1 nuke more reliably. <br />
<br />
this isnt even an issue, there is NOTHING even remotly close to overpowering anyone in game and it only solves one of our age old issues of to many damn spells and to few damn spell gems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Valkargen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Malos should be changed to neg 55 to ALL resists.<br />
<br />
MD should be scaled from neg 51 to neg 55 DR from level 63 to 65 and NOT level 70.<br />
<br />
Malos should block MD.<br />
<br />
Malosinia should overwrite Malos removing the DR component.<br />
<br />
With Malosinia landed MD should now be allowed to land reinstating the DR component.<br />
<br />
This would allow SK's to elevate their DPS especially in single group fast paced content where only Malos is utilized.<br />
This would not allow mages the ability to debuff DR.<br />
This would allow MD to still remain a situational spell and retain its use.<br />
<br />
This is just one fix that would actually address the points arising in the thread.<br />
<br />
However I disagree with it for a variety of reasons:<br />
<br />
RP reason: Mages work with the elements. They should be able to debuff fire, magic, and cold. They shouldn't be able to debuff disease, that's part of the physical realm which is a shamanic forte.<br />
<br />
Cynical reason: Debuffing disease is unique to the shaman class. Giving it to another class dilutes that small advantage shaman have.<br />
<br />
The first reason is false...as maloxxx actively debuffs PR...which mages don't effect through spell, pet, or proc means.  RP has never entered into the equation of why we share spell lines with mages to a degree.  For that I would surmise we should look to Verant/SoE's reticence in adding additional difficulty into debuff stacking.<br />
<br />
As the the 2nd and cynical reason...Explain how allowing mages the ability to debuff DR dilutes a shaman advantage.  Only 5 classes have the option to utlilize DR for damage or utility purposes:  Necro, SK, Shaman, Bard, and Beastlord.  <br />
<br />
1.  BL's damage when utilizing DR through pet procs or dots is incredibly minimal even by our own shaman DPS standards, considering the options available to them in pet proc selection or through selection of PR, CR, or Ferocity options available to the class.<br />
<br />
2.  Necros have a myriad degree of high damange dots and dd's already available to them through MR/FR/PR.  One of the current concerns of necros is INCREASING dps while reducing aggro levels through the inclusion of CR based pyre versions.  Necros have their own DR debuff varient...and its even less utilized than MD for a reason.<br />
<br />
4. Bard chants utilize DR, however when grouped or raiding bards have more options than any other class in game to positively affect a group or detrimentally affect a mob in a manner far greater than DR.<br />
<br />
3.  Shamans can at their discretion, even with the changes, now opt to either debuff DR through MD or Malos/Sinia.  If both Malos AND Sinia included the same neg 55 DR adjustment and MD were more rapidly scaled to the same at level 65.  MD would then bounce if either Malos or Sinia were landed with the same neg 55 DR mod.  In no way would this alter the situational advantage that some shaman find in utilizing MD, and in some cases the change would lesson the workload on our already overtaxed spell gems.<br />
<br />
4.  SK's would be the only class to directly benefit from the change through increased levels of DPS...with the exception of our own class garnering gains in both utility and spell gem savings.<br />
<br />
Concerning the precedence set to class balance... would we as shaman even bat an eye if tomorrow SK spears were moved from DR to PR?  Would we even notice or care?<br />
<br />
If our concern is that we don't want mages debuffing DR, then by all means lets analyze that arguement for what it is.<br />
<br />
However if our motives are entirely selfish, especially at a time when our class is helped by the support of others, then maybe we shouldn't be looking at SKO for examples of discourtesy to others, as we unfortunately have issues to deal with in our OWN glass house...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">It's bad enough that we have to debuff most mobs these days to slow them in the first place.  I can't see too many Shaman keeping MD in a permanent gem whenever a SK is in the group.  It's nothing personal, but most mobs are half dead by the time our slow lands as it is.  Adding another 3-4 seconds would just make it.....well, stupid.<br />
<br />
SOE isn't going to add DIS to Malo or vice versa with MD.  And if by some miracle they do, we would probably never hear then end of excuses why we didn't get DPS or healing upgrades for the next 5 expansions.  I sympathize with SKs, but quite frankly it doesn't even scratch the bulk of Shaman problems in EQ right now.<br />
<br />
Healing and DPS are what we need to be desireable for groups/raid stacking.  Right now, we are bots and soloers...kinda feel like the Necros of Kunark actually :P<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Valkargen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">The proposal wasn't made by shaman, but brought here by SJ of the Shadowknight community as something that would address one the their concerns.  It was brought here in part due to the alteration of one of our spell lines.<br />
<br />
The proposal is something along the lines of:<br />
<br />
Shaman<br />
MD: 1.5 sec CT, 150 mana, neg 55 DR (L65)<br />
Malos:  5 sec CT, 400 mana, neg 55 ALL (L65)<br />
Malosinia:  3.25 CT, 300 mana, neg 55 DR, neg 70 MR/CR/FR/PR (L65)<br />
<br />
Mages<br />
Malosinia:  3.25 CT, 300 mana, neg 55 DR, neg 70 MR/CR/FR/PR (L65)<br />
<br />
<br />
MD would be overwritten by Malos or Malosinia, and Malos would be overwritten with Malosinia.  Shamans would garner 2 additional methods of debuffing DR and in no way would lose the situational effectiveness of MD.  In some cases this would allows us to debuff DR in environments where we currently lack the gem slots or time to do so.<br />
<br />
Two primary arguements would brought up to as reasons not to support the proposal brought here by the SK community:<br />
<br />
1.  That the change would weaken shaman, wether in relation to another or as it pertains to our class alone.<br />
<br />
2.  That other classes would benefit in an appreciable means besides SK's and Shaman, and this would upset class balance currently.<br />
<br />
SJ came here as a representative of his community...a community that argueably is in similar dire straights to our own, looking for support to address one of their concerns.  He left not because he recieved an answer but because an answer wasn't forthcoming and his continued presence might have strained the relationship between his community and our own.  His proposal was an articulate, concise, and polite one...I think he deserves a similar response from us...<br />
<br />
I would like to see ONE in game example of how this change could hurt our class or how any class besides SK's or Shamans would appreciably benefit. Either answering 1 or 2 will do, ANY group structure, ANY zone, or ANY specific encounter will also fulfill that requirement...just...one...<br />
<br />
At a time when our own issues are and have been helped by members of other communities, then we would be horribly remiss if we didn't extend that same common courtesy to at least give an answer and not empty excuses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>stanislao</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">I never quite figured out why we have to have 2 lines of debuffs to work better our 2 lines of dots. That makes just add more spells that need to be pulled up. After we got Bane this was not much a problem ...  <br />
many times magic/poison dots get the job done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Kror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">As a shaman I'm wondering if putting the disease resist on the Malo line wouldn't be seen as us being overpowered to having it two easy since that would cover the resists for all 3 lines of our DoT's.  They may want to continuue to make Shaman either or.  <br />
<br />
So since 2 of our DoT lines are covered by Malo I suggest adding a Magic debuff to the Decay line, so it would also cover 2 of our DoT lines.  A shaman would have to choose.<br />
<br />
As far as SK tankability I'd rather have a pally tanking agaainst sunnable mobs than a warrior or a warrior tanking and a pally stunning.  SK's don't have that nor are they dps and FD pulling is extremely situational all through PoP and too slow and inefficient for DPS.  The excuse they can't tank as well is their utility but it's not even used.  That class has issues.<br />
<br />
Please, show me an unprovoked &quot;shot&quot; at an individual poster or SKs in general.<br />
<br />
<br />
For the record, I went looking on SK.org.  It made me feel kind of like reading the sullon forum, but I did try to pull some actual conversations out of the constant stream of profanity and foul language.  <br />
<br />
/clip<br />
<br />
I'll add that I'm actually impressed by Slein's demeanor on this board as a result of seeing what he's like &quot;at home&quot;, if you will.  It's like two different people.<br />
<br />
Wow! I found both!<br />
And describing SJ as a Jekkle and Hyde character is a &quot;shot&quot;.<br />
He's in Europe on vacation ATM so I'll defend him</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>PanzerCat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">At one time I was a constant visitor to the SK boards, and Ive seen SJ at his best, And at his worst.  While on many occasions he has given outstanding advice, Ive allso had the misfortune to have to read some of his less then pleasant replies.  The SK board is notorious for the conduct and content of its boards and I myself along with a few others quit going there.  It became tedious and mind numbing not to mention the links to pornagraphic content.  Im glad that this forum is well moderated and if it sank to the level that the SK forum has, Id probably quit comming here to read the articles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>dulbecco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Cool, someone joined the crucible just to argue with me.  That's a first.<br />
I came to the crucible to read what shammies thought about SJ's question about rounding out Malo to cover the only resistance line it does not debuff, which is coincidentally the resistance line SKs and no other hybrids use.  For the record, I didn't join the crucible to argue with you, but to make sure that people were informed about SK concerns from an SK and not from your umpteenth-hand impressions about supposedly useful auras and Sony's supposed favored treatment of knights.<br />
<br />
I believe, Trevurg, that your &quot;greeting&quot; to me counts as a &quot;shot&quot; against a visiting SK.  I just wanted to inform you that SKs don't see auras and Sony's recent &quot;tanking patch&quot; in as warm a light as you apparently do, and to provide the reasoning for it.  Instead I was greeted by condescension.<br />
<br />
Since you apparently still don't understand my point about why SKs shouldn't have to use Aura of Darkness or other debuffing spells to come in line with other hybrids, let me put it this way:<br />
<br />
- Rangers use fire and cold nukes.   Beastlords use cold nukes.  Pallies use Magic nukes.  Shadowknights use Disease nukes.  Shammy casts Malo.  Ranger, Beastlord, Pally nukes land.  Shadowknight nuke does not because mob's disease resist is still not debuffed.<br />
- Shadowknight says, &quot;pretty please mr. Shammy, can you load up Decay so i can land my nuke?&quot;  Shammy says, &quot;Sorry, I have 6 spells perma-memmed and don't have room to load up a spell just for one member of the group to land half-strength nukes and dots.  Why don't you use your Aura of Darkness?&quot;<br />
- Shadowknight loads up Aura of Darkness and casts on next mob.  Because Aura of Darkness only debuffs -10 to disease, SK nuke still doesn't land.<br />
- Other members of group: &quot;@%$# stupid gimpy SK buffs.  I can't #@$% click it off and it just blocked the cleric's heal over time.  NEVER cast that stupid aura again or you're getting kicked from the group!&quot;<br />
<br />
OK.  So hopefully the scenario above tells you something is wrong with the situation.  The solution is (a) add disease resist to malo (or maybe some other shammy line if you're worried about mages competing with shammies /boggle), (b) make aura of darkness stronger and get rid of the recourse, or (c) give SKs an independent debuff line.  There are other solutions i'm sure, but these are the ones under discussion in this thread.<br />
<br />
Take your pick as to which you want.  I'm just telling you that from an SK perspective, and I had hoped from a shammy perspective, A is the way to go.  It accomplishes the goal of making SK spells actually as effective as other hybrids' as they seem to be on paper (hint: they're not as effective as other hybrids' spells), and it doesn't give SKs another function / ability which we don't want and other debuffers may say impinges on their territory anyway.  You already jealously guard disease debuffing from mages - I don't really see that you would want to give it to SKs.</div></div><hr />
