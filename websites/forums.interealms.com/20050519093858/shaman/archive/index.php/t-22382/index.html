<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Now most of us realise SoE Dev's have a problem balancing the power of slow so I have been giving a lot of thought lately to how I can assist them with this issue.<br />
<br />
I believe the following suggestions will allow SoE to produce at least five (maybe 6) more expansions thereby allowing them to extend EQ's life by around three years. BTW I would like 10% commission on all sales :)<br />
<br />
The basic premise is that for all these expansions slow operates at 100% of its effective value and we ensure that all balancing revolves around that hypothesis. Listed are the expansions and their unique attributes.<br />
<br />
Gates of Debilitiation (GoD)<br />
<br />
In this expansion all plate tanks will have their AC and mitigation randomly reduced to either 25%, 50% or 75% of its current value upon engaging a mob. To add flavour to this expansion the armour graphic can change to cloth, leather or chain to better simulate it graphically.<br />
<br />
Gates of Durability (GoD)<br />
<br />
In this expansion all players will have their hitpoints randomly reduced to either 25%, 50% or 75% of its current value upon engaging a mob. Player size can decrease by a proportionate amount to demonstrate wimpiness.<br />
<br />
Gates of Damage (GoD)<br />
<br />
In this expansion all spell and melee damage will be randomly reduced on any hit to either 25%, 50% or 75% of the base attack value from other expansions.<br />
<br />
Note: This expansion has a wonderful possibility of being split into 2 expansions and squeezing out another expansion to all those suckers........ err lovely customers out there by making one expansion ony reduce spell damage and and another expansion only reduce melee damage.<br />
<br />
Gates of Dun Coloured Pets (GoD... struggling with the GoD theme now :) )<br />
<br />
In this expansion all pets will only do around 10% of their maximum total damage available in other expansions. Naturally snce this will severely restrict enchanter dominance in the high end game it should be carefully considered and then rejected as an idea because we would not want to upset this extremely important class.<br />
<br />
Gates of Healing (GoH - gave up on getting a GoD-alike :) )<br />
<br />
In this expansion all healing spells (including CH naturally) cast by players will be randomly reduced to 25%, 50% or 75% of their current maximum value in other expansions. this raises the interesting possibility of implementing CH chains with a 0.25 seconds delay and ensuring maximum FT is essential.<br />
<br />
<br />
As stated above, slow will now be a very useful tool in reduciing mob damage when player dps is reduced or when mobs are overhitting players due to decreased mitigation and/or hps so the power of slow has been balanced by other factors.<br />
<br />
You will notice that none of these expansion severely effect enchanters, this is quite right and proper within the overall Vision (tm) which is quite clear on their important role. As long as they have crack, haste, slow and mez even the pet one may prove little trouble to them but we wouldn't want to upset them.<br />
<br />
I am sure that no players could possibly object to these expansion tuning methods as you will always have enchanters, shaman, beastlords and bards available to slow thereby keeping mob dps balanced with respect to player stats and abilities.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I still like the idea of an expansion where mobs have no backs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">An expansion full of gelatinous cubes and oozes and wisps!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">And maybe they can say ah heck with it, and use an ENTIRELY random chain of letters for all mob and zone names, and replace all vowels with apostrophes.<br />
<br />
Oh wait, that's been done already...</div></div><hr />

Every mob will be named &quot;Blorbble&quot;, &quot;Squeelch&quot;, and &quot;Mosquito-Noise&quot;</div></div><hr />
