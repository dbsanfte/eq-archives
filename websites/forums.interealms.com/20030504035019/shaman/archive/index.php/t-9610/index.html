<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>SingleServing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I remember reading some time ago that VI changed all the cannibalize spells so that the ratio would get better with each upgrade. Does anyone else remember this and remember the date on the patch by chance?<br />
<br />
I will be hitting 54 soon and will test it out myself if no one knows. I am just suprised no one remembers this or has it updated on castersrealm or anywhere including here!<br />
<br />
/sigh <br />
<br />
Peace</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's all right there in Lucy (http://lucy.fnord.net/spelllist.html?searchtext=cannibaliz) (or EqCaster (http://www.eqcaster.com/pages/eqcaster.htm))</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>SingleServing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Did an in game test of canni 2 and found the results in line with what you guys posted.<br />
<br />
...and to think I thought VI grew a grain and would make it so each spell would have an increasingly better hp to mana ratio.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Giden Grooverider</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">A long standing curiosity that has to be quelled...<br />
<br />
How do you know how many mana points Cani or Lich gives?  For me, I only see a little tick, a percent gain of mana and I've wondered how you know that that 1-2% of mana xxx mana points.   I would think that you would have a hard time calculating mana pool by chain casing a spell with a known casting cost, you'd be gaining back mana as you we standing there casting / waiting for recast.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think the mana gain from standing is negligible without any mana regen buffs. I just cast a spell, look at the % dropped and calculate it that way. I believe it is pretty accurate because I see mana pool growth when wis or mana pool buffs are added. No real way of knowing unless you have SEQ tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shjekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm guessing the ratio is where they want it balance wise. There is not rule that says the newer spells have to be better mana/hp ratios. Just cause Necros are that way doesn't stand to reason that shaman should be. What you are getting from each higher level canni is faster transfers. We can heal very fast at high levels and very efficiently so you want to be able to chew through lots of hps. Using cann 1 maybe technically more efficient but it would take forever to convert thousands of hps that a 60th shaman (for example) would have, both in base hps and what is healed. <br />
I never wanted to get can 2 since it was so hard to do the quest. By the time I was about 50ish I NEEDED cann 2 because it was taking me so long to get mana with cann 1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The later spells aren't more efficient, but they have something even more important : they are faster (in terms of potential Mana/Second gained).</div></div><hr />
