<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The &quot;SOW&quot; spells for indoor are significantly SLOWER than SoW. Its an entirely different line of spells.</div></div><hr />

It's funny you mention that, quite a while back (before the Run3 aa was in game), that was my idea to make Alchemy really useful. If the only SoW that would have worked indoors was SoW potions, the demand for them would have been much greater.<br />

UghleiHave you check the LDoN Alchemy book yet? I had power outage right as I was going to buy the book yesterday, so have not read it. Maybe there is a combine for such a potion?</div></div><hr />
