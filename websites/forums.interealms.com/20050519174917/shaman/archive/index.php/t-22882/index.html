<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I quit EQ about two months ago (it feels great, I really recommend it) but still occassion my guild's board, the Crucible and our server board from time to time.<br />
<br />
After reading the current thread on GoD Progression, I decided I could create the new zone names for Omens.  So here I propose the first ten new zone names for OoW.<br />
<br />
Jlgohvsm<br />
<br />
Kjkndxmkn<br />
<br />
Rofmnun<br />
<br />
Apomufc<br />
<br />
Wounyci<br />
<br />
Pnqotua<br />
<br />
Buqicqyuiob<br />
<br />
Upncosa<br />
<br />
Ynipuynup<br />
<br />
Xzxzuiiip<br />
<br />
Created by simlutaneously striking my keyboard with both hands, and at no particular key.  Makes about as much sense to me as the GoD zones.  I'll expect my royalty check in the mail.<br />
<br />
Feel free to post your own suggestions.  I'm sure they'll make as much sense as Vxed, Tipt, Uqua and Ikkinz?  (I don't even know if I spelled those correctly.)</div></div><hr />

My favorite is &quot;Doljonijiarnimorinar&quot; name of a mob and an axe he drops (velious).  Now that's creativity at it's finest!</div></div><hr />

<br />
The names of the zones get weirder and weirder with the new expansions.  pretty soon it will just be random letters thrown together :p</div></div><hr />

.......It already is?  :p <br />

Wonder if the creators foreheads hurt after making allll those zone names...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Heigelyac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have it on authority, they threw hamsters at keyboards to determine Zone names for GoD, and some NPC names for ldon.<br />
<br />
Edit:  they bought the hamster towards the end of the development of ldon.  They couldn't think of a name for him either, so they went with the sound he makes...  Splatclick</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, thats who did the recent DX9 coding update.  The reason it took so long to fix was they outsourced the job to India, where non english speaking monkeis smashed keyboards, and the translation from Hindi to English took some time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Some more zone names, leaked from Sources:<br />

Um...Im working through the list, but so far Ive only got:<br />
Sacsatsit - Cast it ass<br />
Agas Oman Cumidye - again saucy modem, cousin may damage, you acid gamesman<br />
<br />
Ok...after those 2 my brain hurts.  Ive never been good at anagrams, so have to write all the letters on scraps of paper and shuffle them around.  My desk is a mess now, and my cat is having a grand old time with them, so Ive decided to stop and just watch him play instead.  If HE comes up with anything interesting, I'll let you know =^.^=</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Since nobody's mentioned it yet:  Mine are anagrams.<br />
<br />
A little disappointed you had to explain that to some<br />
<br />
Use the internet Anagram server if you aren't anagram savvy<br />
Wordsmith.org's Internet anagram Server (http://wordsmith.org/anagram/index.html)<br />
<br />
Now I get to anagram your anagrams (not what she made them from but fun anyway)<br />
Sacsatsit - Cast it ass<br />
<br />
I thought that was &quot;Static Ass&quot; (it's actually Asstastic for those of you on the short bus - there wasn't really any good one for that)<br />
<br />
Agas Oman Cumidye - again saucy modem, cousin may damage, you acid gamesman<br />
<br />
&quot;Go A Adynamic Muse&quot; (most appropriate as I'm thinking of repatative LDoN design)<br />
<br />
Weeolin Yowus = &quot;WoW, You senile&quot; (subliminal anti WoW campaign in game)<br />
<br />
Barb Desolate = &quot;A Tabbed loser&quot;<br />
<br />
Monel Soreoz Deck = &quot;Monk Decree SoL = Oz&quot;<br />
<br />
Tenneco Throne = &quot;Rotten Hence On&quot;<br />
<br />
Yorenor Abedmud = &quot;A Burdened Roomy&quot; for college students whose roommate uses their computer to play EQ<br />
<br />
Nitstrom Aheekin = &quot;Tom, A stink herein&quot; one developer to Developer &quot;ToM&quot; about GoD<br />
<br />
Thawross Toytry= &quot;A Sooth, wry trist&quot;  A euphamism for bending us over &lt;bleeping&gt; us and taking our money<br />
<br />
Seriously: can you say Fedok Curve on this board?  i.e. Shaman are Fedok Curve?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, that kind of defeats the purpose of a word game, but ok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Well, that kind of defeats the purpose of a word game, but ok.<br />
I figured that if people needed to be told that those were anagrams then they would also need a little assistance.<br />
<br />
It probably won't solve Sacsatsit or Fedok Curve anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">because it is so hard to say the new zone named from GoD.  I mean, they are just so hard to remember.<br />
<br />
Tipt<br />
Vxed<br />
Barindu<br />
Ferubi<br />
Qinimi<br />
Natimbi <br />
Ikkinz<br />
Inktu'tu<br />
Tvexu<br />
Uqua<br />
Tacvi<br />
Qvic<br />
Kod'Taz<br />
<br />
There is really only one name from that is might be remotely hard to say and that is Inktu'tu.  Just call it inky for short.. and just call Tvexu - Texas for short if you can't say T-Vex-UUU<br />
<br />
The only real name that I have trouble saying in GoD is the garden dude in Qvic.  I still have no clue how to even start to say his name -- Iqthinxa Karnkvi... or should I say it's just that I don't care to pronouce it.. just easier to say Garden Dude.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">It's all a ploy from SOE to stop us from using voice applications like Teamspeak, to improve communication, and break their content faster. <br />
<br />
So they came up with a brillant idea to nerf Teamspeak by giving zones and mobs &quot;unspeakable&quot; names.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Valsuvious wins the &quot;yep, you're much better than us, aaaaaand you still missed it&quot; cupie doll.<br />
<br />
Thorizon, thanks for the image of a cat on the desk tossing scraps of paper everywhere.  That made my morning.</div></div><hr />

Blah, blah blah....<br />
<br />
Maybe the board will chip in and buy you a sense of humour for christmas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Shambler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">The first time someone mentioned a name of a GoD name in chat, I asked them if they could please speak in English/Common. I thought maybe they were some funky french words or thieves cant.</div></div><hr />
