<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Willowwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As usual I'm up for anything.  But as of yesterday I have found a place where I can hit 50 and will be spending time there a lot.  It's Karnors and Dreadlands.  I have found for some reason this place Bard's can get a group really easy.  I know I missed out on you guys taking VS down but was wondering if anyone would be interested in coming here this weekend.  It's a new place and I really like it.  Don't know why I never went here before but better late than never eh? :).  <br />
<br />
  I also wanted to know who in the guild is at Master/Grandmaster level in jewelry.  I need to get some resist stuff made i.e. Fire emerald rings and Diamond stuff.</div></div><hr />
