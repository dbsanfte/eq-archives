<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">While PL''ing some chars in good ol PC, I noticed a bunch of dwarf miners, blue to my shammy. So I tried them out, can't single pull. I fd pulled with my monk and the fight begun. One of those guys took me like 15 minutes maybe with me 57 shammy and my 50 monk. THey are blue to my shammy red to my monk. Hit not too hard at 159 max or so, and must have like 20-30k hp?  just guessing they lasted through 2.5 turgurs. At the end of the fight I got shadowhaven merchant faction hit and some dworf hit, in shadowhaven too I think. I got about 2% exp on my monk and 1% exp on my shammy. ANyone else try these bad boys?</div></div><hr />

Yeah, they're part of some quest.  I had high hopes when I found them due to paludal's high zem... but they are hard to single pull and the fights took too long with the crew we had.  They also are rough on your shadow haven faction.<br />
