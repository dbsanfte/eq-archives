It's actually http://db.allakhazam.com.  I get a cutesy little 'No cookies for Lucy?' page with that whole URL. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ohh cool I didn't realize that, thanks. I wondered where everyone got their info since the 13th.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hrmmm... what's up with that...<br />
<br />
http://lucy.fnord.net/ is my URL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hamenu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Alla's doesn't seem to be pointing completely at lucy yet, so I'm guessing this is a transition weekend for them. Part of this is probably a hosting arrangement, similar to what was done with Muse and EQAtlas.<br />
<br />
I DO notice a huge difference in their spell data, as they appear to be pulling full detail from lucy, but displaying in the Allakhazam &quot;skin&quot;.<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/spell.html?spell=1446<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/rawspell.html?spell=1446<br />
<br />
It will be interesting to see if Lucy @ Alla requires a premium membership....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well that's just great.  I can't get to allkhazam's at work, there goes any item/spell research while I'm on lunch break. :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>howjan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It will be interesting to see if Lucy @ Alla requires a premium membership....<br />
<br />
It is not intended to become a pay deal.  The only thing that should change with lucy is the addy that you access her through.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">IF you read the post that was linked above, you would know the answer to that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Is there any particular reason people go to allakazam's to get to Lucy? <br />
<br />
Why aren't you using http://lucy.fnord.net?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Taoxek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Because Lucy is moving. You may notice lucy.fnord.net hasnt updated since the 13th, while the allakazam lucy has. If you want new data you will have to start using the new address.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hmm..no advanced equipment search. =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The impression I received at Fan Faire (when everyone was drunk and shouting over the noise, mind you) is that Kerasota, the maker of Lucy, has quit playing EQ and therefore quit keeping up Lucy.  The item collector stopped working with the LDoN changes, at which point the spell data was being entered manually by the Allakhazam folks (mainly Illia, I think).  Apparently they are now taking it on completely, item collector and all, to get it all working automatically again.  My guess is that old Lucy will vanish entirely once the new one is fully up and running.  I noticed a week or so ago that the Allakhazam folks disabled the profile system for subscribers, so I wonder if they're going to be making it an automated profile system of their own, like Magelo.<br />
<br />
Again, we were all drunk and it was noisy, so no guarantee on my facts there.  But I think it's mostly right.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
lol, why would they keep that for free when they already have one that they charge for...</div></div><hr />
