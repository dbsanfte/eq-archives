<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Styantiss Sarnakslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings everyone, I am Styantiss Sarnakslayer, a shaman of 47 seasons. I am currently unguilded, though I am carefully looking at a couple of guilds.<br />
<br />
 I heard someone mention a group of people on another server who help others get their epic in exchange for helping others. That sounds like such a great concept, though I have never heard of such a group on FV. Please, correct me if I am in error.<br />
<br />
 Anyway, would there be a shaman on FV who could lend me a hand? Whether it be just info or letting me tag along on a raid for a needed item, I would be very appreciative. I am at the Black Dire part, though I also have 5 of 6 COM reports. It sounds like after BD, its a guild only affair.<br />
<br />
 Thank you in advance, give me a tell in-game if you wish :)</div></div><hr />
