<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Pzakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I recently bout a Othmir Cheiftan Spear of a vendor for 99pp. I was curious and looked up the item on eqprices.com and found it is a rare drop and used for a quest to get the manastone. Does anyone have the details of this quest and what exactly the manastone does? Thank you</div></div><hr />

<br />
what site told you there was a quest to get a manastone?  FYI the manastone no longer drops in game .. and it was a drop not a quest.</div></div><hr />

Doh! thanks for the reply too bad though for me. What did the manastone do?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Magsy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It was basically a way for non-shamans to canni.  Don't remember the numbers on it but that's what it did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It takes hp and gives you mana and was insta-click.  So you could just spam cannibalize (basically) but the ratio wasn't anywhere near cannibalize.  Now the manastone will only work in the old world, it doesnt work in Kunark or Velious etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It is/was considerably faster than canni - no??<br />
<br />
:)&gt;&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yes much faster only because it's insta-click.  Although I bet Cann5 is better ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Cann and cann v are definitely more efficient than a mana stone but short of cann v nothing can convert hps as quickly and even a regular torpor is efficient enough to make it worth using. A SCRM extended quiesence is even better.<br />
<br />
Manastone is 60 for 20 mana if memory serves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Pzakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">So, I guess it was a mistake that I bought this for 99pp from a merchant.<br />
Doh!</div></div><hr />
