Under Review<br />
Hi, <br />
<br />
We wanted to give you an update on some of the things we've been working on lately. We've been following the various class and server boards, and looking for pressing issues. While this isn't the complete list, here are some of the topics currently being reviewed - <br />
<br />
- PoP planar flags and how they are acquired. We're experimenting with some ideas that let people accompany their raids to the deeper planes without having all previous flags. Our goal is to allow a player to participate in raids and guild events, even if the player wasn't able to acquire a previous flag. This would not grant them a flag for that zone, but would give them access to it while on the raid. We're looking at several options, but our current version in testing allows a raid to bring along a small group of people without the necessary flags, if the raid has most of it's members flagged for an event or plane. <br />
<br />
- PoP zone access quests. We're looking at the difficulty of the quests for individual access to the various planes. Our goal is to make it reasonable to gain access to later planes by doing the quests, without making it trivial or unbalancing when compared to the raid-gained planar access methods. <br />
<br />
- We're looking at the state of Charm spells, and may make adjustments so that the cost and risk associated with charming high-level pets is balanced with the power of the spell. <br />
<br />
- We're continuing to evaluate the drop rates of PoP spell parchments to see if any further adjustments are needed. <br />
<br />
- We're reviewing the tanking ability of the various melee and hybrid classes to be sure each class is competitively balanced with the others. The main factors we're considering are the ability to take damage, deal damage, and the additional abilities of each class. The goal with this review is to find any issues where melee classes are not &quot;bringing enough to the party&quot; when comparing their package of abilities. We're paying particular attention to the avoidance-focused classes such as the monk, to be sure things end up where they should. <br />
<br />
- We're going back through priest classes to find any major balance issues. Currently we're focusing on healing, secondary abilities, and the value of each class in different situations. <br />
<br />
- Shields and blocking. We're reviewing the impact of giving an innate chance to block when using a shield. We'd like increase the value of shields, and make it a worthwhile choice for players who might normally dual-wield weapons or use a two-handed weapon. We're working on balancing this against classes which use shields by default, and therefore wouldn't be making any trade-offs to equip a shield. <br />
<br />
- Lull spells. We're watching the impact of recent changes to be sure these spells remain useful, but are not over-powered. <br />
<br />
- Riposte and Enrage on planar mobs. We're looking at alternatives to make these abilities less punishing on common planar monsters. <br />
<br />
- Tradeskills. We're reviewing the current recipe line-up for any gaps in skill progression, and items that aren't appropriately rewarding for their difficulty. <br />
<br />
Thanks for playing, <br />

<br />
Umm, you DO realize Monks took a major hit about 3 months ago?<br />
<br />
let me break it down for you REAL simple like...<br />
<br />
Health<br />
<br />
Warriors = 2<br />
Monks = 1.2<br />
Rogues = 1<br />
<br />
Damage<br />
<br />
Rogues = 2<br />
Monks = 1.2<br />
Warriors = 1<br />
<br />
Monk's aren't meant to tank you say? Fine - up their damage output. Monks aren't meant to outdamage Rogues you say? Umm, what is their role then?<br />
<br />
 <br />
Currently we're focusing on healing, secondary abilities, and the value of each class in different situations <br />
<br />
Um guys - I know those l337 monkeys you have in the test department gave you a 'thumbs up' but in case you haven't notices - dr00ds get a spell which costs the same mana as its Shaman counterpart and delivers 1000 more healing.<br />
<br />
Secondary abilities?<br />
Different situations?<br />
<br />
Be afraid - be very afraid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">They also might be looking at our 60+ heals versus the slow mitigation.  With mitigation, there is no reason to make our other spells in that era suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The flag thing sounds interesting, but you will still need the entire guild to go back and reflag those without to give them non-raid access.  They should just give each successful raid a number of extra flags to dole out to members who could not attend because they were having a tumor removed, were in a multi-car collision, or had a fuse blow.<br />
<br />
Just think, you could sell the extra flags to raise money for dots or just give them away to people so eventually everyone who bought PoP could fully use PoP.<br />

Then to add insult to injury they totally yanked one of the new Shaman heal in PoP. Is it balanced? Possible, but debatable. Does it still sting? Yes.</div></div><hr />

They made things so frikkin hard for so long, and slowly added in recipes and items to fill the gaps, that people are happy to see new things.  Noone ever expected it to be good, so when it has a use, they're happy.<br />

<br />
It means clerics will get extra goodies as well as druids, and shamans will be untouched, because we have slow...  Not trying to make an agruement between the &quot;we're all fine&quot; shamans and the &quot;we need fixing&quot; shamans.<br />
<br />
Shields and blocking. We're reviewing the impact of giving an innate chance to block when using a shield.

We're working on balancing this against classes which use shields by default, and therefore wouldn't be making any trade-offs to equip a shield. <br />
<br />
I'm confused by the last sentence.  Are they saying classes like clerics, shamans, druids who usually always wear a shield, won't benefit from this?  Or, is this directed towards paladins/SK's that switch shield/1h and 2-handed weapons?  I don't know too many paladins/SK's that use a shield by default.  Most use 2-handers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Remember when nobody used 2h weapons, because they sucked compared to 1h ?  Now its common to see even warriors using 2h weapons.  They are attempting to retune the 1h + Shield option to make it viable as well... without massively changing the game for those who use 1h + shiedl by default (priests, casters).<br />
<br />
I dont see any reason not to give us the same benefits of a shield that the melee types get, but specualting on what those benefits will be is pointless at this time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Well, it's common to see warriors using 2-handers because of the common riposting PoP mobs do.  Dual-wielding + ripostes = a healer's heart attack or a warrior's death.   The riposting, of course, is being looked at according to them.  But yeah, I don't why anyone who wears a shield can't benefit.</div></div><hr />

My skill is at 180 and I still fail occassionally on SOW potions or damage shields.  Most of our recipes are worthless due to excessive cost, so even though I love making potions there is seldom a call for them.  If this is &quot;working as intended&quot; it is truly a shame.  This could be a useful skill, particularly in the high end game if Sony would allow it.<br />

I actually think they might be on to something here .. although why they would tell us beforehand is little mystifying.  Unless of course there is a huge nerf coming  /cringe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Kaneras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I find it hilarious they want dual wielding classes to use a shield instead of dual-wielding.  As far as I can tell they are talking about warriors, rangers, rogues, bards.  The only class who might do this to increase defense is a warrior, at the risk of losing agro.  Rangers and Rogues can't tank in PoP period, so using a shield will just reduce damage output.  Bards...maybe, though I would assume a bard is already handicapped without double attack so using a shield would bring his melee damage down to nill.<br />
<br />
What are they thinking about at SOE, is beyond me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only way it will work is if there was also innate hate when slamming/bashing (or make it a cheap AA) along with increased blocking.  There's at least one shield I know of (Stormrider Carapace) with a hate inducer when bashing.  Combine all of the above with a reall good hate weapon, it might be an interesting, alternative way for an MT; extra AC, extra blocking to help the MT survive.  After all, the main reason for MT is to hold agro and stay alive as long as possible.<br />
<br />
This shield thing has been in &quot;the works&quot; for a several months now.  This is the first time in a while though, this has resurfaced.</div></div><hr />

- We're going back through priest classes to find any major balance issues. Currently we're focusing on healing, secondary abilities, and the value of each class in different situations. <br />
<br />
<br />
Ok, this brings up a question in my mind.  What do they consider shamans' secondary ability?  That depends on what they think the primary ability is.  The way it stands now, shaman healing is a secondary ability.<br />
<br />
What are the major balance issues between us and other classes?<br />
<br />
1.  Healing - we are very unbalanced here.  Do our other abilities make up for it?<br />
<br />
2.  Damage output - We have very low dps for short fights, but can stack on a fair amount of damage over the long haul with DoT's.  Additional abilities to DD other than cold would be nice (e.g., poison DD around 900ish).  Fixing rabid bear would provide a nice option for damage output that would allow us to stack better.<br />
<br />
3.  Buffing - we're overbalanced here, so much so that we can't get any useful spells due to the existence of 4 useless str/dex buffs at 62/64.<br />
<br />
4.  Debuffing - We are better than other priests here, but slow mitigation has changed this in PoP.<br />
<br />
5.  Flexibility - We are specialists at stat-buffing and debuffing.  Anything else we do can be done more efficiently by other classes.  Our edge in these specialties is slim.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Look at every major raiding guild's roster and look where the balance problem is. Clerics outnumber every other class by at least 2 to 1 margin, some classes to probably 7 to 1 margin. There is your balance problem.<br />
<br />
Then again, I have negative 400 confidence on a scale to 1 to 10 in VI's uber coders and designers. I am sure they'll screw up something bad again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Priest Balancing?<br />
- Clerics get double attack and Knight combat caps. Clerics cheer, without realizing the cleric class no longer exists. There is now Paladin, and Paladin with a hammer<br />
- Druids get Cannibalize, a new CHeal, and be able to cast a spell in PoK to render all port stones useless.<br />
- Shaman will get Turgur's reduced to 70%, with a 10% chance of 80% hasting. They will then add group Inner Fire at level 9, to make up for this.<br />
<br />
Shields<br />
- Knights will be moved ahead of Warriors just that much more, with their great ratio one-handers, and probably dual-weild bash damage, combined with added tanking from the innate block.<br />
- Warriors switch to two-handers.<br />
- Rangers ask &quot;We get shields?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tradeskills<br />
- Tailoring difficulties will be lowered. Drops will be made rarer<br />
- Smithing and Jewelcrafting will be combined into a tradeskill only Human enchanters can enjoy. This will be called Smithcrafting.<br />
- Brewing components will no longer be sold on vendors, since it will be decided that that makes it too easy to whip up a bottle of kalish with a different bottle graphic.<br />
- Baking will use more alchemy sullies. Alchemy vendors will have a limited amount of herbs, ala high quality ore.<br />
- Speaking of alchemy, it's working as intended.<br />
- Unfired pottery items can now be mooshed back into the base components, to skill up from 1 - 16. Go figure.<br />
- Half Elves will be happy to hear that fletching is now their cultural tradeskill. Though the drops are rare, Half Elf Rangers will finally make their first imbued Karana bow - and be pained by the bug that renders the bows usable only by HLF RNG, rather than HEF RNG. Ooooops, another win for Norrath's super-race.<br />
<br />
Charm<br />
- Necros will no longer be alowed to charm undead - deemed &quot;overpowering&quot;<br />
- Druids will lose dire charm, also &quot;overpowering&quot;<br />
- Enchanters can Smithcraft a permanant charm item (trivial 150) that allows them to carry their pet through a zone line.<br />
<br />
Tanking<br />
- Beastlords get monk nerf<br />
- Paladins get 300 Defense<br />
- That is all<br />
<br />
PoP flags<br />
- Sorry, we messed up, this will not be going live, until after we find 51% of the player base is flagged. Remember like we did with the velious teeth?<br />
<br />
PoP parchments<br />
- All parchments will now drop in the Elemental Planes. Runes have been moved to Plane of Time.<br />
- On a side note, Mystic Abomin has mysteriously vanished from our database. We suspect the culprit's name is Henora.<br />
<br />
PoP mob riposites / enrage<br />
- We reduced the damage these fellas do on these attacks, but had to put that extra damage into their normal DPS.</div></div><hr />
