<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jannia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ever since the patch a few weeks ago, I've notcied that many of my Roots are working a lot better. Has anybody else had similar results? Yersterday I had a mob Rooted while I nuked it 8 times and then it died while rooted. I still have some mobs that quickly bust out of the root within seconds, but some are now lasting a very long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>bakkal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm a pessimist when it comes to &quot;It acted different today, it must have been changed.&quot; I tend to believe in today was just a run of bad/good luck.<br />
<br />
But after killing Katta guards all weekend at level 57.  I found I could enstill and nuke many many times without a root break (Would break at the timer)<br />
<br />
I'm used to every fight I'm in being extremely lucky if one root holds on a nuke and 2? Not a chance.  Not saying it was changed, but I noticed very similiar results. <br />
<br />
Root/Epic/bane/4 nukes and still rooted and almost dead. Happened multiple times.  Doesn't seem a coincidence to me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Oddly enough, after having used Enstill for root parking for maybe 2 years, I've just given up on it and started using the basic root spell.<br />
<br />
I know that Enstill is supposed by Verant to be used for this purpose but I'm either having a very long streak of bad luck with it or its broken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>jannia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I rarely relied upon rooting but since it seems to be working a lot better IMHO. I'll be glad to try out my new lv49 DoTs and let the mobs stew in their juices a bit before sending in the dawg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Paralyzing Earth is a true upgrade from Root,<br />
but it's too goddam expensive, so I almost never use it.<br />
Cept for splitting spawns.  Like when two high level mobs are sitting next to each other, and I only want one to come.  I root one of them and slow the other as it runs towards me.  Then I slow the rooted one.  Pull the non-rooted one back to camp for the melees to work over.  Paralyzing Earth works great for this application, I've seen it last up to 3 minutes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>jannia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It's creepy now, it's working through some really rough fighting. While I was in a group within KC, I casted the simple root on one of the pulled gnolls at the start of the battle and the mob died before the root broke. During the battle there were 4 tanks bashing at the mob and none of the fighting broke the root.  It happened twice like this last night. I'm not saying it's the perfect spell because it was failing a lot while fighting mobs at Maiden's Eye. It would break within 10 seconds on a good cast. One mob resisted the spell 5 times before I gave up on casting it.</div></div><hr />
