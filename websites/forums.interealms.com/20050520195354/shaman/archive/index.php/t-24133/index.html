<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Munkh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well when I made this shaman it was with the intent that he would be guilded and be a good grouping/support character. <br />
However with changes in my personal life and in the EQ realm that has not been the case. I trained in Alteration and got skills all the way to 200. <br />
Unfortunately I have found over the last 10 levels that I have mostly solo'ed. So as a result I decided to go and reset my specialization to Conjuration. <br />
<br />
I am just curious for some imput from other shamans out there who perhaps don't do guild/group functions all the time. Is going with Conjuration really help ful? Did you choose to stay with Alteration?  Give me some feedback please.<br />
<br />
P.S. oh ignore the magelo profile it's way out of date. sorry</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Alteration all the way, no matter how you play. IMHO (I play a variety, solo - group - raid).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>wakonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Alteration will always be the win, specially if you go Qbuff 3, you get a quickening of mithaniel drop, I would suggest do it, I wore a haste of mithaniel range item for so long...I recently upgraded for hitpoints dmg shield and regen, I hated my decision, so I was out 110 hitpoints, it doesnt make up for the fact you can actually save your own arse or others. My opinion but hey? its just an opinion.<br />
<br />
       I think back to the Kunark Prima strategy guide, there is a sentance in there I have found very useful to this day, regardless of how SoE views us, &quot; The best-Healing shaman is the most useful&quot; Meaning fastest cast, and most powerful heal will net you groups over slow anyday.</div></div><hr />

I went Evocation waaaaay back when and haven't changed it. I do just fine in healing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">if Yoppa's Spear was Evoke instead of Conjure I might be tempted to go evoke. Either way, it doesn't really matter, hard to blow mana really.

Talk about the worst advice ever.. alteration then conjuration as sf. I'm sure this guy goes oom much faster than the other shaman he raids with.</div></div><hr />

Who said it was advice you moron. I love people who put words in my mouth.<br />
<br />
Also, on the contrary, I rarely ever go OOM period. Clueless jackasses like you speak about someone without knowing them.<br />

Evocation suited me much better than Alteration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I too started as an evocation specialized Shaman. I changed my specialization to alteration a few days before Kunark when I took a close look at the spell lists. <br />
<br />
Back then we nuked a lot(I even stopped DoT kiting after the DoT nerf and used DD kiting) and specialization was believed to do all kind of things(lower cast time was just one of rumors). So this isn't anything strange for those who were playing back then.<br />
<br />
I am evocation and alteration specialized now btw(both at 200 due to bug) as I rarely ever go oom from anything, much less from nuking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Same here Giac...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Alteration is better, regardless of your play style.  But not everyone plays to min-max. /shrug.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Evocation constitutes 4 spells from 50-65.  I believe it is 2 spells from 66-70.  What you are saying is that you cast those spells more than any other groups of spells marked alteration or conjuration . . . unlikely (except for certain botted characters--and if they wanted a nuke bot, they'd make a wizard).<br />
<br />
Specialization was parsed at a flat percentage mana savings.  I believe it was parsed at 10%, but I may be misremembing.  All your heals, all your buffs are alteration.  If you need mana, it's almost always going to be for healing since our heals are so inefficient and we have to spam heal or something.  It's rare we need just that little extra mana to land a nuke.  So if, as you say, you rarely run out of mana, why not have your specialization in something that will help in situations where you are most likely to run OOM?<br />
<br />
Sorry, Aruman, I have to agree with the others--evocation just isn't a good choice.  Whatever floats your boat, I guess.<br />

Someone asks for advice, you give a &quot;statement&quot; that sounds like advice in response to it, but it's not advice. Ok I can buy that.<br />

Then you say I'm a clueless jackass because I spoke about someone without knowing them. You are a hipocrit, unless you think my 2-3 sentences was enough to get to know me. <br />
<br />
What exactly do you do at raids, what mobs are you fighting? Personally I'm only a 7kmana shaman, add spec makes it roughly 7.7kmana shaman, I always run oom chaining my heal. <br />
<br />
I would like to learn something from you. So go ahead, enlighten me as to what you do during encounters that keeps you from going lom or oom.</div></div><hr />

Hypocrite? He asked what we specialized in and I replied that I had specialized in Evocation, this was back when Evocation better suited my play style. Whenever someone asks me for advice, I always ask them how they play. Solo more than group... etc. I never tell anyone what they should get, only to look at how they play and then decide.<br />
<br />
As far as what I do on raids:<br />
<br />
I do what helps at the raid. Shaman don't *have* to heal all the time. I use assist healing and heal when I have to, not because I can. IMO the Shaman adjusts to the situation, they don't follow a script.<br />
<br />
I nuke, CC, debuff, tank, DoT... it all depends on the encounter. That's the wonderful thing about a Shaman, you can adjust to be helpful in all encounters becuase of our flexibility.</div></div><hr />

Heh... It worked for me, and very well. I solo'd from 50 to 60. I am assuming you grouped more.<br />
<br />
All I can tell you is I play smart, not haphazardly. I also take my equipment/focus effects into account. Specialization isn't the whole picture my friend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>windfinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I have gone conjer, and made a choice to do so when I did so (that was a pain makeing all the bread since canni is alter and i did not want that). In my opion if you dont think about it you will go alter just from all the canniing you do. but in a normal fight I will cast (grouped or solo or raiding) 1 alter spell (slow) or maybe 2 (if I need to malos incase my sini neckless did not hold) then I will cast anywhere from 2 to 30 dots (again depending on the place the 2 to 4 in most groups more if a good tank up there, will run 4 to 6 dots on raid bosses for upwards of 6 minetes, and will run 8 dots while soloing or sometimes hit 9 to 10) for DD's I normal do rains and posion resist unless I have to do ice then I do them. so all in all I looked at all I did and found almost all my alters where cast while I was sitting and during down time where as the vast magority of mana I spit out in combat was conjer based. it was a no brainer I wanted to be efficant in combat not in sitting on my arse. plues with canni-danceing (and yes since thay put in the numbers for mana I have varivied that even with canni4 you can STILL canni-dance to further incress your mana regen while also getting your HP regen .... oh and a side note the game thinks you are consently sitting so over time your rate of HP regen will go up becouse of the patch thay did for the melee plues I am a iksar so I in essence look at it as I am turning around 40 or a little less in to 82mana a good trade off.) I have always been right next to the melee swing my wep grouped or duoed or solo and have not stopped now.<br />
<br />
But your milage may very I build my self to be very combat orintated and am always looking for ways to help that. wepaons hold a higher place in my list then gear. I am almost elemental flagged but still have 3 to 4 pieaces that are from plane of hate on. quite a few items are bazaar bought. I have fully self buffed somethign like 3.4k hp and have 3.7k mana but I tend to work it to the point that it seems like I am doing more then most of the other shaman (ahnd yes maybe speclize is playing a role in why there acting less often but it would seem that I see stuff quicker since I am constenly paying attetion to the screen, the combat going on the, where everyone on raids and such. I am exsited that with the new dots our high tri stack comes out to roughly 2700/tick in damage unfocused so roughly avrage over time of 3000/tick with a very unlucky crit possability of 6000/tick. very few shaman will beable t sustain such a stack for long (just like very few tanks will beable to out tuant you) but I am happy that for my guild I bring to the table a DPS right now around 250 to 300 (we have normal a derth of shaman so I am the 5th or 6th wheel normal) just need to incress my mana regen and suply now with gear and I will be golden.<br />
<br />
Hay a thought just came to me, gear for melee means a incress in power and duribility, becouse thay already have a very high enderence. where as gear for casters does not realy (well maybe if you include only the damage focus items) give the caster anymore power, it gives them durability and incresses there enderence in a fight. nacked a caster can pick up a stick and he has a LOT of power but he will be spent very quickly, where as a melee can pick up a stick and though he has a moderet amount of power, he can keep useing it endefnetly. <br />
<br />
just a thought to ponder on as this now effectivly burys this topic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd love to see you calculations for this!!  Please list spells used &amp; stacking order, as I'm clearly using the wrong ones.  On my list, I calculate I'd need to stack 9 dots to get to 2,700/tick (just about possible with new spell slot) but I doubt many people run around with no other spells loaded.  And according to my figures, that'd used your entire mana pool to load (ignoring resists, which'd be high with no debuff).  Also, combined they'd take at least 49secs to land, which means u'd need to be a master of juggling in order to get even 1 tick of 2.7k.<br />
<br />
I will generally stack 1,153/tick max, using 4 spells (Blood of Saryrn, Breath of Ultor, Bane &amp; Anathema) if I'm going for max dps in a long combat - i.e. root rotting.<br />
<br />
Lastly, in order to keep on thread, I'd recommend Alteration as main &amp; Conjuration as Secondary forte.  <br />
<br />
Even if u intend being a &quot;nuker&quot; then Evo is a bad choice IMHO.  U'd be better off going Con as main &amp; Alt as 2nd &amp; using the poison nuke line.  These have much higher dps &amp; u have a realistic chance of getting them off with a mob beating on u.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I will generally stack 1,153/tick max, using 4 spells (Blood of Saryrn, Breath of Ultor, Bane &amp; Anathema) if I'm going for max dps in a long combat - i.e. root rotting.<br />
<br />
<br />
Right now I can exceed 1,153 a tick with 2 DoT spells. DoT's generally don't stick so well on a good number of raid level mobs though.<br />
<br />
DD tends to work better on raid level mobs. Cold line and/or rains are what I use most of the time on raids. Both Evocation. Suits my previous choice of Evocation pretty well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>ShiverMetimbers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Which 2 DoT spells?  I don't have them yet, but my understanding is that Curse of Sislak is 546/tick &amp; Blood of Yoppa is 429/tick.  I'm not aware of any 2 better dots for dam/tick.<br />
<br />
Just for clarity, I was quoting raw damage, before Burning Affliction or any other focus - as per the original claim.  But if you really can stack that much I'd be interested to know how, so please list all focus etc. you're including.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>windfinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">oks for a tri stack yes that would be the top spell in each line and for tri that was 3 of each. tri this disease last darn near forever, so have them and curse up first. drop the disease and then mem in the posions. that is 6 spell slots and I reguler remem spells in a fight not that hard just know your book like /book 3 gets me the top 2 dots in my for each line plues AoE and single slow, on page 4 is unrissistable debuffes, root, cripple, avitar, VoTB, can4, and summon compainion. now as for droping your entire mana bar, nope in practice with my AE4 and my speclize I can normal load all 9 spells on one target for around 2 bubs maybe a little more then hit can5 (if I am doing that many normaly I am in a raid and the cler heals me even if I through up a Q) and hit canni 4 and chance you get. and resist on raid mobs is that bad. I have a very good luck landing my dots but that could be becouse I am in melee range or just out of it. the disease ones are the only ones that might take some doing to land but there also the lowest aggro so you can start them very early in the fight. after the disease take a choise etehr drop your posions or drop the curses, most time I do one of each working from smallest to largest then there you go just keep them going and canni when ever. the thing is before the curse I could pretty much go forever but since the curse it cuts in to your mana much faster then.<br />
<br />
ture burning down a mob would only be usefull in soloing in a raid I normal just run top 2 dots and mana free ones (spear and if there is room in the debuff stack and I got the time bone of bertox witch that 35 points has got me the kill shot a couple of times). asfor cast time AH cuts down quite a bit of time off the dots. makes it much easyer. not saying that my damage does not fluxuate and I keep all dots on but at most I only have 1 dot off on any one tick (expecaly if your curse and posion die at the same time).<br />
<br />
asfar as base damage with the 3 new dots from omens being 450pos, 577cur, 180dis, and the top two of 328blood, 214bon, 420Bane, 278anath, 131breath, 111pox gets you 2689 unless my math is off and a avrage focus help of 10percent gives you 2958 so my numbers where just aproximets drop a bone in there and there you go over 2700 but was not including the mana frees. if I had ABoN would use the 254 instead of the 214 and that would get you over as well.<br />
<br />
and while the new spells would add 1848mana on to the 2860mana stack already for 4608total with the AE focus (also the new ones have a higher effect but there you go) of 25percent specalived as a straight 10 percent (35) 10percent on SCM (45) and if I am doing this then I drop a charge from my focus psotions for magic and posion for a extra 5percent from each (50curse/pos, 45disease) so that 4608 turns in to a messly 2304mana. if I can finaly get enough peeps to get me my extended affliction item (or get the one that drops from omens) then it will just make it easyer to keep up becouse mana cost over time would go down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Which 2 DoT spells?  I don't have them yet, but my understanding is that Curse of Sislak is 546/tick &amp; Blood of Yoppa is 429/tick.  I'm not aware of any 2 better dots for dam/tick.<br />

<br />
Of course DoT's won't always do max damage based on Focus effects, and I have yet to find an item with L70 Focus on them that I would use over my current equipment, but:<br />

I think if you average the non-crit's from the following log you will probably find that the average damage per tick is over 1,153.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>windfinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">stistily speaking over a long enough perion of time most people have found that the avrage help from a focus item comes real close to the half the max value or around 22percent for up to 65 spells from your focuses. now since thay included a drop off so that effects go above and beyond yours are working ar a 12 percent bones but that is probley fairly close to real bones depending on how thay come up with the rate of drop off for them effects ..... actully just figured it out with your named effects on your Curse dot it is operating at a 38 percent max bonus and on your posion it is operating at a 36 percent bones. so I am betting that for at lest the effects you have it is a 44 at level 66 then a 2 percent drop off from there. but seeing as how you dont have the disease version of that effect cant test it for the max hit of the upgraded dsiease dot should be 255 or 256 asumming same drop off rate. If you included half of your crits your Dps and also your avrage gain from your focus items would go up.<br />
<br />
does anyone know if the AA that adds to the damage of your crits works with our dot crits or not?</div></div><hr />
