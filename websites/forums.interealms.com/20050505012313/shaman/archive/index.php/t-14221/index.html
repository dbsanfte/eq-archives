<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Man im coming up on 14 hours. I thought the soul stripper was rediculus (12 hours ), atleast the mobs there drops other useful things. I have officaly labels this at the worst camp in the game atm :p<br />
<br />
Im just thinking the spirits that after this i will never have to camp a long arse camp for a key/shard/whatever, ever again. Alteast till the new expansion /sigh. I hope in the future that things like this VP key and the shards will be slightly reduced. Hell, Shards were nothing compared to this stupid VP key =\<br />
<br />
Anyway , how long did you camp this dude?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Michael J. Kaspar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No more than a couple hours.  Most of my key parts were like that though.<br />
<br />
You sure you are in the right spot?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>wsbsteven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Spend 3 camping sessions with the 3rd one having Verix Kylong already up before I got there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i think i am , i went to the sewer and im in a room with the  Decayed Kylong Iksar in a room with 3 other skellies thats a dead in next to a room with 3 skellies.<br />
<br />
i came into KC and went right, followed that all the way to the back and entered the sewer there. once i came out of the water i went right then tookt he lil right side passageway/door. turned left and that was the room with 3 skellies and the next room is the dead end where  Decayed Kylong Iksar is.<br />
<br />
at first i was clearing both rooms , then just the 3 skelly room and pulling  Decayed Kylong Iksar, now im just camping iside the door pulling 1 skelly int he corner and  Decayed Kylong Iksar.<br />
<br />
I followed the info from http://www.geocities.com/mct_02/vpkey.html<br />
<br />
which says<br />
<br />
The VP quest guy spawns in the sewers. Enter sewer from moat, when you rise out of the water take a right and then the next right (if you take either of the lefts you come across additional water spots, looking forward to exploring these some day). You'll be in a room with a staircase on your right-ish and two adjacent rooms on your left. First left room has 3 skeleton pops, next room has 4ish skeletons and the VP fellow / ph. He's a shaman, he summons.<br />
<br />
If im in the wrong spot at this point id be happy lol, 2 or 3 hour camp sound so much better then what seems a endless one right now =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Between 6-8 hours, by far the longest camp for the VP key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">First time 1-2 hours. 2nd time, about 10-15 hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've found him up when I went there, I've gotten him after 4-5 spawns, and once it took 6 hours for him to spawn.<br />
<br />
Usually it is pretty fast. I was the guild's official Verix MQer for a while, I got that piece at least 5 times.<br />
<br />
Normally the worst part is the Pained Soul, but I got supremely lucky there...the PS was up when I was heading to Seb for an XP group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jeradin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Went down there, buffed an exp group in trade for looting it. <br />
<br />
Guess it took 1 to 2 hours for it to drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Let's put it this way: I started at level 58, by the time I finished helping camp the medallion for all my guildmates, I was nearly through level 59.  <br />
<br />
It's real streaky, I've seen two pops in a row and I also remember 37 PH spawns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">not as long as the pained soul.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Scardrak1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">He just happened to be up when I went down there.  I got lucky, in that most of the camps took me at most 1 hour...with the exception of the Ancient Jarsath.  I thought I'd never get that piece done!  <br />
<br />
Maybe it'd be easier to just have a tracker friend check KC periodically.  You could probably just ask a ranger in the zone exping to check track every once in a while.  I'd imagine if they are exping in KC they're probably not working on the VP key.  There will be exceptions I'm sure, but it's probably a good bet they won't be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">sigh. i guess im in for another LONG night of camping greenies that give no cash or exp but have enough HP to be a pain =(<br />
<br />
logged time ...  15.5 hours</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">He's a veru uncommon spawn. When my Paladin got Celestial Cleansing I soloed from 59-max 60 there and only saw him maybe four times - and that's fairly low. Unsoloable for a gimp 60 Paladin, at that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Got it in 5 spawn cycles... a bit over a hour and a half, I think. It wasn't too bad. The Pained Soul in TT was a lot more uncooperative.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I lucked out and got all my medallion pieces real quick. Verix was up when I went looking for him. Pained soul was probably the longest, but even that one wasnt bad. Killed the placeholder for about an hour one night, then I camped and went to bed. Next day I logged in and killed the placeholder again and pained soul spawned the next time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Just wait till the exp &quot;revamp&quot; hits the live servers. Those skellies may at least be exp then.<br />
Your description of where you are at is right on. You got the right room.<br />
<br />
I use to camp down there all the time just to rake in exp, seen him many a times and helped many a people get pieces. Hard to say what his average spawn time is, but he is not common by any means. That area was one of the best exp places if you knew your way around and what to pull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I did this at 60, was my last peice but wasn't too worried as xp was ok here at 60 (over half Db, easy kills)<br />
<br />
Probably took 5-6 hours over 2-3 days to get him in all, was a fun solo at 60. FV and DL were longer camps for me overall, rest was fairly painless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Got him :)<br />
<br />
logged some , over 16 hours. pained soul was only 3.5 and rotting was 15 min lol<br />
<br />
man, that was a test of will :p <br />
<br />
<br />
ok , can we please ban together and find and tar and feather the guy who made up this quest please ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Up to 10 hours on that damn skelly. last piece I need. Was 16 on pained soul but at least that one I could just kill him then afk until he respawned with no fear of death.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I have helped make at least 5 VP keys with MQ's etc and the real &quot;key&quot; to doing this quest is not to camp anything.  Just check on spawns in your spare time and knock out a few PH's then get back to whatever you normally do.  I'm not sure about everyone's regular EQ day, but I always have time between exping and raids for this kind of thing.<br />
<br />
After killing the pained without camping it multiple times, I am damn sure they NEVER intended people to sit there and shuffle PH's for key parts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>kowalsky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">took me 3 sessions too for verix.. 2 times for about 6 hours straight without him.. on the third time, I went back to KC and he was up :)<br />
jumped in the room, landed my best dot and just watched him died :)<br />
<br />
pained soul was faster.. less than 1 hour</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">About 4 hours total, most of it solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">took me a LONG time to get venrix.  i soloed it pre pop.  used some ITU potions and a bit of luck.  took a LONG time.  was worst camp for me by far</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Cleared the cellar about 8-9 times and got him to pop, but we were mid-50's and wiped on him (I was the healer and took some nukage and died, they didn't have a chance without me).<br />
<br />
A second time, cleared the cellar maybe 5-6 times and he spawned, a friend got the piece.<br />
<br />
Litgruv, have you done the VT key piece camps?  The ME camp is worse than this one, IMO.  What a pain in the rear.  I hate that zone with a passion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Hadd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">duoed it with a pally , took me 6-8 hours  ( for one verix ) . <br />
longest vp camp for me was the undead guy in firona , i camped everything ( 6 hour camps for pained soul and aquagoblin ) and it was the last part i needed for 4 months ! i would come and force myself to pass by and ask paladin and clrs to do sense the dead ... but he was never up ..<br />
<br />
Hadd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Torlaan02</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Only about 30 minutes for me. But I used up all my luck on that quest. Got all the key pieces in about 2 weeks time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Hadd, I got the FV piece by sitting on the hill near the entrance to the temple with my druid while I worked on the other computer (work work).  Took about 8 hours of doing that before he showed up.  I logged in my main and waxed him.  That piece definately would have been a pain any other way.<br />
<br />
The saving grace of this camp is that, for now, NOBODY is contesting the spawn.  I never saw a soul out there, at least not coming out for that purpose.  If they revamp VP and everyone wants in that's gonna change for sure.</div></div><hr />
