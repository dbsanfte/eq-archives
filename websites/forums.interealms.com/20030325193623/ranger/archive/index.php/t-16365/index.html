<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>AtcMickey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Where is good place to Fear Kite i hear Rangers talk about, and what exactly Is it? Stupid former Int caster. Sorry <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Amise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Fear-kiting:  pull an animal, snare it (can pull with snare if you wish), then cast panic animal on the snared mob.  Run behind it and WACK it until it falls down dead.  :D  You'll need to re-apply fear every 10 seconds or so.<br />
<br />
I started fearing in my late 20s, killing mammoths in everfrost.  These are great cash and xp until 30, then if you want to continue fearing, Stonebrunt (cats and other animals) or Iceclad (cougars, wolves) would be a couple of good places.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>magimix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That pretty much sums it up for me :-)  I ground my way from 30 to 32 at Everfrost, fear kiting mammoths.  The XP was fairly low risk, and I made about 1000PP  as well.<br />
<br />
Fear kiting is great for the simple reason that the mobs are running away, not hitting you.  My own preference is to pull the mob with snare, unless it is a contested mob, in which case I may pull with an arrow, and snare while they run over to me.  I would suggest you make sure the mob is snared before you cast panic animal though - some of these mobs can run damn fast, and if they are social they could bring back some unwanted buddies to help them out.<br />
<br />
Of course, fear kiting works best in large, expansive outdoor zones.  Because you may do this while soloing, it is vital to have root and tangling weeds memmed as well, to quickly manage any adds that may turn up.<br />
<br />
I'll have to check out the other suggested zones, but in the meantime I'm going to be checking out the Griff action in North Karana.</div></div><hr />

LOIO - (/shudder) sabretooths/grimalkins <br />
OT - tigress<br />
EW - mammoths/rhinos/walruses.. and dont forget Icefang -- named wolf near Kael (in some huts) -- can snare-and-scare --nice exp with about a 10 minute re-pop -- no faction hit)<br />
Dawnshroud Peaks -- rockhoppers -- go light blue about 53<br />
PoJ -- rats -- NOT social, so no adds.  <br />
<br />
getting 1%aa on baby blues, 2%aa on true blue.  not great, but if you play at off-times or have limited time and want to get that great solo exp, nice to know you can always go rat-hunting if you need.<br />
<br />
good luck.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">At 25 fear-kite the Mammoths of EverFrost until 30 (can leave at 27 though) and then go to Dawnshroud Peaks, fear kite Small and Reg Zels or melee shrooms till 34 then add in Large Zels, at when Zels (reg) go LBlue add in the wolves. This can take you to lvl 47 very fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Azareal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">And just a quickie side note, snare pull, back up a bit, cast Panic Animal, run in start whacking away at mob (you'll get sick of staring at the behind of mobs soon), make sure you Kick the moment you engage the mob, wait for second round of Kick and then fear again. The mob will never touch you. Just watch for adds though.</div></div><hr />
