<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys, Kytherea has asked for volunteers for a new class correspondent since Sudedor stepped down. If you feel like you'd be a good fit for the role, please send her a PM (on the SOE forums).<br />
<br />
http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Shaman&amp;message.id=3209<br />
<br />
Note: I threw my hat in the ring last time, but SOE didn't choose a correspondent from any of the class sites, so I'm not going to volunteer this time. Good luck to our new class correspondent, I promise to do a better job working with them!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Gloriana,<br />
IMHO, if you have any desire to be the correspondent still, you should reconsider and apply again.  If you were to apply, I'd happily /feedback an endorsement, as would half the posters on this forum most likely.  You are probably the most respected shaman in the community (&quot;An Addition to the Class!&quot;), and you have experience organizing communcation with and working as a liason to SoE (such as with the recent epic 1.5 issue and with the compilation of the &quot;petition&quot;).  I know SoE was stupid enough to turn down your application the first time, but perhaps the fact that their last correspondent quit out of frustration will motivate them to try to score some points with the shaman community by choosing the most qualified candidate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Not even if they paid me one billion gajillion fafillion dollars.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I do not want Gloriana to be the SOE correspondent...she's much to valuable to us here at the crucibile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Being a Class Correspondent will be a difficult job, since many Shaman tend to have very different views of what a Shaman should be.  I think the perfect candidate would be one who is respected in the Shaman Community, who is impartial to all ideas but has a strong desire to increase the prosperity of the Shaman Class, and is able to have good communication skills.<br />
<br />
This person would be able to address issues that are important for both the raiders as well as the casual players.  Working with a community as large as us is a daunting task because every person wants a say in how the Shaman should be.  It is the responsibility for this person to compile all of this information into a clear, concise manner to present to SOE on behalf of the community.  Also, there are times in which this person needs to know what battles to fight.  If you take on too much, most likely you will find yourself frustrated, burnt out, and the fire you once had is gone.<br />
<br />
Hopefully, there will be someone up for the challenge, and I tip my hat to that said person.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Dear Everquest Subscriber,<br />
<br />
You have been recommended by an associate who assured me in confidence of your ability and reliability to prosecute an appointment of little to no consequence involving actual-sounding class balancing issues requiring maximum one-directional information flow. We are top officials of the Everquest Development Team who are interested in subscription money of shaman through vague and non-committal responses to recommendations that are presently trapped in long threads on The Shamans' Crucible.  Due to the extreme length of these threads and proximity of lunch, my associates and I are unable to directly access these recommendations.<br />
<br />
I have therefore, been delegated as a matter of trust by my colleagues of the panel to look for a crucible partner to whom we would mention the sum of 20,500,000.00pp (Twenty Million, Five Hundred Thousand Platinum). There, we mentioned it.<br />
<br />
You responsibility, and please accept my word of honor that these negotiations are 100% safe, would be to gather said recommendations, condense them into an itemized list using simple, easy words and post them on our class forum.  Please leave enough space for our possible comments.  Six to ten characters should be more than adequate.<br />
<br />
Secondly, you will make numerous posts for the benefit of the shaman community stressing the &quot;good feeling&quot; you have about the &quot;serious commitment&quot; of the development team.  Emphasize that &quot;balancing takes time&quot;, these are &quot;complex issues&quot;, and how the community relations team is currently awaiting feedback from the customer support team who themselves have submitted inquiries to the developer interaction panel who have requested a master list of class definition from the guy who often replaces the toner in Smedly's laserjet.<br />
<br />
In order to commence this business we solicit your assistance to enable us the transfer of class grumbling into your lap.  Please respond soonest with your account and passcode.<br />
<br />
Yours truly, madly, deeply,<br />
Abashabsorenlo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Gloriana.<br />
<br />
Im 100% serious.<br />
<br />
She has the right balance of sweetness and class knowledge, she knows when to kiss a lil ass and when to kick it.<br />
<br />
Ive found a new respect for her recently simply cause of her unchanging ways the whole time ive been here, she has always been active and involved and unwaivering in her efforts.<br />
<br />
<br />
Seriously, i want her for class rep.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">/agreed, Gloriana all the way.<br />
<br />
Damn it, I'm actually agreeing with Litgruv.  I'm gonna have to go take a shower now.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Foramorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Gloriana, by far.  She's been around, like, forever!  And I know she has all of our intrests at heart, and will do an awesome job.<br />
<br />
Let's just hope SoE will listen ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Kidding aside, I would also support Gloriana.<br />

May she forgive us someday.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I say we all do what Loramin suggested and feedback it once we get back in game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'd support Glori<br />
<br />
Problem is I have absolutely no faith that SoE would support her any better than they did Sudedor.<br />
<br />
My belief is that SoE have no intention of ever addressing shaman issues regarding healing and dps<br />
<br />
OMG we got SLOW and CANNI - we r so l33t</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I agree glor would make an awsome corispondant, under 1 condition.  She has the spare time IRL.  However from a comment she made a while ago i don't think this is the case, so we might want to think of someone else to support in case SoE actually bothers to read what's posted here and actually listen to us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Thanks so much for the kind words! I did apply last time and I think it's SOE's intent to select class reps who aren't also community moderators. <br />
<br />
It's also true that I have a job that's very cyclical, when it's slow, it's pretty darn slow, but when it's busy, I spend long hours at work (not to mention all the travel I do).<br />
<br />
I'm sure whoever SOE picks will do a great job!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Scirocco is a mod at the druid grove and is also the SoE class correspondent.  There is obviously not a SoE rule against being a moderator on a class board and also a class correspondent.  If you want the job, go for it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Actually, he is a moderator, but Chenier from the Druid's Grove was the representative at the guild summit. <br />
<br />
I used community &quot;moderator&quot; but I really meant &quot;community leader&quot; but thought it sounded too self-aggrandizing. I was specifically referring to the folks that were asked to attend the guild summit as &quot;leaders.&quot; None of us were asked to serve the dual role as community correspondent, and there were some questions raised in that forum after class correspondents were chosen.<br />
<br />
It's kinda better this way, now there will be two individuals with a pipeline to SOE about shaman issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Horomen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I vote for Millman!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Fine, then lets give em Chutoi, just to drive them nuts :P</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Wondering if Samanna would have tmie?  Seems fairly level headed and consistent.  <br />
<br />
I think the wrong choice is anyone has has deep seated opinions about the shaman class.  Rather, I'd like to see someone who can calmly and clearly convey the general consensus on these boards to the developers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Murtuk of Veeshan (if he's still playing) would be ideal too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Gloriana, Murak and Chutoi would be great single or as a cage-match tag team.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I'd vote for Tudamorf if he was still around. Since he isnt maybe Giac would be interesting too ;)<br />
<br />
But why even bother? What reason is there to have another person appointed to a position where the only thing that is guarranteed to happen is that 99.9 % of what he/she says will be ignored.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Slqmdooley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">You can apply to be the new shaman class correspondant or just go find a brick wall and bang your head against it until you pass out.

Stop trying, SONY does not give a crap about shaman class issues.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Glori would be my first choice.  Murtak, Chutoi, or Sammana would all be second, but very viable choices.  Morbid curiousity and a need to torture SoE would require me to recommend Millman (the Millman of old that is, he seems to have mellowed out last post I saw from him) ... NAH!  I'm not that mean.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I wouldn't want to be the class correspondent because I don't want to have to deal with all the idiots.<br />
<br />
No, not the ones at SOE.  The ones on the Crucible.<br />
<br />
I'm not talking about people with opinions, either.  Just people who can't recognize that theirs IS only one opinion; people who can't bear to hear a differing opinion expressed; people who don't have the patience to deal with others who may not have had the exact same game experience that they have had; people who interpret EVERYTHING SOE does or does not do as a personal attack on them or the Shaman class.<br />
<br />
I don't like the way this board, and by projection the entire shaman community, has become so hostile to differences of opinion.  Disagree with the predominant feeling here and get flamed.  The only reason I find it tolerable is that I can just close the browser; I rarely read the boards thoroughly like I used to.  <br />
<br />
Whoever becomes the correspondant needs to be able to read through all that dreck and put up with the inevitable flames.  Glori would take her share of flames, but she has enough pull in the community here that they would be a lot more moderate than with almost anyone else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Folks, it isn't a matter of &quot;us&quot; picking a representative.  It's a matter of someone &quot;applying&quot; for the job and writing a good enough &quot;resume&quot; that SoE feels they are capable.<br />
<br />
The only way Chutoi, Gloriana, or anyone will get the job is if they apply for it and write a strong enough letter as to why they should be &quot;it&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Sudedor,<br />
<br />
Serious question, should anyone even apply?  Really, will it matter one iota?  Is SoE serious about this or just playing it lip service to keep the masses placated?  I'm all for having a correspondant if they in fact will be able to voice shaman concerns to a group at SoE that is listening and ready to take action.  However, if, as I suspect, no real changes will be made due to having an official &quot;correspondant&quot; then I say, let's not even bother trying to get anyone to apply.  It's just a big waste of time.  Why be a part of this farce?  The top 10 lists have not been updated in months, and the company response to all issues has been:<br />
<br />
1. working as intended, no change planned<br />
2. being discussed<br />
3. being addressed in oow<br />
<br />
None of these is a good response.  No detail, no timelines, no commitment of any kind.  Hell, I wish my boss would take this cr@p from me when I have to get something done.  I've given up on this &quot;so-called&quot; process.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I suppose it is all a matter of what you define as &quot;action&quot;.<br />
<br />
To me, I did not feel that the position was being used in a manner that was at all efficient or even wise.  As I said in my initial post, I do not feel that the communication standards I have were shared by SOE.<br />
<br />
Will you be heard?  Yes, you will be heard.<br />
<br />
Will you receive any sort of meaningful response?  No, not very likely.<br />
<br />
If you find a true &quot;bug&quot; or something that is &quot;broken&quot; (ie not working as intended) then yes, they will respond quickly.<br />
<br />
But as to what we call &quot;Class Balance&quot; . . . no, don't expect any sort of two way dialog whatsoever.  You will be talking to a wall.<br />
<br />
Unless of course you consider &quot;Currently being evaluated&quot; to be meaningful communication.</div></div><hr />

The Zerker rep, who got &quot;removed&quot;, was from a class site.  The removal letter did mention that being a conflict of interest.</div></div><hr />

Swampfunk was removed because he *joined* a group of people who seemed to be out to stir up (*@#.<br />

He said some things that probably needed saying, but he did so in such a careless manner that his message was lost in translation.</div></div><hr />

Right... that's why most of the druids on my server pull their hair out when they look for a group :). Yeah they can solo but... it gets boring at times.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am still a newb to this board but I have played a shaman for over a year now and have 6 lvl 50+ alts of various classes. <br />
<br />
It seems that Samanna has the most level head, besides Glori on this forum from my slim experience here thus far. She cares about us completing things so perhaps Samanna should drop a &quot;resume&quot; on SOE's doorstep :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Can we have Giac?<br />

You've obviously got the knowledge and experience to represent the class.  I enjoy reading your take on things (I've been lurking for quite some time) and think your particular sense of humor would make the reports of &quot;progress&quot; made on our behalf more bearable (sorry).</div></div><hr />

now i go to bed with a cheshire cat's grin . Very amusing .<br />
<br />
<br />
Seems Chutoi real busy in RL .<br />
<br />
So as Giac has applied , he defo gets my backing<br />
<br />
Personally think either Sammana or Glor do far too much for shaman community already .</div></div><hr />

I actually applied, thought about it for a day, then withdrew my application. <br />

I really prefer to be able to focus on what's right with our class. <br />
<br />
Whoever gets it has my support, though. I believe that it's a job that needs doing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For those who don't realize the humour in this - Eduin was a Shaman on the TM (iinm) server who was quite flamboyant in his flames. Now he wasn't always correct, but boy was he interesting to read.<br />
<br />
Suffice to say he makes the flamewars in 'The Grey' look like Mr. Rogers reading a bedtime story.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Pinot Noir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">I really appreciate whoever apply for Shaman correspondant.<br />
But I do not want Glori to be our correspondant.<br />
Because, if other shaman becomes our correspondant, we have 2 channel to Dev team.<br />
It is better than 1 channel to tell our opinion to Dev team.<br />
<br />
And I will try not to accuse or criticize our correspondant.. never.<br />
If we do not follow and support our correspondant, he feels very unhappy and loses eagerness to tell our opinion.<br />
So even if Dev team does not follow our opinoin, we should not criticize our correspondant.<br />
<br />
What I expect our correspondent is;<br />
 To stand on neutral side (not only raider, but also casual gamer)<br />
 To tell not his own opinion but ours to Dev team<br />
 To keep patience between ston-headed Dev team and whinning shamans  :p <br />
<br />
that`s all.</div></div><hr />
