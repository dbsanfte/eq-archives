<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">got it last night in the castle area</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Torpor has been seen as well.  Looks like a rare chance for spells to drop, do you remember what it was off?  I haven't seen any, and we've spent a few hours there (no spells at all), but have heard a few people get some things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sunstrike dropped from a named ghost that roams around a bit between the castle and the cave just to the left of the zone in area. Had a number of spells drop from the named mobs (including rabid chokidai I think), but that was the most notable.<br />
<br />
Shaman wise, not seen any but I'm sure they're dropping. Anywhere sunstrike drops, avatar, malo and  torpor tend to drop too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Know of at least one shaman on tribunal that got Torpor outta Chardok B. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Silverpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Have you noticed that the drops are changing from night to night in Chardok B?  Opening night we were there, got a FT 2 item and several see invis earings.  This week seems to be spells and research items.  Is it just me?  Or are they prepping us for LDoN (Lost Dungeons of Norrath).<br />
<br />
Just a tinking :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">its just you<br />
<br />
We got the earing &amp; FT2 item tonight, we also got Malo (YAY ME!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">its you, things drop from different areas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Uthgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">We had 3 lvl 60 spells drop in a 4 hour period. One of which was avatar. I believe they where from the named around the castle area.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I got pox there myself.<br />
<br />
I'm not actually going to share where the spells seemed to drop most because I like to find that spot empty when I get there...and you should do some things for yourselves. Suffice it to say in 2 hours we had something like 12 or so 59/60 spells drop in there.</div></div><hr />
