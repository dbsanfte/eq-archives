<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ihopp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Join the club. Me (Warrior) and my wife (Shaman) have had nothing but success in anything we attmept to topple.<br />
<br />
We are now both lvl 26 and lusting for mroe blood to shed.<br />
<br />
Currently we just got done cleaning out the Sarnak Fortress in LoIO.<br />
<br />
I was thinking about heading on out to South karana just for kicks and a little site seeing. I would love to explore my options at this point. I would hate to waste the day killing those poor gnolls.<br />
<br />
I know at lvl 26 the northern part of Stonebrunt Mount. is not a good choice. We take reds (Elder Gorilla's) down but with very much resistance.<br />
<br />
So, where are all the good spots?<br />
<br />
