<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sorronn</div><div class="date">10-04-2002, 01:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am going to be blunt here. There are some really great and wonderful ideas being worked on for POP by the developers.<br />
<br />
However, they are supposedly converting the stat fields from 8 bit integers to 16 bit integers to allow for far larger values. This is both a serverside and client side change, unlike Luclin which was primarily a client side change (on the graphics engine).<br />
<br />
Now, couple this major open heart surgery of the game servers with the quality of the last two patches.<br />
<br />
I really want to see POP and play with the new spells and abilities. But based on their (lack of) execution so far, I am expecting a disaster of epic proportions (pun intended).<br />
<br />
How many of you think that we are going to be able to safely play our characters in the first week after POP goes live? How many of you are worried that the changes might be so FUBARed and bugged that playing your character might corrupt him in some way?<br />
<br />
I sure hope that Verant has figured out a way to convert old character backups into the new file format. Otherwise things may get very very scary for the first few weeks after POP is out. (Lost all your gear? Your stats are totally messed up? Sorry about that, we can't roll you back.)<br />
<br />
What I am saying here is that the dev team seems bright and hard working but the team responsible for implementation does not seem to be able to pour water out of a boot with instructions printed on the heel.<br />
<br />
Opinions?</div></div><hr />

Just a little bit of history repeating.  But it will be worked out in the end and  im fairly sure that you wont have to be paranoid about losing any gear or stats.</div></div><hr />
