<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Post-patch, does your selection of a pet really matter all that much?  After browsing various boards, I'm finding that the popularity of King B is going to fade, and that you might as well get &quot;interesting&quot; pets, rather than Snarler, Takk or King B.<br />
<br />
So.... recommendations on interesting pets?<br />
<br />
At lvl 10 as a NE hunter, I ran over to the river between Durotar and Barrens and tamed a crocodile and brought him back to Darkshore.  He gets a lot of comments and its fun.  <br />
<br />
I was thinking about that named white bat in Silverpine or those flying snakes in WC.  <br />
<br />
Anything else that's kind of unusual?  I don't really care about stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kryscha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I tamed a &quot;Slithid Protector&quot; on my Tauren hunter, but they're quest triggered only, and it's a horde quest. Level 18 or so from memory. The cool part is that every time I summon him, or log in after logging out with pet up, is that everyone sees the message, &quot;A Slithid Protector crawls out of the sand to protect it's eggs&quot;. It's a crab model, but with a colouration I haven't seen on any others.<br />
<br />
I have no way of knowing if it has any special abilities; I just play for fun and rarely pay attention to that side of things, but crabs in general are both decent tanks and do decent damage.  It does swim quite fast, and will easily catch fleeing mobs if they're in water. Plus, he's so gosh darn cute, with that little mouth and his crab walk   :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If I had to do over, I'd get the armored boar from RazorFen Kraul and stick with him.  I got one at level 37, but since he is level 28 I could not bare the pain of leveling him up 9+ levels.<br />
<br />
Boars are good all around pets, with good hp, armor and dps.  The black armored one is the toughest looking pet in the game.  Pic below.<br />

BTW, he makes a squeling noise that can be a bit annoying.  Also, imho, the flying pets are too much of a nuisance.  Especially the bats, their wing span is so large that they are always flapping their wings in your face and blocking your line of sight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm a big fan of the Pridewatchers (http://www.eldersofamshara.com/screenshots/disp.asp?pic=34)  (purple'ish tiger) or any white bear myself. Though both seems to be getting more and more popular, so not as unique as they once were.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I notice higher level hunters are getting owls and on the alliance side (just before we kill one another) I've seen many sabrecats as pets</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">At level 17 I went to The Barrens (I'm a dwarf) and tamed a Savannah Patriarch (male lion model).  I've stuck with him through thick and thin.  I picked up a few other pets along the way, but ended up dropping them.  I tried the Wind Serpents from Barrens (like their coloring better) and for a bit had a Worg from Shadowfang.<br />
<br />
I picked up Snarler not for his resists, but because of his model.  I ended up abandoning Snarler and picking up a higher level version (Witherbranch Pup) from Hinterlands.<br />
<br />
Have the wolf and lion right now.  Happy with both.</div></div><hr />

Yep, that's the one that I have now.  He's 28, got him at 31, so it's not too bad, although rest xp screws me for letting him catch up.  He is cool looking and pretty unique.<br />
<br />
I go for uniqueness/rareness personally, but then I'm not a big min/maxxer.  I had the pink tallstrider, but as mentioned above, I tamed him (level 9) at like level 27 and it was hell trying to level him.  I've tamed Humar but he's not that rare.  <br />
<br />
I never see anyone with boars or crabs or crocs or tallstriders at high levels so I figure I might be a bit uncommon at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Macheras,<br />
<br />
If you level him to 60 you will in fact be very unique.  I have yet to see anyone else on my server with him, at any level.  The fact that he only spawns in a Horde instanced zone, far from any Alliance quests, makes him even harder to get to than the ZF serpents.  <br />
<br />
/salute.  Wish I had gotten him at 31.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Cool, hopefully I can stick it out.  I have a quick /abandon pet finger sometimes when I see a new possibility hehe.<br />
<br />
I do wish they would make it easier to level a pet.  Like I said, when I was level 27, I tamed a level 9 pet and I eventually got him to 20 before I gave up.  It was excruciating.  Basically like playing without a pet at all.  Would be nice if they gained xp really really fast to at least get within 5 levels of you or so.  But oh well.<br />
<br />
For alliance, getting the pink flamingo tallstrider over near Thunder Bluff at level 9 would be really cool I think.  I may try to do that on my alt.  At one time I took my orc to Darkshore to get a grey-skin bear model, some named bear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">/agreed.  Leveling a much lower pet is just too painful solo.  Best way to do it, imho, is to group or at least duo with someone that can be the tank.  Therefore, you don't need the pet to tank and he merely becomes a bit of extra dps (when he gets to the point where he can actually hit the mob).  Luckily he doesn't have to do damage to get exp like we do.  Just have him tag along on a couple of nights of group killing and forget about him.  A couple days later you will be happy to see that he leveled 10-20 levels in that time.<br />
<br />
When I hit 60, one more level to go, I'm going to grab the pet I decide I really want regardless of level and work to get him to 60 over time.  No hurry, will just bring him along when teamed with guildies on low risk stuff.<br />
<br />
Maybe I'll get the boar again, maybe a Sin'Dall, the bengal tiger, who knows?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">http://www.enterealms.com/forums/showthread.php?t=915<br />
<br />
I'm starting to wonder why we even GET pets?<br />
<br />
SHEESH!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yeah, we are taking it up the @ss again.  I had said in my previous post that I will be retiring my hunter, ala my shaman in EQ, over this crap.  However, at this point, I'm leaving the game if these changes go live.  Blizzard will have proven to be even more incompetent than SoE, and I did not think that could happen.  They should not be in the MMORPG business, period.<br />
<br />
Great game, being F'd up by horrible infrastructure, non-existent customer service and morons on the development team.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">They're now saying the pet DPS issue was unintentional, and they're investigating the cause. Also saying with the new &quot;vs defense&quot; combat they'll be looking into all the +dodge and +defense gear and adjusting it accordingly.<br />
<br />
Time will tell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, I read those empty promises, hell, they are not even that.  How long have they been &quot;looking into&quot; the pet runspeed bug.  These changes will go live as is, mark my words.  Hunter dps will be deceased, both ranged and pet, by 15-30%.  I will ding 60 tonight and retire my hunter.  <br />
<br />
And I agree with your other post Val, I already cancelled my subscription, ends in 2 weeks, and I will probably never buy another Blizzard game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I wouldn't toss in the towel just yet bud. Let's wait and see what happens.<br />
<br />
I'll be the first to admit news of impending nerfs is disheartening (and getting pretty old/tiresome), but I'll also be the first to admit that the last negative change (pouch/quiver bonus decrease) hardly affected my playstyle. I was 58'ish when that patch was pushed and I hit 60 within 2 days after that.<br />
<br />
I'll give it a try and see if it adversely affects my perception of &quot;fun&quot;. If it does, I'll join you and Faern in the 'retired/cancelled' arena. If not, well...guess I'll keep playing until it's no longer fun.<br />
<br />
Willing to wait and see myself, but I'm still far from impressed with their current customer service and communication abilities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">2 weeks to see what happens.  Then I'll either let it expire, or renew.  I'm not rash, just not optimistic.  <br />
<br />
Good Hunting.</div></div><hr />
