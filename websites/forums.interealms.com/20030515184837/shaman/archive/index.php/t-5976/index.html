<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>LUEWEN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ok...here's the dilemma folks.....looks like a friend of mine did the Envy of Woe part of quest 2 times and he now has too much faction. What can be done to reverse this or lower the faction? please help....if you can email me at davedepaul@aol.com <br />
thank you all for your help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Pumyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Don't think it's possible to have too much faction. Shaman friend has handed tear to Rak on 8 occasions since he got his Spear of Fate (so was maxed then), the faction hit for tear handin is fairly high and he has had no problems getting Rak to spawn.</div></div><hr />
