<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>iso2202</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I always give my pet a pair of rusty weapons,have 3 bags full of em, but i still have some questions<br />
<br />
1. Does the Damage/Delay matter? if not could i just get em a weighted axe and watch em hit for 60somethin every hit?<br />
<br />
2. Does 2 weapons Speed up his hits?<br />
<br />
3. Does giving him weapons in general really help or just a nice lil extra boost?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dirkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1) I don't think so. If I recall, dogdog has an internal damage/delay that i sunaffected by weapons. However, if the weps have procs(like mage summoned), then dogdog will use those procs(if he is high enough). And max hit for dogdog is 60, so even if he did use weapon damage, a weighted axe wouldn't do much good.<br />
<br />
2) Yes. Giving him 2 weapons allows him to duel wield, which shaman pets cannot do innately. I don't remember the DPS numbers very well, but basically if you give him 2 weps, he hits twice as fast.<br />
<br />
3) Yes. See 2. His DPS almost doubles if I recall. I know there are some parses lying around somewhere, but I'm in a bit of a rush and don't have time to find them and call them up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) not at all<br />
<br />
2) and 3) Yes because it makes him dual wield. Dog has innate double attack, but doesn t dual wield. So you need to give him 2 weapons to make him dual wield and so he can quad now. So about the help or extra boost, you just make twice more damage with dog dog, up to you to decide how usefull it is. ( if you can find weapons secondary only, then only one of this weapon is enough to make dog dog dual wield )</div></div><hr />
