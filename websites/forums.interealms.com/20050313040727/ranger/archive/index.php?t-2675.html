** Cleanup Patch ** <br />
<br />
We're sorry to have to patch again so soon, but there are some issues that we felt should be taken care of right away. <br />
<br />
- Fixed NPC's multi spawning in Grimling Forest <br />
- Fixed a spawning issue related to the Coldain 10th Ring War <br />
- Fixed assorted issues with several other zones <br />
&lt;b&gt;- Fixed a bug that made archery work like Innoruuk's own machine gun &lt;/b&gt;<br />
- Fixed the Petrifier ****atrice name truncation in Dreadlands <br />
- Fixed Innoruuk's Chosen name truncation in the Plane of Hate <br />
- Fixed a memory leak in the animation player <br />
- Tavee's shoulders effect has been changed to specifically exclude affecting the duration of the Donal's Chestplate timer effect <br />
- Naki's rings now report the altered casting time properly <br />
- Most NPCs in the world will now return items that they don't care about. Summoned pets can still be handed anything you like <br />
- Fixed a bug that was causing GMs to be incomprehensible to players if they did not share a common language on Firiona Vie <br />
&lt;b&gt;- Fixed a bug that was preventing players from being able to turn off /roleplay on Firiona Vie &lt;/b&gt;<br />
- Fixed a bug that was causing bard song modifiers (such as Instrument/Singing Mastery and Puretone) to break if the combined bonuses went too high <br />
- Fixed a bug that was causing some quests to think they required a higher faction than they actually did <br />
- A quest for a new high level Druid spell is now live (requires Luclin) <br />
- Addressed a balance issue with high end Magician and Necromancer pets by improving them. (Half of this change went live lastnight but was missed in the previous patch message.) <br />
- Improved many rewards in an overall rebalancing effort of many Luclin encounters. (This went live lastnight but was missed in the previous patch message.) <br />
- Made stacking changes to allow more spells to stack with Dance of the Blades. <br />
<br />
- The EverQuest Team <br />
<br />
<br />
** News arrives from Freeport ** <br />
<br />
The streets of Freeport have been overtaken by greed and turmoil. The conflict between the Dismal Rage and the law-abiding citizens of Freeport has reached a boiling point. New heroes have been called on to aid both sides in the constant power struggle of this city. Numerous guildmasters have advanced the training that is given to all those brave enough to rise from Freeport, either for good or for evil. The Commonlands have also started to see strange new individuals and even stranger creatures. &lt;b&gt;There is also word that the Deathfist Orcs have begun to stockpile supplies for an unknown reason. Citizens knowing the nature of the Deathfist Orcs are preparing themselves for anything. &lt;/b&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
** Late arriving news from Ak'Anon ** <br />
<br />
It has not been long since two wayward gnomes returned to their home city of Ak'Anon, one empowered with gifts of a Paladin of Brell and the other wielding the dark knowledge of a Shadowknight of Bertoxxulous. Already pupils have flocked to the chapel of the Deep Muses and the mines of the Dark Reflection to learn the secrets and skills these opposing masters possess. Led by their new champions of Brell, the Deep Muses, Gem Cutters, and Eldritch Collective have begun a campaign to exterminate the Dark Reflection from the mines of Ak'Anon and their cherished homeland, the Steamfont Mountains. <br />
<br />
I love how &quot;we changed our minds&quot; becomes a bug fix. I played on FV early on, when you could turn off roleplay, and read the damn patch message where that bug was patched. Now putting it back to how other servers are is fixing a bug? Fix what you like, rethink what you like, but don't call a change a bug fix.<br />
<br />
The bit about the orcs may suggest that the howling caves or whatever might be a reality.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Oh goody, it's nice to know that going through hours and hours of camping and searching will reward me with Woodsman's mail that isn't made worthless by the effort and level required to get it...<br />
<br />
...or maybe, just maybe (sarcasm there, folks), I'll have to be an uber-equipped rogue in Triton, TMO, FoH, BotS or (insert random &quot;uber&quot; guild name here) to see any effects.<br />
<br />
I'm glad they're fixing those encounters.  Really.  I mean, what's a crippling flaw to an entire class' &quot;spell of all spells&quot; when the poor rogues only get a 19 delay piercer instead of 15 delay?</div></div><hr />

Actually, according to VI's messages that they were posting before this patch, the newsest change to allow using the /roleplay flag on FV was so that you could more easily find people to group with for XP.  They want to continue the role playing intention of the server, but people were having HUGE problem finding people that they could group with to earn XP and do things.  Besides, if you are using the /who list to see the occupents, then you are already 'breaking' roleplaying intentions, so you would only see this other info if you are already sidestepping the roleplaying aspect.<br />
<br />
They also opened up the Shout and Auction channels for the same reason, it as WAY to hard to find people to group or trade with if you are restricted to only /say range conversations, or have to /tell ever person in the zone one at a time to find someone.<br />
<br />
And this grouping and XPing is also the reason why the team-grouping restriction is being removed.  It was decided that it was your CHARACTER's roleplaying that should decide who to group with, not the game engine.  Enchanter and bards are a good example of this.  They can illusion themselves to accomplish things with NPCs that would normally KoS them, so they should have the same abilities to use that against players (a DE chanter changes into a high elf, or visa-versa).</div></div><hr />
