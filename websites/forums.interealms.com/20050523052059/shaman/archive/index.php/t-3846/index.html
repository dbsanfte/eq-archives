<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Moved my trader out of Bazaar to try and exchange some stuff with my warrior who kept going LD.  When I zoned into SH my trader could not move - not an inch.  I camped and that did not help so I shouted to see if anyone had a quick fix for me.  Seems things don't have weight in Bazaar and when iI moved him out at 330/110 he became stuck from the weight.  A nice fellow cast str on me and I was able to crawl back into Bazaar, where once again he could move freely.  <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hehe, that sucks.<br />
<br />
I'm spoiled.  I can get my STR to 255 at will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Pingpang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm only repeating what others have posted, but  can't you always move (regardless of how overweight you are) by strafing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Get a sow, can always move then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Alliza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yep, weight makes no difference in the bazaar.  <br />
<br />
Nice bazaar feature, but sucks if you forget and gate or port out when you forgot to bank first. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah, especially bad if you zone out into SH, where you can't be Sow'd.  Those trader satchels are heavy too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Snicker, I did this the other day. Logged in my druid to run her to Kael during a raid. Completely forgot she had two traders satchels on her.<br />
<br />
Arrived in WL and was crawling, took me a mo to figure out what on earth had gone wrong, the shame of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I had just zoned into SH the other night when I get a tell fom a level 1 bard standing just inside the zone in.  He had zoned into SH with 44k on him and couldn't move at all.  I tried buffing his STR, but he still couldn't move.<br />
<br />
He was pretty brave considering he didn't know me at all, but he gave me his plat and I zoned into the Bazaar.  He promptly went LD.  After about 20 minutes, he got back on and I gave him his plat back.  I got a thank you and I felt good, but I did waste a lot of time.  That's what I get for being nice and trustworthy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Strafing should work.<br />
<br />
Alternative might be to duel, and knock him backwards into the zoneline.<br />
<br />
Does levitate work?</div></div><hr />
