<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So last night I got to help raid ToV for the first time. I'm level 55.<br />
<br />
The one thing I noticed (I was main slower there for the raid) was that turgurs would not stick no matter what. Obviously I tried to malosi (don't have malosini or malo yet obviously) first and I think I landed it.... maybe twice out of probably 30 pulls. So I broke out insideous malady (don't have insideous decay yet, /mad spell tradein quest) and plague of insects and used that. Obviously turgurs would have made things much smoother, but better some slow than no slow, right?<br />
<br />
My question is, what level am I going to have to be to semi reliably have a good chance of landing malX and turgurs on HoT mobs?<br />
<br />
Also, I have to say that was one of the most fun raids I've ever been on, although it woulda been nicer if I wasn't a guild initiate so I could roll on the phat chain lewtz :D But that will come in time ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Whenever you like to hear or not, get 5 more levels and Malo. Even HoT is very tough if you don' thave at least Mala. Slowing needs combined effort from at least shaman and enchanter and sometimes you even need a bard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Anything with the word &quot;Ancient&quot; in its name you can pretty much forget slowing till 60 (you will need malo/tash/oos to land malosini/slow on these). <br />
<br />
Racnars can also be hard. <br />
<br />
To be genuinely effective slowing in HoT (I assume you are talking about HoT) you will need to be 60 and use malo/oos/tash/malosini/slow. Even then you will still occasionaly get resisted and die.<br />
<br />
I didnt start going to HoT till 57 and even with tash/oos I found it really really hard to stick malosini/slow unless a level 60 shaman was there to cast malo. Its just a fact of life that mobs are hard to slow there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Glimmer drakes (butterflys) can be slowed with diease slow, but are for all intent and purpose immune to magic line of slow.<br />
<br />
But yup sounds like you did the right then. You won't be able to turg till 59/60 with any real consitancy unless you have a mala'er or malo'er there with you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">yeah, I've pretty much concluded that I have no choice but to work on 60 (I want malo and torpor anyway ;) ). Just wondering if it's possible to land turgurs more than one in a million casts before 60.<br />
<br />
Last night we had no bard, no mage, and no higher shaman. We had 55 chanter tash and 55 shaman slow. That was it. I landed malosi twice I think, and never a turgurs, but I could land PoI on *almost* every mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The key is not being level 60, the key is having someone who tash's someone to malo/mala and someone to oos.<br />
<br />
With mala tash and oos we consitantly have a 54 shaman that slows things with no problem.<br />
<br />
At 58 I have very few reists on tugurs, but if the mala person leaves the raid, I have a difficult time slowing anything.  My only hope seems to be to chain cast malosini until I get it to land.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Atlet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">With malo/malosini and tash you shouldn't have any problems slowing mobs in ToV. If you are under 60, better bring a mage or two that can land mala/malasini to help you out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wargbearjumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">At 60, in HOT, I generally need Malo, and a Tash, and then I can Reliably slow with Turgur's (nearly 100%)<br />
<br />
If you move deeper into HOT into the nameds, or Dozekar, or into NTOV, you are most likely going to need Malo, Tash and Occlusion of Sound from a Bard to land Turgur's without many resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cantiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Let me make a suggestion, have at least 2 lvl 60 shaman. One to malo and the other to slow. Gaurdian drakes in NToV will eat you alive if slow does not land. Before the disease counters where added you really coulnt taunt a mob off very easy but now that it has changed and supposedly fixed it still generates more agro then before teh disease counters where added. Dont try casting on them unless its malo'd/mala'd and tash'd to increase your odds of landing slow (and thats if your level 60, dont even try if your not)<br />
Also, level means every thing in EQ and the higher the mob the harder it is to cast on. The difference 5 levels make in landing spells is huge when in a zone like ToV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ssik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Anyone ever use Togor's to get a foothold on a mob?  I don't know if it's resist rate is any less or if the level of the spell has anything to do with it, but it's nice to be able to chain cast slow if nothing else...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yup yup. <br />
 I can't comment on what it is like at 60, but at 57 i used togors alot and i used it occasionally at 58.  At level 60 tugurs is 75% and togors is 70%.  If the 5% is going to make or break you, then you probably shouldn't be in HoT.  So if togors lands, I don't even bother with tugurs.<br />
<br />
Might be different with uber mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Corwil Delyonhart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">What my guild usually does in Halls of testing is slow the named and regular mobs with Mala + Tash or Occlusion then Malosini. After that any of the 54 + shaman we have can slow the mob. <br />
<br />
When we don't have those there you can land DR debuff and then do the DR slow on most mobs.<br />
<br />
Aggro is going to be a consideration if one person is doing too much of either type of debuff chain. When I first tried out DR slow and debuff it was suicide cause I was the only shaman on that particular raid. <br />
<br />
Also to note - some of the druid class mobs have a damage shield, so make sure to time your debuffs with your person dispelling ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">does anyone have any real proof that lower level spells should land better than higher ones? it makes about negative 10% sense that they should, and I have yet to see some conclusive tests / proof.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Did HoT when I was 56 for the first time, had the exact same problems landing stuff.  Was a total bear ;).  Used Decay and Plague to make us have a chance.  (and this was during the double slow aggro month, I died ALOT).  But we didn't have Mala either even.<br />
<br />
Now and days, I'm 58, we tend to have a lvl 60 doing the real slowing.  But I can land cripple or Malosni  pretty easily after Tash and Mala have been cast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Last night I was shaman #3 in our HoT raid.  We had 2 lvl 60 and one 57 (me) shaman there.  I let the big boys malo and tugur, I'd lay it on with insidious and PoI.  I was suprised how often I was able to slow those big suitcases before the tugur shaman were.  Malo, tash, ooc all take a long time to land (especially with timid chanters).  I like PoI as a backup slow, helps save slots for the 60 boys too as I can cover the shimmering drakes better.<br />
<br />
Although not slow related, I really like torrent of poisen in this zone.  The mobs can't be mezzed anyway so the AE doesn't really matter aside from getting unwanted aggro.  Half of the mobs are really suckers for ToP.  1620 damage on a single mob in 3 ticks while you drop in 2 JBB shots makes for some nice damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Padraic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I agree with those that say it's all about debuffing.  I was main slower on one trip to HoT, and did just fine.  But, I waited until Mala, Tash and Occlusion were all on the mob.  With any one of the 3 spells not already on, getting turgurs to stick is a real nightmare.  I dont know how much Occlusion debuffs, but it seemed to be the one you can get by without the most.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">OOC debuffs 25% MR/CR/FR ... its the lowest % of debuff, but every bit counts.</div></div><hr />
