<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Looking for some solid guidance on how a warrior can beat a shadow priest.   I've dueled my wife's priest many many times at various levels and I haven't beaten her once.  She's not even full shadow spec'd.<br />
<br />
Here is how the fight goes:<br />
- battle stance, charge... start swinging... oops, absorbed by her PW:S<br />
- switch to berserker stance, she fears me, berserker rage to break fear... try to MS whenever I get enough rage<br />
- meanwhile, I have Vampiric Embrace, SW:P, and Mind Flay on me... even the short time she has me feared is long enough for her to Mind Blast me<br />
- her fear cooldown is 26 seconds with talents... berserker rage is 30 second cooldown.<br />
<br />
In summary, I hardly ever can even break through her shield before I am dotted/feared/nuked to death.  A shadow priest with vamp embrace, PW:S, and Renew on is almost impossible to even damage.  PW:S has a very short cooldown too.<br />
<br />
I know I probably just suck.  Looking on the priest boards, about half of the priests say there's no way they lose to a warrior and about half the warriors claim there's no way they lose to a priest... <br />
<br />
36 Arms/5 Fury/10 Prot spec'd.  I typically wield Princess 2h hammer or Massacre Sword.  Not great, but not that bad either.  AC without shield is about 4000 or so (not that it matters a lick), hp's are at 4950 unbuffed.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
EDIT: I'm aware that ranged guys are gonna have an easy time (although still have to battle through shield and overcome renew and vamp embrace) and I'm aware that a rogue's dps is probably enough to blast throught the shield and stuff... warrior has neither option unless I get very lucky with crits.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Gonna post this on the warrior boards when I get home from work and wait for the &quot;learn to play your class&quot; responses from the warriors that beat shadow priests in their sleep.<br />
<br />
I did post this on the priest boards and received no responses... maybe what I say is true, dunno.<br />
<br />
Maybe I should put &quot;thread killer&quot; in my sig again hehe... my threads go nowhere and if I post in yours, it will die :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Psychic Scream needs nerfage, or they should make Howl of Terror instant cast too... howl already has a longer cooldown :(<br />
<br />
It's stupid that priests, the best healers in the game, are the best fearers and wielders of evil shadow magic &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">LOL!  GL finding the answers you're looking for.  I'd have posted but I have yet to play either class to any level where I'd know enough to be of use to you.</div></div><hr />
