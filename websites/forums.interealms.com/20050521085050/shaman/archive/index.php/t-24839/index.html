<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hail,<br />
<br />
I've retired my spear and will traverse Norrath no more. :o <br />
<br />
Took my family to Disneyworld the week OoW was released, and haven't really played since I returned.  I really should at least log-on to give away some very choice tradable toys (manastone, fungi, chok cords, etc) to friends, but owell. :rolleyes:   Maybe I'll get around to it eventually.  ;)  OoW sounds like it would be just barely good enough to keep me going for a few more months, which is one reason (of many) I didn't buy it. :p <br />
<br />
I've put my computer in my son's room for his use, and our &quot;message board&quot; computer in my eldest daughter's room.  Now the only machine connected to the Internet is my spouse's, and our router is lying unused on a shelf for now.  We've recently moved &amp; the long 8' table that used to hold 3 &quot;primarily for EQ&quot; machines side by side is now in our garage holding up tools &amp; some boxes. <br />
<br />
I don't foresee myself returning for EQ2, WoW, or any other online MMORPG.  They just eat up way too much time, even if it is a very economical form of entertainment.  It was a good run, but I'm done.  I'll be playing Morrowind, Halo2, &amp; any # of other free online games I can quit (or save game) from at the drop of a hat without feelings of guilt.<br />
<br />
I'll browse the boards here for another month or so, then I'll probably be done posting as well.  I'm transferring IRL for some training for the first half of '05 at the beginning of the year (which won't let me cruise the Intenet from work anymore), and then I'll be off to Hawaii for another sea tour on one of the submarines based there in the summer.  Submarine duty and MMORPG's don't blend well. :D <br />
<br />
Thanks everyone here for putting up with me (too many to thank individually to name here).  I'd like to hope I've made some tiny contributions to our community in my time here that maybe helped a few over the years.  I definitely learned a TON of information and received loads of great advice because of these boards.  :cool: <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kelorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Take care. Also if you're looking for offline games (you mentioned Morrowind) you should check out The fourth elder scrolls game, Oblivion. Looks really cool. Check it out at www.elderscrolls.com if you haven't seen it already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Good luck to you Frekk. It sounds like your reasons for leaving are more related to RL than the actual state of EQ. Nothing wrong with that. Find something enjoyable. I tried Morrowwind, it was OK, but I got a bit tired of the &quot;Run-Get&quot; quests that just keep piling up. <br />
<br />
Personally, I re-installed Alpha Centuri for a bit of diversion from EQ during those times I cant dedicate myself online. Love Sid's games.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Good luck to you, Frekk. A-Gang bubblehead here ... few years ago that is. Congrats on the upcoming Hawaii tour also, bra!<br />
<br />
And sorry, Samanna, comparing jump wings to dolphins is much like saying a McD burger is better than filet mignon. Only true if all you can get is a McD burger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">You were one of the good guys and I always respected your thoughts and your posts.<br />

Good luck to you.<br />
<br />
And no, don't give away your gear.  Who knows what will happen or if the bug will bite again.  People can live without it and it would be nice to have if you come back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Hail Frekkels!<br />
<br />
If they had a vote for most-helpful crucible member, I'd vote for you.  I can't count the number of page long reponses I've see you provide to those seeking guidance, all without a hint of elitism.  I've seen you remain polite where most of us would have pulled out shotguns.<br />
<br />
Take care and keep your stuff.  Makes it much easier when you come back. ;-P<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Barm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">No offence to anyone else here but Frekkels is on of the people i will miss the most around here.<br />
<br />
I fear even a very minor marginal part of people mourning Frekkels leaving will be concerned when I leave hehe.<br />
<br />
Good luck Frekkels!!!</div></div><hr />
