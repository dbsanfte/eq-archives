<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Larsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all-<br />
<br />
I've been doing some selling of old gear, trading for profit and have upgraded my gear to a kinda plateau for my level (38), I think.<br />
<br />
Here's my stuff:<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=494623<br />
<br />
While there are some easy upgrades out there they don't seem really cost effective, ie replacing the totemic bracer with a engraved bracer +1 Ac +3 WIS for 1kpp.  The jaundiced stuff has to be the best cost/Ac stuff out there.<br />
<br />
I kinda like the effects on the mask, ring and bracer that is-Spell Haste II, Manna Con II, and Affl Eff II.  Ill prob upgard these post-lvl 44.   <br />
<br />
Anyway, any and all suggestions are appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

Edit:  Oh I have around 4kpp to spend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Your stuff looks pretty good for your level, only suggestion I would make would be to lose the two earrings and replace them with Black Sapphire Electrum Earrings.  While you lose a total of 2ac and 8wis, the +mana gain (50 total) probably comes close to equalling out with the wis loss and you would gain +70hp.  Its a relatively cheap upgrade, I think around 300pp per earring.</div></div><hr />
