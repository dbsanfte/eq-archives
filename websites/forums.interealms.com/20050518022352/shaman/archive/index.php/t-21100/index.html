<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aemon Talishan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was reading some information about Ssra temple to procrastinate from studying and came across the Glyphed Covered Serpent event.  <br />
<br />
Basically, i was wondering how difficult this event is.  My guild can field maybe 15-18 folks, virtually all 60+:  <br />
<br />
Tanks <br />
------<br />
2 warriors, 63, 65 (~5300 unbuffed hps on 65 warr)<br />
<br />
Healers <br />
-------<br />
3 clerics, 62, 2 x 65<br />
2 shamans, 62 and 65<br />
3 druids, all 61+<br />
<br />
CC<br />
---<br />
2 Enchanters, both 60<br />
<br />
DPS<br />
----<br />
1 monk, soon to be 63<br />
1 bard, 65<br />
A variety of DPS classes, all 60+ with many at 65 -- mage, necro, rangers, rogue, etc.<br />
<br />
We are bazaar geared -- certainly no VT/EP stuff.<br />
<br />
Is there any chance of us succeeding?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>korask shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes.  But will you in practice ?  Highly doubt it.  It'd be risky and jobs would need to be perfect.  Ive done this with 12 people before (good number of em bots).  The hardest mob of cycle will be the second one.  It deathtouchs to start fight.   So send in an unsuspecting alt to eat death touch and burn him down.  Rez the dead fast and prepare for a bloody fight.  If you can switch tanks fast youll win.  If you cant get them ready in time im sorry but you'll lose.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ah ok, I thought the Glyphed Serpent was the last mob in the event.  Yes, the second Vyzh'dra would probably eat us for lack of gear.  It sounds do-able with some outside help though -- we do have some ex-guildies who keep in touch who are VT or EP equipped.<br />
<br />
While we're on the subject, does Blood of Nadox cure the dot you're talking about?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Cursed is a range fight. He's stupidly easy provided you have 1) A bard. 2) A couple clerics. 3) Some ranged DPS. It just takes forever. The only mob which is &quot;Hard&quot; per se for a group of smaller numbers to do is Exhiled, as he Death Touches once per minute. Since you only have 2 warriors, this might be a problem. He's also unslowable.<br />
<br />
Here's a Rundown:<br />
<br />
Glyphed: AE Feign Death + DD (slowable with Turgurs). AE is called &quot;Wave of Death&quot; and checks against Cold Resist. having a bard doing elemental chorus is handy.<br />
<br />
Exhiled: AE Fear/DoT (Fire based). Immune to Slow. Death Touches. AE is called &quot;Pyrokenisis&quot;. Again with Elemental Chorus.<br />
<br />
Cursed: AE Charm, AE DoT (2k in 4 ticks). Need Disease Resist. Keep a bard in the warrior group and have them  sing Psalm of Veeshan. Everyone else is to use bows, shirukens, nukes, whatever. It is Imperative that your warrior maintains agro, because if cursed comes away from him and gets within AE Range of the raid, it's easy for you to wipe from him charming everyone.<br />
<br />
Setup: Basically there is a temple on the west end of the basement, with a ramp on the north side of it. Your clerics are to park at the base of the ramp, and the tank is to be on the other side of the wall, which is where the mob is brought. For cursed, everyone must find max range for whatever attack they use.<br />
<br />
Cursed himself is a very long fight, but if you keep him slowed, his melee output is pathetic. I've done the whole cycle with like 16 people, just takes forever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">As others have said, exiled will be the hardest for your group.  He is unslowable and deathtouchs, and you have a shortage of tanks to begin with.  However, I have seen a paladin tank him from 70% to death because the deathtouch is a casted spell - i.e. the paladin can interrupt it with stun (I could be wrong, it has been a long time).  If you can do that, then you might have a chance against exiled.  It is important to have a bard singing AE fire resist (I think it's fire - elemental chorus is the right song).<br />
<br />
Glyphed is easy.  His AE is more humorous than dangerous.<br />
<br />
Cursed is not &quot;hard&quot;, but the fight is going to last a very, very long time with the classes you listed - I am guessing upwards of 30 minutes.  There are two vitally important things to this fight:<br />
<br />
1)  Someone HAS to call the AE.  When the AE is about to be cast, it gets called, and everyone runs out of range, waits a few seconds, and then runs back.  Once you are all uber with lots of HP and MGB heals, you can just fight through the AE - however, when you're first starting, you have to use this method.  We call it the &quot;chinese fire drill&quot; technique.  It will be tricky to get the hang of and if your guild is full of people that don't pay much attention, you're going to have problems.  The AE takes off I believe 500 a tick, so quiescence + bard song + replenishment can pretty much cancel it out. I haven't done cursed since healing wards came out, but they might be worthwhile if you have them.<br />
<br />
2)  The bard needs to be in a group with the main and backup tank.  The bard needs to be singing psalm of veeshan as his #1 priority, and AE disease as his #2.  Cursed cannot charm the main tank while you are in the learning phase of his encounter, or you are probably going to wipe.  There is, however, a trick to keep the bard out of danger.  Cursed is usually fought (never seen it done another way) inside the building on which he spawns in.  He's cornered in the right corner of the building, and clerics stand on the other side of the wall so that they can still CH without being hit by the AE.  Inside the room where cursed is cornered, there are several tables.  These tables will block his AE.  If cursed is properly cornered, a bard can snuggle up against the front face of the nearest table, and be &quot;out of sight&quot; of the corner, thus not getting hit by the AE.  However, his songs will still hit the MT and everyone else in the room.  It is also feasible to run behind the table when the AE is inc, and it will protect you.  Whenever I do cursed, I usually stand by the table so that I can see all the people attacking cursed, but cannot &quot;see&quot; cursed himself.  This allows me to target individual people and check up on their health, which I could not do if I was on the other side of the wall where clerics typically stand.<br />
<br />
If someone can post a screenshot of that room, I can use my amazing Microsoft Paint skills to show you exactly where to stand.<br />
<br />
Also, don't let your tank have a DS besides the DS attached to psalm of veeshan.  If your duel-wielders get charmed, they are going to attack the MT and if he has a raid-level DS on him, it will eat them alive.  First time we did cursed, Cursed only killed a couple of people, but we had a pile of halfing rogue corpses surrounding the MT that had died from his DS.  It's funny as hell, but with low numbers you probably want to avoid it.<br />
<br />
Also, I could be wrong, but don't think cursed's AE has any counters.  RC3 has a chance of removing it, though.  Once again, it has been a very long time since I've done cursed, but I think that is correct.<br />
<br />
Good luck, he drops the best weapons in Luclin.</div></div><hr />
