<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all, first post.<br />
<br />
I started playing Everquest when it was first released, left the game for about 18 months, and have just come back to it; so I'm looking for advice.<br />
<br />
My shaman, Mack Sparkles, just hit level 37 on the Cazic Thule server. Now that I'm back into Norrath, I really want to explore equipment and so forth much more thoroughly, to try and get deeper into the game. Trouble is, there's SO many items it's a little overwhelming. Having done some searching on Allakazham's, most of the items that would interest me seem to be either high level or at the very least need a group to get the appropriate equipment for my level.<br />
<br />
I'm way under powered, so don't laugh (I'm not a power gamer). I still use a Screaming Mace, A crested Mistmoor shield, a Runed Circlet for my head and a couple of bits of Totemic armor. I have low wisdom (132), only about 700 plat and very low stat equipment overall. The reason for this is that I enjoyed finding out about new equipment in game rather than scouring the web and spoiling the find. I've realized now I've had enough of that, and want some more powerful stuff.<br />
<br />
So, any advice? I prefer soloing with ma doggie, hate camping for 8 hours at a time (which is why I don't have the Totemic Helm) and only have Everquest Classic and Kunark. I'm just looking for a nice piece of equipment I can loot (not buy) to feel like I've made some progress without ruining the game for me.<br />
<br />
Any help with zones to hunt, quests to pursue or level appropriate equipment would be appreciated. I've searched these boards, but most people seem to enjoy higher level equipment. What's attainable by a 37 loner shaman?<br />
<br />
Many thanks - great and knowledgable boards by the way<br />
<br />
Mack<br />
<br />
P.S: As an example of an upgrade for me, I started camping the Goblin Preacher for the Cold Steel (?) Morning Star. After 4 hours, I'd had enough, particularly as it's hardly a great weapon. This is how uninformed I am, lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rewts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Mmmmm....<br />
<br />
Looking for things a 37 shammie can solo for equip upgrades in Kunark or classic only.  Talk about a handicap...<br />
<br />
There is an eyepatch that drops in the grave yard in Mist moore that may be a possible upgrade.  Sorry I dont remember the exact name.  There is also a spear that drops of a rare spawn in the kedge keep zone in area which you wont be able to get solo, but you could xp there killing the ph until he pops then ask someone to help you kill it.  That would be a good xp area for you till 39 or so.<br />
<br />
Cant think of much else.  What I would really recommend is buying some Rygorr stuff which drops in Velious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think that's the Bloodstone Eyepatch. Looks like a good item (+3 wis, +3 agi) and is attainable by me. I'll have to fight through some stuff (especially as the last time I went to Mistmoore there was a 35 MOB at the zone line that wouldn't go away). Everything is KOS to me there, so it should be a good challenge.<br />
<br />
Also, I've been there 4 times since I came back to the game, and have never seen anyone there except me. Where is everybody these days? Are they all in the high level zones?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the tip. Kedge sounds good - that zone always scared me a little - hard to run. How does a companion spirit fare in water?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Oh and BTW, I should have the other expansions by the middle of next week, so I'll be ready to expand my search. It takes me a while to get to know places though. I still haven't seen all of Antonica!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Actually, it looks like Chief Goonda may have some items I want. He hammered me a few days back, so I'll try to take him down.<br />
<br />
Anyone got any advice on beating him? It's hard fighting another Shaman. I was wondering if I need to dispel him first, or use Mal-. My usual tactics are slow, scourge, pet, poison DoT if needed, then I step in an take a few hits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Larsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hi-<br />
<br />
I'm was in a very similar position to yours about six months ago.  Played through Kunark, started Velious and quit for 18 months or so.  If you feel that your are going to continue to play for a while, I highly recommend buying the expansions, at least through PoP for the Plane of Knowledge teleport stones.  They COMPLETELY change the way the game is played. No more 40 minute trips around the world.<br />
<br />
The old world is pretty empty now, which can be a mixed blessing.<br />
<br />
To upgrade your equipment you will need Luclin and the bazaar, EC is dead and gone.  You will also be amazed (at least I was) to see what 500 plat will buy today vis-a-vis the good old days.<br />
<br />
Head to the bazaar and forget about totemic.  Spend  some time getting a feel for the prevailing level of prices and buy Ry`Gorr and cheap Jaundiced stuff. Look at metal linked crowns and leaf scale gloves to have something to grow into.  They go for ~100pp on Torvon.<br />
<br />
Sounds like you have the right mind-set to enjoy the game, so get some new toys and have fun!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks Larsson.<br />
<br />
I looked into Ry'gorr equipment, and this is definately the kind of thing I was looking for. Attainable at my level, decent stats and seemingly plentiful. I won't be buying it though - I'll be hunting for it.<br />
<br />
Now I just need Velious to arrive next week, and I'll have a goal.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You might also want to check out the giant fort in FM. 10ac belt, 18ac tunic, forest loop are 3 items that come to mind that you might find useful if you're really that underequiped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Wodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The mobs that actually drop the armor would be very hard around lvl 37, unless you had a full group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Definitely looks like a Kunark trip for me, until I get the expansions. Those Forest Loop earrings look nice. By the time I get Velious, I'm hoping I'll have hit 38 (which I assume is a nightmare level) so I'll have a little more mana to take on some of the lower level Ry'gorrs.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help everyone. It's hard not being a power gamer...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You could always hit Rathe mountains and kill Tabien the Goodly and Glaron the Wicked for the shield of falsehood.  You can solo the epic quest up to that point at level 37 for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Vivyenne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'm on C-T as well, send me a tell if you ever need some advice.<br />
<br />
I'm a grouping shaman though, not a soloing one.  I only solo'ed until 30 and then started grouping.  So I may not have much advice for you but if I'm just hanging out in PoK I can buff you up :)<br />
<br />
Edit:  Bah. Anyone have a place they can host my pic for me?  I'm useless when it comes to this sig crap /grin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Ascendant Order? Is that your guild Vivyenne? It may be time for me to try and proove myself to a guild...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ailith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Try the Kodiaks in EW - just SW of the IceClad bridge.<br />
Nice XP there for 37, drops an ocnl HQ Kodiak Pelt (was selling for 750 on AB server). It paid for probably 1/4-1/3 of my gear. They must have increased the drop rate some because when I started - I'd kill 15-20 and maybe get 1 HQ pelt. The last time was there - got one from 1st kill and the 4th kill, then again on about the 15th kill. Maybe it was my lucky day??!?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">These are great tips guys, thank you.<br />
<br />
I need my expansions. Man, it didn't take long for me to get hooked on this game again...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Eilderts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Luclin and PoP are a must. Try the Beginner's Magic Manual quest as soon as you get PoP, very very nice range item. Ill give you a link to my magelo as I have decent equipment at 35. Remember, aim right now for 160-170 wis and as much ac/hp and hp-regen as possible. You don't need too much wis b/c you can get a KEI for very cheap. Chanters are nice and understand if you are poor. I usually give 1/5 of however much I pulled from the last c3. Thats usually around 25-30pp for the chanter.<br />
<br />
Anyways, my magelo, hope it helps:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>taggletoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Runnyeye comes to mind.  At 37 you should be able to solo the third level if you're careful.  Battlewizard Unak should be your main target because he drops the Black Alloy Medallion 6 AC 5 wis and mana conservation II. <br />
<br />
Warsiliks Woods would be another good place to hit.  The Iksar Bandit Lord drops the Bracer of Scavenging(9 AC 5 Sta and Dex) and the Grachnist drops 10 AC 10HP gloves.  You can also try to get lucky with a Forest Loop off the giants in the fort or you can hike it over to the Frontier Mountains and solo the blue giants there hoping for a loop.<br />
<br />
With your 700pp I'd look to save 100pp more and buy a pair of 6AC/65HP rings.  They will save you much more often than a pair of +7 wisdom rings.<br />
<br />
There really are some good items to be had for cheap if you ever make it to the bazaar.  It's easy to pick up a 10/25 spear for 200pp and assorted JBB/Ry'Gorr pieces for 400pp.  Getting Ry'Gorr yourself would require a fairly strong group at 39 because only the Elites drop it, they're 40-42, hit in the 100's, and difficult to single pull at that level.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">At 37 most of that will be green. Runnyeye is a 10-30 or so dungeon really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">By the time I get Velious, I'm hoping I'll have hit 38 (which I assume is a nightmare level) <br />
<br />
No more nightmare levels/hell levels.  They did away with those a while back.<br />
<br />
No more class penalty to XP, you'll be happy to hear.  The race penalty stands but it's only 5% for barbarians.  There's a small XP bonus for grouping (they are tweaking this on test and it may get bigger).<br />
<br />
No spellbook needed to med.  Just sit.  Works at any level.<br />
<br />
DOTs do full damage even when the mob is moving.  This had been nerfed for a while but was unnerfed.<br />
<br />
There are some new spells, even for your level, but you have to have some of the later expansions to get them (Velious/Luclin/POP).<br />
<br />
There are &quot;focus items&quot; now that affect spellcasting.  Better healing, better DD, longer DOTs, faster-casting spells, etc.  Check on Allakhazam for more info.<br />
<br />
If you get Luclin, you can use the Luclin spires for transportation and it helps things a lot.  If you get POP you can use the books and they are AMAZING, SO much easier.<br />
<br />
BTW there is an all-in-one expansion called Everquest Gold that has basic, Kunark, Velious, Luclin, and POP (but not Ykesha) and sells for not much more than a Velious upgrade.  But I guess it's too late now if you already bought Velious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">everquest gold is sold out everywhere I look.  Was thinking about getting a second accouny..<br />
<br />
<br />
Hear they are coming out with a new boxed set soon though...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Curare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Actually, it looks like Chief Goonda may have some items I want. He hammered me a few days back, so I'll try to take him down.<br />

<br />
HiYa here's some advice for killing goonda. I and my druid friend both were lvl 39 at the time we camped goonda. He used harmony to single pull goonda. After the pull I sicked my dog on his dog, druid snared and dot'ed with whatever dot's' druids get and  I dot'ed with Scourge, venom of snake and then shock of tainted. After dotting I rooted him. My pet took his pet but came out with 1/2 health.  All of those dot's and goonda died kinda quick. I wouldn't try soloing him at 39. Now as far as getting anything good from him it's a very long camp. We stayed there for 5 hours in RL and finally got the Chipped Bone Bracelet.<br />
<br />
One thing you should look out for is Hill Giants, they wonder by. We had only one aggro us in the 5 hours - but I just thought I would let you know.</div></div><hr />
