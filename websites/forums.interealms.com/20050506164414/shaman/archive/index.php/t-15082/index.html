<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Etrigan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings all:<br />
<br />
I'm starting a new Shaman, and I'm torn between making an Ogre or a Troll. I'd like some advice from those who've played these races, particularly the 50+ crowd.<br />
<br />
Troll:<br />
(Leaning this direction because of the regen and look.)<br />
<br />
1. Is the regen chart at Caster's Realm accurate?<br />
    http://eq.crgaming.com/misc/pages/regen.asp<br />
<br />
2. Does the regen make a big difference at higher levels, given the use<br />
    of regen spells/items?<br />
<br />
3. Does the AA regen stack with racial regen?<br />
<br />
4. Is the snare necklace used often at higher levels, or is it more of a<br />
   soloer's tool?<br />
<br />
Ogre:<br />
(Leaning this direction because of the high Sta/HP and the role-play.)<br />
<br />
5. Does the frontal stun immunity have much use in high level group<br />
   play?<br />
<br />
6. Is the low Agi/Dex going to be an impediment?<br />
<br />
Religion:<br />
<br />
7. If I choose Cazic Thule, will it be that much easier to build Cabilis<br />
   factions up with the intent of completing the cudgel quests?<br />
<br />
Tradeskills:<br />
<br />
8. Is there a market for Cazic Thule or Rallos Zek Ogre Cultural armors?<br />
<br />
9. Do both races have easy access to all potion components?<br />
<br />
Sorry for all the questions, but I intend on putting considerable time into this character, and want to make an informed decision. Any advice on stat point placement, etc is much appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your input,<br />
Etrigan</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">&quot;5. Does the frontal stun immunity have much use in high level group play?&quot;<br />
<br />
Considering how many times I get stunned from the front.  Yes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>zimgrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Go ogre....thats just my opinion.   But ill tell ya what I think.<br />
<br />
Regen is nice as  the troll but thats about the only thing I like about them.  Hell, they smell worse then ogres to!<br />
<br />
Ogre:<br />
(Leaning this direction because of the high Sta/HP and the role-play.)<br />
<br />
 Does the frontal stun immunity have much use in high level group<br />
   play?<br />
<br />
Yes.....And hell yes!  This always will be of use.  You always get aggro when dotting and not being able to stun you is the shizznit!<br />
<br />
 Is the low Agi/Dex going to be an impediment?<br />
Not at high levels it wont be.<br />
<br />
Religion:<br />
<br />
If I choose Cazic Thule, will it be that much easier to build Cabilis<br />
   factions up with the intent of completing the cudgel quests?<br />
I dont know about this one....but any faction is fixable for the most part.<br />
<br />
Tradeskills:<br />
<br />
Is there a market for Cazic Thule or Rallos Zek Ogre Cultural armors?<br />
Im currently at 221 and the cultural  and armour I make now I cannot keep in stock.<br />
<br />
 Do both races have easy access to all potion components?<br />
As for ogres.....I can get them very very easy from PoK, Oggok, or SH.  Havent had a need to go elsewhere.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grixx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I chose Troll and while the regen is what I would consider &quot;ok&quot; to have, I wish I had chosen Barbarian or Ogre.  Having played a barbarian shaman to 60 before and now doing Troll (and having played an Ogre SK to 65), I would choose Barbarian for shaman most likely, if for no other reason than the 20% exp penalty that Trolls have.  At high levels (my troll shaman is 55 now), I haven't been that impressed with regen.  It was useful at lower levels for downtime, but more than anything, KEI has made more of a difference from 45 and on.  I don't even have a Fungi tunic.  If given the choice between being lvl 60 with a Barbarian or being 55 and Troll (I'm sure I'd be 60 by now if barb), I'd choose Barbarian.  I also think Barbarians have a nice model.  <br />
<br />
The Ogre frontal stun immunity is a nice feature for sure - especially for tanking in teh face with a JBB and a pet alongside.  But again, they have a 15% exp penalty I believe, and I'm not sure it'd be worth it.<br />
<br />
just my 2cp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Discordja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I want to say Frogs don't get a XP penalty.<br />
<br />
However, as l33t as /cheer emote is they should at least get a 5%<br />
<br />
Frogs also have innate Ultravision .. nuff said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kukgulano</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Dis be Kukgulano callin at ya!<br />
<br />
I am a Ogre Oracle of 62 seasons and I have thought much about other races of shaman, and basically I am very happy I first chose Ogre.<br />
<br />
The invulnerablitly to stun ( when facing a target ) is one hard ability to beat.  <br />
<br />
To contemplate Troll and Ogre would depend on your financing at the start of your career though.  In lower levels that troll regen would be very handy... to compete with that you would need a regen BP on your OGre, if you could afford one.  The Iksar BP on my server usually goes for about 4 to 5k.<br />
<br />
Other than that Ogres hit harder in melee, and they have more health points to work with.  In later levels you will find total health points are very important.  Exp penalty? ya, if you are Troll or OGre you get punished for it.. but that because you don't need a group if you want to hunt.  And don't stick to the regular exp zones you see the &quot;Good&quot; races in, go eat the guards in their cities because there is no exp penalty in a city zone. You see alot more Trolls and OGre shaman soloing than other races.<br />
<br />
Actually, if I were to consider building a troll I would first go Iksar.  If you want regen go lizzard.  They can forage for food, swim like crazy, and every hates them already... which is something you will face as a troll or OGre.<br />
<br />
Only other thing is that OGres are chick magnets.</div></div><hr />

Nah.  Honeys dig the scaly tail.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Just a note on the snare necklace. I've been the only snarer in the group the past two nights in Tactics. If it hadn't been for the necklace, we would have died from adds many times over. This is an extremely useful item whether you're in Runneye, Chardok, or CoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tiorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Just to add debate to the fire.<br />
<br />
I am lvl 46 troll shammy w/jbb and snare neck and I OWN mobs.<br />
<br />
I dont get stunned to often cause I root mobs as a matter of course.<br />
<br />
Slow mob<br />
sick pet<br />
root mob<br />
chain cast jbb<br />
canni 2 between casts<br />
when mob is at 40% - dot them<br />
when mob is at 30% snare them<br />
<br />
they die <br />
<br />
I loot<br />
<br />
I am at 100% health<br />
and usually 80-90% mana<br />
<br />
I honestly dont stop pulling and adds are not a biggy, just root and slow em come back to em later.<br />
<br />
Although I have heard at higher lvls the exp penalty really sucks - and yes that worrys me - I guess its payback for all the fun I'm having now<br />
<br />
Dam EVIL Sony.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Secs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Where is all the love for the vah shirs =x</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I would think the snare neclace would be a plus. I wish I had started a troll shammy instead of my blind barb. I have never played a troll though so I don't know how much the exp pen sux. The few times I've grouped with a wizzy or druid it's been great to have snare, having it on your own would seem very powerfull.. you can getto fear kite. Snare mob, get high on the mob agro list, sick pet with taunt off, when it gets near  your blind it it will run off while your pet is chewing it down.. easy. :) Blind also takes like no mana.. one blind is 5 mana the other is like 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bazoom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Stunning is one of the more annoying things ever, I would never change back :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ogres get the fabulous Gatorsmash maul quest that Thantu wrote his famous walk-thru for and it was all the rage before RoK released.  YOU want this artifact and to be part of The Big Kids Club so make a frikkin ogre.<br />
<br />
No stun &gt; troll toys, but play what race you think is sexy. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Spite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I love my snare necklace.  Sometimes I hunt with a enc/clr two boxer, with my war/shm, and I just click the necklace around 30 health.  Works great.  When we group with druids or rangers, we let them snare to give them something to do.   :p <br />
<br />
My warrior has worse issues with being stunned than my shaman, and the warrior can get an aa to help with getting stunned.  <br />
<br />
In regards to the exp penalty, ogres get close enough of a penalty that I don't think the little bit more (5% more?) that trolls get, is much different.  I remember the old hybrid penalties, and how much worse things have been in the past.  With how fast one can progress through the levels, choosing troll wasn't bad.<br />
<br />
Both races are pretty oogly.  But at least they don't prance around, night blind, in a dress.  :D   Regen is pretty nice, and every little bit helps.  It's not a huge amount of regen, mind you, but it's an ambient, don't have to trigger sorta thing.  The fleshweaver's mark, a LoY quest ring, is a nice item that adds to my regen.  Bad marks for Verant, for bungling up the quest so that only good races can get both regen rings, and still evils can only get one ring.  <br />
<br />
As alot of other threads ultimately decide, it is all up to your personal preference.  No one race is better than all others.  Go with what you think would be neat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I play troll I am level 65, I would say troll is probably best race till lvl 60. Then the benefits of regen is not so noticable and ogre would be better. Immunity from stun is not too noticable till pop I guess. As buying that extra time from avoiding a stun helps a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Walknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I took a Trolly's snare necklace once...you know, to try it out. (he never knew so dont tell him).  Anyway, I could never figure out how it worked.  I kept snaring myself.  I almost didnt make it to the little Ogres room one time because of it.  Even with SoW on. :(<br />
<br />
So I decided it wasnt that uber of an item and looked in the mirror and was glad me an Ogre.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Etrigan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Wow, thanks for all the responses.<br />
<br />
I've been inquiring of lvl 65 Shaman on my server (E-Marr), and not unsurprisingly, both Trolls and Ogres I've spoken with advocate their own races. Still trying to make up my mind :P<br />
<br />
Have any of you actually played both Troll AND Ogre Shaman who might be able to provide some insight?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Dimdim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Seriously I'd go with what some of the others said, just pick the one you like the look of, you'll have to look at it for a loooooong time. I love my troll, I love the black bear and I think being green is a bonus.<br />
<br />
 The xp penalty does hurt later in life, I didn't even notice until lvl 55 though, when friends started out leveling me, but the regen helped me through, now it's less of a bonus, but still worth having IMO. With PoP xp I really don't think the 20% is such a massive issue though, I still fly along in tier 2, enough to keep this trollie happy.<br />
<br />
Anways, maybe just make one of each, goof around a bit and decide then which you prefer. If I did it all again I'd be a cat personally, I'd miss the regen but I'd have a furry tail...</div></div><hr />
