<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Yhakfiend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just want to start off by saying that in the last week or so of visiting the crucible, this is one of the most informative, well conducted EQ boards I've been to.  Very, very good work to everyone who puts their time and energy into making this all come together.  <br />
<br />
Now, for the matter at hand.  I've been exclusively playing a warrior character for the last 18 months or so.  I'm in a pretty good guild, got quite a bit of experience, explored the far corners of the world, etc., so I've got a pretty good understanding of the game.  <br />
<br />
A few nights ago, I made a shammy alt after i realized the birth of my new baby boy has left me very limited time to play.  Instead of sitting in zones and calling out /lfg's, I decided to jump into another class where I would have all the tools for each and every aspect of the game.<br />
<br />
So, I read through a couple threads here, twinked my new Barb shammy (for roleplaying reasons) up with a Fungi (from my warrior's collection), an REIF and a few other focus goodies, and started out.  Needless to say, level 1-10 in less than 3 hours while killing red cons 2 and 3 at a time was pretty fun.  <br />
<br />
So here's my issue - I don't just want to PL this new character up without getting the full experience and know-how of playing the class.  Eventhough my warrior was my first character, I put a lot of time into gaining every important piece of knowledge that I could about the class and it's strengths and weaknesses, and I want to do that with my shammy as well.  Eventhough I'll probably be soloing into my 20's and 30's (time restrictions and impromptu baby-feedings make it almost a necessity), I still want to spend time being a knowledgable and competant Shaman when I get a few hours to sit in a good exp group or raid situation.  <br />
<br />
I've read a bunch of the posts here about certain skills - Slowing, buffing, canni-dancing, root-rotting and DoT-Kiting - and I'm looking forward to learning and utilizing these skills as they become available.  <br />
<br />
So my questions are ... 1) What general skills should I be focusing on, being someone who's never really played a caster-class, and... 2) are there any of you out there who have done anything similar to this with the shaman class that can offer me any in-depth advice on how I can turn my privaledged situation into a positive career as a shammy?  I don't want to be one of those level 50 guys who's spent his entire career soloing exp without any of the necessary skills to make a good group shaman, but I don't really want to have to spend 50 levels in exp groups just to make sure I'm doing the right things, either.  <br />
<br />
I know, it sounds like a shortcut through hard work and experience.  But still, I'm confident that with my existing knowledge of the game, I can greatly cut down the general learning time and focus specifically on the class, making my leveling much more time-efficient.  <br />
<br />
So, any advice would be appreciated.  Thanks for taking the time to review my questions. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fulgrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If I could give you one tip... it would be NOT TO FOCUS<br />
<br />
Try everything.... experiment.... thats when you learn....<br />
<br />
A shaman can be played so many different ways.... why don't you create a new one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think all shammies spend the first 19 or so levels of their life, maybe even up to 24, soloing. Before that, 1) it's hard to find groups that actually work better than just random attacking and running away, and 2) with your baby class spells, you really don't get the full impact of &quot;the perfect group&quot; yet. Meaning your cleric heals as well as you do, you hit almost as well as the warrior, and your buffing spells give a total of +4, and your slow is not even noticable.<br />
<br />
I grouped off and on throughout most of my career, from 18 to 26, then from 34 to 44, and then off and on after that. I found that the point where I learned *the most* about playing my class well was 36-44, in Dreadlands. Yes, dreadlands, that horrible icky place. That's where I learned which buffs the tanks want (because you don't have HoS or FoS then, so you have to prioritize... I can do dex now, str later, or I'll go OOM), where your quickness/alcarity spell is, how to slow a mob once the main tank has aggro and not before (or yer supper), how to cannidance like mad cause you'll always be OOM due to too many needy tanks wanting too many extraneous buffs that really don't help much (&quot;stamina buff now!&quot;).<br />
<br />
In the Dreadlands, partly because people are short of temper and groups are so fluid, your tanks will be very specific about what they want and when they want it, so you can get a feel for what works and what doesn't, and when you know better than them, and vice versa. Also, I found that the 39 pet really doesn't cut it at that level, or the 34, but the 44 pet rocks, so at 44 I started soloing exclusively for awhile. I was also sick of bad groups in DL at that time :) I wanted some peace and quiet... and now, at 51, I still like my peace and quiet. But I do know how to handle a group. (Buff the main tank first, no matter what, ignore the guy who demands &quot;zings&quot; while your trying to slow a mob, buff when you can but don't go OOM, know when to throw a heal on and how much of a health bar your heals will cover...)<br />
<br />
I know plenty of shamans who group from 44 on up, but I enjoy being able to go around and find my own place and just grind in peace.  I also love to raid, (paradox there), so I get my group time in then... but I do burn out, so soloing allows me to refresh my temper and patience. :)<br />
<br />
So if I were you, I'd solo up to 18, then group in paludal because that's the best xp anywhere, and groups are cheap and easy to 26, then solo to 36 and go to DL (yes, I got groups at 36, warriors *luv* shamans), group there until you are sick of the idiots and you've got a good feel for pull groups and maintaining buffs, then go solo again. Group when you want after that, but Shamans can solo all the way to 60 and sometimes, the peace and quiet is so wonderful. :) <br />
<br />
No offense, but you sound like a person who is taking the shaman class seriously, doing research, knowing your spells and strategy, you already know the basics of raiding, you know the higher end of the game, and you aren't &quot;muleing&quot; the shaman by duo-boxing it and neglecting your shammy in favor of your monk/warrior/rogue (that makes me cry. Love your shammy. Don't bot it! Shamans rock!), I personally think you'll do fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">1.  Bag the Fungi till 51.<br />
2.  Play in zones where running away is not an option.<br />
3.  Spend half your time in groups.<br />
4.  Experiment with lots of play styles and change that spell bar up too.<br />
<br />
Pretty much listed in order of importance IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nitsujlak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Powerlevel as fast as you can to 24... maybe 34. You dont really learn the ins and outs of being a shammy till 34.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">0.  If your Warrior wasn't a Troll or Ogre, delete your Barb and re-roll an Ogre.  <br />
<br />
1.  You're already doing good by visiting the Crucible.  I have grown leaps and bounds by reading here.<br />
<br />
2.  Hunt in dungeons as much as possible - with that level of twinkage, you should be able to make costly mistakes and still recover.  But you can't really screw up if all you are doing is single pulling skellies in LOIO.  So get into some dungeons by your 30s.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think the general consensus is that you don't really get into the role until you get Canni/regen and a decent slow spell.  So blaze through until you get to 24ish or so.  Then slow down and enjoy.<br />
<br />
*Don't neglect your DEFENSE*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">yep, don't neglect your defense.  Grouping too much as healer at low level takes a lot of ice giant bashings to make up for.  A shaman can tank anything as long it's slowed. Normally I suggest to forget about canni till you get chlorobasts, but with a fungi you can naturally start as soon as you get it.<br />
Also, if you are a warrior main, you are used to gaining 5 skill points per level in your weapons - shaman only get 4.  Try keeping at least two weapon skills maxed, I suggest 2 HB and pierce (2HB mainly for those massive hits between bracer casts).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Yhakfiend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks for the opening advice everyone.  I do have a couple questions:<br />
<br />
1) Someone said to bag the fungi?  Why on earth would I want to do that?  LOL<br />
<br />
2) Any reason why Ogre would be a preference over Barb that would make a significant impact?  My warrior is a Half Elf, so I already got over all of the frontal-stun BS a long time ago.<br />
<br />
As far as the other stuff, it's all sound advice.  I'm not one of those power-gamers by any means, I just like to have fun with friends, and have quite a fiery streak when it comes to getting things accomplished.  But the reason I did pick a Shaman over the other classes was knowing that after the first 30 or so levels, there would never be too much downtime if I felt like an adventure.  <br />
<br />
And thanks for the advice about the skills.  It's awesome that I don't have to worry about 11 different combat skills everytime I ding, so keeping everything maxxed so far has been pretty easy :)<br />
<br />
Looking forward to more ideas!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Krodah Dirtnappah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">the shaman game changes after 39 when we get togor's so plevel up to there then group in dungeons where you don't have SOW to save you when stuff hits the fan.<br />
<br />
39 to 59 are the same except the mobs, slows, buffs, and dot's all get stronger.<br />
<br />
at 60 the game  changes again with torpor/malo but the skills you learned from 39 to 59 are your bread and butter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">For exp grouping, I think the most fun and important &quot;skill&quot; for the shaman to develop is good situational judgment.  You have such a variety of skills, there are too many choices and not enough ticks and mana to do it all (though after lvl 24 we have some of the best mana regen around, esp with your fungi).  <br />
<br />
The way I look at it, in a typical exp group you have to decide how to allocate your mana and attention on each pull among these separate roles:<br />
<br />
1.  Healing (direct heals, regens, bodyguard for robe casters)<br />
2.  Buffing (how thorough will you be giving out haste, stat buffs, resist buffs, utility spells)<br />
3.  Debuffing (SLOW, mal*** line, cripple line)<br />
4.  Spell damage (DOT's, nukes, JBB, epic)<br />
5.  Crowd control (root parking, off tank add, pet tank add)<br />
6.  Melee (bashing caster mobs, straight melee)<br />
7.  Self mana regen (cannibalizing, medding)<br />
<br />
In a typical exp group, I usually do some of all of these in the course of an evening.   The art of being a shaman is having good judgment about how to operate most efficiently in different situations, which depends on the other classes present and the mobs you are facing.  A good shaman understands the spells and capabilities of the other classes well, and has a deep bag of tricks for applying our many skills to the maximum advantage of the group.<br />
<br />
Enjoy!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Bagging the fungi till a later date IS a good idea because that particular item provides a massive amount of buffer, particularly at lower levels.  You talked of skill building right??  You will learn much more about your spell uses, spell timing, and methods of play by NOT using a crutch.  Why even cast during a fight if you can just absorb all the damage dealt to you and ineffecintly melee through a given situation?<br />
<br />
The fungi is a godly twink item simply because it shields you from your mistakes and allows you a large degree of slop in play.  Why do you think this sucker sells for so much?  It is pretty much the laziest tool for twinking around and I have seen warriors level to almost 50 solo using one.<br />
<br />
If you are serious about gaining some skills ditch it till a later date. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Christabel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It isn't till level 44 or so that you have good enough channeling to reliably cast through meele. So a lot of tactics you'll use commonly after 50 (like root parking) are just not viable in the early levels. I would say that some important things to learn are:<br />
<br />
1) How to prioitize your mana use so that you don't blow it all in one place and regret it sorely 1 minute later<br />
<br />
2) How to prioritize buffs (in order of importance) for each class, and how to prioritize classes in order of importance. Ex... The druid crying for focus can just sit tight and wait/hope.<br />
<br />
3) To be a quick thinker when the unexpected happens (especially in using your heals). If an enchanter starts getting torn to pieces then rare is the shaman who has the presence of mind to catch him before he dies. Become a shaman who doesn't let that crap happen.<br />
<br />
4) How to stagger and time buffs in an exp group so that you know when it's time to refresh. Many shamans just want people to send them tells. And that works ok. But if you're a shaman who keeps the buffs fresh without being asked, tanks will remember your name (even though its not such a big thing).<br />
<br />
5) How to stay cool and keep your head when people expect you to be everything at once. You're gonna go to raids where you just wanna pick up your monitor and throw it at the wall. But you still have a job to do. And you acomplish nothing by going berserk. So when people start getting rude about buffs, just know that it's the way things are always gonna happen.<br />
<br />
6) How to control your pet in a group, and how to recognize situations where you shouldn't summon one at all.<br />
<br />
and finally<br />
<br />
7) Go through 55 or more levels without mentally locking yourself into an official &quot;job description.&quot; As much as a lot of shamans despise playing healer or CC, you should always jump on those chances and be extra attentive. Excellence in going above and beyond is how a player makes a name for himself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">get to 24 ASAP then bag the fungi, but make sure to keep up skills as much as possible).  For 30-33 its acceptable to bring out that thing again, cause these levels suck almost as bad as 19-23.<br />
<br />
Always buff dex/agi on yourself to counteract the fungis -stats.  you want your dex up for the skill raises, same w/ AGI(defensive skills).<br />
<br />
<br />
Keep the barb btw, You want to be sexy :P <br />
<br />
<br />
You've done a reasonably good job twinking yourself, but believe it or not, you want more WIS.  At your level 130 is fine, since the fungi will powerlevel you up fast, but i found that around 150 is a good amount, and underthat significantly increases the amount of fizzles you will get.  Im gonna suggest dropping some AC and getting a Chipped Bone Bracer for the focus effect(dont get CBB if you can get a JBB though).  Might not seem like much now, but saving around 10% of mana per slow is really great.  <br />
   Also, a SBS or Clay Gaurdian Sheild might be a good investment for the AC, but you need to up the wis you would drop.  120 Wis is pretty low, even if you have an arseload of HP's...<br />
-<br />
<br />
As to what you should do grouping:<br />
<br />
Slow anyway, just because.  Slow makes the mobs swing less often, and connect less often(or atleast it appears that way to me).  Once your 39 youll be glad you kept up that habit.  Every slow helps...I was duo'n w/ my fungal equiped monk friend, and after walking sleep was stuck on the mob, i could actually see her HP rise(this was 30 levels ago though, Lol).<br />
-<br />
<br />
Most of all, dont quit.  If soloing seems to slow in the hell levels off 19-24, and 30-34, just stick the fungi back on and rip through em.  Theres nothing important that you will learn during these levels, they simply suck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Sell off the idol in range slot and grab a medicine totem or something else with wis/ac/hps deal.  <br />
The bracers also can be easily replaced with dragon ones from WW dragons for a nice wis/ac boost.  <br />
You do want wis to be &gt; 150, but not so much that your ac/hps drop too much.  The setup looks excellent for the most part.  Might wanna sell off the hand wraps later on at around 44 and get coldain skin or similar for hands.  Leg armor of comparible ac to rygorr and with wis on it can be easily obtained now.  check bazaar.  <br />
<br />
As far as leveling goes, I'd say make sure all your casting and other important skill stay up, especially DEFENSE, make sure defense rises 5 points each level.  <br />
<br />
Have fun!  The class has enormous potential.  Try out new stuff and see what you can accomplish.  Test yourself and your abilities often, and see what you can do.  Chances are you'll surprise yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Mutkuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If i were to twink and level up a new shaman i would do the following:<br />
<br />
Be a Troll.<br />
<br />
Have a Fungus Covered Scale Tunic, Fungi Covered Great Staff, JB Armor and HP armor for other slots.<br />
<br />
At 35 when the staff clicky works you regen over 30 hp a tick.<br />
(15 from snare, 15 from tunic, +Troll Regeneration) Root Rot/Tank/Slow the whole way. It would be soo much fun. And if you are worried about the whole snare thing, its a insta click staff, so cancel it and when you want to reapply it.<br />
<br />
But see I did do the leveling thing already hehe, i think an alt of the same class is the best thing. :p <br />
<br />
But one thing you could do if you want to solo as your warrior is, Use the Fungi, Get a Colbalt BP (for heals), Embalmer's Skinning Knife (free bandaids), Silken Whip of Ensnaring(for Snare), Truncheon of Doom(For Slows) This stuff would make it quite easy for a warrior to solo, but you have to swap weps vs. casting.<br />
<br />
Sorry im not a real smart person so typin errors or stupid sounding things is 100% my fault. BUT warriors can make good soloers with that stuff, and if you cant afford it you can scratch the fungi.<br />
<br />
-Me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Any reason why Ogre would be a preference over Barb that would make a significant impact? My warrior is a Half Elf, so I already got over all of the frontal-stun BS a long time ago.<br />
<br />
a) Ogres get more STA.  Much more.<br />
<br />
b) If you haven't ever had to deal with faction problems that come with being evil (ala Troll or Ogre) it's an entirely new ballgame.  I can't say it makes you a 'better' player, but it is tougher.<br />
<br />
c) No Stun isn't BS - It might be ok for a warrior to sit and spin for a few seconds, but it can be downright deadly for a shaman.  Especially one that isn't twinked with a fungi (another argument for ditching the fungi from 30 - 50).<br />
<br />
PS - I'm not trying to derail this thread into an 'which race is the best'.  The end result is - play the one you want. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Yhakfiend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Aye, I've never really had to deal with the evil race issue, except for that SK that had for like 4 levels once.<br />
<br />
As far as soloing the warrior, unless you've done it you can never know how absolutely AWFUL it is pre-60.  Believe me, I've got all the gear and them some, and it's still the most boring, unsatisfying way to play him.  Not to mention the area 55-60 is extremely hard to solo through, regardless of equipment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">PLAY BARBARIAN.   From your post it sounds like that's what you had your heart set on, so that's what you should play.  I find the ogre unstunnability to be a non-issue.  In my 80 days and 60 levels played as a barbarian, I cannot think of a single instance where I have died or had serious trouble from a frontal stun.  There have been a few times when I was pulling that I got stunned from the back and it nearly killed me, but being an ogre won't save you from that.<br />
<br />
Troll/iksar regen is also a non-issue, when compared to a fungi tunic (at lower levels) and torpor (at 60).  Like unstunnability, it's nice to have, but it is definately not worth playing a race you don't really like.  In the end, race means very little.  Pick whatever one you most want to be stuck looking at for the next 60 levels :)<br />
<br />
btw, don't be afraid of the kunark route.  there's nothing inherently wrong with it.  If you already have a high-level character and know how to play the game, you have nothing to lose by going through the path of least resistance.  The basics of being a shaman are very very easy to learn (It took me about 15 minutes to teach an 11 year old to play my character.  an hour later he was pulling velks spiders.  I was so proud!)  Besides the basics, the only thing that is tricky at all is pulling and doing CC.  send me a PM or an email at misterconservative@attbi.com and I can give write a fairly brief but thorough guide to grouping a shammy, if you want.<br />
<br />
have fun, and keep up with these forums.  they are a great place to get information and learn about the shaman class (at least when people arent bitching about spell rarity/druids/cheal/nukes/whatever)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Yhakfiend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Hey everyone!  Just wanted to come back and give a little update, and also ask a couple more little questions.  <br />
<br />
Well, I got ol' Yhakfiend up to 35 a couple days ago, taking the awesome advice from the hunting guides here.  I've done it all pretty much solo, except for a few times in my teens and late twenties where I just felt the need for a good group.  <br />
<br />
I did a pretty good job of keeping all of my skills maxxed (thanks to the supply of blunt weapons that I still had in my Warrior's bank).  Everything's going well, and it looks like it will only be a matter of time before I become somewhat of a respectable shammy.  Thanks to everyone for their advice and help in the earlier posts.  <br />
<br />
Now for my questions:  <br />
<br />
I haven't changed any equipment since my last post, focusing mostly on playing the character and becoming familiar with everything.  My money situation is rather meek right now (also have a human smithy alt who takes up most of my cash), but I'm going to need to change a few things as I move up in levels.  <br />
<br />
So here's my question - In the next 10-15 levels, which items should I be focusing on acquiring?  I know of the obvious JBB, but I'm particularly interested in anything that I can quest for (alongside my level 55 warrior).  I've seen a couple that I'll be going after (Coldain Military Wrist, Shield of Bane Warding, etc.,), but are there any good ones that I'm missing?<br />
<br />
Any input about quests or items that I should be looking at are greatly appreciated.  Thanks everyone!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">SoBW is a great quest to do in the low 50's, your warrior shouldn't have any trouble with it.  The tormented in TM even give some exp for the both of you.  You didn't mention if you're two-boxing.  You will need the assistance of a full group so to get the charcoal and do the final fights.<br />
Another good quest is the Kromrif legs quest with the broodmother in GD (if it's working at the moment, no idea).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Try to get your black fur boots (epic quest) as soon as possible. Those are just a life saver.... plus they work nicely as an outdoor anti-dragon clicky item. About 3 people 40+ can take down Black Dire.<br />
<br />
Let's see.... a REIF (rune etched icewurm fang) is nice, I love it, but you'll probably need to buy it as it's a rare item in Kael, IIRC. <br />
<br />
Another great item is the Amulet of the Grey Wastes, a perma eb item you get by farming Taskmaster Tsorah in Echo Caverns for organs, or by getting organs from the Shisskar in the Grey. 3 organs = 1 Amulet, it's no-drop, but you wouldn't believe the number of times that thing has saved my butt. I don't travel without it, I am often wearing it at all times, it's just so nice to jump in the water after mob x and not give a damn. Or to walk in the Grey, the Deep, Kedge, and not care...<br />

A rallic pack is a 10 slot, 85% weight reduction backpack you get by getting a perfect owlbear pelt, some shadeling thread, and a rallic pattern gotten by farming the grimling runner in Tenn mountains. Can be done at 40+.<br />

Now for my questions:  <br />
<br />
I haven't changed any equipment since my last post, focusing mostly on playing the character and becoming familiar with everything.  My money situation is rather meek right now (also have a human smithy alt who takes up most of my cash), but I'm going to need to change a few things as I move up in levels.  <br />
<br />
So here's my question - In the next 10-15 levels, which items should I be focusing on acquiring?  I know of the obvious JBB, but I'm particularly interested in anything that I can quest for (alongside my level 55 warrior).  I've seen a couple that I'll be going after (Coldain Military Wrist, Shield of Bane Warding, etc.,), but are there any good ones that I'm missing?<br />
<br />
Any input about quests or items that I should be looking at are greatly appreciated.  Thanks everyone! <br />
<br />
Kromiff Bracer and epic boots would be the obvious quests. Easy to do with a high lvl friend or two and seriously useful even at 60. I never really thought the shield of bane warding was worth the effort, an SBS sells for a few hundred plat these days and is argueably just as good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Yhak, like yourself I am a warrior main with a shaman alt(well sorta alt, he is a second main anymore).<br />
<br />
This is the best advice you can get on playing your shaman and looking for gear:<br />
<br />
1. Play him like your warrior<br />
<br />
2. After your wisdom is 150ish, you have the same priorities as any other class: HP&gt;AC&gt;all else.<br />
<br />
Ps. Really guys, I know you love your ogres and I can appreciate that, but you get exactly nowhere telling knowledgable (nonogre)warriors how beneficial stun immunity is ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Meschit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">The point Nagruuz made about bagging the Fungi is valid, since it prevents you from using it as a crutch.<br />
<br />
The best example I can provide is this: I started from scratch, non-twinked, blah blah blah....I leveled slow, but I learned as much as I could as to what our class could do (by lurking here). I experimented, soloed, grouped, the whole shebang. Another shaman in my guild was twinked from lvl 1 with the &quot;shaman package&quot; (Kunark Era) Fungi, JBB, RMBs, and so on. He would often send me tells talking about shaman stuff, but mostly how he had gotten hold of info as to the best soloing spots, best money spots, etc. No personality, just optimizing his character. His whole objective was to solo to 55 then join an uberguild. He of course always gloated about some new toy he bought (from Ebay) while I was getting by on rusty Totemic.<br />
<br />
Along the way, we got into discussions about dogdog, and he was convinced that pets were useless. Of course he wouldn't need dogdog, since he had free damage and massive regen while killing overconned Seafuries, so everything I told him fell on deaf ears.<br />
<br />
When our guild had a meeting, he challenged me to a duel and told me he wouldn't use a pet to prove his point. By this time I had read all the nasty tricks PvP shaman who post here use, so I was putting crap buffs on myself and canning and regenning and drinking potions, while he kept tapping his foot and asking me if I was ready. Finally we dueled. Twice. Both times he gave up, because he couldn't get any spells to land on me, and dogdog kept chewing his ass.<br />
<br />
He lost because he didn't live his life as a SHAMAN! He stuck to a formula that had shaman powers and store-bought effects. He didn't know what to do when dealing with the unexpected. So Yhak, you must LIVE as a shaman, not just play a shaman template.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>windfinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">and also if you do your epic to the boots you will also have the shield which is a nice shield ( not up to SoBW or the AC of SBS ) that will give you some decent stuff for free.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Purifyre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Don't forget to have some fun charm soloing at 29 to 33 in say Marus Seru for example - always greyhoppers around to be a pet for you altho they tend to swarm you a lot - at 34 why use dogdog all the time when you can spice things up with a drakkel dire wolf for a pet!  ( I tried this at 32 but the 29th charm spell isn't high enough for dire wolves ).  Charm soloing would probably be fun in Eastern Wastes as well since you just keep your target rooted until your charmed pet kills it then kill the charmed pet for more exp since it is low on life :)</div></div><hr />
