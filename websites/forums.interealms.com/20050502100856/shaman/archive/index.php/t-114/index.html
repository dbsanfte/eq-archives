<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Drezz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, First let me tell you my situation:<br />
<br />
I quit EQ before luclin came out.. One of my best friends in RL still plays, and he had been nagging me and nagging me to come back to EQ for months... So he told me, if I came back to EQ he would give me 20k to twink my self with... <br />
 I played a Wizard up to 46, and a Barb shaman up to 33, so I know the &quot;lowbie&quot; game very well... :0<br />
 Anyway, I now have a level 9 Ogre Shaman parked in the EC tunnel, loaded with plat :0(level 9 took me less than 4 hours BTW, thats nuts :0 )<br />
<br />
I did some price checks on the items I was thinking of buying:<br />
<br />
Rune etched Icewurm fang = 6k<br />
Iksar Regen BP= 3.5-4.5k<br />
Fungi tunic = 30-40k :( <br />
JBB = 17-20k<br />
FBSS= 2-3.5k<br />
<br />
I have not bought anything yet, I plan to buy JB armor for my Legs/arms/hands/head and 65hp/6ac rings, a Tattered mantle, and a Iksar regen BP.<br />
<br />
<br />
My questions are:<br />
<br />
Should I buy the Runc Etched Icewurm fang? <br />
Or should I get a slimy/spine chill and fill some slots with better armor?<br />
What is a fairly good 2h blunt?  Drakkel Icegrinder?<br />
<br />
What about 1h blunt? blackjack maybe?<br />
<br />
I also need a good item for my Back, ears, face, and neck... Any thoughts? :)<br />
<br />
Should I buy a haste item?(like FBSS) I kinda want to just solo up to 35 or so, so I can get those boring levels over with...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I know everyone hates equipment threads, but I would appreciate some imput :)<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
JB legs will be pretty expensive (still selling for 20K+ on Emarr) but the rest of that sounds very good and within your budget.<br />

<br />
I will defer all melee questions to the more melee oriented shaman.  I used a howler/slime combo for a really long time.  I haven't used a 2 hand blunt since I retired my beloved Staff of the Observers! <br />
<br />
I also need a good item for my Back, ears, face, and neck... Any thoughts?<br />
<br />
Ogre, right? Lemme think.<br />
<br />
Back - back is pretty tough, heiro is of course the best choice, but sells for around 15K on Emarr.  Other choices: mammoth cloak, molten cloak, I'm not sure what new cloaks have come out of SoL that are worth looking into.  <br />
Ears - Ivandyr's hoop and electrum black sapphire?<br />
Face - actic wyvern mask, bone mask of the jarsath, enshrouded veil <br />
Neck - ivory collar from chardok (very common and cheap on my server)<br />
<br />

<br />
If you have the money left over, why not? Meleeing is fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Drezz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for the reply :P<br />
<br />
And the JB legging thing was a typo :P Ill probably grab some Ry'Gorr legs :0<br />
<br />
I also need two bracer items(forgot those :P ).. any thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Depending on cash, you might want to pick up some of those nice dragon hide bracers from WW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ikky bp, JB helm, boots, guants, arms, and rygorr to fill in the rest are my thought also.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I still use my Iksar BP a lot at 54. You won't be sorry for a minute if you buy it. JB gear is pretty cheap now, so you've got the right idea with that. If you can't find a piece you're looking for, Ry`Gorr is definetly the way to go. The fort is so overfarmed that the BP is selling for under 500 plat on Rodcet.<br />

<br />
<br />
You'll really miss the shield if you use a 2hb; I know I did. Blackjacks are dirt cheap even if they have a cruddy ratio, and they're good for keeping up 1hb if you melee a lot. Centi Warhammers are also very cheap and are right around a 2 ratio as opposed to the BJ's 3. Piercing is what I'd go for first. REIFs are spendy, and though they're really good, you'd probably do better to buy something else and spend the rest on better armor. Spine Chill Spears are fairly cheap, since they come out of the Ry`Gorr fort too.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Face: An Arctic Wyvern Mask is a nice balanced face item, and pretty cheap since most people that are working on tailoring will make lots of them.<br />
Ears: Black Sapphire Electrum Earrings aren't much more expensive than forest loops and will serve you well for a long time (25 hp/35 mana), and if you know a jeweler you can get a pair for around 500pp.<br />
Neck:Sabretooth Amulets are somewhat uncommon but are usually reasonably priced (15 MR and permanent See Invis). Failing that the good old Chrysoberl Talisman or Black Alloy Medallion will tide you over. <br />
Back: I've got a Shissar cloak (AC 6, 5 wis, and 55 hp/mana) but they can be expensive and hard to find if the Grey isn't very populated on your server. Prior to that I think I had a banded cloak. =\<br />
<br />
You didn't mention anything about a shield. Charred Guardian is still the way to go until you get a Shield of Falsehood or better, imo.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
I wish I had an FBSS :) If you have cash left over, grab one if you see it cheap, but they aren't essential.<br />
Why stop at 35? I soloed most of my 54 levels :D<br />
<br />
Boy these new quote boxes are cool!</div></div><hr />

Replace 'Legs' with 'Feet' and you're good, minus legs and bracers.  Not a lot of great choices available for those two slots, sadly.  I'd suggest Rygorr/Totemic or the like.  If you happen into more cash, dragon hide is good for most any slot you can get it for, but it ain't what you'd call cheap on my server.Should I buy the Runc Etched Icewurm fang? <br />

The REIF is nice-nice.  If you get one, you'll keep it for a long time, I'd say buy if you can.  JB is pretty good armor for a while.  When you go to replace it, you're looking at the real pricey droppable stuff or quest/no-drop.  The economist in me says buy the cheap JB now, then hold out til you get high enough to get the really nice stuff yourself.  Icegrinder is a favorite, price/performance wise, can't be beat.  Also good and on the cheap end is the Runewood staff, 22/40.  On the not-so-cheap but still surprisingly low end is the Granite Face Grinder, 29/36, +10 str/int/wis.  Recently sighted in EC for 5-8k, another keep-for-a-long-time toy.What about 1h blunt? blackjack maybe?<br />
No idea on 1hb.<br />
I also need a good item for my Back, ears, face, and neck... Any thoughts? :)Back, maybe Spider fur cloak, ears, Cougar claws serve for a while on the cheap end, Ivandyrs hoop and the Vah Shir earring on the pricey end.  Face, hard to beat the Wyvrn(sp?) mask.  Neck, I like spider fur again til you can get a nice no drop piece, but there are other options.<br />
<br />
Should I buy a haste item?(like FBSS) I kinda want to just solo up to 35 or so, so I can get those boring levels over with...<br />
Yes.  I'd go with the FBSS if they're that cheap, though Chitin handwraps are an option too until you can afford Chitin gaunts, at which time you'll want a non-hand haste item.  Prolly more expensive too.  Simplest to just buy the FBSS now.<br />
<br />
I know everyone hates equipment threads, but I would appreciate some imput :)<br />
<br />
Nah.  What you see on the boards are a) people who don't mind equipment threads, b) people who enjoy equipment threads (hi), and c) people who enjoy complaining about equipment threads.  The few people who really don't like them simply don't read them.<br />
Thanks. Is no troubles :)</div></div><hr />

7/18, 4str, 4wis, -2 int and procs good old fleeting fury fairly frequently, weighs a ton, but for an ogre thats really not an issue.<br />

Either look to spend 2/3kish on one, or just get to 20 and camp the kurns basement for one.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Drezz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Thanks for all the replys :0<br />
<br />
Last night I bought a Drakkel Ice grinder for 900pp(good deal!), JB arms and hands for 400pp each,  a Iksar Regen BP for 3.8k, and two 65hp/6AC rings.<br />
<br />
EC buying/selling is so boring :P I was in that tunnel for about three hours and thats all I got :0<br />
<br />
I think Im going to see if I can get a FBSS for cheap, that will be useful, seeing as I could use it again to twink a melee class :)<br />
 If I cant get a cheap one, I will just get a spider fur belt or somthing.<br />
 <br />
And I will look for a Sentry Bracer or two(Are they lore??)... If I cant find any bracers, I will just wear banded or something, untill I can  do the totemic quests.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks again for the help :)<br />
I figure I have another three or four days of auctioning untill I can go level some :0 <br />
<br />
Oh well :0</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gettinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I would definitely buy the REIF if I were in your shoes.  I have one that I used until I got epic.  12/19 is awesome for a shammy piercer.  Add the FBSS to that and you'll be doing some really nice melee damage.  With celerity I was swinging that bad boy once a second and hitting for up to 48 or so.  In fact, I had to zing myself near the end of a fight because I was swinging so much.  Also, I think some people are missing the point of using a blackjack.  With a 21 delay you shouldn't have any problem keeping your 1hb skill up.  That and the fact that blackjacks are so cheap makes them worth having if you're mainly looking for something to keeps skills up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If you're buying a one hander, you'll want a shield.  I recommend a clay guardian shield (ac 25, +50 hp) - I saw one of these in EC yesterday for (gasp!) 200 pp!  And it kept getting auctioned over and over- no one wanted it at that price.  I already have one, but I almost made a mule just to buy this one- it seemed to fricking cheap!  Normally they're around 500-800 on Karana... great deal for a shield with very nice stats (basically a Sarnak Battle Shield without the resists.)<br />
<br />
REIF + Haste item + Haste spell = fun fun fun !!!  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Canabull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Ikky regen BP, REIF, FBSS, VFO rings, JB armor except BP, Bracer, Helm, and Legs, Totemic Helm, RMBs, Totemic/Wyvern Legs.<br />
<br />
That will probably take all your cash, but you'll be set for a long time.<br />
<br />
Solo giants in Kunark from 34 on to get a pair of Forest Loops for ears.  And just save from here to 45 and try to save up enough by then to afford a JBB, that's what I'm doing with my troll shammy.<br />
<br />
For offhand use I'd get a Crystal Webshield.  15 AC, 20 HP and mana, sweet little twinkie item, and has more AC than a CGS.<br />
<br />
Range...  Howler or Med Totem, there are some really good ones from luclin for a more melee oriented shammy.<br />
<br />
If you want to be a melee shammy then you really should get the REIF AND the FBSS if you want to solo and melee, you'll need them until you get your pet, and the REIF procs at 35, with buffs and lotsa haste you'll outdamage monks sometimes at that level.<br />
<br />
GL, and glad to have you back to EQ</div></div><hr />
