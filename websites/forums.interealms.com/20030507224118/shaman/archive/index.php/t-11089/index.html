<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>sirx4playz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i just dinged 45 last night running about in kc and gd....well i been through these post over and over and most people root/dot/med....i've tried that many times and it works sometimes...i use instill is it better then just root annd how do i make my root stronger cause it seems to break everytime i use VoS and i surely can't dd with blizzard cause then it surely breaks...any help would be greatful...thx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">any time a DD hits a mob root gets an extra chance to break root, and all shaman dots until lvl 64 have a DD component on them.  I always used regular lvl 14 root when I was root/rot, as 30 secs was usually more than enough time for me to do something to break root early anyways, using malosini (or whichever one you have at 45) might help some</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Why are you root rotting? IMO tanking in teh face is the best method. Talisman yourself with best HP buff, chloro, aclarity pet. Then just go out and pull some mobs with slow and apply VoS. Usually i finish with about 70-90 HPs and about 60-80m (on underbulks in echo caverns with 180 defense which seems to have stopped skilling up completely</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah, leave root-rotting to the wussy druids with their magic-based dots.<br />
<br />
Interesting thing to note: they added the &quot;DD breaks root&quot; feature well after release.  Shaman and druid dots were already in the game.  Was there any shaman uproar, because a nerf aimed at wizards was now hurting us just as much?</div></div><hr />
