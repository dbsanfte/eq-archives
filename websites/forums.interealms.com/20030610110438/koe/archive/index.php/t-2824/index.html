Maybe even drop down and keep the bear pit cleared so if anyone is feared they can run back up and get back into the fray. Other than that I am afraid I can't make much of a contribution.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jice Virago</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Truthfully, MR is the more critical resist, especially for the healers.  If you take damage, you can keep being useful.  If you are feared, you are not performing and quite possibly out of the fight.  While I dont expect people to run out and drop 10k on resist pieces, there are a lot of inexpesive MR and CR items out there.  Ideally, you want to have around 100 MR and CR before buffs are counted.  At this level, you ignore most of the Cold DD and just about all the fear.  Things like Telescopes and Goblin Earings are also handy as you can click them to act as a buffer for your crap buffs once the original crappers get dispelled (for Clerics/paladins, Yaulp 1 works beautifully in this capacity too) and prevent critical buffs from being eliminated.<br />
<br />
I was rusty last week, which is why it took two tries.  This time, especially with last weeks experience behind us, it should happen in one attempt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well you tell me Jice. At lvl 45 even if I somehow had 200mr buffed, I don't think I would resist fear. Now my Cleric has almost zero MR items. Perhaps some suggestions? Only thing I really have is velium diamond rings I can give him. <br />
<br />
I'll do some research on MR items for Clerics. Perhaps get some suggestions from our KoE clerics? Bark potions?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Drolgin Steingrinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Once again, I'd like to point out this (http://forums.interealms.com/koe/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=5)  excellent post on resist gear.<br />
<br />
For MR there are quite a few fairly cheap items you can get, these are just a few examples:<br />
<br />
Plat/Velium Jacinth rings (13/14 MR)<br />
Earring of Essence (30HP 10MR)<br />
Bloodstained Mantle (AC6 3STR 10MR)<br />
Cape of the Midnight Mist (AC2 2str 7MR - neck slot)<br />
Cloak of the RyGorr Oracles (AC6 2WIS 2INT 10MANA 10CR 5MR)<br />
Crested Mistmoore Shield (AC10 6DEX 10MR PR DR)<br />
Kylong Boots (AC12 5CR 5MR)<br />
Kylong War Helmet (AC12 20HP 20MANA 7MR 4PR - also known as &quot;The Ugly Hat)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jice Virago</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">A lot of this depends on race but here are some things I can think off off of the top of my head that are super cheap-<br />
<br />
Black Alloy Crown (+6 to all, or Black Iron Crown for the old schoolers)<br />
Dwarven Ringmail Tunic (+8 MR, FR, CR)<br />
Bloodstained Mantle (+10 MR)<br />
Crested MM Shield<br />
Shiney Brass Shield<br />
Skull Shaped Barbute<br />
Gold Diamond Mask<br />
<br />
Those are some dirt cheap things I can think of off the top of my head that clerics can use to pad their MR.  The link Drolgin posted has many more.<br />
<br />
Finally, the reason MR is so critical for healers is there is an occasional bug where a healer who is feared will continue to run around permanently until world kicked or sometimes just be unable to cast any spells.  Its rare, but its happened enough times that we should be prepared for it.<br />
<br />
Oh and FYI my rogue at level 43 resisted all but one fear with a buffed MR of around 143 and Fenna who main tanked vox was level 52 and had 151 buffed MR never got feared a single time.  So fear at 45 is resistable consistantly, it just takes some good solid resist bases.</div></div><hr />
