<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bourijn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all,<br />
<br />
I am a level 55 shaman that has dreamed of owning a JBB since I knew of their existance a long time ago.  Finally, I have saved enough PP to buy one, however.....<br />
<br />
It seems that as I gain levels, the amount of damage put out by melee classes is rediculously high compared to what a JBB would contribute.  Here is my question....should I give up on the dream and put my PP to better use?  On my server, I can find a JBB, BP, or Greaves for about 22,500p each.  Would I be better served to upgrade my PoH BP and greaves with jaundiced?  Or should I just keep saving my money for spells / horsie / etc, etc.  <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your feedback. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">At level 55, a fungi would be hugely powerful.  I looted mine at 57 and it was one of the few pieces of gear I have ever earned that had a noticeable and immediate effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">never having owned a Fungi I cant comment on it, but I survived to 60 without one. I do however know that a Horse is an amazing tool for a shaman, if for the mana regen alone. You also get to avoid 'sitting agro' when memming new spells etc.<br />
I say save your money for an 8k horse &amp; your spells, start saving now. You'll be thankfull once you reach 60 and need the expensive spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would keep savin, go for horse...if you want armor, PoG is still a blast and I had all the big pieces of PoG armor by the time I was 55. I was one of the higher lvl people in my guild at the time, had just over 20 people total all under 56, except 1 lvl 60 warrior that could take the beatings.<br />
So long as your guild isn't a bunch of elf lovers you should be able to get geared up nice there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I agree with Glori.  A fungi is an amazing item.  I'd probably be 60 by now if my friend hadnt decided that he needed to sell it because of whatever reason(i had been using it, it was his, but whatever).<br />
<br />
If you dont have the cash, then a JBB is great.  I use mine all the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i love my jbb, people say that once you hit the planes you don't use it and i have not found that to be the case. i easily steal aggro from my tanks with BoN + constant jbbing in PoD and PoN. It regularly hits for its full damage. But i ahve to say, a horse should be much higer on your list than a jbb =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Tiny Tim is the best investment I made on any item I have ever purchased.  No  sitting agro,  continuous medditation is the best.  <br />
<br />
I dont have a fungi or a JBB but the horse is hard to beat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Podunk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have owned both a Fungi Tunic and a JBB and eventually both become obsolete, my JBB sits in my bank and my fungi tunic i got rid of a long time ago because the loss of stats for regen was terrible.  The biggest bonus i see for the fungi is for the races that lack a decent bonus from race barbarian and ogre.  The JBB may not be as an effective tool to group with but for soloing such as in FG or olderzones there is nothing that compares because its free mana same as your epic.  As for a horse, I have never owned one because i never have to sit anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Talsondar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I still use the JBB to exhaustion when I solo at 55.  Free damage is nothing to shake a stick at, at any level.<br />
<br />
I have seen estimates of 30dps or so, assuming no full resists/partial resists, and that is none too shabby for 0 mana.<br />
<br />
I guess if you did the math it would be something like ((60/8)*263))/60 of mana free dps, and free damage is free damage at any level.<br />
<br />
That said, horses are incredibly powerful.  I had the 8400pp horse, decided I wanted to twink up a melee, took the loss and sold it back for 6k+ to twink up a rogue.  Well, after just a few minutes outside soloing with my shammy without it I realized what a big mistake that was and stripped the rogue back down and rebought the old mare.<br />
<br />
Either is a good choice, but I would not spend that kind of cash to upgrade BP (unless Fung) or Legs, neither is as game altering as a JBB OR a Horsie.  The real combo is the Horsie/JBB, you are medding the entire time you are clicking JBB so essentially getting ADDITIONAL 30+dps while medding.  Now that is nice...:D<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
<br />
Never give up on a dream...:p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bourijn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thank you all for your replies.  <br />
<br />
Since I had about 23k in the bank, I decided to go with the cheap horsie, and WOW what a huge difference that has made!!<br />
<br />
Looks like my next purchase will be a JBB after all.....as Talsondar said, &quot;Never give up on a dream&quot;.  I'd hate to stop playing this game at some point as Shaman that never had the pleasure of owning one ;)</div></div><hr />
