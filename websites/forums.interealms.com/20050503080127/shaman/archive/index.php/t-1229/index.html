<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The night before a raid, we usually ask the guild up there to let us know when it is safe to run in. We then bolt in, head to SS, and camp for the night.<br />
<br />
Not sure if that method would work for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>raburr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">not a bad plan..but on TZ PoF is not raided that much plus...TZ is now more of a guild fight than a 4 team fight as it was set up...so help or communication with another guild isnt the friendliest....</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Every time I've been to Fear it has been a west wall break. Not all successfully either. Usually it is a monk FD at the portal giving the &quot;clear for now&quot; signal, 3 groups in with enchanters, clerics, evac and melee (usually hybrids for LoH and HT) zone in invis and just go for it. People come in as needed after that until the first 15 or so mobs are dead.<br />
<br />
It seems to be the easiest, just hope that no one in your raid party is an idiot. It only takes one person who doesn't seem to think the &quot;stop, get a loc and die&quot; instruction applies to them to ruin a break in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My guild raids PoF once a month for epic bits (armour rots like garbage up there, freaking sick, but understandable).  We do a 3 group, but I've seen it done by 1 group, break (all lvl 60).  On the 3 group breaks its 55+ only with PoF experience (a little bit of overkill, but it works).  We hit the SW ledge (there are 2 ledges, one for cracking, one for farming) by zoning in invis, first group in has a chanter and cleric and is all lvl 60.  Lvl 60 chars have a very low aggro radius in PoF.  First we take in the wanderers, then we pull nearby camps.  We always bring 1 warlord, 1 shaman, 2 chanters, 2 clerics and a druid for every group.<br />
<br />
When the portal is clear we bring in the other 3-4 groups (everyone wants to go, at least for a couple hours to maybe armour a twink, but mostly for epic pieces, oh ... and the ammy pull).  Once the whole raid is up we send out 2-3 pullers and pull everything we can.  Usually clear the plane pretty quickly and then get the named.   I've personally never been to PoF while CT was up as the more raid oriented guilds tend to drop him on spawn.<br />
<br />
The break is exciting, but after that only the temple pull holds any interest.  We sometimes have 2 pullers do the temple at the same time and train the raid, just for fun.  We've had 20+ mobs running around (with adds) in front of the raid camp while we peel off 2-5 at a time, chanter mezzes, shaman slows, MA calls targets.  I really need to take some screenshots of this, but I'm usually collecting my jaw from the floor wondering why no one dies on these things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Haggus of Saryrn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">For a guild that does not have a large number of 60s ( say mostly 55- ), I would suggest using a 53 necro to help break Fear.  We use the necros as a security blanket.  <br />
<br />
What we did was send in a group of monks and the necro with the objective of getting the necro feigned at the SS on the North wall.  <br />
<br />
After the necro is FDed.  We send the rest of the troops for the mad dash from the zone in to the SS.  We order the Clerics to camp immediately.   If we are not successful in getting a cleric camped out, we have the monks pull the cleric corpse to the SS and then have the necro with an essence emerald rez the cleric.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Once you get your guild some more levels ( 55+ ),  you can do the west wall break much easier.   Having two groups with a wizard/druid help when attempting the WW break the first time.  Send in the two groups and if the clerics or enchanters go oom while fighting, order the evac.  Med to full and do it again.  <br />
<br />
<br />
While either of these tactics may seem gimp, they both have less risk than the traditional run to the SS and hope to get a cleric camped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I assume a straight run to the west wall is out of the question?<br />
<br />
I always thought it was fun to take two groups to Fear and do a break-in/exp run.  Invis, run west immediately, and if you agro, stop, and hold the mob as long as you can before you die.<br />
<br />
If necessary, camp everyone at the west wall to clear agro.<br />
<br />
More recently, we just train everything to the west wall and kill it.  However, we are pretty much all level 60s, so that may not be a viable option.  I kinda miss Fear.  Unless doing exp or something, we never go there.  :(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rewts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">This is something that my guild has been working on alot in the last few weeks.  We are a smallish guild and usually have only 3 groups or sometimes 4.  Clerics are frequently in very short supply.  We have no necros.  we have no Lvl 60s.  only 1 lvl 59, 1 57, 2 56.  Our highest enchanter is only 53 so breaking fear for us has been a major challenge.  Here is what we have settled on:<br />
<br />
1) We try to coordinate with larger guilds who are doing boss mobs, to go in after them.  This helped us get folks up to speed on the different mobs, like which had high MR, see invis, etc.  This may not be an option for you.<br />
<br />
2) Since our enchanter is only 53, she has difficulty in mezzing many mobs. Amy's, Scarelings are always Multi-Tanked.<br />
<br />
3) usually we only have 2 clerics, sometimes only 1 so camping a cleric out is not an option for us.<br />
<br />
4) we make groups based on how many Druids we have.  We almost always have more druids than groups.  We evac early and often.  Breaking Fear is hard, breaking Fear in Mage summoned gear is harder.<br />
<br />
5) We always buff to the Max at the portal before zoning in (duh).  Although dispelling mobs are not that much of a problem on the break we always make sure that Sow, Invis, are the last 2 buffs.<br />
<br />
6) We send in the highest lvl FDer to FD at portal, usually a monk.  We he is ready he stands up and pulls any mobs he can away from the portal.  Since we have lower lvls thier aggro range is huge and this helps alot.  He usually runs northish and then to the west wall and Feigns again.  He sometimes dies.<br />
<br />
7) at the same time the rest of us zone in by groups about 10 sec apart.  We run to west wall and get in as tight a group as possible.  Usually someone has managed to get an aggro by this time and we focus on killing one mob. If not we pull one ASAP and burn it down quick.<br />
<br />
8) We evac early and often, usually after kiling only 1 or 2 (clerics OOM) sometimes without killing any.  I think our record so far is about 8 or 9.  just a short run from D-ring to portal where we med, rebuff as needed and try again.<br />
<br />
9) If the above has gone well, the portal is broken within 1-2 hours and regular pulling begins.  First with nearby roamers then buildings.  The building on the west wall south of the portal still gives us lots of trouble.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>dirtybax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">We do a WW break and they are usually pretty flawless.  We basically send 3 AE groups in, they run straight to the wall and then AE any adds they picked up along the way.  Then we send in any other groups that are left.<br />
