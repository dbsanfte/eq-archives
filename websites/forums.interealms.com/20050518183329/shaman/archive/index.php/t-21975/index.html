<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Positive changes, in no particular order:<br />
<br />
1.  Dragons can now fly<br />
<br />
2.  Dryads are in the game.  They are actually small fairy-like creatures rather than the dryads of Greek/Roman myth.  They hover rather than walking.  Their appearance is very customisable.<br />
<br />
3.  Combat lag appears to be fixed.<br />
<br />
4.  Mob AI appears to be slowly changing.  Mobs are increasingly forming groups which cannot be split.  This is leading to more varied and interesting fights.<br />
<br />
5.  Formulae for high level gear (level 81+) is now in game.  Its very expensive so should provide the necessary money-sink needed for high level players.<br />
<br />
Problems that remain:<br />
<br />
1.  No dungeons.  Adventuring is essentially in outdoor zones.  I  miss dungeons.<br />
<br />
2.  Little high level content.  Once above level 60 the choice of content available to you starts to dwindle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Breaking news: there's been staff laid off at AE, the developer of Horizons.  The game may have a limited life expectancy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Horizons life expectancy was severly impacted during the initial coup when the founder of AE was ousted. Shortly after they entered a long period of silence, and the game that emerged was nothing like what was originally spec'd and touted. It was a real shame how they handled that entire take over.<br />
<br />
I never even bought the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I am currently trying the game out with the 7 day trial thing.  Really customizable characters.  So much so that I was very confused at first.</div></div><hr />

<br />
LoL, if char customizing confused you in horizons, you better stick with EQ1 and not try any of the new and upcoming mmorpgs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just at first.  There is no such thing as a &quot;tree&quot; or scheme to things.  And documentation is sorely lacking.  Tried it, found it ok gamewise and empty of people.  The dependancy on other players or yourself to upgrade, especially when there are not many other players, makes the game somewhat disappointing.<br />
<br />
After a day or so the characters made more sense.</div></div><hr />
