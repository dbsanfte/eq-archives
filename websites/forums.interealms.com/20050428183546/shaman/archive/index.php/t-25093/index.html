<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Wow I did ragefire for the first time tonight. I was able to complete 2 of my 4 elite quests there but died on the &quot;Slaying the Beast&quot; guy. Bad pull got us a train of mobs and we wiped. Still I must say WOW Ragefire looks awesome. The whole feel to it. I don't know how much bigger it is but the place looks fantastic. Kudos to Blizzard for another cool zone.<br />
Anyone else done Ragefire yet?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>drib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've done Ragefire, Wailing Caverns and Shadowfang Keep so far.  All very entertaining and nice rewards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Soul - there's a trick to Ragefire.  The &quot;Slaying the Beast&quot; guy is linked to all the troggs along the dead end path that goes to the left way down near the bottom of the initial trail.  If you kill that trail first, no mob zerg later when you attack the quest mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">We did all 5 quests in Rage yesterday, was a blast.<br />
<br />
2 were from Org (Thrall and Neeru), 2 were from TB, and one was from UC.  It's good to get them all if you can before you go in, nice to wipe them out in one shot.<br />
<br />
What have you guys found is the optimal level to go in to Rage?  We tried when our highest was a 16 shaman and the tank (me) was 13 and the priest was 12, and had a 15 rogue with us.  So this 4 man group found it difficult to say the least.  We went back with our average level about 17 and it was pretty much too easy.  We could rush and 3 spawns and take them down no problem.  We still didn't have cc though, so it was brute force, but interesting still.<br />
<br />
I think the best time to go is right around lvl 15 or 16 at most to be challenged, but still have it survivable.<br />
<br />
We had some issues finding the best loot settings too, between NBG and group loot.  Wasn't too much of a problem since only 2 items were bind on pick up, the rest were bind on equip, so could still sort it out.  Except our shaman did loot a bind on pickup sword grrrrr.<br />
<br />
And also, agree that sometimes some recon can help :).  If you try to clear around a boss mob from different angles, it's easier to fight him solo.  We ended up doing that on a couple of them.  Also, be patient on pulls to minimize adds.  Pathing allows you to pull a lot of singles if you watch carefully, although some 3 pulls are unavoidable.<br />
