<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Scurvey Pestilential</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">New I should have farmed them while I had the chance :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tranzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">and yet no mention of fixing Rak and Neth..*sighs*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Still doable though, have key, and also not sure but they had all high resists. So its possible to still do them dotting them, and pet tanking. And if you got disease based root...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">what we need to do, is next time everyone logs in, petition/feedback/bug or whatever that our epic quest mobs have been hosed, and are still that way.  try to be as verbose and descriptive as you can, to help avoid the chance that the people who dont know what you are talking about (SOE reps), will get confused and not move on this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have always tried my best to mentor younger shaman who are up and coming... and it pains me to say that several of them still ask me if that bug is fixed. I've managed to arrange a few tears here and there for them, but always give the caveat that they have to wait for SOE to give a ****. <br />
<br />
Makes me feel like I've failed at my duties to them.</div></div><hr />
