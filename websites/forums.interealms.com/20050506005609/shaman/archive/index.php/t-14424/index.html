<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tiorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">question as per post<br />
<br />
and at what lvl if they can?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>nornez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Haven't noticed any conflicting post, but yes our pets can dual wield from the first pet we get. <br />
<br />
Just give the pet a combination of either a 1HS &amp; 1HB weaps or a piercer &amp; 1HS or 1HB &amp; turn off the see others hits filter so you will see your pets damage. You will see him both slash &amp; bash or whatever combo you gave him.<br />
<br />
Damage output is considerably more than when the pet has not been given any weaps. Just farm rustys or whatever &amp; keep a couple pack in the bank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">They dont duel wield naturally, but if you get two weapons they will start doing it.  This is what people refer to as &quot;project alpha&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">They dont duel wield naturally.<br />
<br />
Well, sorta.  The parse I posted a while ago shows they do, just by looking at the # of attacks they get.  It's just not often.<br />
<br />
Give them one 1h weapon, and you see attacks with the type of damage (slash, crush, etc) for the primary paw, and some off-hand (off-paw?) attacks with the pet's &quot;natural&quot; weapons.  Give them a second weapon, and the frequency of the off-hand attacks goes up noticably.<br />
<br />
Funny how it works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">BTW, good source for cheap weapons are fishing vendors -- people often sell back the rusty daggers, you can buy them for like 3 sp each.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grellaart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The fishing vendor in PoT near the Nightmare enterance sells fishing spears, cheap, and great doggy weps.<br />

Grell, 65 shami</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sylino</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ah thanks Grell... never looked at that vendor twice before, now I will be a regular customer!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Rustys work fine, but i like to use shivs, which are common drops in Dulak. I don't have any parse or anything, but I swear my pet hits for max more often and for more damage altogether when using them over rustys. You can get in bazaar for under 5pp, but your best bet is to check vendors in PoK, cost a little over 7gp at best prices. If you have a little extra money to spare, the best stuff to get is mage summoned....either blade of walnan or fists of ixiblat...they give 50hps and proc, but I don't think they proc until the 61 pet (I know the 49 pet don't proc them)...and also either belt of magi'kot (250hps) or girdle of magi'kot (500 hps). On my server, you can get each for about 5pp (total 15pp) in bazaar. If you want a procing weapon, either velium weapons (only 12hp DD tho - about 10pp each in baz) or gnoll hide lariat (proc stun - about 10-15pp) are also nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The mage weapons also have +magic or +fire damage. <br />
<br />
Love mages :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">yea, plus I forgot the belt/girdle give 10 and 15 to all stats....though I'm not sure how much of an effect this has (I can't say I ever saw any difference, but such a small amount I'd be likely not to without a good parse).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Wampaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I give the pet both weapons at a time. Works everytime. Nice to get mage weapons, dagger of dropping, velium weapons or gnoll hide lariets.<br />
<br />
Buff his dex, haste him and hell proc alot. Good way for him to keep aggro too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>icebain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Have you read the description on a GHL now it says only affects 55 and below (.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I could be wrong, but I believe our pet has a higher attack rating with slashing weapons than with h2h.  Thus, use mage summoned swords (as opposed to fist) and you'll get a pet that has a high atk and is duel-wielding 150dd proc weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Fishing Spears are awful pet weapons because they don't fit in the secondary slot; you can't dual wield them.</div></div><hr />

It never actually stunned level 56+ mobs. No pre-PoP stun other than the Paladin Divine Stun AA would.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">a bad pet weapon is.. <br />
screaming mace<br />
<br />
you get a &quot;you pets screamingMace_Spell has worn off&quot; message every 10 seconds :p<br />
gets really annoying</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Vorpatril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I used to try to get mage weapons, but I found the proc to be annoying. Yes, the dmg is nice but since I like to root mobs and sic the pet on it while I rot/canni/buff/handle adds, the proc would break root, which I found to be annoying. <br />
<br />
I found that in FoB, there is a merchant that sells 3/20 daggers that are 3sp each. I use my spiritstone to fly there to pick some up, then gate back to wherever I'm fighting. <br />
<br />
The dmg difference when equipped with weapons is remarkable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
AHA!  That's why it didn't work when I tried it.   I bought a couple in the bazaar and tried soloing in PoN, never saw a difference and never tried it again.  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />
