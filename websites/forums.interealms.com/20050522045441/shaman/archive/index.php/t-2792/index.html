<br />
Possibly netherbein at 24th..</div></div><hr />

We are not too bad twinked but Luclin's red con takes us too much time to drop.<br />
what about the Warren or Stonebrunt mountains ? is xp good there?<br />
I never hunted there with my shaman (kinda too high). <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sepisis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Snare necklace quest starts in the cleric guild in Neriak.  You need to raise your faction by running a letter from the DE in the Grobb shaman guild to the quest giver in Neriak.  Takes about 2 or 3 letters to get your faction up enough.  <br />
<br />
You can find the rest on allakhazams.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fulgrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Pauldren is BY FAR... the easiest xp I HAVE SEEN IN THE GAME for your level.....<br />
<br />
DONT GO ANYWHERE ELSE&gt;&gt;&gt; for a twink that is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zenyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">where the hell is Pauldren?<br />
<br />
Or are you referring to paludal caverns? exp is by far the best there.</div></div><hr />
