<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wudlaorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings all. Hope I can get some suggestions here. I am currently level 37 Barb shammy with a series of weapons. Ive been using a Spine chill spear for the last few levels and my piercing skill is maxxed for level but im only hitting for 30 max. I have a groaning mace(2hb) and Frost giant femur(2hb) which let me hit in the 50's. My skill with 2hb is only around 50. Should I work the 2hb up? Or stay with the piercing weapon which is faster? I'm currently fighting in Eastern Wastes with wolf by my side at all times. Any help would be appreciated<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Try to bring all 3 of our main weapon abilities up; Piercing, 1hb, 2hb.  2hb will take the most work, there really aren't a lot of fast 2hb (Kechata Koro Mis 7/30, and &quot;shovel&quot; which is delay 27).<br />
<br />
There are some truly awesome weapons in all 3 categories.  I chose to stick with piercing, and came late to 2hb, neglected 1hb for a long time.  Skill slow to come now that I'm repairing them.<br />
<br />
I use epic for piercing, I'm getting hits in the 60s.  Rune Etched Iceworm Fang is an awesome and fast piercer.  I used the Spine Chill till I got my Epic, tho.<br />
<br />
2hb with my Tae Ew War Maul (33/36) lets me regularly smash things for 100-130s, at skill 185.  I was late starting this one, and am still suffering.  I carry Blight and the Barb Spritist's Hammer for variety.<br />
<br />
1hb is still underdeveloped on me, so I haven't concentrated on high-damage weaps here yet.  Using a Noble's Walking Staff (8/19) until skill improves.<br />
<br />
I'd concentrate on piercing, 2hb, and 1hb, in that order.</div></div><hr />
