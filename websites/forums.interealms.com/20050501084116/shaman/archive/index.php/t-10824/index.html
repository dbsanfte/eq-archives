<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">If you turn off all models and summon the horse do you still recieve the nice benefits we used to get? Or do you HAVE to use new horse and char models to recieve the benefits?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dyrk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You only have to enable your race and horse models to use the horse.  You don't have to enable all race models.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I believe i have ALL models off including horses.  I still get benifiets of horse</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have everything off an get the effects.<br />
you must have everything off OR at least have your race and horses on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ezeekial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think you guys are wrong. I've tried it both ways, i think there was even a patch that fixed this very scenario a bit ago. I am surprised there is any confusion on this matter.<br />
<br />
However, it be very easy to test. Go OOM and med to full with graphics on and off, while timing. There would be a significant difference, if i am correct.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ezeekial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I went ahead and tested it.  i used the Everquest internal clock, and used Inner Fire to get me to approximately 0-9 mana or 0% mana.<br />
<br />
With Barbarian and Horse models, i went from 0% mana to 50% mana in 6 minutes and 2 seconds. <br />
<br />
With all Luclin graphics turned off, i went from 0% to 16% mana in 6 minutes and 2 seconds. <br />
<br />
So yeah you need your race and horse models on to get benefits of horses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Baldkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Please tell me you clicked an insta click item to refresh the mana...<br />

My mana still jumps up when I cast a clicky after a min or two.. heck, seeing mana go *up* when I slow a mob happens... if I'm not actively canni-ing.</div></div><hr />

i have horse models off, and seem to get the benefits- mana jumps up when i canni- i have female kitty model on only.<br />

some folk can see my horse other cant- even the some with horse models ON cant see it.<br />

<br />
I can assure you that I am getting the med benefits of the horse.  I have all Luclin models off.  Just the med bar refresh issue TELLS me that I am, but I can also notice a huge difference in mana regen between having the horse and not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You defintely get the benefit of the horse with horse model off and luclin models off, you just don't see your med bar go up till you cast a spell or click your bridle.<br />
<br />
I much prefer models off for another five reasons.<br />
<br />
1. No need to shrink everytime to get rid of that horse head blocking your view.<br />
<br />
2. You travel faster with sow if you have the low-end horse like me<br />
<br />
3. Less lag<br />
<br />
4. Luclin models are butt ugly IMHO<br />
<br />
5. You can duck to interrupt spells</div></div><hr />

That's the same thinking that is causing everyone to be pissed over the Affliction foci bug fix.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am using this &quot;feature&quot; and I have little video lag and still get mana back (mana refreshes after clickly/spell).  I still shrink myself so that those that have models on aren't feeling like they are driving behind an SUV while in a VW bug.<br />
<br />
I won't complain though if they remove the &quot;feature&quot; in nine months since I still can use my horse then anyway just with more lag.</div></div><hr />

The exploit is that you can run at SoW speeds with the models all off if you have the cheapie horse.  <br />
<br />
It's not a huge thing, but techically it is an exploit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Solariis did a good job of enumerating the benifits from exploiting this bug.<br />
<br />
This is a fairly minor exploit in comparison to other possible violations of the EULA, but some poeple value their personal integrity and will strive to behave in an honerable maner if they are aware of the situation.<br />
<br />
Most people that cheat / exploit are only restricted from such behavior by external factors like bug fixes and GM warning / bannings.  Others value honesty and integrity and try in good faith not to violate the EULA.  All I am doing is pointing out that the advise on how to use the horse without the models turned on is an exploit so that those whose behavior is regulated internaly instead of externaly can make a informed decision.<br />
<br />
An honest person is honest even when no one is looking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Thanks all!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">At the moment there are two different implementations of horse.<br />
<br />
If you have models on you get:<br />
1) Horse startup, running, and stopping physics.<br />
2) Innate safe fall.<br />
3) You cannot duck to interrupt spells.<br />
4) Aggroless spell swapping.<br />
5) Continuous mana updates.<br />
<br />
With Models off you get:<br />
1) Your character's movement physics.<br />
2) No safe fall.<br />
3) You can duck to interrupt spells.<br />
4) You do not have aggroless spell swapping.<br />
5) Spikey mana updates that can be manually refreshed by casting a spell.<br />
<br />
Both versions include meditation and a huge increase in the amount of food and water consumed.  Neither horse cancels any other movement buff, but both conflict with illusion buffs.<br />
<br />
Neither has been determined to be the true horse by SOE.  Neither has been determined to be an exploit by SOE.  They are just two different options available to players, like whether you turn your clipping plane down in laggy zones or not.<br />
<br />
I can't believe there are posts attempting to measure Sony's intent and therefore judging people as exploiting or being 'honest' based on the models setting they choose.  The fact that there are two implementations of horse doesn't make using one 'right' and the other 'wrong'.  That's just nonsense.<br />
<br />
I have models off.  I zone about 2 minutes quicker and I like the old models anyway.  I also prefer the non-models version of the horse.  It works more along the lines of what I expect a horse to do.  Somehow this makes me an exploiter and dishonest according to some unique opinions on this board.  Ah well - I'm betting they turn down their clip in the bazaar too - cheaters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Battle Axe,<br />
<br />
I find it hard to comprehand that you honestly beleive that SOE designed the horse to provide more game benifit if it is used with the horse model turned off instead of on.<br />
<br />
I find it quite remarkable that you would choose to argue that the developers at SOE designed two implementations of the horse so that players could then decide to turn off the model in order to receive all the same positive benifits of the horse without a great number of the negatives.<br />
<br />
Also,  SOE has attempted to fix this bug in the past.  Lots of people used the horse with the new models on and with the horse turned off before SOE &quot;fixed&quot; the bug.  Now you must turn off all the new models in order to get the horse to function.<br />
<br />
I do think you are dishonest and exploiting however clever your rationalizations might be.  Is this a big sin?  Nope, it is minor and in the long run it may never be fixed because it's game impact is fairly small and restricted to a small number of players.  No one makes you push the EULA button when you play and no one is going to punish you for such a minor offense, but it is still dishonest and shows a lack of personal character.<br />
<br />
Lots of people will give you a pass and lots of those will also be exploiting the same bug.  Some few will activly chose not to violate the EULA.  Personaly,  I don't care very much what you do in the game.  I don't look at your face when I shave in the morning.<br />
<br />
Let me clearly state that I don't write this because of the people that exploit.  People that cheat / exploit are as common as ticks on a stray dog and will find little value in my missive.  The reason I mention this is because some few do care that they behave honerable and those values will govern how they conduct themselves.  If all men where honest the people would need no laws.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Well, so long as they use your definition of honesty obviously.<br />
<br />
I'm not reading Sony's mind.  If it's a bug and needs fixing, they'll fix it.  Obviously there's little compunction about them doing that.  <br />
<br />
I don't get safe fall, so there's some trade-off involved.  You do get aggroless spell swapping with models off, which is probably the best part of a horse.  <br />
<br />
I hate the new graphics and I hate the way you can't see with the horse head there, and shrinking is an odd way to have to deal with that.  The Luclin artists were simply horrible.  <br />
<br />
That's a mighty broad brush you use there Radag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">SOE designed the horse to provide more game benifit <br />
I do think you are dishonest and exploiting however clever your rationalizations might be<br />
<br />
You rationalize &quot;different&quot; into &quot;more&quot; in order to give yourself a &quot;holier than thou&quot;, virtual half inch moral high-ground to preach from.  The horse options have different benefits and one isn't all that better than another.<br />
<br />
SOE changed the way it worked once, because at one time people had all models on but their own, which was apparently not what Sony intended.  You read the intent of the change (though no explanation was posted) to mean that Sony didn't want to have 2 horse implementations, but what really happened is Sony made the game so you either have all models on, all models off, or you get no horse at all.<br />
<br />
You're welcome to disagree with me.  You're welcome to discuss this with me.  But to call me dishonest for using a horse at the same time I have models off puts you on that fake half inch moral high-ground in the company of Jim Baker and Jimmy Swaggart.  Congratulations.  You've arrived.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">hmm, I get a &quot;you have to have your race and horse model enable&quot; error if I try to play completely without luclin models.<br />
The only thing I don't like about the horse models on is the lack of ducking. A &quot;spellinterrupt&quot; hotkey would be nice. I love the safe fall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Ok, Radag, answer me this:<br />
<br />
I have all models off.  Did this pretty much after I started playing again about 2 months ago because my machine just couldn't handle the new ones well.<br />
<br />
Then I bought a horse.<br />
<br />
So... what, can I not use SoW while I'm on my horse?  Because with the models off, without it I don't even get the moderate speed increase having the models on would give me.  Would it be different if I had jboots, could I use those?<br />
<br />
If I need to run away, is the morally ethical thing to do to turn on walk for three seconds before hitting run, to simulate the effect?<br />
<br />
Give me good answers for those, THEN tell me having SoW and horse on together is an exploit.</div></div><hr />
