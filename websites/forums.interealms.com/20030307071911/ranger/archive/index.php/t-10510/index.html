<br />
Onyx Earring:AGI+2<br />
<br />
Studded Leather Collar: AC3 STR+1 STA+1<br />
<br />
Which drop off of elites and above. (Meaning creatures of their level or above.) I forget the going price, but I auctioned for them and bought them for around 5pp I think. <br />
<br />
Giant Snake Fang: DMG5 DLY27<br />
<br />
Drop off of the giant snakes (imagine that) and sell for about one gold piece to merchants.  <br />
<br />
Other than that the only other things that drop here are rusty weapons, various pieces of clothing and copper, silver, and some gold. <br />
<br />
<br />
[Quests]<br />
<br />
Gnoll Teeth: NO DROP<br />
The teeth drop randomly off any gnoll except for Gnoll Pups. A great quest to complete for exp. This quest alone makes Blackburrow a great place for a ranger to level up Every Gnoll Tooth you give to Capt. Tillin in South Qeynos who stands overlooking the arena. He'll give you a moonstone which can be given to McNeal Jocub in The Fish's Ale bar in the same zone for more experiance and some alcohol which is worth about a gold piece to a NPC merchant. Antonious Bayle, Qeynos Gaurd, and Qeynos Merchant factions are all given positive hits. Negative hits for Circle of Unseen Hands and Corrupt Qeynos Gaurds. You can also give them to someone in Halas, but are you really going to run all the way through Everfrost to bother? I think not. Teeth are a great way to gain experiance and money, so collect the teeth!<br />
<br />
Cloak of Jaggedpine: AC6 DEX+3 LORE MAGIC NODROP<br />
After giving Gnasher's Head to Larsk Juton in Surefall Glade and he will tell you about the Gnoll Brewers. For this quest you need three casks from the Gnoll Brewer or Gnoll Master Brewer. I have only half-heartedly tried this quest. The Gnoll Brewers spawns underneath the Elite Ledge and doesn't spawn very often and drops the cask randomly. So be prepared to wait around for him a long time. As the amount of time vs reward isn't enough to keep me in one spot for this bloody cloak, but I digress.</div></div><hr />
