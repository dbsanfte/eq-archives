    Planes of Power: Exploratory Outing<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Last Night Maz, Sareb and I got to do a little exploring of the Planes, this is what was found... <br />
<br />
Plane of Knowledge: <br />
This is the first plane you enter into, and in completely safe for anyone to enter into, regardless of faction or other issues, as combat is COMPLETELY impossible in the zone - you cannot dual, nor can you accidently attack a merchant or anyone you are talking to - the nature of the plane prevents it. <br />
<br />
It is reached by any of the various pedestals with books atop them in various zones near or around all of the starting cities, Firona Via, Overthere, Great Divide, and the Nexus. From the plane you can also access instant transport to any zone to which you can get to the plane from and will probably soon replace the nexus as a central hub of travel. Also in this zone is a soulbinder to make things even easier. There is also a teleportation stone which will take you to the Plane of Tranquility. <br />
<br />
The Plane of Knowledge (PoK) is divided into five sections. There is a Light Section where you will find trainers for the good races, a Neutral Section, an Evil Section, a Merchantile Quarter (which I have not really seen, but an guard greeted me upon my arrival here and indicated such existed), and a great library in the center of the plane. <br />
<br />
The Library is quite vast, and it is easy to get lost in until you become familiar with it's layout. Within this library you can find merchants which will sell you many many spells for every class that is capable of casting spells or bardsongs. I have found two new ranger spells, one for level 29 Rangers and one for level 39 Rangers (there is allegedly a third, but I have yet to find it). I am also told there are new spells for all of the other classes, but I am unaware of them. Within the library there is also a glass elevator that will take you to the ruling council of the PoK, all of whom have aids and give quests. <br />
<br />
Plane of Tranquility (PoT): <br />
The is the second plane you can access, and is accessible from the PoK in the same manner as accessing any other area from the PoK. There is also a pedestal here which will take you back to the PoK. <br />
<br />
This is another plane in which you are completely safe, being ruled over the god of Tranquility, and in the background you will hear the ringing of tibettan mediatation gongs, find weavewatchers, and monks meditating. The PoT is gorgeous and time spent wandering aimlessly around it will reward you with the discovery of portals to all of the other Planes, although specific quests or achievements might be required to access each different portal. <br />
<br />
The Portals we were able to find and verify the destinations of were: Plane of Invention, Plane of Disease, and the Plane of Justice. <br />
<br />
All of the planes save PoK and PoT have graveyards, which I will explain shortly, having had the opportunity to discovery their usefulness firsthand. <br />
<br />
Plane of Invention (PoI): <br />
This plane is accessed via a windmill in the PoT, and is similar to Akakanon gone awry. Giant malevolent robots, and deadly tiny ratlike cleaners roam the hall, and appear to be hostile to those of us who went - a gnome however may have better luck here than the Wood-Elf Ranger, Dark Elf Enchanter and Human Magician involved in the initial exploration. <br />
<br />
Most things here appeared to be able to be assaulted by a group of individuals of the same skill as myself, although some would require a bit of luck to kill. <br />
<br />
The exit to the PoK from PoI is supposedly near to the entrance, but I cannot describe what is was, as I had exited the plane by way of a Resurection from an earlier incident in the Plane of Justice. <br />
<br />
Plane of Disease (PoD): <br />
The entrance to PoD is a giant open sewer(!) in the PoT. Jumping into the rushing torrent of noxious substances as it exits the sewer will flush you down a series of tubes into the Plane of Disease. <br />
<br />
Not much exploration was done here, as everything looked to be well beyond the capabilities of our small expiditiary force. <br />
<br />
Of the landscape, it is exactly what you would expect the plane of disease would look like. Use your immagination, and you'll probably be dead on. Bertoxxulous is probably somewhere in here too, fortunately we didn't meet him. <br />
<br />
Exiting the PoD is via a trapdoor near where you enter the plane. <br />
<br />
Plane of Justice (PoJ): <br />
This zone is accessed via the large scales atop the mountain in the PoT, and egress from this plane is via a slightly confusing series of corridors and doors, the last door being the exit back the the PoT - some exploration or a person who knows where the exit is is advisable for any who wish to explore here. <br />
<br />
This area is a vast prison, containing many prisoners who have been imprisoned by the tribunal from their crimes. Many have obviously been in this prison since long before the common tongue of Norath had been devised, and do not understand any language but that which they spoke when they weere imprisoned. - The was a Drake I spoke with who only understood Elder Dragon, and Maz spoke with a Dark Elf who only understood Ancient Tier'Dal. <br />
<br />
Although mostly safe, it appears that there are some prisoners who do not want to be disturbed... doing so will upset them, they will attack you and call for the guards. After a surprise attack by one of the prisoners upon Sareb's Pet (followed by Sareb's timely gate to saftey and my untimely demise) we were a little more cautious in our explorations. <br />
<br />
Maz has claimed to have found the Tribunal himself/theirself. Although I was busy returning to the planes from SurefallGlade following my death and did not witness these beings. <br />
<br />
Graveyards: <br />
All of the Planes in which Combat takes place contain a graveyard. This is the area you enter into when entering the zone. If you die within a plane, after about 30 minutes your body will pop up in the graveyard, making corpse and equipment recovery far easier than anywhere else in Norath. A thankful boon for those explorers who unknowingly wander into the wrong place at the wrong time. <br />
<br />
This concludes the initial scouting report for the Planes newly opened. Many new quests and adventures are up there, with new equipment and experiences to be had...<br />

We went down and down and then we got 2 a room with sever big executioner looking dudes and some guy there floating in front of a portal tipe wall sait something about being judged and of course psyco me said i wanna be judged and clicked on the wall -OMFG i almost crapped a twinkee - I was on this floating platform with a space like void all around me and 6 giant black jumbo executioner type mobs with big ass mallots. and i though to myself ok how am i gonna cr from here. I hailed one and he did not kill me he asked me what i wanted and i replyed &quot;my mommy&quot; that did not work so i tried several things none of witch worked.
