<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>TwoBrew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, HELLO WORLD! <br />
<br />
I played EQ when it first came out, then left...Came back last year and played a Ranger to 40...and left again.<br />
<br />
I'm back because it's hard to stay away. I'm a Shaman now in Halas. <br />
<br />
I've been fighting, and have my spells thru level 5.<br />
<br />
Got a couple questions. Thanks in advance for any help you can give me!<br />
<br />
1. Ok, I've looked at the spells...I know what they do, but I'm wondering what to have memorized. What has more priority?<br />
I'm level 6 right now, but will probably be 9 before Friday...<br />
SO...when I get my level 9 spells, what's the set up I should have?<br />
<br />
2. I'm on the Tunare server. I wanted to go onto a server I hadn't played before...the people so far have been REALLY friendly. I've gotten a Crystalline Belt and some basic leather armor from higher ups. Should I be shooting for banded right now? <br />
<br />
3.As a level 6'er I'm casting Flame Burst and Drowsy in the EPeaks. Then melee-ing the rest of the way through...Is this the basic way of fighting for the Shaman?<br />
<br />
4.I've been reading the posts here, but there's a lot of high level posts. All I have right now is EQ and Kunark, so I really can't travel everywhere for quests right now...I don't want to screw up faction. That's why I quit last time. My Ranger was hated ONLY by bankers and there was NO way for me to raise faction. Will little quests (wolly fungus,etc) ruin my faction with important functions of the game?<br />
<br />
Thanks again for any advice you can give me! <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">the little quests (wolly fungus, goblin necklaces, other stuff) is the reason Ef is a great newbie zone, and it doesnt mess up faction at all. other than that i think youve got everything right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The shaman is a different class, because how you play changes as you level.<br />
<br />
At lower levels, you're more a melee with some buffs - you can also play sole healer for your group.  Don't forget about using Inner Flame at low levels, instead of the heal spells.<br />
<br />
Buffs help, but their aid can be limited... a lot of the help is in people's minds.  So go as appropriate.  Not sure when we get our first root, but I pretty much always keep one memmed.  Actually, I keep my best heal, root, gate, and select debuffs/offensive spells up, switching in for buffs as needed.  Of course, at lower levels, they don't last long, and you don't have as many to choose from.<br />
<br />
As for what you cast now, the really big thing is to keep your skills up - especially if you're levelling fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not sure about the faction quests but the banker in Halas isn't on Rogue faction any more so that isn't a concern. Banded and a decent weapon is a good goal for your level. If you saved/sold all the tailoring supples that you looted on your way to 6th lvl, you might have enough for that right now. Check out the intiate symbol of the tribunal quest, gives a nice newbie neck item that acts as a light source and summons a (crappy) magic hammer. Good enough for wisp hunting in a few levels though. The quest takes maybe 30 minutes to complete. <br />
<br />
As for spells, dot and melee is probably the easisest way at that level. Pull with the disease dot, melee till dead, heal yourself with Inner Fire (twice as mana efficient as your 1st lvl heal) and repeat. At 9th lvl, you can add your first poison DoT to the mix.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">BTW, the DoT vendor is in the middle of Everfrost, at the north end of the plains.  Just so you don't wonder (as I and many other newbies have) where the heck you are supposed to buy them at.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i remember finding bearn starjumper at lvl 18 or so :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">be carefull when doing warrior guild quests btw...<br />
<br />
Alot of the warrior guild quests such as the gnoll fang quest, and maybe others have a neg hit to the rogue guild in halas.  the banker is a rogue, and him not liking you = bad :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>hladar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Glad you choose tunare, prolly the most crowded server though. Nevertheless tunare is a great server and very social =). Drop me a tell in game if you ever need any advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Thorgryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">As a barbarian shaman, it is very important at low levels to do the initiate symbol of the tribunal quest, it is doable at level 1 (with some luck when running thru blackburrow) and nets you a + wisdom and mana necklace that summons a 6/32 undead bane 3 weapon (so its 9/32 vs skeletons and the like)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">First piece of advice, don't buy that Spirit of Wolf spell at lvl 9, it's a waste of money.  And you get the pleasure of watching the jaws drop when you tell beggars &quot;nah, I never bought that&quot;.<br />
<br />
Seriously, you should be using Inner File as your healing spell, so it should be up all the time.  Your best DD spell.  And then tank, tank tank until about lvl 14.<br />
<br />
Lvl 14-24 are tough, no doubt about it.  At 24 you get regen/cannibalize and a great DOT and you're back in business.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ginslunger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'm on Tunare now and have a 27 Enchanter named Mcgynn.  Played a shaman on Torv to 52.  Shoot me a tell if you have questions.<br />
<br />
Shaman can be difficult to play early, but are extremely fun post 24 or so due to their versatility.  They can solo or contribute to groups depending on what's available.  However, the lvls up to that point can be a grind.  My advice, keep your skills up, make friends with competent players and learn how to adapt your skills to fit the situation as this is the shaman's forte.<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">This is the site to ask questions.  The best shamans in the game read and post here.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Congrats on joo new shaman.<br />
<br />
Da shaman class just gets better and better as joo lvl up.  It is lots of fun.<br />
<br />
some ealy lvl tips<br />
<br />
1) get a weapon of each type as soon as joo can.  Try and keep all joo weapon skills maxed. 2hb and pierce are da most important.<br />
<br />
2)  Keep defense and offense maxed each lvl buy soloing.  Just tank da monster till it be dead.<br />
<br />
Joo other skills should also be maxed da best joo can but they can be &quot;practiced&quot; outside of combat so not as critical to work on.<br />
<br />
The first lvls go so fast that it is hard to get all you weapon skills maxed at first.  Mez not have dem all fixed up till about lvl 12 or 13 I think.<br />
<br />
Joo be broke all da time at lower levels and getting cash for spells is a big problem.  Da price on spells takes a big jump at lvl 9 or so.  Plan ahead so joo have da cash for da spells.<br />
<br />
Have lots of fun wid joo shaman.<br />
