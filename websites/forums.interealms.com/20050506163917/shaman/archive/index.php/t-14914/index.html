<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jonaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So we killed AoW yesterday and I wanted to test what my nuke damage is like.<br />
<br />
Fight lasted just under 7 mins, most are lvl 65 with quite some aa's:<br />
<br />
Mage 44k<br />
Mage 43k<br />
Wizard 42k<br />
Mage 41.5k<br />
Druid 40.5k<br />
Ench 35.5k (with DC pet)<br />
Necro 35k<br />
Monk 32.5k<br />
Rogue 26.5k (only lvl 61 I think with few aa's)<br />
Me 26k<br />
Monk 25k<br />
<br />
I was surprised that I outdamage most other melees and was wondering if I could get caster like damage with nukes, I was chain casting Velium Strike and have ice dd focus (forgot to ask for mana safe focus from mage). Anyone specialised in evocation or have parses from a Shaman with evocation specced?<br />
I only got scf1 and scm1 and specced in alteration and will get scm3 soon and probably scf3.</div></div><hr />

26000 damage in 420 seconds is 61 DPS.<br />
<br />
In comparison, if you had simply chain-cased blood of saryrn, you would have done 53 DPS.<br />
<br />
You probably didn't even outdamage the MT, nevermind the rogues, monks, and rangers.</div></div><hr />

Max crit I can get with mage focus bracer is 2035, which is <br />
(925x2)+(925/5). Interested to know what other peoples highest crits are.<br />
<br />
In Solro yesterday I dotted mob with ancient scourge of nife(burning affliction 3 item)+ chain nuked velium strike and did not get aggro. However unsure which would have been more dps, chain raining torrent of poison and Tears of saryn or the option I did.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't have Blood yet but Bane got resisted 3 times so I didn't try again.<br />
<br />
MT did 15k, died after about 6 mins though, ST died even earlier cos he got unexpected agro :P<br />
Compared to the other melees only my bot monk (staff of flowing water and ferine avatar) and our only 60+ rogue (lvl 61, tor vignus main hand, 15/21, 7% piercing mod, epic offhand) outdamage me, the other monk was close and all 3 65 rangers did just around 21k compared to my 26k. Bst did about 23k and we have quite some lower melees that all did under 20k.<br />
<br />
Since nowadays most I do is malos/slow and then just dd I was thinking if it might be worth switching to evocation since I can pretty much chain cast Velium Strike without getting agro and I don't use the mana for anything else anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">All of our buffs, debuffs, and heals are Alteration.  Our nukes and rains are evocation.  I just have a hard time imagining any shaman spending more mana on nukes/rains than Heals/Buffs/Debuffs overall.<br />
<br />
Our evocation spells are limited in usefullness and most certainly not our bread and butter.  If you're outdamaging the majority of the melee in your guild at 60ish DPS, I'd suspect it's more due to level/gear differences.  As you're melee gear up and gain in levels you'll see their DPS scale up while yours will go down as you take on higher end content and things like patch healing AE damage and resists kill your DPS.  <br />
<br />
I can chain nuke without the spec bonus for Evoc for quite a while regardless due to our mana regen.  The long ass cast times and relatively low damage/mana ratios severely limit my DPS potential relatively though, so often I find myself taking over patch heals and telling the druid to nuke while the clerics is busy in the CH chain.  it's a nice change when I can just sit and blast and I do pump out decent DPS IMO, but not enough to merit changing my specialization.</div></div><hr />

- One slight little problem people forget: After the 4th or 5th BoS he would have been summoned and killed in about 2 rounds max. A while ago I tested poison DoTs in VT, and every boss summoned me after about 4-7 DoTs casted. Of course when boss summons a shaman with AoW+ like mobs, it means a swift death.<br />
<br />
A shaman who is debuffing/slowing (gets early on aggro list) should nuke or rain for DPS. Disease DoTs work too. Avoid poison DoTs if you don't want to die fast and early in the fight.<br />
<br />
On bosses I FA DPS classes (about 4-5) then I chain nuke between FA casts. With focii and AA Velium strike is not half bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Depends on how strong of a hold your tanks have on aggro, I can run ultor pox blood and bane (don't have scourge) on most VT bosses w/o getting summoned at all, I just wait until about 85% to start dotting</div></div><hr />

Dependent on the mob of course, but have you ever tried cycling two rain spells (Tears of Saryrn and Torrent of Poison is what I use), with a Disease DoT or DD thrown in for good measure? Might surprise you what DPS a Shaman can pump out.<br />
<br />
Right now I would imagine that Specialization is more dependent on your mana pool and your Focus Effects than anything else. I am not spec'd in alteration and can throw out quite a few Tnarg's before running out of mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have indeed gone all out DPS many times and while we're no wizards we are capable of respectable DPS when we put our minds to it. :) <br />
<br />
/shrug I look at myself as primarily a support person in xp groups or raids.  I can and do crank up some DPS when the situation allows, but that's pretty much always a secondary concern and rarely can I recall really NEEDing more mana to nuke.  <br />
<br />
Hell, let's face it shaman don't go OOM all that often regardless in normal fights heh.  But when we're raiding, I tend to find myself pressed for mana most often when I'm stuck healing AE damage or patch healing in some other way.  Those heals can be critical and thus I view having mana for them as more important than having mana for an extra nuke or two.<br />
<br />
That's my viewpoint, but of course others are welcome to look at things from their own perspective. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zethrir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Dependent on the mob of course, but have you ever tried cycling two rain spells (Tears of Saryrn and Torrent of Poison is what I use), with a Disease DoT or DD thrown in for good measure?

<br />
Some raw numbers, assuming the rains get 1 resisted wave per a cast (things I fight so far tend to do better on average than just 2 waves, but I am not high end yet)<br />
<br />
ToP<br />
(540 * 2) / (6 + 12) = 60dps<br />
<br />
ToS<br />
(650 * 2) / (6 + 12) = 72dps<br />
<br />
So if you just chained cast both rains (you even have time for a canni 4, once after you have cast both rains) you would do 132dps.  If you have spell casting fury, the dps looks even better and you still have the option of throwing in a dot to add some more dps.  With horse, mana preservation, SD, C5, Canni 4 &amp; 5 and FT items you could keep it up for quite a while.<br />
<br />
Specialising with Evocation to me seems like a viable route.  I never seem to run out of mana with the spells I use of the alteration line.  I guess the only way to see if it is worth it is to log for a week of average play then add up how much mana you spent on alteration and how much you spent on evocation and let the numbers decide.<br />
<br />
I know I am going to look into this futher down the road (I am also wanting an upgrade to our rains in the next expansion (not that that means much), I can't believe the rain the druids get at 61)<br />

Evocation is for nukes.  You can reset all your specialzations to 49 by doing a quest.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Actually Xorraiz, you *can* go back and fix it.  There is a quest in the temple of solusek ro that lets you reset your speciailization.  After you do that, just chain cast an alteration spell until you get a specialization increase and you are set. <br />
<br />
I am an alter-spec shaman myself (it just naturally worked out that way).  I'm happy with that since I primarily cast buffs and heals.  I nuke *alot*, but it is always secondary to waht is going on (ie: not my primary job).  Since I never seem to not have enough mana to nuke, I never really worry about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">They may have changed aggro a bit Zor. Yesterday I tested on one of the Aten blobs and I stacked Saryn/BON/EB the whole fight from about 80% on including slowing.

<br />
I specialized in Alteration but I'm a big proponent of using our extra mana for nukes rather than DoTs (though as Sciek said, healing has to come first). Nukes generate less aggro than poison DoTs, work against PoP experience MOBs with low life expectancies, and Velium Strike with FoM3 and summoned focus items has a better mana/damage ratio than Bane of Nife.</div></div><hr />

Todate 1801.  Thats with Spell fury 2 and +30% focus<br />
- around 2120ish with bard song, fury 3 and 20% DD focus.<br />
<br />
As for poison dot aggro, I did my tests over 5 VT raids, never surived a boss. That was of course in January so all might be changed now, but there was no mention anywhere.  In XP groups it still aggroes a crapload so my guess is that there were no changes. VI would certanly announce aggro redux changes even if they don't care, for pure PR move.<br />
<br />
Guilds have more DPS, VT bosses live a much shorter time, that can explain why people almost live out bosses or being summoned only at 20% life or whatnot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Like others, I find that DD has much less aggro than our DoTs, and also does damage faster, with AA's and focuses. Since I have tons of AA (around 190), I went ahead and maxed out Casting Fury and Fury of Magic. I also have an Improved Damage IV item. On most boss fights, I nuke quite a bit now, if cold lands on them. I think my max crit is around 2035, though most are in the 1900 range. I don't have a Burning Affliction focus, so I can't compare my DD to DoT damage, however I usually do a mix of both if I can. <br />
<br />
Blood of Saryrn is just too much aggro if you nuke a lot. Ultor doesn't seem to piss mobs off nearly as bad, most likely due to the disease counter aggro nerf around a year ago.</div></div><hr />

Spec saves about 10% mana, so evo spec would let you cast 10% more nuke spells for the same amount of mana, over a long period. There ya go.</div></div><hr />

 Compared to the other melees ... outdamage me<br />
<br />
How do you know? Did they parse themselves, or did you just turn on other hits and collect from them? If you did not get the information from their logs of themselves, then your data is extremely suspect. You are missing hundreds of thousands of points of damage that were simply lost in spam or from when the other melees were out of range of your ability to see it.<br />
<br />
all 3 65 rangers did just around 21k compared to my 26k.<br />
<br />
This I find the most difficult to believe. Assuming these 65 rangers were all at least AM2, these figures for their damage is low to a factor that delves into outright silliness. When my former guild was killing Sontalak, our rangers would parse themselves (in a TWO minute fight) in the area of 20-30,000 damage (depending on bow quality, and if they had AM3 yet or not). And that was before the godly PoP bows existed yet.<br />
<br />
--Edit, now I'm beginning to think your whole post is a pile of BS. Please reconcile the following statements:<br />
<br />
 most are lvl 65 with quite some aa's:<br />
<br />
and our only 60+ rogue (lvl 61<br />
 we have quite some lower melees that all did under 20k.</div></div><hr />

Can you qualify this abit ?<br />
Is it 10% if you make the specialize check ? or is it a 10% average over a period of time ?  Also are you taking into account the AA's that increase the chance of the specialize check ?<br />

<br />
It has been parsed and very much accepted that spec throws are an always occurance at full value, and the quote &quot;aa's that increase chance&quot; really just increase this mana savings on all spells as if you had specialized in each skill plus of course doubling the bonus of your primary specialization.  This totals to ~22% mana savings on primary spec and ~12.5% mana savings on all other types.<br />
<br />
Since specialization doesnt increase the damage of your evocation spells there is really no reason to redo your specialization to evocation.  If you think of your specialization as a mana pres 4 item for all spells you cast of a certain type...which would you rather have...a focus that is used on spells you cast MOST often or a focus that is used on spells you cast less than most of the time?  And if you're casting mostly evoc spells i think you are playing the wrong class~<br />
<br />
And as to that parse...you outdamaged the rangers you describe as having decent amount of aa's and level 65 by  25%???! YOU WISH!  What were they using, hunting bows and arrows out of blackburrow?  Do they not know how to activate trueshot?  THe ONLY logical explanation i can see is if you pinned AOW into a corner...And even then...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Lohknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Am I the only Shaman here that trained SCF3 before SCR?  The one thing that shaman lack is DPS.  Why not train the AA that will help you fix that?  When I'm grouped, I malo slow and then just chain nuke.  With Canni 5 I never run out of mana.  Once I finish FoM3 I'll focus on things like SCRM and QB.  With the extra dps those aa's will come a lot faster.  Sure you might say, well your focus only lasts 1.5 hours while mine lasts 2.5.  Big deal, I'm not too lazy to refocus once an hour.  Or you might say well my Q heals for 2k while yours for 1.2k, again big deal, have the cleric top you off, or do what I do, and have a pet cleric close by to cast Supernatural Elixer on you.<br />
<br />
I use DoTs only when soloing, because the aggro is just too much on raids or groups.  Go ahead and try DoTing a raid boss.  Chain casting 6 DoT's at a time on a boss is a sure way to get summoned and quaded for 4k, and then look like an idiot.  Loading please wait....<br />

After reading this thread, I'm seriously considering changing my specialization from alteration to evocation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">After reading this thread, I'm seriously considering changing my specialization from alteration to evocation.<br />
<br />
This is my advice to you... The next time you join a group write down every single spell you cast for the period of an hour.  Try to do t his at least 2 different times...although for an entire week (7 groups or so) would be better.  Record for an hour starting with when you buff til the hour is over.  At this point compare what casting skill has taken the most mana (of course neglecting trying to compensate for alt specialization--just add up what the spell is supposed to take mana wise).  If you have somehow managed to use evocation and consumed more mana than any other skill then go ahead and change and it will benefit you.  The thing is though...if you never have mana problems when you're nuking why would you want to specialize in evocation? obviously nuking isnt causing your mana pool stress...and like i said above...specialization in evocation isnt going to up your damage so why?<br />
<br />
Run my test and report back though :) i'm just sorta curious.</div></div><hr />

Anyway, to go off topic, if you solo a lot, you should do conjuration, think about it, you cast fos/boar on yourself, maybe agi to help with lr =] (please no replies about agi).. then you root (180 mana), then you dotx2 bos/bou 1000mana epic, wait 36s cast  bos, wait until epic is done, refresh it, go get another mob.. hmm.. that's 2000mana you spent on conjuration, maybe you nuked for 900 with vs 300 mana =] geese I love contributing to the offtopicness :)</div></div><hr />
