<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mcast12</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've lived in CoM PLing my war for 20 levels, (he is 59 now) I've killed everything in the zone except Lhranc and now way too many mobs are light blue. I'm a 65 shaman with 180AAs, most spells etc.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking about where to go next, what do you think about the following zones? has anyone PLd a 59 mellee to 65+, if so where?<br />
<br />
sebilis - average xp but runners are annoying I think I will avoid<br />
chardok - haven't been in years, xp any good?<br />
PoP - PoD, PoN worth it?, last I was there things seemed to take a while to die<br />
droga - loot seems good but what is the xp like?<br />
velks lab - again haven't been in ages, was pretty easy kills last time I was there<br />
PoM - whats this like after the revamp?<br />
<br />
I tried searching but not much came up, thanks in advance for any responses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Droga is full of runners too.<br />
<br />
I'd recommend Veksar.<br />
<br />
PoM is fun and decent exp.<br />
<br />
Velks is where everyone goes to PL melees (and I see 65s solo there).  If you don't object to the quality of the company, I guess it works, assuming you can find something to kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you are worried about things taking awhile to die then Veksar isnt for you.  Mobs there seem to have an inordinate number of HP's.  They dont run, which is good.  If you are grouping your shaman with the warrior this wouldnt be a bad place as you can help with DoT's.<br />
<br />
Planes solo arent as good as they once were.  They arent bad, but mobs here also have lots of HP's for the exp they give.  <br />
<br />
When I'm Pling an alt, I always try and use the oldest expansions that I can.  Why?  Because mobs on older expansions dont have the HP's that newer expansions do.  Chardok has about the same exp mod that CoM had, and mobs that dont run.  One way, so make or buy some gate potions before you go.  Veksar has a better exp mod, but the kills will take longer.  Seb is ok cash/sellable loot (some camps) but lots of casters can make it sort of annoying.<br />
<br />
Or, just take him to PoI and have him solo there.  Ive done that too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rehunh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Could try Torgiran mines in LoY. The mobs by the bridge are all single pullable by your shaman and they have about 10k hp. They do run but with dog dog and my dots I have never had one make it far enough to have an add. I don't have all the defensive AA's and I can tank these mobs once i slow them very easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">PoV EW/WW. Make a group around your warrior with Shaman either inside or outside group. Good time to work those group aggro skills. PoV groups will do this as it seems (at least on Luclin) the folks you will most likely group with have very limited group skills. XP at 59 is excellent and good to 61.<br />
<br />
Flip side is when you get a solid PoV group it is heaven. Fast pulls, swift kills, lightning fast xp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>niwggib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Crypt of Naddox rocks for exp 50+</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">At 59 its a tough thing to do to PL a toon. from 45-55 I Pld my Sk by grouping with him and mass slaughtering basically whatever was in my way. I would suggest Crypt of Nadox or Torgarian Mines, both are nice zones for some decent loot and if your warrior is decently twinked (cultural or some ornate) he can tank in there with just a Q and you can handle 2+ mobs easily. The names are pretty rare to pop, but in the Mines, the Ft necklace still sells pretty well in bazaar, so you can line your pockets and Pl at the same time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Benadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">This is the same problem I have with my Warrior, runner control. Here are a couple things I have found that help alot with this.<br />
<br />
Scepter of the Forlorn (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=5417) <br />
<br />
Ball of Burlap Yarn   (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=6574) <br />
<br />
The Scepter of the Forlorn is a lore item, but it is not no drop so the war and the Shaman each have one. Once the Warrior burns his up just destroy it and have the shaman pass over number 2. That gives you 20 casts of clinging drarkness. The Ball of Burlap Yarn is no drop, but it is not lore. Each only has 4 charges of snare though. <br />
<br />
Usually what I do is kill the prince, run over kill the king, then go do the turn in in Stone burnt for the yarn. By the time I get back the prince and king have repopped. Getting both the Warrior and the Shaman loaded with 28 charges of snare takes 2 trips.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>rowf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yep no snare sucks, just pull **** in poi, drag to tank, let him hit it.<br />
<br />
I had my 46 sk in poi, he tanked fine with virt and mobs pre-slowed.<br />
<br />
I found I could sick doggie onto mob and still not out dmg tank at 49.<br />
<br />
Occasionally you will get a deat due to slow heal times, but thats why poi is great, just wait for a cleric to zone in, or pop out and offer cash for a rezz.<br />
<br />
Too easy.<br />
<br />
Sure there is better xp in pod, if you can get to it.<br />
<br />
POI is great, lots of mobs, can fight at the zone in, people will swap you buffs.<br />
<br />
Bit booring after a while but such is life.<br />
If you can get a decent dps class to group with twinkey, xp will fly.<br />
<br />
My favourite is a 65 mage, all three of you grouped will rip a new arsehole in any mobs you see, its fun doing an outer circuit.<br />
<br />
The xp will even be decent for you real toons due to the kill rate.<br />
<br />
Did that a few times.<br />
<br />
Mage pets + your pet with toys, + twinkey doing a little dmg (get a snare whip and a darkness sword for agro generation)<br />
<br />
Or if you have good agro weapons, just use them.<br />
<br />
Once you hit 62 you can do the beeez in bot that will get you very good xp for your twink. Mine hit bot at 56, and could just tank the beez in full cultural (ogre SK). You will need kei though, controlling two chars eats into the canni time a bit.<br />
<br />
I dont think the beeez run, but im not sure, I always used snare on them to keep agro.<br />
<br />
At lower levels, you will out dmg the twink sooo much its often better to load em up on dots and kill with the shaman, all the twink does is sto you getting hit.<br />
<br />
good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>rowf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Get mr mage to summon you a heap of arrows and pull with the twink, he will bring one or two at a time, and they will hate him for daring to hit them seing his level is sooo low 8)<br />
<br />
Root one on the way in, VP is god.<br />
<br />
Slow the other one.<br />
<br />
Life is good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>gnarishal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have been using a warrior to help make things easier for me in places like seb, best thing I have found to control the runners is Silken Whip of Ensnaring (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=341) Think I have only had it fail to proc a couple of times. RNG is so dang streaky :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Ill second (or third) PoI, just take your twink to an unoccupied room and pull to there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>rowf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yeh, i used to have that on my warr/cleric combo, unfortunately you cant guarentee it will go off once per fight.<br />
<br />
The whip and the kunzar katatich or whatever it is that procs darkness in combination will ensure the mob is snared.<br />
<br />
Once ensnare has gone off, you can swap in a better pri weapon.<br />
I used to use the kunzar in pri and the whip off hand.<br />
<br />
They are seriously underpowered weapons by todays standards, but so is death by train.<br />
<br />
I sooooo wish they would give mages the ability to summon a snare proc weapon for dogdog.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>mcast12</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Update my warrior is now 61. I've read almost every duo PL thread in here, but I hear conflicting reports on various zones. I'm still not sure where to go, I just want to PL the war as fast as I can, which of these would be the fastest?<br />
<br />
BoT stormriders at 62+<br />
POI - dont run<br />
ChardokB - don't run<br />
Greigs End - dont run<br />
Crypt of nadox<br />
Droga - good loot but runners a pain<br />
velks - runners? fast xp?<br />
veksar - don't run but lots of HPs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Velks has runners and is starting to go LB at 61.<br />
<br />
Why not just suck it up and group in valor until you can go to BoT?  Given that that's what everyone does, it's probably the &quot;best&quot; exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Nadox is a &quot;hotzone&quot; now (xp similar to Paludal).  Take him down to the undead.  Most mobs are 53-55.  XP will be very good, and still db to 65.  Nice thing about them is that they don't turn and leave at low health there, either, so you don't need to worry about snaring/rooting.<br />
<br />
I had my SK there until about 61 or so.  Then it was off to PoV to do the worms.  I don't know about the new melee changes, but I didn't like my warrior in PoP...slows resulted in aggro, and my warrior (61 at the time) had problem getting it back, simply with taunt.  I retired the epic'ed bastage and made an SK.  Given the new melee changes, maybe, I should go back and work on him, since Knights are about as gimped as shamans in GoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>rowf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">There are better xp zones, but they all take a while to get into position and set up. The time you spend running there is lost xp time.<br />
<br />
Also the time spent recovering after a death is greater.<br />
<br />
Bind at the bindey dude in pot, or at the entrance to the zone (dont know if you can do that).<br />
<br />
I used to bind in with the toon cause on the rare occasion he died I was usually out of food and chit, and he would usually get rezzed back in quick smart.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Nurga and Howling stones.</div></div><hr />

Perfect for your combo; after the revamp, the mobs have very low HPs, but hit fairly hard for their level.  Slow takes the fight out of them nicely, however.  PLus, the ZEM is really nice.  I can solo an AA in about 2 hours in HS (at 65), which is about the same rate I can get AAs in tactics/PoV, etc. solo'ing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I'd second the PoJ basement (called deathrow on my server).  In addition to decent experience you have decent cash loot, and a graveyard in case things go wrong.  Always easier to get a cleric to rez you in PoJ gy than have one run to a Kunark zone.</div></div><hr />
