<br />
How do you search for spells in using the bazaar tool ? I use class = shaman ; type = scroll.  But this still someone misses spells that are on sale.  Then I type in the words = 'Spell'  and select class = shaman.  And i still miss some spells that are one sale.  But if i go and select a specific trader, I see spells that were not on my previous two queries.  Anyone encounter this problem before or know a solution ??<br />
<br />
Secondly, my guild has just started to farm VT.  We are a dkp guild.  So if all the Shaman that have farmed VT already, can give me a list of items that would be worth it for the shaman to spend their dkp; that would be great.<br />
<br />
Thanks everyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've ran into a number of cases where a vendor's goods didn't return for one search, but did for another.  I've even had that happen to my own goods when in trader mode!  (so I know it's not just a case of the vendor turning off trader mode for a sec when I hit search)<br />
<br />
I seem to get much better results the smaller the search result, so try searching for a specific spell name.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>pacman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have.  I type in Blood for &quot;Blood of Saryn&quot; and get everything else but that spell.  Its really weird.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chiyu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i search for spells by entering &quot;spell:&quot; in the text string (without quotes, natch) and class &quot;Shaman&quot; - seems to work nicely</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Under class chose shaman.  Under item type chose scroll.  That will give you all shaman spells for sale</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grenoble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've also noticed that when I'm in trader mode, if I do a search by something I'm selling (say I have mm drums, and I search by 'bard') I don't show up.  But if I search by trader, under my name, there I am.<br />
<br />
Kicking out of trader mode then back in seems to make me reappear, but only temporarily.  Anyone else experience this?  I think I miss out on a lot not showing up that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Same for me; I have had items I have for sale not show up under a search. Chock it up to crappy coding?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">There are many many nice items for shamans in VT.  Some of the ones I really liked tho, were<br />
Ring of Immobilization (Free 2.0 second root)<br />
Crown of Ambivalence (15% extention on all spells that have a duration (only focus effect that affects Torpor's duration)).<br />
<br />
Aside from that there are the obvious choices . . .<br />
Mask of Judgement (18% mana savings on all spells).<br />
Numerous FT items.<br />
Mace of Dark Thought (400 mana drain proc)<br />
Swarm Orb (group shrink clicky, tho not as uber now with the group shrink spell)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tappion Zek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">When i search I do scroll and shaman, but then i make sure to set the minimum price to 101, and the maximum to like 19999999. I find that it is limited in how many things show up after a search. So by filtering prices i can get rid of all of the Tumultuous Strength and Canni 3 entries. Then I go and do a search with the price 0 to 100, to check and see if any major major deals exist.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Under class chose shaman.  Under item type chose scroll.  That will give you all shaman spells for sale<br />
<br />
Read -&gt; Comprehend -&gt; Post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Is there a maximum number of items that a search will return? It seems like this is so.<br />
<br />
I do the same search (shaman, scroll), but include a min and max value (e.g., min 1k, max 100k) when I'm looking for PoP spells. I don't know for sure if this gets me all of the spells in that range that are out there, but seems to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Is there a maximum number of items that a search will return? It seems like this is so.<br />
<br />
Right.  If you just do scroll / shaman, you'll get a small subset of all the shaman spells out there, cause you're getting all the Can 3 / Blast of Poison / yadayadayada scrolls.<br />
<br />
I do min 500 / max 500000 for no particular reason, it usually shows me the ones I'm interested in.<br />
<br />
Sometimes I go back and do a min 1 / max 500 to see if there are any bargains as well.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>pacman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">cool.. thanks for the great replies.  <br />
