<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dalinar Silvermyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just wanted to post and apologize for what took place at the Lodizal spawn yesterday evening.  Eudas and I had been there since very early morning (about 6am CST)  Sometime in the afternoon Nolani showed up with the same purpose as he and I.  I spoke with her and Wulfran and I agree'd it should be whomever gets first agro gets the spawn.  If I'm correct those are the pnp rules for outdoors zones (Talked with Zelfani about that).  A bit later a guide showed up, stayed for a few mins then left.  No clue if he actually spoke to anyone.  20 or so mins later you guys decided to stand down.  I was in an odd situation because I've known Eudas for quite some time and I'm friends with KoE as well.  I agree he can be a rough person sometimes but he's always been fair with me.<br />
<br />
About 2 hours later Lodizal did spawn (told Zelfi exact pop time for reference) and I finished a year long quest (had the other 3 maps since a week of SoV going live).  As a gesture of friendship I've offered the spells he dropped to KoE and will be getting them to Zelfani sometime today.  They were: Focus of Spirit, Gift of Brilliance and Call of the Predator.  I also have Healing Wave of Prexus (for Spectrez I think) which I'll pass to Zelfi too.  <br />
<br />
Oh... hehe Wulfran was there camping the Dire Wolf Stalker while this was all going on.  I was tracking (like I ALWAYS AM! :p) and caught him on track.  I did a /tell Wulfran Stalker up!  GET! and got &quot;Wulfran is not online at this time...&quot;.  I gave a tell to Nolani immediately and she got ahold of him.  While he was logging on I snare/kited the Stalker around till Wulf got on then pulled to him.  Grats Wulfran on Eyepatch of Plunder!  Glad you completed yours as well old friend!<br />
<br />
Anyway guys...  I really hated the situation and during the whole thing I was in contact with Wulfran, Nolani and Zelfani.  I sincerely hope there are no hard feelings regarding this messed up situation.  Take care everyone and if you ever need a 60th Ranger I'm there.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zelfani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Thank you for the spells and we are very glad (as you gathered from the tells) that you finally got the eyepatch.. we have also know and raided with Eudas before and have never had any conflicts.  <br />
<br />
Open zones will always be in conflict when these rare spawns are involved.  Hopefully one day VI will recognize what they have created and find other ways to remedy the situation.. until then only action is honor and friendship..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Actually, amazingly enough, the guide told me that the latest PNP rulings support the longest group at a camp for &quot;rare, epic and God-type mobs&quot;. A complete reversal from what Widjan has always told us.<br />
<br />
Anyways, no hard feelings from my end: I'm just glad you got your map piece :)<br />
<br />
GRATS DALINAR the One Eyed!!! :)</div></div><hr />
