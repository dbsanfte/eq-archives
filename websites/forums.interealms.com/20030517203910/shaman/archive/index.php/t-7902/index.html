<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Culle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've read over about 7-8 different epic guides and none of them addressed faction issues with running around in NFP.  Being that my shaman is an iksar, I'd imagine I'd get a bit of attention when I go to visit Jade Inn.<br />
<br />
Will stuff aggro from downstairs if I invis my way to Jades?  I've had another character get slammed by a character in jades before (hit for something rediculous) so i'm a bit nervous about this step.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any info.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Iren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Im also a iksar shaman and the way i did this part was in my youth i killed guards in WC so when i went to do this part i was ally to everything in the zone if your real worryed about it try killin them for a day and u will probly be non kos, you can can check your faction by conning that pally guy by lake in WC</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mikshal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Scout zone first with an alt.<br />
Then if u go with ur shaman on the underground entrance and u give the items to drunk man.<br />
He shall slowly move to Jade, i followed him for a bit but i had to run back for invis drop.<br />
U dont have to worry, just go on the 3rd floor of Jade and wait invised there. Spirit pop in the second room (if i remember right)<br />
sometimes i see a guard moving on 2nd floor, not sure if he move to 3rd<br />
Enjoy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hyacinth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I did the drunken Shaman part invised &amp; running around under the tunnels. Just pray to Cazic-Thule your invis doesn't drop at an inappropriate time. Refresh invis when you can. Make sure you work on your divination ahead of time.</div></div><hr />
