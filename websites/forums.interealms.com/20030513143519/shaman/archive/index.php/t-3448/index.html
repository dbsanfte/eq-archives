<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Innatook</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is the tear MQable? Last 4 fear raids I've went on, no golems up. I have the ring to turn into Neh, just waiting for the tear, so I can finish up in 1 night.<br />
If it is, any Shaman on Brell happen to have an extra?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Warscar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes it is. The shaman with the tear should already have his epic. Then you know for a fact that his true spirit faction is high enough for turn. He does turn in, kill Rak and you loot scale.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">MQed a tear myself for a guild shaman.  Definitely can be done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Innatook</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There was also a post on Alakazam's that said  the Iksar child is a static spawn. Is that old, or is that true?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Irksome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That is old info.<br />
<br />
The iksar broodling pops sometimes upon the death of one of the 'golems' of Fear.  You know, those nasty guys that do Death Touches.  /grin<br />
<br />
After you kill one of them, the broodling pops at the site of the kill.  He's like level 1, and even a shaman can melee him to death in 1-2 hits.  Many guilds/raids kill the golems for their goodies and other epic items, and have no shaman around to get the tear.  I have a tear in my bank, for instance, from a raid where we couldn't find anyone that needed it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Syrellian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">As stated, it CAN definitely be done.  My tear was MQ with my guild's main Shaman and everything worked out perfectly.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Venomblood Draconis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yes, tear can be MQ'd, and I have done it for others. Just be sure you tell the shaman you are MQ'ing it for that they need to ensure they are at max ally faction before turning in the scale. Turning in the tear does give a faction hit to True Spirit that the other shaman won't get.<br />
<br />
The other shaman may have to do one of the steps over again to make sure his faction is maxed out after getting the scale.</div></div><hr />
