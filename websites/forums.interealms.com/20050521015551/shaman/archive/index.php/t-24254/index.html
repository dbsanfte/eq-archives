<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>psosnake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">just curious...<br />
i was duoing wit a druid friend of mine the other day somewhere in GoD on an epedition or whatever it is...and he asked me a question <br />
&quot; Y do i have agro shouldnt you be out dotting me by far&quot;<br />
we were root rotting the mobs and i told him sure if i loaded up on my dots but i only have 3 that dont break root when cast (being odium, bane, and Ultor) <br />
he said his dont break root, most of them<br />
now understand i am a 65 shammy with no GoD spells or OoW xpan<br />
so what i want to know is do the GoD spells and the OoW spells do dmg when cast for the good chance to break root?<br />
this was a big thing since the mobs we were fighting mitigated slow (like always) and hit for 900+ all the time and we didnt have room to kite them <br />
<br />
Info needed plz.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No dots in GoD.<br />
<br />
The three dots in OOW are:<br />
Lvl 66 - Breath of Wunshi - 180 hp/tick. No initial damage<br />
Lvl 69 - Curse of Sisslak - 577 hp/tick. No initial damage<br />
Lvl 70 - Blood of Yoppa - 450 HP/tick. No initital damage<br />
<br />
None of them break root.<br />

yep :P  Only way to check who has aggro in that situation is to break the root!!!!<br />

tk you all for your replies..but not sure on the root thing..while we were there he was closer and we were both sitting and the mob would point or look towards my druid friend  and then look at me, so i asked him if he fully dotted i and he said no..you could tell it was when a dot made a tick cuse hp went down..maybe maybe not..im still a noobie too though =-) learn something every day =-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Really though, if you are root rotting stuff, and you have a druid (ie snare), there's no such thing as the term &quot;not enough room to kite them&quot;.<br />
Also, our Blood of Saryrn poison dot and Breath of Ultor disease dot have no initial damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Haxot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Agro behaves really funny when you have 2x people dotting.<br />
And our curse line is extremely low agro.<br />
Our disease line I've never noticed anythgin specail about agro.<br />
Our poison line is pure agro (smiles reminecscently,, pally bud spamming root broke message,, and the ineveitable &quot;LOADING... PLEASE WAIT&quot; message)<br />
<br />
I wouldn't expect a shaman to out agro a druid w/out the use of poison dots, even tho our dots are capable of kicking more damage then druid dots.<br />
<br />
Ask any of the regulars aroudn here,, dot agro is a weird and fascinating thing = )</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sshiverr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">This reminds me of a conversation I had with another guild shaman the other day.   He asked what DoT's I was casting (blood,bane,ultor) because he said that if 2 different shamans cast the same DoT on a mob we would both get the damage message from our DoT's but the mob would actually only be taking damage from 1 of us.   I thought they fixed it a couple years ago that DoT's stacked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Doesn't a rooted mob just look at the nearest pc? <br />
<br />
No, this is only the case if both pc are within melee range.  If a mob is rooted and all pc are out of melee range, the mob will &quot;face&quot; the one that has the highest aggro.  Proximity and sitting will affect the level of aggro, but after only a few ticks poison aggro will outweigh proximity and sitting by far.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They did change it. Go root rotting with a few shaman and see how long it takes to drop a mob compared to how long it takes you on your own. The dots stack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">my brother plays a druid, we have root rotted just about everything possably root rotable together.<br />
what i noticed about him and other druids:<br />
<br />
while we debuff first with malos/sinia/decay/slow (maybe not even bothering with slow,) they snare, (which is greater agro than all 4 of the shaman cast spells,) then possabley fire debuff, (which is HUGE agro,) and then start to dot right away, (sometimes their fire dots, then magic dots, then epic, depending on the mobs resists.)<br />
while bane/aneth/ultor/epic/blood make for huge agro, it takes a minute for that agro to kick in.  so druids may keep agro the first 1/3 of the fight without question.  if they get a snare resist or 2 they are building up monsterous agro at the start of the fight.<br />
our dots eventally outagro druids, but we are a little slower to start getting DPS on the mobs than druids are (and even then, we have to outagro their initial snare attempts.)<br />
<br />
that is just what i have noticed =p</div></div><hr />

Info needed plz.<br />
Quite simple actually. If your Druid friend was 1) snaring after you slowed or 2) using his Fire DoTs.<br />
Both are quite high aggro debuffs, snare for obvious reasons, and the Fire DoTs lower Ac by a not too inconsiderable margin.<br />
Willing to bet its the #2 option, used to duo a LOT with a druid and she usually ganked aggro if she wasnt careful with her snare timing or fire dots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Snare is tremendous agro.  When I do Pofire kite groups, I often have a druid friend to the kiting because they can snare a few times and grab agro fast.  Snare is also very low mana cost.<br />
<br />
A couple of crit tics might pull the mob off, but they can get agro right back with a snare or two.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>windfinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">well I must say we had a kite group and by and far (atlest when kiteing) I had no problem takeing arrgo via dots. sure malos is low arrgo (or just sini neck tell it sticks) but that gives you tim to land all debuffes while the druid just runs like a school gril. then dropped bane, athem, blood, bane of nife, and breath if it was a long kite. after that almost no mater what the druid did it would not get off me.<br />
<br />
But as for your situation for non root breakers in the dot department you should have blood, (insert highest curse dot or 2 highest), and breath. then almost for sure that its the blood doing it but you will have no problem with aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I agree with the above posters about aggro building.  Typically when duo'ing with druids, they'll have aggro immediately, but after all my dots land, it comes back to me.  Snare is huge though.  Couple recasts of it, and its back on the druid.</div></div><hr />
