<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aramous Chlovare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello my fellow brethren. I have started my epic and seemd to have failed when I had to give the books to the Spirit underwater in CoM. After getting nothing, I became extremely pissed and just threw away all the info regarding the Epic and swore I will not do this stupid SH(@#T.<br />
<br />
 Well I guess I am a softy becasue I am thinking of starting it again. I have read some info on where I can do some steps repeatedly and bring my faction up, thinking that was the problem from the getgo. What I need is a link to the steps for my Epic again. A site that is well explained and updated would be great. Can anyone show me the path I am looking for? :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Charuliz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This is only to increase your spirit faction. You get no reward.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aramous Chlovare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">From my information I was supposed to receive something from the spirit underwater. In either case I still need info on rest of Epic :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Charuliz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">http://www.eqshaman.com/<br />
<br />
look under quests ... at next you need the High<br />
Scale Icon found in CoM/temple.<br />
<br />
most of the epic quests are only to increase the truespirit faction ... when i right remember was the shaman epic a long time ago bugged and you did need only the tears from PoF to make the epic but they fixed it. MQ the tears works now only with an other shaman no other classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sikky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you turned in the completed book from COM to the spirit in the lake... you turned it in to the wrong one :(<br />
<br />
The spirit that gets the books is in a little ruin of a tower in EJ .<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Seems to be a little confusion here. There are two parts of the quest that involve gathering &quot;books&quot; from CoM. The first part is where you gather 6 items and combine them in a booklet container. This is given to the spirit in the tower.<br />
<br />
Next you have to kill Lord Ghiosk and loot from him 3 &quot;books&quot;. These are given to the underwater spirit, who then tells you to find the High Scale Icon and give it to Kirn.<br />
<br />
Neither of these book stages gets you any items from the spirits, they just give you instructions as to what to do next.<br />
<br />
I'd suggest getting the books from Ghiosk and handing them in again, just to make sure you are at the stage of the quest you think you are. It would be a shame to get to Kirn in the Hole (not easy to get to) and have him eat your icon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aramous Chlovare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ok what I did was I skipped the 6 notes part and got the three books and handed them to him. He did not tell me to get scale. I will try handing in the books again and see what happens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Um, why don't you try handing in the 6 pages like you're supposed to instead of skipping to the 3 books?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Do the 6 notes part, Aramous.  Each step of the epic does a faction check, and if you aren't high enough faction, it doesn't work.  Doing the notes are very easy.  It takes a couple hours at most, and if it keeps you from not getting your epic due to faction problems on the last turn in . . .<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aramous Chlovare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Was told I was able to skip the notes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yeah, and it worked out really well for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You can probably skip the notes... if you did the woe/envy/shield part like 15 times. Implications of an exploit aside, just pure effort wise it's far easier just to get the pages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Aramous Chlovare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well my objective was to get helpful hints without the consctructive criticsm, so I think I will say thank you all for the help and end my comments here. If need be I will edit my post so it continues no longer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Korman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hmm.......let me see if I understand you.<br />
<br />
1. You posted that you would like some help with a problem (shaman epic quest).<br />
2. You were told the reason your problem occurred (skipping parts of the quest).<br />
3. You were told the easiset, most efficient and least painful way to fix your problem (do the parts of the quest that you skipped), as well as given a work-around (re-do earlier parts of the quest multiple times, much more time consuming).<br />
4. You get miffed at the Shaman's Crucible community for answering your question.<br />
<br />
This reminds me of a running joke in the IT field.  I'm sure there are many here that have heard it.  The jist of it is this:  You must be in management, because you got yourself in this mess, not us.  You have no idea how to get out of the mess.  You asked us for help.  You didn't like what you were told, so now it's somehow our fault?!?!  You're mad at us!?!?<br />
<br />
Your previous posts show that you have 162 posts.  Surely you have been reading these forums for a while now.  You should have seen the flames of others that posted about skipping parts of the epic quest.  My post count is in the low 20s (been lurking for about 9 months now), but I have read enough posts to know what to expect when I post on a topic that has garnered flames in the past.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Aramous Chlovare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">To answer your question, I am VERY thankful for those that gave relevant answers to my post. I do not like pinpointing out names because that just causes a FLAME war and that is not what this post is suppose to be.  If you cannot see why I made that last post, then I do not know what to tell you. Thank you anyway in informing me on how to read a forum :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">You were just misinformed.  You can skip basically any portion of the epic quest that you want, but you'll need to compensate for it by redoing other parts (most commonly, everything before the dire wolf).  But if you simply skipped a portion of the quest as if it were never there and continued on in the true progression, it definitely will not work because you won't have the sufficient faction.</div></div><hr />
