<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Namurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi, have a couple of questions about this, if anyone has the AA.  With the 2nd rank in the skill, do the timers on the pet's buffs run while it's suspended?  With the 2nd rank in the skill is there any reason to get the /pet hold AA under the Class AA tab?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I cannot answer the buff timer question, but I can answer the second.  You can suspend minion under the same circumstances that you can summon companion.  So, if it has agro and is getting the snot beat out of it (like, it ran 50 feet away to a caster that tried to malo you or something), it'll not be able to be suspended.<br />
<br />
Or so I'm told.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Perelandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Timers on buffs do not count while the pet is suspended. Shrink and Run Speed Changes won't still effect the pet after a suspend (it will still list SoW, but the pet will run slow).<br />
<br />
Pet Discipline is still very beneficial. As a Mage it is considered the most important AA, but as a shaman I'm not sure where it would fall. If you plan on using your pet while raiding however, you should most definitely have this.<br />
<br />
While you can use Suspend Minion as a poor man's discipline, you will end up having to kill the pet a lot as a pet on any NPC's aggro list cannot be suspended. I wouldn't even think of using a pet with only suspend minion in ToV - but use it all the time with Pet Discipline.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You can't suspend the pet if it's on a MOB's hate list, even if you tell the pet to back off, so it really can't be used in the same way as /pet hold. Plus it takes several seconds to work whereas /pet hold is instant. Since I wouldn't want to deal with a pet at a raid, the main use I find for Pet Discipline is when my group is pulling casters.<br />
<br />
Suspend Minion 2 is a pretty decent ability. Zone in and instead of sitting around waiting for the rest of the group to assemble, you summon your pet, give him weapons and buffs, and then suspend him. Now you can invis to your camp and, once there, bring out the pet at no mana cost. Also very nice if you need to invis to go pick up new group members.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Suspend minion is nearly vital for pet classes in LDoN when you are pushing the time limits.   You can pocket the pet, invis past a couple of rooms and continue along with finding your target or clearing around a chest/named.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It's also very nice for farming ... say... somewhere like droga or nurga - so you can skip the trash and clear the named/PH's only.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I was thinking of getting Suspend Minion soon for being able to farm Droga.<br />
Now, with LDoN, I'm for sure going to get it next.<br />
The amount you invis around in certain dungeon types is huge, and I don't like resummoning my pet all the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Glad I saw this post, I really like the idea of this AA now. I pretty much have been living in Droga and Inner Acrylia since I dinged 65. This will make farming named a lot more convenient :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The only thing I didn't expect is the long-ish time it takes to pull pooch back out of your pocket.  Took me a couple of tries to realize that even rotten little nurga greenies need to be slowed before you can reach for dogdog.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>blakhomer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I was thinking of getting Suspend Minion soon for being able to farm Droga.<br />
<br />
I dont know about your server but Eci players, myself included, have pretty much ruined the Droga market.<br />
<br />
Example;<br />
Legendary Daggers of Might for 2k...come and get em</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I love suspended minion, its utility instead of enhancement which other aa does, aids me.  While pet is suspended with suspended minion 2 buffs are held yeah which is cool.</div></div><hr />
