<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Apparently VI seems intent on 'balancing' until all classes are the same, or close enough. The whole thing reminds me of some badly broken DnD game where the GM keep handing out freebie magic items  to the whining players. <br />
Every week now encounters are being made just that little bit easier - as if most of them weren't easy enough.<br />
<br />
I think a lot of this can be traced back to &quot;The Vision&quot;. Brad and friends came up with a big map of what the classes would do, and how they related, and how the game would be played. Then the game got released, and because no-one in the playerbase was made aware of this plan on how they should play, what grew up was a very different mode of play than VI expected (e.g. Feign Death pulling). Brad reacted badly with this, and tried to tune the game so that people would play his way. Generally speaking, it didn't work, because we still didn't know what &quot;his way&quot; was, and so people just moaned that all their l33t skills were being nerfed.<br />
<br />
Fast forwards a couple of years, and suddenly all the keepers of &quot;The Vision&quot; have left VI. The new guys, when they take a look at the desireability of the classes, don't start from Brad's notes - they start from their experiences as players, and from what they read on class boards. So now the tweaks to classes, rather than being designed to move towards a single person's vision of a class, and being moved towards a consensus opinion.<br />
<br />
This consensus opinion is, necessarily, less focused than a single vision. So the application of this vision produces more blurred class definitions.<br />
<br />
The other thing contributing to the blurring of classes is the desire of the playerbase. Everyone now appears to want to play a class who can solo, and who is wanted both in groups and on raids. <br />
Unfortunately, differing degress of competence in this three areas was obviously one of the design tools used when creating the classes, and so giving everyone equivalent competence in all three areas will further blur boundaries.<br />
<br />
Take Clerics for example. There are four major healing classes - Clerics, Paladins, Druids, Shamen. The Cleric lacks the melee ability of the Paladin, the offensive magic of the Druid, or the wide range of buffs and debuffs of the Shamen. What Clerics do have is better healing than any of them. This makes Clerics the healer of choice when serious healing is needed - in raids and tough groups. Less challenging groups can use a lesser healer. Solo, Clerics are gimped.<br />
<br />
The thing is - how do you improve Clerics without making them more like a Paladin, a Druid or a Shaman? Any broadening of their <br />
abilities both makes them look more like the other classes, and <br />
weakens the need for those other classes (one suggestion for solo Cleric power - self only heals with a 0.5 sec cast time). <br />
<br />
Making it more desirable to group would be a very good thing at this point. There's far too many situations where XP is better solo.<br />
<br />
Here's some more of my comedy suggestion for an emergency fix: same level mobs and above yield full xp, one level below and it's half xp, another  level and it's an eighth, another level down and it's nothing. <br />
They should just make every single non-raid-encounter mob in the game 50% more powerful to reduce the soloing. <br />
And they should nerf the exp in Fungus Damn Grove / Maidens fecking Eye as well as the rest of the gimp-levelling-circuit (LOIO-&gt;OT-&gt;DL-&gt;FG/ME) to reduce the population pressure at level 60.<br />
<br />
Every time I see some idiot bragging about how ubah they are because they levelled to 60 in 30 days I want to laugh. And slap them. Laugh while I slap them.<br />
The one thing I thank the stars for is that it took me 2 years to get to level 60 cos I had a pissload of fun doing it and got to see a mass of content most of these losers don't even know exists.</div></div><hr />

I am sooo bored at work today ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't agree with everything Spiritblood said, but it was a well written post with some well made points, and no gratuitous ranting and cursing. Why mock him for that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Nice original post. Would love to see Zorlac's take, (I think he would agree with certain parts).<br />
<br />
I am finding the game more and more fun these days. PL'ing alts, getting the Epic for my level 1 alt Shaman, (Troll, Inny of course), doing crazy whack stuff that passes the time.<br />
<br />
Yeah sure the game has some problems, not the least of which is some overlapping of abilities, and as Spirit said - each class wants to solo, group, and raid at equal efficacy, but I don't see them (VI &quot;brain trust&quot;) screwing up a product with 40% gross margin and 5.2 million a month in income.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Toshizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I read it, at least I think I did, geez I need another coffee. I agree with some stuff you say and with others indifferent. Right now I feel happy with EverQuest leave it as it is no big changes and soon people will stop whinning about the changes and forget and get on with their life. Another with the burning to level 60 in a month let them if they want to let them go, but when it comes to exp grinding they will find EverQuest less and less interesting and eventually lose interest and leave. Their choice really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I got to the word &quot;shamen&quot; and stopped reading.  Petty, but that's what happened.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure I can summarize without reading the rest of it though.  &quot;Mudflation sucks.&quot;  How close am I?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I like to solo. It would NOT be good to make ANY mob 50% more powerful than they already are. Why would they do that anyway? I'm sorry but not everyone likes to group. I hate grouping, thats why I solo :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Agreed.<br />
<br />
I've solo'ed from lvl 1 to 49.<br />

Suits my playstyle much better as I take frequent smoke breaks ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Slimetooth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Excellent post,<br />
<br />
I agree with a lot of what was said.  I enjoyed your thoughts on the purpose and eventual demise of the &quot;Vision&quot;.  I think there is probably a great deal of truth there.<br />
<br />
And yes, mudflation suxxor, but only for the people that experience it.  I wonder if people who started playing a year ago have any idea what the game used to be like?<br />

<br />
Even if its just a summary of common knowledge, but thats what the topic said.<br />
<br />
Two points<br />
<br />
Shaman, not shamen :D <br />
<br />
Can we please stop to use this silly, dumb generalized argument about LOIO-OT-DL-route? There are already 50+ pointless posts on TNZ and similar boards for this.<br />
<br />
Yes, i used this route (mainly) to level quick and easy with my first character only casual playing with less players on, when playing (like many others, i guess).<br />
Am i playing worse then a player with 3 years experience, who knows all dungeons in and out? Probably yes, but i can do my job in every xp-group.<br />
<br />
Sorry for ranting, just a little tired.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Niall Graycloak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I've always felt that the &quot;vision&quot; tm - died with Kunark. I don't think they originally expected EQ to last anything like this long or to have as many die hard players as it does. Remember that the devs basically came from MuDs. Your average MUD is launched, reaches maturity and dies/is reset within a 6month period. <br />
<br />
(Un)Fortunately, EQ took off - and since then it has become such a cash cow for VI/Sony that there is no way it will be allowed to die. The dev team is stumbling (punch drunk and half blind admittedly) towards changing the game into something sustainable longer term. I'd expect PoP to be a real glimpse of what VI considers the &quot;new&quot; future of EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">MMORPG competition has a little to do with it. Players have more options and VI has to keep its player base to make “Monies”. Its getting annoying as an old timer to see these changes and I’ve been scorned by all the new up and coming players that I have a Granpa attitude “Walking up a Hill Both Ways in my day, we had to earn everything”.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">They should just make every single non-raid-encounter mob in the game 50% more powerful to reduce the soloing. <br />

While I might agree with some of your other points, it sure looks suspicous to me that you have 2 (!) level 60 characters with god knows how many AA points and 1 level 52 character too. And now you want to nerf FG/ME/numerous other places. So you never used those places to get exp or what?<br />
<br />
EQ might be broken but I dont think this is a good fix.</div></div><hr />
