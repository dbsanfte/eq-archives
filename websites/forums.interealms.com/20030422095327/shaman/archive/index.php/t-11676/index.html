     OK, I realise that this topic has been hit on before, but I'm a liitle lost as to how to search with the new form.  I'm a 44 shammy with about 2k in the bank.  My plan is to farm rathe for about 2 weeks, to get the cash up for a cheap horse.  Is this a good plan, or should I go for the JBB first?  I have seen JBB's on sale at the bazaar for about<br />
15k - 20k.  If I were to go for the JBB first, it would take about double the time, and just farming for a month seems very borring.  Is the JBB much more valuable than the horse, or is it visa-versa.  Again, I realise that this topic is getting redundant, so I hope no one gets annoyed by the question.  BTW, I run with the new graphics so that isnt a problem.<br />
On a side note, I know that the horse head gets in the way, and the big lizzard (I forget the name) doesn't have this problem.  Does the big lizzard give the same advantage as the horse, and what are the drawbacks of them.  I know about the slow start-up speeds and the not being able to &quot;jump-out&quot; of a spell mid-cast.<br />

Thanks for taking the time to read this.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cesta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Lizard gives you sitting mana regen while you are canni-ing.  Combine this with Stoicism and mana regen is extremely fast.<br />
<br />
JBB gives you a lot of free mana (and damage) too and is extremely strong also, but the Lizard is amazing.<br />
<br />
I got the black one and I *am* seeing a big reduction in aggro radius while hunting in Burning Woods.  I used to get jumped by a wandering piece of trash at least once and hour and now I have things walk right over me without aggroing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Get the horse.<br />
<br />
It will increase your ability to hunt in outdoor zones by a lot.  Permanent medding is good.  With the extra mana regen you will more easily be able to farm the plat for a JBB (assuming you arent sick of farming plat by then).<br />
<br />
While the horse and drogmoor give the same mana regen effects... I would say buy a horse over the drog.  I sold my horse and got a drog, and I like the look, but I prefer the smooth movement of the horse.  Drogs just bounce a lot.  A shrink will take the horse head out of your way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hamman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would strongly suggest going with the horse first.  With stoicism, there is hardly any downtime, you can just chain canni up while healing.  What this means is that you can start using your own nukes until you get the jbb.  Even though you use mana, it is replaced with ease.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The horse and the JBB are both great, but if I had to pick which first I would say JBB if you can swing it plat-wise at lvl 45.<br />
<br />
At 45 when it starts to proc, a JBB is just godly.  I got mine at lvl 49, and didnt start regularly using dots again for damage until the high 50's, when the mobs started to require more damage.  But I still use the JBB solo and in groups at 61.  It works indoors and out and at 45 you wont need the mana regen boost of the horse as much when all of your damage is mana free.  Having to use dots for damage eats a lot of mana, more than you will gain back by horse medding during combat.  Plus you give up melee damage to horse med during combat.<br />
<br />
That said, you definately want a horse too, because nothing beats the JBB+horse combo.  And if you get too bored farming when you only have enough for a horse, you wont be sorry about that purchase either.  Horses rock for shammies for the rest of your career.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ladani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I purchased a &quot;small&quot; red leezard this morning, and tried him out in the LoY zones....standing mana regen R O C K S.  It was almost as good as having KEI....which I got later after a 20 mob train...and brought leezard back up....it was pretty sweat!<br />
<br />
I'd love to get a JBB..but I have two cool wrist items right now: Coldain Military Wristguard and Braclet of the Spiritcharmer...very cool!<br />
<br />
Took us two attempts to get the CMW....very easy once you get the pathing pattern down of Korf...;-P Oh and you have a NON kos warrior to do the turns ins!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>jathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">horse will be the best 9 k you ever spend , trust me. add the jbb and you won't believe how far exp flys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zamnon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Get the JBB, horse later.  You'll be a soloin machine with JBB.  Horse/Lizzy very nice as well, but at your lvl, won't make near the impact as a jbb.    <br />
