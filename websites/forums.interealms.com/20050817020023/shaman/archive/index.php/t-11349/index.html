<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Eluj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just started playing again after a long break and wanted to continue getting my totemic armor. I have the boots and the gauntlets I think, but would like the rest of the set. So I was wondering, should I go through the quests myself or is it cheaper to just buy it now? And to go along with it, roughly how much does the armor go for now? <br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Its cheaper to buy them.  Minor pieces sell for ~100p and the BP sells for 400 or so. Saves alot fo time and agrivation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Pretty much all you need to know about totemic armor? It won't even sell for the amount it costs in dufrenite to make it.<br />
<br />
Do the quests if you enjoy doing the quests, but don't do it because you want the armor--there is cheaper better stuff on sale in Bazaar.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Larsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Unless your like to role-play.  Get jaundiced for cheap in baz, and fill in other slots with Ry'Gorr etc.<br />
<br />
The Baz really changed the game<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I tried selling my remaining totemic boots, legs, gaunts, bracer for 50pp each a few months back and never could so I just gave them to pet one time lol.<br />
<br />
I don't understand why they can't just increase the stats on the old quest armor to make it more attractive to newbs of today. There's no good reason to do the quests anymore with all the nice and cheap dropable armor in the bazaar. I have some great memories of doing my totemic quests and it forced me to travel the world extensively.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I agree.  It would be nice to see some of the older equipment get upgrades, especially quest pieces.  All they would have to do would be introduce some new quest to do to update the existing equipment.  This would increase the value of that equipment and add additional fun to the game for those who like to do quests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The totemic quests were the best quests I ever did.   And the most frustrating.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I enjoyed the totemic quests, too (mostly).<br />
<br />
So if you want to do them, here's a suggestion -<br />
<br />
   Go camp the items.  When you have the nodrop items you need to make a piece of armor, go to the bazaar and buy that item and destroy your nodrops!  Same reward but cheaper than buying dufrenite!<br />
<br />
   Ok, yes, that's really dumb.  The totemic quests were fun at the time but that time has passed.  Get Ry'Gorr or Jaundiced Bone cheap and move on to a different quest that is still relevent.</div></div><hr />
