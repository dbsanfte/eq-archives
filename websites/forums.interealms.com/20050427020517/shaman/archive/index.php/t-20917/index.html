<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Whatever good gameplay this game might have is drowned by the prehistoric UI. The UI would be considered a bad one when EQ first came out in 99' not to mention what it is today.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Another thing is also the obvious retarded pvp balance.<br />
<br />
General rule, runspeed is king in any PvP especially when range attacks are at least somewhat useful.<br />
Different runspeed per race and profession are pretty flawed here.<br />
The mages are slowest this is somewhat good since they have powerful range attacks.<br />
The big brainfart is the archers, they have the longest range and the fastest runspeed (maybe some of the assassin melees can beat it) and bows are very powerful so an archer kills anyother class 100% of the time kiteing them around.<br />
If that gets balanced the pvp sieges are pretty fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lyluvia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, I would advise you to not judge the game so early. The NA version is one expansion behind the Korean one and there are many changes that are in that tried to balance the archers' speed and how tanks (mainly shield users) perform against them. There are more changes planned for them and its still pretty early to judge how the game will end up really. But for now, just try to enjoy the game as it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well i played a lil and i have to say, the PvP is not my style. To me PvP needs to be truly perfected in general, not 1 game can do it right and balance it the way i like it atleast. I mean i dont wanna be force to PvP but i wouldnt mind to do it when imin the mood. However if iw anna do some menaingless task like traeskill i dont wanna  have my head chopped off while im threading a needle.<br />
<br />
My 2 cents anyway.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>NinthSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">wow a lineage2 forum! i'm playing my overpowering archer now though =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Archers and/or elf archers are gonna get nerfed on the chronicle 1 update.  Not exactly sure if they are nerfing all archers or just the elf ones.<br />
<br />
Edit:  from the Korean server chronicle 1 patch<br />
<br />
Movement Speed<br />
<br />
Because there are problems in the balance of naturally fast moving characters and slow moving characters, the following skills have been changed to add a fixed amount of speed to the movement of oneself, regardless of natural speed: wind walk, sprint, fast servitor, quick step, song of wind. The added speed is like when using potions to increase speed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>NinthSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">They are getting nerfed somewhat.... but from what i hear they still will be overpowering in PvP... just not as much in PvE.</div></div><hr />
