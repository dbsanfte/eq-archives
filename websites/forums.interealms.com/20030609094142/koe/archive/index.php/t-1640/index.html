<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Arborealus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As you all know I am through the 8th Coldain Ring now, so I would like to start gathering materials for the Tainted Avalanche Ale which is required for the 9th:<br />
<br />
Iceball<br />
Ice Wyvern Stinger<br />
Arctic Mussels<br />
Seahorse Scales<br />
Runed Seashell<br />
Vial of Mind Melt<br />
<br />
Iceball &amp; Mussels are no problem<br />
<br />
Runed Seashell is a farily rare drop in SG but is tradeable<br />
<br />
Sea Horse Scales I know these drop in SG I think in Kedge as well<br />
<br />
Ice Wyvern Stinger is a no drop off of Wyverns in CS if you get one of these please /tell or /guild so one of the guild brewers can get their hands on it...(the final brew goes trivial about 248 and is no drop)<br />
<br />
Vial of Mind Melt Not sure if any of our Rogues are maxxed in Make Poison if you any are please /tell me and I will get you the ingredients for this...This poison trivs around the 250 mark if it does trivial...<br />
<br />
I appreciate in advance any and all assistance in this matter</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nolani Silvermoonbow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well I got Iceball, Seahorse scales (lots), and mussles.  Brewing skill of 199 is good enough to do brewing.  Apparently no one in guild has poison skill high enough to attemp the poison.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Canoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">hey bro my brewing is 199 currently, and i DO have a ice wyver stinger in the bank (which is lore so until i brew another one of these i can't get another).<br />
<br />
Secondly on the runed seashell, on the tuesday night raid we must have had 15 or 20 drop.  It isn't that rare, you just need about 2 groups (and peeps who know what they are doing), to effectively clear the sirens deep in.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps, and i'll be happy to brew this for you anytime bro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Arborealus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, I need the poison and I am ready for Canoe to try...If anyone knows a rogue with high make poison skill please let me know...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Spectrez Scythebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Aye, let me know as well ;) I asked a couple FoH/CT/PD/CD rogues if they could make me some poison if i gave them the ingrediants.. of course they said no..heh..go figure..<br />
<br />
Dang poison... oh well, guess both of us are stuck at this part till we can find a rogue that can make us some,arb :(<br />
