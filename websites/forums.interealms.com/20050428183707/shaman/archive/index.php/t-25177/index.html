<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>JESTER</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all, I am looking for a decent place to solo presently 55 but will take a look at anything for 55-58 lv.  I have read that places like chardok or nadok may be the place to go but I would like to get a little input first.<br />
<br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zaug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hey there<br />
<br />
IMO Nadox sucked, but maybe it was where i tried, i zoned in behind the temple in Gunthak, and fought there at 55.  The XP was brutal for the effort put in.  The funny part is that i zoned back into Gunthak and pulled the mobs there non-stop and got more XP in 30 mins than I had in 2 hours in Nadox.<br />
<br />
I know it is just a ZEM issue, but that was only like a month ago, so the ZEM is most likely the same.<br />
<br />
I just dinged 59 last night soloing the OC in Dulak. At 57 or 58, i would recommend either Dandy or OC...although the Oceancrasher is much more work.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tronc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'll agree with Zaug, Nadox at 55 is tough work - lotta hp on the mobs and iffen you run into the caster types it can get quite nasty... with 2 people or 3 it would be worth it but not solo.  However - there is the benefit of getting some spell quest items in there.  Blood of Nadox which is very much worth the effort - and if I recall very good exp on the final turn in.<br />
<br />
Torgirin mines would be fine - tons of blue mobs right from the entrance and they just get progressively tougher the deeper you go.  The wandering Trolls are a notch up in difficulty as compared to the static mobs that they patroll - no casters really except for the occasional named.<br />
<br />
Nurga is a nice little place - but plenty of casters in there and pulls aren't always solo like they usually are in LOY zones.  Can be tricky but very rewarding...NOTE: bring weapons for pets as nothing in here drops even a rusty dagger.<br />
<br />
The Enraged Soulstealer camp is a very good spot at lvl 55.  Many things are light blue up until his PH but his PH and anything past there is blue.  Casters aren't that nasty either except for the SS himself.<br />
<br />
You could solo in PoJustice no problems.  Pulling and agro seemed pretty good when I was in there - had no trouble getting singles (trap rooms excluded).  Gotta be able to tank em though so would recommend a virtue beforehand.<br />
<br />
PoInnovation is soloable but a step up from Justice and I usually pulled with Malo in there instead of just slow...Very difficult to take 2 mobs on respawn pulls though.<br />
<br />
You could do bugs in SolB...even pull the odd imp but be forewarned - they are old world agro ranges and LoY type zones have spoiled one into a false sense of security at times.  Very good exp there though.<br />
<br />
Skyfire sucks in every aspect...I wouldn't recommend this zone to anyone and yet I enjoy it there...maybe because it almost always empty.  ALthough I think that's not much of a factor anymore in any zone in EQ nowadays.<br />
<br />
<br />
Good luck. If I think of more I'll add to the list...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Greflin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Howling stones, get a key very easy quest. this zone is great. 55-58 solo the enterence by this guide here : <br />

after 58 you can single pull the N wing. either get a key from a devouerthingie and then head in or gather some friends and get a master key. Pretty easy witha  full group hardest part is e wing, have to go into Drus room to get the container. but N wing will carry you to 59 or 60. is also very good AA exp as well. And pretty good money, lots of 55 and under spells.<br />
<br />
If ya on xegony look me up for any questions or help :)<br />

After though! Only kill the golems in w, s, and n wings. is easier and can generaly kill 2 zone in mobs. then 6 golems. And the roamer mentioned in that link above will not bother you if you don't bother the e wing golems. then have time to med up and get ready for repop.<br />
<br />
ALSO! for those who wonder about the master key.<br />
<br />
From the North Wing, Dismembered Finger (pos330, pos200)<br />
From the West Wing, Dismembered Thumb (neg142, pos623)<br />
From the South Wing, Mutilated Forearm (neg570, pos150)<br />
From the East Wing, Blood Encrusted Glove; 4-slot container (pos310, neg570)<br />
<br />
Combine the finger, thumb, and forearm in the glove and receive Hand of Glory. Can be added to keyring. The items are ground spawns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>JESTER</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thank you all for the great help, I will try a couple of the zone's and see what work's best for me but I will try them all, again thank you all for the input</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have recently come back to EQ after a 30 month DAoC layoff.  I started over as I was a dumbie and sold my original shaman.  After 4 months back, I have discovered it is an easier game now, but advice is harder to come by(this board was used A LOT more back then).<br />
<br />
So my first nOOb question is...how do i get to PoJustice and do I need a key.  Second question is do the pieces for the PoP armor drop there?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tronc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Zone into the Plane Of Tranquility and then look on the map.  You will see a windmill...run down there and then enter.  Once inside, go find the little Gnome standing there.  Then turn and look at the center column of the windmill and look up.  You will see one working windmill thingy (left side) and a broken one on the right.  Click on the broken one and voila! You are now in PoI...and no you don't need a flag.  No clue about PoP armour - someone else will have to answer that for you.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bah...just re-read your request...but I refuse to erase the above as you may need it at a later time.<br />
<br />
Plane of justice is a little more tricky to find as it's not marked on the map.  The entrance looks like a set of 'justice scales' and you simply click on them...it is difficult to describe how to get to them.<br />
<br />
Once you enter PoT...head north to the hill.  They are on the side of the hill ('bout 3/4 to the top) as you run westward.  If you get to a tunnel entrance (entrance to tougher planes PoV and such) then you've gone too far.  Sorry I can't describe it better than that and at work I don't have any /loc with me<br />
<br />
<br />
Good luck<br />

edit: you don't need a key for either plane zone</div></div><hr />
