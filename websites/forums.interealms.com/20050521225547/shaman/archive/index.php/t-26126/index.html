I usually 2box my 62 sk (7khp 1500ac - 30aa) and 67.8 sham (5.5khp 1200 ac - 155aa) and group with my sister (66 mage - 80aa) and we are looking for some higher end content to kill. I am doing the name camps in NC but the spawn rate is not to good. I was think about maybe take my group to WoS and do a zone-in wall group. Do you guys think I will be able to tank them successfully with out getting killed on every other pull? I can maybe get a 62 druid to help but my play time is very odd so I am not available during prime times :(<br />
<br />
<br />
Any other zone suggestions would be cool also.. I also have all expansions!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's not worth moving to WoS since the named aren't any more common, and would threaten killing you guys any time you tried them.  Keep on those NC mobs until you have your quest faction knocked out and some more levels.  What you're capable of now is really really different from what you'll be able to do when that SK is 70 with full defensive aa.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you want some variety, try out Ruined City of Dranik.  Maybe that's more your speed if NC isn't challenging you anymore.</div></div><hr />

I was in WoS the other night with a 64 Mage, 67 Ranger, 62 Sk, 65 Cleric and about the same level Enchie. We happened to be doing pulls at the Arch. A little fat girplan caused tremendous grief for our group. The next pull happened to be a Noc and we got wiped. Healers went down first, and that is it. A 62 Sk tanking is tough. Even slowed, those mobs hit hard. Our tank couldn't get the mobs off the cleric when she did a heal and she dropped fast.  :( Was not the tanks fault;  group &quot;manager&quot; settled for a 62 because no other tank was available and then asked him to pull and tank. Did not work. Another group I was in had a 65 &amp; 70 warrior. We were at south wall and never had any trouble even when warrior began chain pulling.  :) <br />
<br />
At a south wall camp things may be abit better. I would use caution tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Herger, that SK you were with sucked, no two ways about it.  Shadowknights do not need to be high level to take agro from a healer.</div></div><hr />
