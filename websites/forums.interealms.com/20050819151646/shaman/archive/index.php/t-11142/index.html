<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shizbiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is it just me?  My fizzle rate seems why higher then normal lately (last week or so).  I just got scm3 last week so if anything fizzle rate should down.  A cleric in my was complaining about fizzles the other day aswell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i dunno , it does seem like its alot more lately , but it could jus tbe luck of the draw.

My can4 macro seems like quite often im getting a fizzle in there too. I dont know why this change would ahve taken place so its probly persception. Worth watching though i think.<br />
<br />
Im more concerned though with my crashing. Since last patch my GF and ME crash tot he point where im afraid to solo. Ill leave comp on all day then come home and crash every 10 min for 3 hours. ITs really weird. She will just get booted to log screen while i dont , we have a simple hub system running through you basic server  setup. Im doubting its a hardware issue. Just seems very odd we bolth got this issue around the same time.<br />

I hoping next patch corrects osme of this ...</div></div><hr />
