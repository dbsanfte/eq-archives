<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Viken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just wanted to say that with Chloroblast, HG can be really nice. I crit for 856 now. Granted, it's only 1 out of 33 heals that crits, but with 21 aa points you can heal for 856 every sixth heal on average. I find myself healing quite a bit more after I got Chloroblast so that's what prompted me to spend two points on Healing Gift.<br />
<br />
As an aside, I also find myself nuking far more often now with Frozen Winds and Brushfire so I put in 2 points to Spell Casting Fury just for fun. Crits are *Very* rare. 1 in 50 to be exact. I don't think I will do SC2 or 3 for a long while.<br />
<br />
As another aside, all this stuff is making me use a lot more mana so I plan on doing Mental Clarity sooner then I had originally planned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Darkdoc-Trib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">SCF3 is nice for 2 reasons.. 1st being a chance at a crit nuke.. second at level 3 for some reason i git double damage nukes upon cirting. so atm lvl 60.. my calcification does 900 damage when i git a crit.<br />
<br />
healing gift 3 is pretty nice regularly git a couple crit heals in a row which saves soem mana and downtime soloing</div></div><hr />

SCF2 adds 66% damage 4% of the time<br />
SCF3 adds 100% damage 7% of the time</div></div><hr />
