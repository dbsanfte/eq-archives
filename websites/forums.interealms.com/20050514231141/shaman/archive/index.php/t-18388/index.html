<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Scurvey Pestilential</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I may about as far from my computer as humanly possible right now, and thus unable to play EQ.  But I have a few hours to kill, so I'm going to post my increasingly optermistic wishlist here, as I do with each new major expansion.  Past experience has taught me not to do this due to the onslaught of flames it usually prevokes, but I don't care I'm doing it anyway.  :p <br />
<br />
On a more serious note.  It would be nice to see the Shaman Wishlist sticky back, I always thought it was a good collection of the better ideas.<br />
<br />
- Alchemy, improved but still not rewarding enough. Definately not on par with other trade skills, not even the other class specific ones.<br />
<br />
- Forage Herb, this has been a good idea for years. Would make alchemy profitable and if done correctly not overpowerd. My personal suggestion is that the more expencive the herb, the harder it is to find. So say a 100pp herb could only be found in the bottom of Seblis, or deep in tier one PoP?  Each zone could have a specific herb or herbs allocated to it, otherwise people wil just get bogged down with random herbs they don't need. This could maybe be an AA skill. This would be totally seperate from normal forage. I think even from a Roleplaying PoV, this is a good idea.  Probably an arse to code, but one of my faves.<br />
<br />
- Critical DoTs, we're not nukers we're Dotters. Crit AA's are of limited use to us, how about we get the DoT equivilant? Even at the expence of losing our nuke AA's?  Am I right in thinking that this might actually be on test already?<br />
<br />
- Rabid bear and melee in general, this is a gimic AA and serves no real practical use. Something radical should be done to it maybe?  Don't get me wrong I like gimmics, just not this one.  Shaman melee has always seemed a bit gimped to me, I know we're not melee as a rule.  But we have all these kick ass weapons with their kick ass stats, and we swing them around like limp haddok.<br />
<br />
- Curse of the frenzied spirit.  I mentioned this years ago and I still like the idea now, however with the new beserker class arriving this idea looks a bit like it belongs to the wrong class now.  Basically it's an AA which allows you to go into a mega beserk frenzy, doing massive damage (20k maybe?  What's reasonable these days?) right up until the point where it kills you.  This would be some added fun for those raids where there are too many bored shaman hanging around.  There's all sorts of problems with it such as agro control, PvP, etc.  I still like the idea in princible.  I thought of this when Wizzys had just got their MB, perhaps similer rules to it's use could be applied.<br />
<br />
- Maybe just have something similer for our pets?<br />
<br />
- Spirit of Pestilence.  Summoned weapons for DogDog, preferably with some little DoT of some kind for good measure, even more unrealisticly SNARE!.  Would be happy though just to not have to keep buying rusty daggers the whole time.<br />
<br />
- Banish Gnome spell!<br />
<br />
- Tigir's Infestation (75% disease based slow, plus 1300hp DoT).   Only thing is, can you say agro?  Really, I just thing adding an extra effect to out best slow would make us feel a little less gutted that everyone else and their auntie is slowing mobs these days.<br />
<br />
- Incubus. Level 65 spell (AA instead?)<br />
Blessses you with the power of the Monkey Incubus, adding dex and atk, as well as giving you the ability to duel wield. Would not be able to stack with the rage line or Curse of the frezied spirit, rabid hair lipped bear, etc.I've thought this one through even less then the others, feel free to flame.  Basically, I just think it's a cool name for a spell.<br />
<br />
- Hand of the Sixth<br />
80% Slow Wohoo!  OK we've been mildly toying with the idea for years, and generally decided it's too powerful, so here's my compromise.  It can only affect creatures below, say, level 55 maybe 57.  This would just be a way of making it slightly less embarrasing when we try to solo modern yard trash.<br />
<br />
Well there you go, everything from the unballancing to the plain rediculous.  This is really just to see if I can whip up some enthusiasm to reinstate the wishlist.  Hell, it worked for warriors!<br />
<br />
Spelling Nazis, feel to make fun of my dyslexia. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fenril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Except for Alchemy and Critical Dot, i'm sorry to say that you must be on a serious crack :D.<br />
<br />
Don't be selfish and pass it around, it really seems to be damn good  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Started off quite well :)<br />
<br />
You really don't want pets proccing dots in anything other than soloing situations. Chanters would go crazy trying to mezz stuff that aggroed you and resulted in pet taking a nip at. Summoning stuff is the mage's role.<br />
<br />
Disease based slow will never be as good as normal slow - its a deliberate feature to allow SOE to balance encounters somewhat. 50-60% maybe, but certainly not 75%. Adding a DoT has similar issues with mezzed mobs as the pet weapons, not to mention aggro. <br />
<br />
If we want an improved slow I'd look for 2 main things - <br />
a) loose the refresh time. Time's Antithesis clicky is actually better than our normal slow, that seems wrong to me. Clickies should, at best, be of equal power to our best spells.<br />
b) Introduce a -MR check on a new MR slow to increase chance of landing it. Even on normal LDoN adventures I find I get quite a lot of resists and if I take the time to malos first its hardly worth bothering with slow at all. <br />
<br />
Shaman melee skills - aye, would like an upgrade here. Would prefer double attack to dual wield, as I don't want to have to carry offhand weapons to swap in when I trigger some AA skill. Definitely need some more atk over rabid bear so we can actually hit stuff. <br />
<br />
80% slow? Seems a bit pointless if the max critter level is 55-57. If you can't solo tier 1 PoP with 75% slow I'm very surprised, and above that I think mobs are &gt; 55-57 aren't they? 75% slow is overpowering enough as it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">- Banish Gnome spell!<br />
<br />
<br />
LOL!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kelorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think it would be cool if we had a series of damage mitigation modifying spells. We're the Kings of buffing melees, and debuffing mobs, so I think a spell that reduces a mobs AC a large ammount, maybe 150-200 (I don't know the AC system to well so this would probably be horribly overpowered), and increases a melees natural damage mitigation by x % points, not based on AC though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thorzek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Rather than 80% slow (which is too powerful, hence the slow mitigation):<br />
<br />
A less-mitigated slow.  This would widen the gap between us and chanter/BL slows.  End result would be the shaman slow is 20% more effective than the others.<br />
<br />
Unresistable slow (AA, moderate refresh time)<br />
<br />
A slow that affects mobs Immune to slow (tough to justify, but hey, it's fantasy).  Not drastically, but say 20%.  Again, this puts a decent gap between us and the pseudoslowers.<br />
<br />
Buffs that exceed stat caps - how many shamans don't bother to buff their melees because they are all 305x4 unbuffed?  'nuff said.  Maybe +20 to each stat beyond the cap<br />
<br />
Love the idea of a pet frenzy mentioned above - Dogdog suicides on the mob, doing 10k damage in the process!  This gives us a burst DPS component, but limited.<br />
<br />
An upgrade to Cripple.  It's a 53 spell for god's sake.<br />
<br />
Self only attack buff.  I'd like to be able to hit occasionally on raid level mobs.  With no dual wield/double attack our melee DPS won't rival that of melee classes, yet we can feel like we are having an impact.<br />
<br />
Summary:  Shamans are buffers/debufers.  It's annyoning that our best debuffs (cripple and turgur's) are level 53 and 54 spells.  It's equally annoying that our 63-65 buffs (focus aside, but only for the HP component) become moot at the end game due to max stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Wishlist is a good word, I wouldn't mind seeing some stuff, but I don't see anything as needed right now...<br />
<br />
- Alchemy improvements, especially something desireable over 170 skill.<br />
<br />
- SOMETHING to make melee even a situationally appealing option.  Double Attack AA?  Completely overhaul Rabid Bear?  I dunno.  But when my group has tons of mana on the healers... the cleric melees and I heal.  That's wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>krindaria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">- Hand of the Sixth<br />

This would just be a way of making it slightly less embarrasing when we try to solo modern yard trash.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think that would be useless. How about an unresistable 75% slow? (except on mobs that are immune of course) or a 75% Slow/Cripple combination.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>ssylva</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hmmm lets see...<br />
<br />
Level 66 Insidious Tugurs -- Slow max 75%(at 70th level) same as tugurs with a -50 to the resist...<br />
<br />
Saryns Spittle -- 450 per tick poison dot -- with a 25% hate reduction over a normal poison dot.<br />
<br />
Improved Invisibility -- About time...<br />
<br />
Superior Immobilzation -- same as our greater immobilze but -25 harder to resist<br />
<br />
Level 67 Clinging Drowsiness -- Slows an already slowed mob 2% extra to a max of 75%...  Hence if a monster resists slow 50% such that tugurs is 37.5% -- each shaman casting this would add 2% to the slow -- IE 5 extra shamen = 47.5% slowed.<br />
<br />
Spirit of the swift -- 65% speed increase single spell with +40 atk.<br />
<br />
Talisman of Celerity -- like talisman of alacrity but 10% more haste -- slightly longer duration...<br />
<br />
Primal regrowth -- like regrowth only 50hp/tick on the party..<br />
<br />
Saryn's Spear -- 1500 damage DD poison... same casting speed as our other poison DD same ratio as vellium strike.<br />
<br />
Level 68 Insidious Tigirs -- AE slow max 60%(at 70th level) same as tigirs with a -30 to the resist...<br />
<br />
Ferine spirit -- summons a dog that is 3 levels higher than our level 61 pet with 25% more hit points that hits for a max of 75.<br />
<br />
Talisman of the griffon -- gives +55 con and +55 agility in one buff slot to the party...<br />
<br />
Spray of Saryn -- 3 rounds of 850 damage rain... <br />
<br />
Level 69 Undefendable plague of Bertox -- 120 per tick 3 minute Dot with a -300 to the resist.<br />
<br />
Superior bear form -- +5 to regen +5 to magic regen +200 to mana pool...<br />
<br />
Focus of the eighth -- +500 more hp than focus of the 7th -- 2 hour duration -- otherwise the same.<br />
<br />
Tnargs touch -- 2000 point heal -- 3.0 second cast time.<br />
<br />
Level 70 Talisman of the swift -- as spirit of the swift but group<br />
<br />
Talisman of the ferine -- as ferine avatar but group..<br />
<br />
Talisman of Quessence -- Casts Que on every member of your party...<br />
<br />
Reverse Ferine -- -140 to all stats and -140 atk on your target for 6 minutes.<br />
<br />
Change Rabid Bear form to give double attack and inherant Que instead of the stat raises it does now... If we want the stat raises we can always ferine ourself before going rabid.<br />

I may think of some others but this is a start...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Batuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">AE Malo__ please!  I can't tell you how long I've wanted this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Vhalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">1st 2 were actualy pretty good, the rest more of a fun read hehe.<br />
<br />
One thing I think should be adressed is Alchemy. There is one very big component missing in alchemy that all other tradeskills have: Items/potions made out of dropeable stuff. High end stuff.<br />
<br />
Even if not making potions as an end result, I think there should be some potions made from rare components with high trivial rate that there could be used as components to other tradeskills.<br />
For example if there was an item made by 250 tailors and one of the components for that item was a potion made with 200 alchemy using dropeable components. This would make both the Tailor item more rare as well as Alchemy more desireable.<br />
<br />
Many tradeskill recepies require other forms of tradeskills; some of them limited only to certain classes (like foraging or enchanting gems) If alchemy would be included into some of those, it could prove to be a worthy skill and the AA with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">increase our melee skills.  you want upgrades on spells post 60, while our melee skills top out at lvl 60?  that doesn't make sense.</div></div><hr />

<br />
nothing like ae unresistable slow 75% with a DA component!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ah, the wishlist... another time honored, seasonal tradition. Always willing to give it a whirl.<br />
<br />
First, the spells...<br />
<br />
Need a new slow. Yeah, yeah... we got a slow in every expansion but Velious. And, don't get me wrong, I much prefer having the disease-based slow (however wimpy) than not. But the way mitigation was implement basically trivialized the difference between our slows and the slows of the other classes. So, here is 2 ideas for a slow:<br />
<br />
- a level 62, magic-based slow. Keep it at 75%, keep it mitigable. Make it cheaper with a faster recast and a decent resist adjustment, say -50 or -100. This is the workhorse spell for the class, after all.<br />
<br />
- a level 64, cold-based, unmitigable slow. Keep it reasonnably weak, say between 40%. Make it moderatly expansive, say 400 or 500 mana, with a 5/5 seconds cast/recast. The idea is to keep the shamans significantly more able than the other slowers in at least a PORTION of the slow-mitigated fights.<br />
<br />
For the buffs... At this point in the game, no amount of stats buffing is going to do anything but impressed the newbs. Beside the travel mechanic effects (movement speed, sight, lev, etc.), the only things worth buffing are: HP, Mana, HP regen, Mana regen, AC, damage shield, ATK, attack speed and spellcasting speed. All those are well covered and distributed among the all the casting classes already, so they can't be just handed out to shamans. But the new melee system offers opportunities... how about giving shamans:<br />
<br />
- Endurance buffs. From level 5 to 61+, a gradation of raw endurance buffs to give the melees associated with a shaman that little bit of edge that all the STR buffs in the world SHOULD but NEVER DID give them.<br />
<br />
- Endurance regen buffs. Make those warriors fight harder and longer was always supposed to be the theme of the shaman class.<br />
<br />
On the self-buff front, we have 2 'line' already, which is fairly par for the course as far as a caster class is concerned. Except we're the only class that hasn't gotten a better self-buff with PoP (or since Velious for that matter). We got the 'frenzy' line (topping with Voice of the Berserker, level 59, from the Kunark era), which is fairly useless beyond the AC component, not to mention that, even though it's no longer the last-ditch spell it use to be, it still blanks out the caster all spellgems for 30 seconds on casting. And we have the 2 'bearform' spell, which would be fairly cool if the benefits weren't so meager and the graphic use so antiquated (with a graphical glitch that makes us all look like drooling idiots). Luckily, it's all fairly easy to fix…<br />
<br />
- For the frenzy line, remove that 'no casting for 30 seconds after using it' crap, lengthen the duration to 2 hours, add a small HP regen component (2 for frenzy, 4 for Fury, 6 for rage, 8 for Voice) and add a level 63 version (with a nice AC upgrade and a 10HP/tick regen component).<br />
<br />
- For the bear line, update the graphic (either the Velious kodiaks or the PoP bear, the one that can sit), replace the HP regen with a mana regen component (say 2 for the level 29 one and 4 for the level 55 one) and add a level 65 version (with 6 or 8 passive mana regen and UV/See invis).<br />
<br />
Where is our fixed-duration invis? Every other robe or healer that can invis has one… why not us?<br />
<br />
A 'real' (i.e. cast, as opposed to a triggered AA) canni upgrade. Something for level 62-ish, maybe 160 mana for 275 HP<br />
<br />
A good review of the DOTs would be nice. For the amount of aggro they generate, they should either be a lot easier to land, hit a lot harder or be a lot cheaper. Yeah, I can pile Bane, BoN, Scourge, BoS, Pox and Breath and do a lot of damage. The problem is that if I do that, I'll likely be dead before I finish casting the second round of poison DOTs, not to mention, between the resists and the fizzles, seriously struggling for mana. During the same time, the wizard will still be happily blasting away and the necros will be landing just as many DOTs, doing more damage for less mana and half the aggro.<br />
<br />
I have given up on our DD and Heals… 925 Cold is something we should have gotten BEFORE level 60, with Velium Strike being in the 1200 range. Tnarg should have healed for 1500+ and there should have been a Knarg upgrade at level 63 or 64. And Tears should have been in the 750/wave range. But they have obviously decided that for some reason we're both gimp healers and gimp nukers. I expect that boat has sailed and we won't see much change to those. But one can hope...<br />
<br />
Now, for the AA...<br />
<br />
- Spell Casting Subtlety. Oh come on… it's not rocket science. We're the class that could make the most use of that. That they gave it to the robes and not the healers was already a major brain fart. It's like if they had given Spell Casting Fury only to the hybrids.<br />
<br />
- DOTs offer so much possibility for AA it's not funny. You could have an AA to make them longer. Or to make them hit harder. Or cost less. Or cast faster. Or go in easier. Or generate less aggro. Pick 3. And give them Archetype, Class and PoP levels.<br />
<br />
- Group Quiescence anyone? Once every 12 minutes maybe? It's not Spirit of Wood or Paragon of Spirit but still.<br />
<br />
- Resist Adjust AAs, once for each resist type (except Fire obviously)... Kind of an innate malo debuff added to each spell cast. Just that would go a long way to compensate for the gimpy spell upgrades of the last 3 expansions.<br />
<br />
- Cannibalization upgrades… quicker recast, more HP for more Mana or both<br />
<br />
- Revamp rabid bear… either make it the high-level bearform upgrade we never got or replace it completely but that short-use, long re-use, overblown melee self-buff is just embarrassing. Or make it something we can cast on others...<br />
<br />
- A pet buff AA. Something nice, like making it tougher and nastier. Nothing to compete with the Beastlord, Mages or Necros, but something decent nevertheless. <br />
<br />
Finally, the miscellaneous stuff…<br />
<br />
- Herbalism skill. Level limited same as Alchemy (5 at level 25, +5 per level afterward, max'ng at 200). Put 3 to 5 herbs in every zone, with maybe a couple common among similar themed zone, plus one uncommon and one rare. It's not going to make us rich (alchemy components sell for silvers) but it's going to encourage people to work up their unique skill a bit.<br />
<br />
- Slam… well, duh. The shaman are the most melee-oriented of all the casters, they get beter weapon skills, they actually use shields and three of the 6 startin classes even have bash as a racial ability.<br />
<br />
Finally, what I really wish for is something NEW. The last 'new' thing the design team gave us was the ability to buff ATK with Avatar for KUNARK, which they promptly turned around and pimped out to most of the hybrids and everyone with a Sleeper's Tomb key the very next expansion. It would have to be something not too powerful, probably something that doesn't affect combat too much, if at all. Maybe the ability to summon mounts? Or a weak form of rez? Or a new, more powerful SOW. Something that make me say &quot;Cool, there is actually SOMEONE looking over the Shaman at SOE this time&quot;. Haven't had that impression in a really long time…</div></div><hr />

some skills are capped level*5, maybe just defense actually, most are (level+1)*5, so... (level 40) *5 = 200. Of course I was 65 before I ever got my defense maxed.<br />

<br />
The rest is just useless junk, which does nothing to bring us back in line with others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">some skills are capped level*5, maybe just defense actually, most are (level+1)*5, so... (level 40) *5 = 200. Of course I was 65 before I ever got my defense maxed.<br />
<br />
For the wish list, you forgot make summoned hammers droppable !<br />
Good god man, my defense was maxed at level 43 or 44, of course it took a lot of soloing to do it, but in the end its worth it....a druman that I knew leveling up way back in the day was level 63 with a 56 defense skill....can you say ouch?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Crit slows!!!! HAHa, I know not really thought you'd get a good laugh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Actually, for weapons skills, the level*5 + 5 thing applies to melees, for priests it is 4*level+4, and for int casters 3*level+3.<br />
<br />
That's only for weapons skills, not for defense/offense which are 5*level and other skills which are 5*level+5 for everyone.<br />
<br />
That would make shamans be able to max their weapons skills at 200 at level 49.<br />
<br />
At least, it was certainly true when I levelled up, although that was a few years ago now. If it's been changed since, I wouldn't know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Here I go again.<br />
<br />
1. We need a real bash skill. <br />
<br />
2. Stat buffs need secondary attributes. Like + Attk on Str. + dodge Mod on Agil. + hit or strike through on Dex. + Regen on Stamina. and a - Hate mod on Charisma. Make the god damn spells useful for the stat capped. <br />
<br />
3. Rabid bear and the Meele capabilities of the shaman need to be Sorely addressed. We are the front line healers.  We should at the very least be wanted to turn autoattack on, an in the case of Burning an AA skill Not have everone laugh when we do so. <br />
<br />
4. New spell lines. A slow. That is 50% But unmitagatable. A stackable shaman slow. That is very minor Like 3% But lands on anything including Slow immune mobs. (Capped at like 33% total slow of course)<br />
<br />
Things like The new meele system enhancers. Make the openings last longer. Or be more frequent. Or do increased damage. Meeles should coem to us like all casters go to enchanters.<br />
<br />
5. I still like the ideas of fetishes and totems. Items made with alchemy that are as good as the Things that JC and Pottery can make. Make them an Augment type. At 200 skill We should be able to make a burning Agffliction augment Fetish. And some other effects like regen.1-3  Small HP increasers. And other things. And have the beginnings of the line documented IN GAME. Not some combine of a combines combine that noone has tried since the advent of Velious.<br />
<br />
6. Heal Capability needs to be addressed. Yes I can heal. But the effort of being the healer and the slower is just a pain. If slow is resisted then I am always behind the curve.<br />
<br />
7. Area Effect curses. Blight an area and for 2 minutes anything that comes into that area is effected by the blight. Kinda like a rain but with the Duration much higher than 3 waves 4 total targets hit. Same resists lines as our dots. Poisen Disease and Curses. So that we can Curse a pull spot and the dot will still be in effect for a few mobs. Also  a slow Area effect as well. Smaller that turgers. Like maybe 55% That has a duration of 6-7 minutes that would go in the area. <br />
<br />
Hell to expand on the idea, have it require a Totem pole. (Regent) Cost for the total combine of 4-5 plat. Created with alchemy Or When Augmented with the totem pole the duration is increased. Like doubled. And to do a non totemed one would make it Last normal duration. Heck even allow some of the more powerful ones to have a drain on our mana. <br />
<br />
8. A Potion based. 50% XP res. You drink it and It allows you to bring a fallen friends essance back from the spirit world. (yeah yeah sounds of clerics having litte convulsions.)<br />
<br />
9. The ability to warp mutts spirit form. Make him tougher with an all inclusive pet buff. With 3 VERY important things.  Innate duel weild. Massive haste. and a large regen bonus.  And for the love of god make it a 2 hour buff. <br />
<br />
I will stop here. Have fun.<br />
<br />
Snoww Silverhammer Bashy RABID bear E marr</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Here's a high level alchemy potion I would be happy to spend days foraging or hunting to get the ingredients or 500  pp a combine if ingredients are vendor sold. Anyone remember the plane or air shaman ring ? <br />
<br />
Potion of the juju zombie (or something like). <br />
cast time 3.<br />
effect feign death.<br />
Trivials at 250 +++<br />
<br />
Just a crazy thought. Rarity and/or price tag can easily ensure it won't be used as anything other than a last resort panic button. There's plenty of examples in litterature of witch doctors concocting potions that slow the metabolism to give the impression of death. This is an example of a one shot fire and forget potion that would make skilling up worth the trouble for me at least.<br />
<br />
<br />
For the rest. I'd go with the basics, <br />
-a Slow Upgrade, no  recast or less recast time with a resist adjustment appropriate to level.<br />
<br />
-a group quiescence (we're the only priest class without a group healing spell)<br />
<br />
-a Quiescence upgrade, 500 tic/4 tics, 400-450  mana, 6 sec cast, affected by the same aa's and foci as quiesc. Let us get rid of krag's mending, we were never meant to have anything referred to as a complete healing anyways and this would be more in line with how we usually heal. Regular quiesc already gives us unlimited mana so this isn't gonna change anything in that regard.<br />
<br />
-Revamp of rabid bear. Make it the better bear form. We can already buff up to almost the same melee level with our regular spells anyways. Duration longer than refresh timer, a few stats that count like hp, hp regen, attack that stacks with our other spells and i'll be happy. Possibly a new model so that people can recognise someone who's using the aa as such.<br />
<br />
-Dots with resist modifiers appropriate to their level.<br />
<br />
there's probably more I'm forgetting but that's the ghist of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I loved your second idea, Snoww.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Drylar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">ooo ooo meee meee<br />
Ok, here's what I wish to see...<br />
1) Pet only buff that's focus+haste similar to spirit quickening, but something higher level. Lower mana cost than focus/haste too. Spirit quickening has only a whole 50 mana cost, so heck, make it 300 with the extended recast time and I'll be all warm and fuzzy in side.<br />
<br />
2) Rabid bear needs yanked or revamped. Forget stats people, we already max those out with other spells. Give us +250 to +500 attack, double or triple attack, innate q, and 100% haste. OR do +500 to +1000 atk, double or triple attacks, no q, but still 100% haste.<br />
<br />
3) Lets hasten rabid gimmic-of-no-purpose! The only AA more useless than rabid bear. I know, I know... I think this should go under the &quot;reoccuring theme&quot; category! Hastened Cannibilzation! Make it a 2/4/6 or a 4/8/12 that lowers reuse time by 5/10/30... <br />
<br />
4) Take away my crit nuking aa. OOOO a crit landed!!! I just cast like a druid without a crit!!! I DONT CARE!!! Gimme &quot;Spell Duration Fury&quot; or somesuch. Kinda an innate aa that has a 2/10/25% chance  for 2/4/6aa that has a chance PER TICK to have a dot (or all dots) do x2 damage.<br />
<br />
5) I'm in a high end guild now. Recently 65 (WOOHOO), focus=hp. stats are pointless. no one cares about the stats, they are all pretty much capped. we are supposed to be buff gods. either add the ability for our focus line to break the caps, or add atk/ac/stamina regen to them... pick 2.<br />
<br />
6) Barbs get bash since they are a large race... vah shir are a large race... what we too furry to bash?<br />
<br />
7) Alchemy... what's the use? About the only high end potion I can sell in quantity is gate. Woo f-ning hoo. I've got a few friens that like a potion that puts fur on their chest (Illusion Vah Shir) which requires farming meats that drop 1 in 10 off mobs that are RARE spawns. We do have a nifty little haste potion that we can make by farming fire giants that gives 134% haste for a few minutes. Monks love it, but it's HARD to get the stuff for. EVERY OTHER TRADESKILL got NICE upgrades PoP. I wouldn't mind working on a few aa while collecting hard to get ingridients for UBER &gt;200 potions. (Heya newbs or non-shaman, our cap is 200.... why make potions &gt;250?) I'm thinking a since we got level/4 and level/2... why not a high end pop DS that is (level) damage for (level/2) duration, and an elemental (levelx1.5) fdamage for (level/2) duration? Fishing got their toolboxs to make fillets for baking.... it became the beginnings of a tradeskill... other than talisman gate, which few use... i can't find anything that uses our stuff... everyone else has a use for everyone elses... lets make some way to add in our awareness lines, etc... or other nice toys... to allow adding of hard-to-come by stats/effects.etc.. to armors/leathers/items in new combines... I know, those spiffy ceramic toys for range are nice, lets make effigies, dolls, totems, that have low stats + better focus effects than mages, or on par with mages, limit them to pri/sec/range... or hell, even ammo/charm... without the norent tag. Maybe even allow for a skilled alchemist to hit up a skilled jeweler to add a chain so that it's neck wearble... work with me here. Ok... can keep going on alchemy ut I'll stop now...<br />
<br />
8?) Ok, we get heals, give us group q. Not overpowered, doesn't offset canni, group heal that has low aggro and does a bit of good. Another &quot;reoccuring theme&quot;. Not like it'll make the clerics cry, they still have better. <br />
<br />
9) Slows... sheesh... I became UBER SLOWER a long time ago. Now that I hit 65, I got 5%.... yes 5% over beasties. We are par to chanters. I thought WE were the debuffers? Give us a NICE resist modifier, and/or lower % unmitigatable (50% slow?), or even, how scary could this be... 30% unresistable! Maybe tweak te mitigation code a bit... if it's turgurs... mitigates at a stronger slow than anyone elses. Disease slowing is nice... the way it is, just give us one more that has a resist modifier or add a resist modifier, and I'd be happy.<br />
<br />
10) Cripple.. GREAT idea... why are we not the only class with it? Give us something like an improved cripple post-60 that goes much further... we ARE supposed to make melee do their job better, and it would be a great boon to the melee to stop whining they are so left behind. <br />
<br />
11) TARGETABLE GROUP SHRINK!!!!!!!!!!!! oo missed an exclamtion point there.. ! Ok, so hey, you dont want it... Those pretty little popups that say do you wanna rez or TL? How about &quot;so and so wishes to decrease your size?&quot; sure, jokes will fly, but hey, IT&quot;LL BE A HUGE BENEFIT!!!<br />
<br />
12) Here's a thought for a far-out-there spell... but how about &quot;Curse of the Avatar&quot;... self only, adds a 100% chance-to-land proc, you must get off your behind, stand up and swing... the proc lands, doing 3x your present hp to the target, and kills you. Refresh like 45 mins or something. The proc-effect offsets it in that it can be stopped by stunninig you or killing you first... Perhaps pet only that makes out pet hit for 500 something and we take damage equal to what the mob does, feeding our pet with our hp, until we or it dies, lasts 1 minute, in case we survive. If doggie's doing 1500/round... shamans can't take that very easy, even with a great CH rotation. Dont forget, BIG buff to pets in the process in addition to the huge attack modifier. (So it hits more frequently, hurting target and us in the process.)<br />
<br />
13) Bear form, ya ya ya, I blend right in if I head to the Karanas. I hit sit, and i just drool a bit more. I think I saw a PoP bear sit... they have cooler models. Can the LDoN bears sit? They BOTH look much cooler. And for goes sake, I am a vah shir... I dont wanna big a brown bear when I go into form of the great bear. You got black and white, why not at least change the color of brown, or i know, a striped bear! Lemme keep my pretty tiger stripes! Ooo another thought entirely... Give druids the silly bear form, give US the wolf forms... would be right on par with the druid's silly bear. Or, swap out the pets, keeping stats the same. (They'd have a silly pointless mutt, and we'd have ferocious bears). Lessee, a bear with a wolf pet and a wolf with a bear pet... just doesn't seem right.. And ooo a bit of hp regen and a minor wis buff... I used to use it for tradeskilling a bit... it's tucked in the very back of my spellbook, used only when i wanna gimmic-up and grow myself and run around pok. Give it a minor mana regen (hey druids and clerics get mana regen spells, and both can out heal us). <br />
<br />
14) ok, I diseased a mob... good, still on the melee, now I cursed the mob... melee hitting that stun a few times... good... hit that poison dot... LOOKY I&quot;M DEAD!!! Our nukes are nothing more than big jokes, our rains get so resisted it's not funny, our dots are HUGE aggro. How about a shaman only - class aa that reduces our hate innately? So mana people running around with an innate invis... why not at least an innate hate reduction to offset our HUGE hate dots?<br />
<br />
15) LOWER RESISTS ON RAINS!!!! Sure, they are good damage/cost ratio (for shaman), but hey, hit that rain, get summoned, you're gonna get hit too, you also can't use it if a bunch of mobs are packed and mezed... it's already nerfed enough, at least let us hope for more than 1 in 3 or 2 in 3 on those we can use it on. Maybe another aa for us like &quot;Cries of Saryrn&quot; that (innate) allows extended duration to all detrimental spells, including rains... like add a tick or 2.<br />
<br />
15) Why the hell can't we cast invis and not have to worry about going vis at a bad time? At least give us a self only &quot;Spiritwalk&quot; that gives us a fixed duration like others. We are heyokah, masters of spirits, why not give us our own line of Invis...  &quot;Spiritshield&quot; that allows random duration invis to live and undead (1-5 minutes) and also a &quot;Spiritwalk&quot; that grants fixed duration 5 minutes? Sure, lasts significantly less than other invis spells, but also grants greater use. <br />
<br />
16) Please have /dopropertinting on AS A DEFAULT!!! I like having my tail not the color of my armor. Everyone turn this on... the message is wrong, you have to restart the client for the effect to take place...  You will REALLY like the effect on how characters appear (tested on a 450Mhz AMD K6-2 with a MX440 with 256Mb ram that is right on the edge with EQ, NO CHANGE IN FPS, nor was there any change on my machine, Athlon XP 3k+, 512Mb PC3700 DDR, Ti4200 64Mb all OC'd)<br />
<br />
17) Non shaman, but hey, I'm a skinner... lemme create my own windows, add buttons (like hotkey buttons, but must be clicked to do the actions), and I want eqtypes for EVERYTHING! ooo aa's spent... i want aa's unspent, i want aa's total... i want all eqtypes for every last thing on the screen, i know, gimme a way to make gauges from buffs for spells of a duration so i know how long on them i have... this is all pretty much drawn from client side, so no extra network traffic, but would allow me so much more to do.<br />
<br />
18) MGB VAH SHIR. CATS RULE!<br />
<br />
Ok... ranting and mind expended... could keep going but need a cat nap. From the mind of everyone's favorite furry shaman.a</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Scurvey Pestilential</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">OK, allow me to sum up what generally seems to be what most people seem to want.  This is by no means a final draft, but something to focus on and better define, I've tried  to represent all the more popular ideas  here.  So in no particular order I give you the Shaman Wish List! Feel free to point out anything I've over looked.  Would someone  like to do a few polls such as: What type of Slows would you like to see in the  game?  ie. quicker casting, unresistable, better AE, etc. We  could also use some similer ones  for melee,  alchemy,  etc.<br />
<br />
1.- Better Melee skills!  Several different options have been put forward.  Including 1) Better Bashing Skill.  2) The ability to either duel wield or double attack.  3) The ability to actually HIT STUFF!   This may include a self ATK buff, or maybe at the very least lose our melee penalty.  This would be good for all those extra shaman shuffling their feet at raids.<br />
<br />
2. - Alchemy - Forage herb or Droppable herbs (Made Perhaps NO DROP) and better potions. Any way that will actually make Alchemy something to use for profit.  The ideas of making charms and fetishes is good and  very role-playing, combing alchemy with other TS's is also good.<br />
<br />
3. - Do SOMETHING, ANYTHING! to make Rabid Bear appealing.  Most are in favour of a complete overhaul.  Perhaps wish No.1 could be brought into consideration.  Oh and lose the hair-lip wookie illusion.<br />
<br />
4. - Better SLOW!  Several ideas have been put forward, from unresistable 50% to a disease AE slow.  Many, if not all of us feel this is one of our class defining skills, which is now available to pretty much every class in some form or other.  We want something that really will give us back the title of KINGS of SLOW!<br />
<br />
5. - Better healing!  The idea which seems to surface frequently is a group version of Q.<br />
<br />
6. - Critical DoTs!  This is one we have a very strong argument for, we were seriously left behind when the critical AA's came about.  How about something to put us back on par?  Perhaps at the expence of  losing our Crit DDs?<br />
<br />
7. - Summonable Pet Weapons!  At the highest level of optermism, something that procs Snare!  However most of us would settle for 'Summon Rusty Dagger'.<br />
<br />
8. - Improved Invis!  We're tired of getting caught with our kilts down!<br />
<br />
9. - AE Malo!  We all want it, and it's fair enough!<br />
<br />
10. - Casting Sublety!  Need we say more.<br />
<br />
11. - IMPROVED BUFFS!  Our other class  defining skill is also limited these days.  Everyone and their auntie in the high end game has maxed buffs.  The idea of  secondary stats on buffs is a good one, adding atk, regen, dodge modulation, etc.   Endurance buffs also.<br />
<br />
12. - New Canni!  Don't get us wrong, Canni 5 is great, but the normal canni (canni IV) just doesn't cut it anymore.  We'd like to see something which has a quicker casting time and preferably gives us more mana too.<br />
<br />
15. - New Cripple (Paralyse perhaps).  Something that actually has a noticeable effect.<br />
<br />
17. - A decent Pet-Only buff that LASTS!  Having to rebuff our pet  with several different spells all the time is anoying.  Giving us something that gives our pets a proper HASTE, Melee buffs, HP's and SoW would be a good place to start.<br />
<br />
16. - Finally many of us just want to see SOMETHING NEW!  We're tired of continually getting simple upgrades of our old spells EVERY EXPANSION!  Suprise us! Give us something new and Unique!<br />
<br />
<br />
OK I know that Sunmoon has said that this site is not here to make Demands of SOE, and that's fair enough whatever the reasons.  But I would only ask you to reconsider, this is without question the strongest  Shaman community on the web.  If there's anywhere we're likely to be noticed, it's here.<br />
<br />
I for one feel that as a class, we're largely overlooked.  We dont want to top of the pile, we simply want to be on par with other classes.  We also want to feel our class is unique and offers something that no other class even comes close to.<br />
<br />
So please, for old times sake bring back the Sticky.  Melees have recently proven if you shout loud enough you will get heard.  If The  Shaman Crucible are unwilling to do it, are there any site owners out there willing to compile a well thought out shaman Wishlist?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>veggi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">What i want for Xmas.... hmmm no EQ<br />
<br />
Group Q, we really need a group heal imho...<br />
Better slow, but i am fairly please with slowing as it is.<br />
Dot aa's<br />
Better Canni<br />
<br />
And with the new melee changes maybe a curse line that creates more 'openings' for melee's to do their new stuff?<br />
Sounds something fun and suitable for a shaman to have in their debuff line of spells... 'Cure of the clumzy monkey' :-)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Moregar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Would be nice to see an upgrade to spirit quickening, as most other classes that have pets get upgrades to their 'all-in-one' pet buff.<br />

Also, I have seen a lot of AE Malo posted as something desired....my question would be, does any class have an AE UNRESISTABLE debuff?  Maybe AE Malosinia, as it can be resisted, would be a viable option, to go along with AE slow.<br />

<br />
<br />
Then I would be happy if they made our AE slow unresistable, either with an upgrade spell or an AA ability - 40% unresistable slow on 4 mobs at once greatly improves our CC I think =)  Of course, I really enjoy playing the game for fun, and am content with it the way it is...more is nice, but I am not going to gripe about not getting upgrades - at that point the game is no longer fun in my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">So noone liked the Cursing an area marked witha  totem pole idea? <br />

Then change rabid bear to do one major thing. + 100 hps a tick regen Stackable Full duration of the spell. Like the old rage line. before the fix./nerf but dont lose mana. and Make the recast about half what it is. Or change our attack and hit table to Warrior for the duration of rabid bear. And lose all mana. But keep the regen in.  So 5 minutes out of 2 hours we can be meele beasts.(Main hand bonus and all) With tripple attack and flurry Raging flurry and such     (Ack... Brick!)<br />

okay shamless bump as well. (Grins)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Scurvey Pestilential</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">The totem idea sounds good, reminds me of dungeon keeper.  However the only spell I know which works in that was is the chanter spell (is that right) which allows the caster to know exactly who walks over the area he cast the on.  All I remember is I cast it once with an observer staff, and lost a great deal of popularity points.<br />
<br />
I think you need to exapand on what you think they should be used for.<br />
<br />
As for AE rains improved, yes there's a fair bit of support but I just thoughtit was boring. :)<br />
<br />
I've moved my finding to Henoras thread anyway, it's far better to have one threadt then multiple ones.  I do appreciate the support though. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Read quite a few, not all so not sure if I'm copying some.<br />
<br />
Ok, there are currently 3 stats that matter.  Not including resists.<br />
Hitpoints, Armor, and Attack.<br />
I like Snoww's ideas on how to make the others matter also, hell even for those who's stats aren't maxed stats are fairly useless.<br />
<br />
Shaman Mellee.<br />
A long ways back there were I believe 3 different damage tables.<br />
Casters, Hybrids, and Pure Mellee's.  They changed things up, put rogues and monks in a higher dmg table above warriors and brought Sk's and pallies up into the warriors dmg table.  Would be cool if rabid bear brought us up into the hybrids old dmg table permamently.  Not just a quick little whif whif smack whif AA, but something on constantly.<br />
<br />
Alchemy<br />
First, fix the **** up where all our alchemy stuff for LDoN was put in the forage loot table and put it in the junk dropped table instead, oh pretty pretty please fix that, cause it must have been a mistake.  No shaman who has played this game for over a year would trust the developers to make alchemy components forageable AND actually give shamans forage, I mean like no way in hell would they put in that much thought.<br />
<br />
Books and usefull potions would be great.  Been saying for a long time now that a Rez potion that uses an Essence Emerald to do a 93% rez is no big deal, its just a portable necro that still needs a necro to sacrifice someones exp to help out someone else.<br />
<br />
Heals<br />
Slow is resisted and our gimp heals don't mean jack.  If we're given gimp heals due to haveing slow then our slow should be irresistable.  If we are not given an irresistable slow then obviously our heals should not be such poo.  Since we do not want them to give us an irresistable slow that make all content require us to have irresistable slow giving us heals equal to druids or at least close to druids would be nice, instead of close to pally's!<br />
<br />
DoT Agro<br />
K, while back I was reading in a warrior thread how agro is figured in the book version.  One thing that caught my eye was the most recent dmg done bonus to hate. Dots hit at the end of the tick, makeing them always the most recent dmg done when figureing out hate for the next tick, therefore dots get an inherent HATE BONUS which gets carried from one tick to the next.  <br />
<br />
This seems to me the reason Dot agro is so huge, perhaps code it to where the dot hits every 6 seconds from when it first hit?  If it hits end of tick, so be it, if it hits middle of tick great.  Codeing it to hit mid tick seems somewhat simpler and a good fix.<br />
<br />
Pet Stuff<br />
Oh lvl 61 pet is awesome at lvl 61-64 and still good at 65, but considering how much many shamans use their pets it really seems a shame that the pet focus aug is not shaman useable.  For as much as I use my pet this is something I would go for definatly.  Makeing it all/all actually seems to make sense to me since it raises the pet performance/hps a percentage probably and it won't ever make a shaman or shadowknight or chanter pet up there with a mage beast or necro pet that is non focus'd.<br />
<br />
Definate wishlist item, an item that is shaman useable that summons a pet weapon with item haste and procs spirit quickening.  Yea, not the best pet haste around, but hey its something and it doesn't get in the way of other hastes.<br />
<br />
An upgrade to spirit quickening that lasts a long time.  Longer than Gone Like the Wind, Talisman of Alacrity long would be very nice since I use that on the group memming gone like the wind every couple minutes is a pain so if I'm traveling without a chanter my pet goes unhasted currently.<br />
<br />
DPS<br />
Fixing DoT agro and giving shamans the ability to up their mellee skills to right below that of tanks would fix our dps abilities, and would be balanced since its not like we can can4 while mellee'ing unlike clerics yaulping.<br />
<br />
Mana Regen<br />
An upgrade to cann4?  A hastened Cann5?</div></div><hr />
