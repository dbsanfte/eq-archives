Bastards. Did they ask if they could?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Heh. That banner is absolutely NOT &quot;uninvasive&quot;, especially now that I know Yantis is running the show (chief operations officer). <br />
<br />
This may be drama queenie of me, and I know the camp is fairly divided on capitalism vs. the integrity of the game (I'm of two minds myself really), but I'll be deleting the bookmark to this site and not coming back.<br />
<br />
Bye.<br />
<br />
what a whiney little bitch.. the website has to be kept up somehow, and if sunmoon doesnt want to go to the community for donations then theres not much else he can do but put in advertising</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">my link was more to the point of all these people are like &quot;oh, if they want to put an image up to pay for the site, that's fine,&quot; when in reality, they're doing some evil stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Is coming to this site now a security problem? Are we getting hit with spyware? I'm well protected but hate to see it, if it is happening.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you hover your mouse over the banner, you see the web address in my status bar that I mentioned before... <br />
<br />
It may have locked itself into my status bar (which sometimes happens to me, go go IE) while I was browsing the forums. If im wrong, Im sorry. If Im not, why is there a link like that on a banner?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>kilher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">What I said in the older thread that was linked... Since I posted that having just blocked the ad, I have not seen the ad since.<br />
<br />
I'm telling ya, Firefox + Adblock extension (both free!) kick butt.  You can use wildcards too, so if you know a domain address (doubleclick anyone?) you can block everything from that address.  Also lets ya stop flash, etc too.  I'll never see an IGE ad again.<br />
<br />
Oh, and to let ya know, it doesn't leave a big gaping hole where the ad should be either, so it looks nice and clean.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The link is on the ad banner so they can track where their click-throughs are coming from.  It would record where you clicked from, then redirect you to the Yantis site somewhere.  They get nothing from you if you don't click on the banner.<br />
<br />
As for why it's stuck in your IE status bar, it sounds like a bug, go go Microsoft.<br />
<br />
And I, too, use Firefox.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm telling ya, Firefox + Adblock extension (both free!) kick butt.<br />
<br />
When a magazine comes in the mail, the first thing I do is rip out all the stupid cards, flyers, heavy or double-paged ads and throw them in the trash.<br />
<br />
Firefox + Addblock lets me do the same thing with web sites.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It's funny after you rip out all of the adds from a magazine how much it shrinks.<br />
I use firefox too, I don't like IE. I was lookin for roms and  got some virus without even realizing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I swear by Mozilla now and avoid using IE unless absolutely necessary (my online classes require IE ... /gag - error out server side in Mozilla). Sure, the nightly builds might crash on occasion, but ever since I have used Mozilla, I have YET to receive any unknown spyware, virus, or other undesirable.<br />
<br />
If only I could toast Windows completely, but need redundancy in order to make sure classes can complete properly (video card fan in one machine is dying, hard drive in the other is dying... not a good combination).<br />
<br />
My suggestion: If you use IE, and don't &quot;have to&quot; (say, for work, school, whatever)... use Mozilla (or Opera, or something else). If you have to use IE, do it on a case-by-case basis... use &quot;something else&quot; for everything else and tell the site's author to make the page standards compliant, not IE compliant.<br />
<br />
Oh!  Recommended Mozilla plugins: Adblock (adblock.mozdev.org) and Multizilla (multizilla.mozdev.org). Adblock, by itself, will alleviate a lot of problems, especially if you grab the pre-built list from http://pgl.yoyo.org/adservers/<br />
<br />
I use that list here and it blocks just about everything (I intentionally allow google ads (googlesyndication) though, since, 99% of the time, they are actually relevant and something I may be interested in).</div></div><hr />
