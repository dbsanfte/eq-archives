<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Setantha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Been happening randomly ever since I restarted EQ. Also not a UI thing..was happening before that patch. Always seems to happen as I am casting a spell too. Occasionally, not always, after i crash I will get a DDhelp Error message (DirectDraw I presume).<br />
<br />
System as follows:-<br />
<br />
Win 98 SE<br />
AMD Athlon 1ghz<br />
512 MB Ram<br />
GeForce 2 MX<br />
Directx 8.1<br />
<br />
Anyone else have this problem? If so how did you resolve it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is the reply that one of our techie boys posted for him :)<br />
<br />
Symptoms<br />
When you play a file using Windows Media Player or run the DxDiag.exe tool, you may receive the following error message: <br />
<br />
Ddhelp.exe caused an invalid page fault in module Mgaxdd32.dll at 015F:BAAL521F <br />
Cause<br />
This issue can occur if your computer includes any of the following items: <br />
Matrox Millennium II video adapter<br />
Microsoft DirectX 6.1<br />
An incompatible video adapter<br />
Resolution<br />
To resolve this issue, contact the manufacturer of the video adapter to obtain an updated video driver <br />
<br />
Hope this helps you!  Seemed to be a driver problem for the video card.  He downloaded updated drivers and it fixed it.</div></div><hr />
