<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">When can our pet proc using the mage summoned swords?  I'm 54 now and my pet gets the &quot;your will is not sufficient&quot; message.  (I'm hoping the new pet I get at 55 will be able to proc since I normally group with a 61 mage  :p .)<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I had to get the lvl 61 pet to use the proc on the highest sword.  Maybe even the one below it.  Had to use Fists to get a proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Reysa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There are three summoned weapons of interest. Blade of the Kedge and Blade of Walnan both proc at level 40. Fists of Ixblat proc at level 10. Your pet won't proc the blades for a while yet, but they will still make it dual wield. The fists will proc for any of our pets, but the blades only for the lvl61 pet. I gave my pet fists until I got to 61, then switched to Kedge swords for normal use.<br />
<br />
All three weapons have a 160pt (at lvl65) dd proc. The only difference on the proc is the resist check. Kedge checks against magic, Walnan cold, Fists fire.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think there are several versions of the Fists actually.  Thought there were some with a cold proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Perelandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Shaman pets can use any of the mage summoned weapons starting with the level 61 pet. Prior to this, the pet can only use Fists of Ixiblat. The fists of Ixiblat require the pet to be level 10 or greater to use while the other 2 require level 40 (the pet prior to 61 is level 39).<br />
<br />
All 3 weapons do exactly the same damage - the only differences are a) skill type (blades are 1hs and fists are h2h) and b) resist check on proc (Walnan = magic, Fists = Fire, Kedge = Cold).<br />
<br />
The damage the procs do is based on the following formula:<br />
Level*2 + 20 = Damage.<br />
The level is the PET LEVEL not the player level. If I remember correctly, the 61 shaman pet is level 58 so the proc damage is 136.<br />
<br />
Beastlords have claimed that their pets have higher DPS when using the fists than with other weapons - claiming their pets have higher H2H skills. I have seen no proof of this one way or the other, but you may want to test some things on your own with shaman pets to determine if they have higher skills with a certain weapon type.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Popu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I had wondered about h2h vs 1hs. Our pets are warriors right? And h2h is capped lower than 1hs thus the idea that even with a noob pet you give them any weapon they do more damage since they have a higher skill than h2h.  I have never tested this, but just to be safe I always ask for blades. Anybody proved different?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Perelandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Our pets are warriors right? And h2h is capped lower than 1hs. . .<br />
<br />
Rules for PCs do not necessarily apply with NPCs. Most pets are flagged as warriors including BST pets. Exceptions being certain necro pets and the post 50 Mage Water pets which are rogues. Don't assume that since 1hs on a PC warrior is higher than H2H that it will also be higher on NPCs. You'll actually have to do some parses to test this out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ungerargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm relatively sure it has been parsed out that beastlord pets do more damage with HTH weapons than other types, although I'm not feeling spunky enough to dig up a parse atm.  Also of note is that beastlord pets do not kick; they only bash, which is part of why they generate such nice aggro. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Walk into Lower Guk and check out the wizard frogs dual wielding scimitars.  Then talk to me about PC warrior rules applying to NPC's.  =)<br />
<br />
I'm not saying it's impossible that these things are true - however, I wouldn't use the warrior H2H cap as a reason.  Myself, I'm going to stick with the highest summoned mage sword - blade of the kedge - on the theory that the higher level summoned items proc more often.  Unless the critters are ice resistant.  Fists of Ixblat have the exact same proc (150 hp) save that it's fire, instead of ice.  Really, I use what the mage in my group hands me.  *grin*<br />
<br />
Maybe someday I'll parse, or see some convincing (read: statistically significant) parses of a shaman pet (ours is the only one who needs to be handed items to dual wield, I'm going to assume dogdog differs from other class's pets in other ways, as well) convincing me otherwise.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This was true for a while - BST pet damage used to drop drastically if you gave the pet anything besides a H2H weapon.  It changed at some point, all the parses done in the last few months show identical dps on BST pets no matter what weapon type they're using.</div></div><hr />
