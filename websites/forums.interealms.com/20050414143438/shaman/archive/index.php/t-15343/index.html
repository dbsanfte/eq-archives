<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Asyth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay.  First thing to know is that i am almost computer illertate.  I can hunt and peck a bit, but takes me a while to realize the simple things in computer land.<br />
<br />
Soooooooooooooo<br />
<br />
I got this awesome amount of money. . ./cheer!<br />
<br />
I deside to get anew puter o. . O!<br />
<br />
I get it and DSL runnin' three weeks later. . <br />
<br />
I log on. . <br />
<br />
LD LD LD LD LD<br />
<br />
Complete freeze out and have to hit restart on the puter to escape.  Ctr Alt Del doesn't work or nothin'.<br />
<br />
So i consult the tech help threads. . . yeah i'm lost. . i go ask my sister for help. . she starts this thread for me:<br />
<br />
http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum3/HTML/044446.html<br />
<br />
okay no reply . . . no reply. . no reply. . busy folks methinks. . <br />
<br />
So i deside to give it a try myself.<br />
<br />
Try 1:<br />
<br />
O.  . look zipped Dirext x files. . /unzip them all. .load. . LD LD LD LD LD<br />
<br />
Try 2:<br />
<br />
Go and find the help file in our sony folder. . follow directions. . Aaaahhh first thing is i had downloaded DirectX 8.1 thinki' i didn't even have DirectX installed. . so i guess prob is that DirectX 9 is baaaaad<br />
I go read up on possible solutions to DirectX 9 probs.  Seems that most folks have a near to complete recovery if they download DirectX 9b.  So i download it.<br />
Load EQ. . LD LD LD LD LD LD LD<br />
/sigh<br />
<br />
So what it comes down to is i'm desperate here! its been almost 4 weeks with virtually no access. . /sniffle I ask you folks for any help or ideas you think would help.   :confused: <br />
<br />
<br />
P.S. i will literally ROFL if its not even directX with all this readin' i've been doin' lol . . . .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Asyth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Okay an update of a sort eheh<br />
<br />
Been talkin'onthe phone with anice guildie who is tryin' to helo mework this out.<br />
<br />
He thinks that since my video card is sharin' umm in the IRQ with my USB thingys that mayhap my video crd is bein' tempermental.  So put iton its own number and it should be happy.<br />
<br />
Well i took apart my puter for the first time in my life. . scary. . and the video card is only compatible with one slot, so can't move that one eheh. . i have an intel fanthingy so its notiverheating.. puter is also next to an ac so no way it could be overheatin' i think. ..now we are makin' sure my xp is up to date. . . <br />
<br />
p.s. yeah i don't have the techno babble down eheh but i think you know what i mean...least i do eheheh<br />
<br />
so still lookin' for the prob just thought a lil' info on progress sofar would be helpfull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gizzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">check if ANY irq's are being shared and fix...<br />
did you install any new programs before you started going ld?<br />
if you keep installing new driver after new driver...eventually your gonna confuse windows so bad that your gonna have erase your hard drive(format it) and reinstall windows from scratch...which is a legitamate fix for certain problems so just dont think the world is gonna end if/when that happens hehe :D <br />
...wait tho did you mean your comp is right next to an air conditioner unit?...honestly that might not be the best thing if you use it a lot since dust=heat=mortal enemy of cpu's...if you use the ac a lot i suggest you clean out the inside(avoid static) every once in a while</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
okay first one.<br />
<br />
IRQ's:<br />
<br />
My vid card is sharing with my hubs.  Nothing to be done with that and really shouldn't be a problem.  Nothing to be doen about it cuz my vid card can only be in one slot, so theres no move it around till you score the &quot;only me here!&quot;<br />
<br />
Did i install any new programs:<br />
<br />
When i first got this bran spankin' new puter i didn't install a thing.  I took nortan off cuz i knew it would ocnflict already, and installed DX 8 ( thinkin' i didn't have DX which i realize is sill ynow cuz XP has DX9)<br />
<br />
Logged on and LD LD LD /sigh i run to EQ tech help area, which btw is insanly busy! <br />
<br />
<br />
Did i confuse my puter?:<br />
<br />
you guessed my harddrive crashed eheh its at the tech lab now bein' erased and redone lol But the tech does  not think it was my fault he thinks it was a bad harddrive and what was possibly my original problem.<br />
<br />
<br />
Computer location:<br />
<br />
Technically it is about 4 feet away from the computer, on the same wall to the right eheh so in a location to remain cool but not bei'n blown on directly.<br />
<br />
<br />
Current situation! :)<br />
<br />
Its with the techy eheh i guess i had two DSL thingys in there too eheh i didn't know they put that chip in there for me, so i bought one (oops) and put that bad boy in.  Techy removed it and tried to connect to internet. . .yeah the one they installed was broken, he disabled it and put mine back in.  <br />
<br />
than he trashed my harddrive and gave me a new one, now he is givin' me an &quot;alter ego&quot; for eq.  Settin' it up so that when i want to play EQ i log onto windows in seperate handle, and have all the nessesary settings done there, while havin' a regular way to use my computer on all the normal settings if i need that as well. <br />
<br />
After he finishes this ( tomarrow) i get to try to launch eq again.  If it fails he wants me to bring him my EQ program and he will make it work fer me eheh.<br />
<br />
All in all this is only costing me labor i believe, i am not bein' ripped off in any way ( entire family is usin' this guy atm) And i am hoping beyond hope that my puter gets fully function soon eheh :)<br />
<br />
But if this doesn't work i'm gonna have to quit! omg! lol<br />
<br />
Thankyou very much for replyin' to this Gizzy  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">First what kinda computer do you have? video card ram etc etc. If you could get another computer there to try it out on your connection I would try that to see if it is your computer. Also clear out all loaded junk, junk meaning well lets start there.. nevermind the junk..  I'll get to that later</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zazra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I know that you said &quot;hub&quot; -- but is it possible that you're using a Linksys ROUTER?  I know of lots of people ( myself included ) that had serious LD issues with multiple boxxes connected to a router.<br />
<br />
Luckily the solution was quite easy.  We just went to the Linksys website and downloaded the newest FIRMWARE version. Perhaps this will help you too.<br />
<br />
( Not meaning to pick on Linksys ... mayhaps same issues with Netgear .... 3Com ... dunno.)<br />
