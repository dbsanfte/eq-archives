<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aeydin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all, like always I have questions for you :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
First question is about buffs, im lvl 15 and a troll.  So far I have been applying all my buffs that I have to my character, inner fire, str, dex, agi, sta, ac etc etc.  A person told me in game though that buffs dont really help at all.  If this is true this would deffinatly speed up my downtime when buffs ran out :)  .  So I was curious if this is true or not, I was thinkin of just applyin the sta, ac and agi buff for now on. But I am not sure if that is a good idea.<br />
<br />
Second question is a equipment question.  http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=280699<br />
There is my character, the atk and ac are wrong cause I forgot to add those.  I was wondering where you would upgrade this character.  I was thinking all I need is a better helmet and some gloves?  Also a friend of mine is making me those fancy 6ac 65hp rings, so those  are on its way.  What do yall think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">At your level, stat buffs will indeed have a minimal effect on your performance. As you go up levels, the stat buffs get more useful but they are never really make or break.<br />
<br />
If you are meleeing a lot, you can't really go wrong with more AC. I'd buff AC and HP and leave it at that. When you get a haste buff, that becomes the most important one for meleeing characters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Verata</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What would be the opinion of a dex buff helping with the rate of skill increases to combat abilities though?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vadmir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Dex matters imo.  My troll SK (10th) was not increasing his mellee skills hardly at all.  Then a 39th level shammy stat buffed me and I maxed my increases within an hour (about 12 points).  May be luck but cant hurt to buff the dex especially if you have a procing weapon.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Good point about the Dex buffs, I'd forgotten about that. Bear in mind that a 30th level dex buff will add lots more dex than the lower ones, so if you seem to be keeping your skills maxed anyway, I wouldn't worry about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You mention applying all your buffs to _your character_ so I'm going to assume you mean while you're soloing.  Melee types will swing more often &amp; have about the same or better base stats as you so they will increase their skills faster.  If you're short on mana, just HP and AC buff yourself, if you've got mana to burn go for the other stats.<br />
<br />
Read our faq about what the stats do &amp; determine if you need them.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Buffs at your level are really only marginly useful, I'd only toss them up on a fight I expected to be very tough.  At 57 I keep 9 buffs on myself (AGIL, STAM, STR, Rage, Shroud, Kragg, Regrowth, SoW, Greater Bearform, although STR is really sorta pointless as I don't melee much I have grown to like having my STR around 255).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Right now i have Clicky SoW, Clicky sta (PoG BP :D ) Summon horse, regrowth, clicky bramblecoat ;) Leftover focusing from raid, agi and AC buff, i always have these going so i can break 1000ac cap for tank soloing :o <br />
<br />
At lower levels I always kept myself buffed unless I was grouped... Then i kept tanks buffed :p <br />
<br />
BTW J bone helmet would help, and JB gloves / Crystal Chitin gloves would be good too (don't know how much money you have :| )</div></div><hr />
