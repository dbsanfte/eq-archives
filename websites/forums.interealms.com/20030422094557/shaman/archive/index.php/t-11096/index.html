<br />
finally made it out of KOS but I'm wondering how high my faction can go, I've read that iksars, even with the ghoul lord's scalp can only hit amiable (native indif faction) and that as an evil race you need to have project illusion cast on you to do this quest<br />
<br />
any troll out there actually done the quest without any enchanter illusions?</div></div><hr />

I got to amiable with the ghoul scalp. Had an enchanter cast froglok illusion on me. That bumped me up one level to where I could complete the quest. (warmly I think)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Shinerbokk, been wondering about how this illusion effects you trolls and the &quot;no stun&quot; ability for frontal attack, do you end up losing it with the illusion?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chikkan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would assume yes... Since any illusion cast on me (barb sham) that isnt a bash-abled race, cannot bash.. If i get halfling for instance, i cannot bash..which is a racial skill... So, if frogs can;t be stunned from front, then you can still do it.. but if it's only for trolls, then can't<br />

<br />
I honostly can't remember ever being stunned while in this illusion. Though I don't usually fight mobs in wood elf illusion.<br />
<br />
I am always in skeleton illusion from my AoN due to it being an insta click and shrink all in one. (It also helps in pvp). I don't get stunned in this illusion so I don't think I would get stunned in wood elf either. I could be wrong, so I'll experiment when I log on to be sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Got an AoN as well that I normally use.   Been contemplating putting my droppable gear on a Ogre and re-rolling slowly on off time lately, figure if I can get no stun and still look decent then it is worth it :)<br />

   BTW, get some of those all all whips and pure JBB you look pretty sweet in Elfie form ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vhalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It is actually easier for evil races to get the required faction than good peps that are KoS (like myself) ... I killed Ghoul Lord (or King dont remamber) and gotten the scalp to drop but its not goodie useable :(<br />
