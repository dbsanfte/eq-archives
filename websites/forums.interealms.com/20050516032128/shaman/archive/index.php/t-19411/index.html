<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Papa G</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering if any of you guys had some info/tactics on the nameds in Tower of Sol Ro, since my guild is coming close to them and I would like to &quot;prepare&quot; for the encounters.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They're all really really easy.  Xuzl and two others can be one grouped if you take the right people and play it right.  Just rush in head first with 4+ groups and you should be fine :)<br />
<br />
Note: Sol Ro himself is a bit tougher, will leave strat on him for you to figure out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">well, dresolich can offer some problems.  Might want to actually sit back and see what they do first before attempting to rush headlong into their chamber.  Might you, they are leashed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>korask shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Forget that, my guild rushed head first into all of them and dealt hot death.  their easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Rizlona - I forget what she does as a bard, but she's gimp.  Once she turns in to a dragon she's basically like a ragefire that has more HP and is easier to slow.<br />
<br />
Xuxl - Use FD pullers / bards to pull the swords one or two at a time.  They can be rooted, slowed, and mezzed easily.  However, they hit extremely hard and flurry.  As long as you only have one loose at a time, you are fine.  Once they are dead just zerg Xuxl, he's a gimp.<br />
<br />
Arylixir - Basically a PoV golem with a lot of HP and a DS.  I successfully tanked him once with no trouble.<br />
<br />
Dreso - 4 slowable mobs, I think they are mezzable.  If not, they are easy to tank mezz.  Once they are dead, a slightly less-gimp mob spawns and you kill it.  The hardest part of dreso is the clear up there.  It isn't really that hard, just extremely boring.  There are some mininamed fiends that have an AE that requires RGC to cure, but it isn't a very bad AE.<br />
<br />
Jiva - Probably the hardest one, but still easy.  A lot of adds will spawn while you are fighting Jiva.  Just mezz them or they'll start AEing.  If you have several unmezzed mobs running around, the AE's  might add up enough to where they are actually a threat.  Sort of like a mini-rathe.<br />
<br />
These are extremely easy, and any guild that is capable of killing mith marr and all the other prerequisite flags should hvae no trouble with them.  GL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Papa G</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks guys, I also heard they were easier than BoT towers which have been farmed many times, but always nice to hear if any of them have something special to be aware of.<br />
