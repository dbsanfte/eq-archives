<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dornin23</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok i am lvl 46 and about to start some of the steps to get my epic.  what steps do i have to do iin one sitting and what ones can i do seperate from others. i know things have to be done in order but if i finish the test of wisdom or might can i stop there or do i have to continue immediatley with the next test. i would like to know so i can let my gyuildies know when i recruit them to help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ogrym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">don't have to do anything in one sitting, nothing is no rent.  Do em whenever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Michael J. Kaspar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You can do the first few parts, up to and including the Shield of Falsehood, in one afternoon.  The toughest parts will be avoiding killer sharks and tracking a spirit.  Both of these may require a touch of assistance.<br />
<br />
After that, work at your own pace.  Eventually you will end up at Kirn, and that will require a fair amount of power (3 good groups) and a few hours to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would also work on collecting the 6 pages from the CoM while the area is still really good experience for you.  5 of the pages are very very common and drop off random mobs, the 6th page (student's log) drops only from the Spectral Courier and does not drop every time.  Some folks have an easy time getting their Student's log, for some people it takes days, so definitely go while you can get into a good exp group and rake in the exp, random loot (wu's stick, GJBS etc) and epic bits!<br />
<br />
Also, while you're hanging out in CoM, watch for any raid groups that come in to bag the reavers.  There's a chance they may have no need for Ghiosk books and would let you loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Anos |phattie|</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">what gloriana said except also ... go to every fear raid that u can for the tear...<br />
<br />
u can do the first part up to dire just about solo...take a melee and porter just to expedite traveling etc...<br />
<br />
then dire u can do with just a couple peeps..cleric tank...slower  (56-60) dire can be single pulled at 55 i do believe...then u are up to Kirn (3grps at least and couple hrs at least barring a wipeout)<br />
<br />
Neh is just like a reaver...bout 50% harder is all...rak is all about mages (at least 2) clerics (at least2) and positioning<br />
<br />
thing is tho for rak and neh and kirn...sounds real ez but getting everyone to CoM/Hole tends to be a pain in arse for most people...expect to have to work a lil to get these raids going...people dont just drop everything and rush to ej or tox <br />
<br />
GL tho...well worth the work and wait</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yes. I agree with Gloriana too. <br />
<br />
Exp in CoM. While there collect the six reports and pick up an Icon of the Scale. <br />
<br />
If a raid comes through get the books off Ghiosk if you can. They often rot.<br />
<br />
After you have the six reports and the icon, start the quest. You can do all through test of wisdom solo in about 3 or 4 hours.<br />
<br />
This is exactly the way I did it. In this way I did all through the shield in one day. The next day I went and killed black dire with a friend. Then went and got the boots and turned in the reports and the Ghiosk books all at once.<br />
<br />
This leaves you with one trip to Fear, one to the Hole, and one last one to finish up in CoM.<br />
<br />
Saves alot of running around.</div></div><hr />
