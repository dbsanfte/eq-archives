<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">picked up a JBB last nigh for 18k . life altering is all i can say. reflecting today upon my actions last night . i did in 3 hours what was taking me 3-4 nights of playing to complete.<br />
<br />
atfirst i was a lil shakey on it . i think i just was a lil over excited and took on a giant wiht no pet . i would have got him but i got a add and died . was not impressed with the jbb at that point . then i head to Burning Woods. it all changed. i made a pet , full buffed it and HP point buffed myself only with chloroplast and my Ikky regen BP.  fight begins with a slow and a haste on the pet . pet does damage to about 90-95% . at that point i unload with the jbb . only catching aggro on the last cast or so. so while im fighitng whatever im regening health . canna up the mana from the slow and im set to go again . i was moving so fast the only thing i was wiating on was my pet to regen . notihng a lil chloroplast couldnt correct though.<br />
<br />
so thats it . 3+ hours playing only sitting to med a few times a hour instead of after 1-2 kills.<br />
<br />
its lived up to the hype. 4 yellows last night and dinged 49 ( new spells yay) .  is there a better soloer now that i have this ?  if so my hat is off to them , cause they have to freaking own .</div></div><hr />

&quot;Frequent use of a JBB will give you a rash.&quot;<br />

Personally, I'd get some cream for that, because I still use mine ;)</div></div><hr />

Any Iksar worth his/her scales has long ago understood that the JBB is only placed in the game so that the weaker races can have some means to defend themself.<br />

Weaker shmeaker.  Go sit on your tail. ;)<br />
<br />
I love reading these posts. :D  <br />
Bloodgills in LOIO, Burning Woods, and OOT Seafuries are wonderful spots for you now.  Go forth and conquer!<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">cool , well while im at it . got any other tips ? strats?<br />
<br />
right now land Slow and Sick puppy  for about 5-10% then unless with just the JBB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jagara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">get a horse to go with that JBB and hunt outdoors - youll find you can slow and DoT the mobs and never need to break to med</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Vortigern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I have found it quite easy to pull with slow, sick pet on target..then melee with hard hitting 2 handed weapon, casting JBB the whole fight.  You can effectively channel through most mob hits at least 80% of the time, and in between JBB shots can get some nice weapon blows in.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Ok, well Im level 48, and got my JBB at 45, 12k and still paying off the debt. I need to get some levels, Im getting bored with EQ (Ack!!!) and need someplace i can get 51 fast. I was in LoIO, but pulling them out of the water was a bitch, and it just wasn't worth it. Is burning Woods good? Seafuries got too many hps and give like no exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Echo Caverns is awesome in the mid-40s all the way up to 51 if you want to stay there that long. Slow the mob, let the pet eat on it and go to work with the JBB. Non-stop killing. I can't remember how the level 44 pet did there, but the level 49 pet can tank any mobs on the side leading to the deep except for the taskmaster and fireclaw. Well, the pet can tank them too, but you'll have to lay down some serious dottage. An alternative is to tank for the pet, but you gotta work on that defense skill anyway, if you haven't maxxed it out yet. The loot sux in echo, but the experience is great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Talamay Crystalspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">there's much better places for exp than seafuries now.  but when i was 51-53, i did em almost exclusively.  only took a couple weeks.  and i made a &lt;expletive&gt;-load of money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">burning woods is awesome<br />
<br />
i tried the blood gills last night and died from a add . plus it was just too much to swim all the way out and pull them back . they are good experience , but i can move fast in burning woods . i was there at 48 so i know you will be ok .  i come in from DL and walk straight . once i get out of the mountains i walk right and there is a lil monumant of a iskar . i found that is a awesome place . the adds are pretty easy to avoid and if you get in trouble you can outrun anything there and itll just stop chasing you eventualy . now that i hit 49 i make a left when i come in . seems there is tougher things there . some of them make me have to heal my pet a few times or to kite it for a while . good XP though. BW is the best solo area fo my level i have yet to find . i can move none stop and somehting to kill is only a few steps away . i just stay in external view so i can watch aroound me really easy and avoid the adds . plus its just plain cool to watch myself at work :D<br />
<br />
<br />
i would avoid the shardwurms though . nothing worse then walking through DL and have gore aggro you . my faction already saved me once when gore was camping the tunnel that leads into DL . there was about 40 bodies there. mine wasnt one of them ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Largus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">CoM is easy with JBB as well and the exp modifier will help you exp a ton. I am still there at 55 (not as good as 54 and below but always empty and I can kill as fast as I want). Not much on the loot but great for the exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">what?<br />
<br />
since when does CoM have a XP bonus ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">since a long time, isnt is 12% bonus?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">City of Mist is my favorite zone. It's an outdoor city dungeon. That means 1) it does have an exp bonus. 2) can bind melee's there 3)sow! =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Got a JBB at 45, I then did a level a day till I hit 50 on bloodgills (bout 4-5 hours a day).  Exp on those is insane.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is not true.  If you use JBB too much, you go blind.  Thank goodness for the braille keyboard!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Hello?<br />
<br />
Why the heck are you pulling goblins OUT of the water?<br />
<br />
YOU have EB spell and the puppy doesn't breathe, why ever get dry? It's not like you're gonna drown. The worst that'll happen is you'll mess up a pull.<br />
<br />
Hint: put your back up against something to reduce interrupts..works everywhere.<br />
<br />
Edit:once you master this you can still get nice exp in Kedge (exp bonus +water bonus +indoor bonus) at entrance..but your JBB won't work so well--poor dependant types</div></div><hr />
