<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been considering the fact that SoE made a level requirement to BoT and wondered where this will end?<br />
<br />
Currently I'm in a moderately successful &quot;family style&quot; guild, only Rallos Zek for EP access with around 70% of guild Sol Ro flagged.<br />
<br />
Given that on our server only 3 guilds are in Time and 2 getting close to Time and another guild about the stage we are at (with massively bigger numbers but thats another story :) ) there that means that a large proportion of this expansion is available to possibly &lt;20% (max) of the player base.<br />
<br />
I do think there needs to be some barriers to allow progression but can people see some of these boss mobs being de-tuned in the future to allow more people to see these zones PoE, PoF etc.<br />
<br />
Not 100% sure where I am trying to get to here, just wondering if crucible visitors see something on the above lines happening in the future?<br />
<br />
Personally given our guild numbers and a lot of casual players I'm pretty proud of where we are, I think it would suck for say EP access to be given because you managed to ding 65 - anyone with half a brain and high play time can get to 65 in &lt;3 months now. We just had a 55 cleric apply to our guild who has only been playing since Dec 15th last year (less than a month :) ). <br />
<br />
The idea of reducing the difficulty of some of the flag mobs may get more people up a step, just how difficult are the EP's anyway for your &quot;average&quot; mid guild level shaman (eg 5400 hps &amp; 1100ac raid buffed, FT7, 54aa - I'm assuming i'm in there somewhere)<br />
<br />
Comments/thoughts on reducing flag mobs difficulty, level requirement on certain planes etc - not looking for a flame war :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hail,<br />
<br />
I'm non-elemental.  Missing Bert, TZ, RZtW, KoS &amp; Saryn, one of the HoH Trials and MM.  There is an active pickup raiding movement on E. Marr though, so with the exception of RZ &amp; MM, I could conceivably be EP flagged if I put enough effort into it, and maybe get a few tag-along raids with some friends in EP guilds doing backflagging stuff.<br />
<br />
I don't think the events should be de-tuned.  From my limited understanding, several of these EP access mobs have already been detuned at least once.<br />
<br />
I DO think they should continue the alternate entry non-progression path though.  Make some more single-groupable hard 'trials' like in PoJ or quests like the exp. flag for Tactics.  That would let some of us non-uber (but dedicated) players see the EP if we work at it hard enough.<br />
<br />
If they are going to open the gates any further though, they can't do it by level in my opinion.  Letting anyone 65 get into Sol Ro would be a mistake (&amp; wreck the zone).  But MAYBE setting an AA threshold for entry would work.  Hail an NPC and he sees you have 200+ aa's.  Bingo, you can now exp in Sol Ro.  300 aa's and you can go to EP without flags.  500 to get into time.  <br />
<br />
I think there are 7 guilds on E. Marr in the EP now, with 4 of them in Time.  It is already getting crowded up there from what my friends are telling me, and I doubt any of those who 'earned' their way up through flagging will want them being opened up to the masses the way they did to HoHa, BoT, CoD, etc.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I like tactics. The quest for access can be time consuming, and killing the MB on a open raid is even tougher. The quality of people in tactics over those in bot is a big plus.</div></div><hr />

&quot;You can please some of the people most of the time, and Most of the people some of the time.  You cant please all of the people all of the time.<br />
<br />
There is always 2 sides and you cant remove something that alot of people enjoying doing.  I can defend the flagging system by saying that you get alot less morons to  deal with in the zones you worked hard to get into to.  Risk/reward is what its all about IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">As a whole I don't think anything needs to be done to make flagging easier or to alow some other way to access the content. As far as the sentiment that I pay so I should be able to access everything I'd just have to ask why your still playing. Going all the way back to kurnark there has been restricted zones that took work to get into. How that has been handled has changed over time but the concept has always been there. With out of order flagging and 15% access flagging isn't too bad and alows more flexability than any of the other previous solutions.<br />
<br />
I do how ever think that some of the particular mobs in the path do need some tuning. For example grummus and behemoth seem a bit hard for being first tier bosses compaired to other mobs. Bert and saryrn seem to be more annoying than they are worth in general just because the events take too long. Vallon zek on the hand is stupidly easy especially given the quality of some of his peices of loot and has actually made him a pretty big problem for us flagging since he's so hard to catch up. <br />
<br />
Some of the drops could use some tuning too and just in general there's far too damm many melee masks that drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">As someone who is not in an uber guild, I hate the PoP flagging system.    <br />
<br />
The concept I don't hate so much, but the implementation.   It's kinda neat to have a ladder to climb and see where your guild stands... but at the same time it's virtually a sure thing tons (most) people will never see past the very beginning.<br />
<br />
I'm not really talking about loot here... I'm just talking about content access.   If all of a sudden my guild could walk into Time with no effort at all... that doesn't mean we're gonna clear Time and get phat lewt... we'd get our asses kicked big time most likely.  (Of course I have no idea how hard time actually is, but I'm going to assume if we can't kill Grummus yet, we're not gonna clear out PoT).<br />
<br />
The alternate quests was a great idea.   The level opening... I didn't like that so much... all of my main characters did the PoJ quests to open up PoV/PoS and it felt good.   None of my characters has done the BoT/HoH quests at this point... no need since I'm not advancing further in the near future (and probably &quot;never&quot;).<br />
<br />
Openling it to levels, or AAs, just means that everyone will go where the loot and/or xp is.    Depending on the values, it could turn any zone into a &quot;BoT&quot; zone where /ooc is laughable, and every corner is a camp.<br />
<br />
Opening it to alternate quests doesn't seem like a bad idea at all to me.   The Tactics quest isn't &quot;hard&quot; but it is time consuming (unless you get really lucky).    Quests similiar than this, and even with more work involved, seems like a great idea to me for opening up the content... open more zones to more people.<br />
<br />
Again... I'm talking about opening zones, content.    If you're capable of killing a mob for the loot, then you deserve it... but simply gaining access to a zone does not make you all of a sudden able to kill all the phat lewt mobs.<br />
<br />
I hate artificial restrictions on what I can access because I don't join an uberguild.<br />
<br />
I'm 65, almost 100 AAs, all my spells, half my top LDON gear... I play a lot... I'm pretty well off... I do not consider myself a casual player... but I'm not in an uberguild so half of PoP I'll almost never see.<br />
<br />
Take a look at the Shissy temple in the Grey.   A good range of raid targets in there from the wimpy Rhag's up to the Emp.   My guild may or may not be able to kill the various mobs... we never find them up, so we won't know ... but we can all go farm emp keys, and we can move around the zone.<br />
<br />
The zone isn't blocked to us... some of the mobs may be beyond us...  but that's up to us to find them and try them.   We don't have to jump through a very hard hoop just to get into the zone.    How far we progress IN the zone depends on us... how strong and skilled we become.   But we have access to the zone.<br />
<br />
Of course, even as I make that point... another point can be made that competition is so high in Shissy because everyone can get in... the mobs in there (I've personally done some of them with other guilds in the past) are not really that hard... and there's lots of good loot.<br />
<br />
Perhaps one big fear the ubers have is that the upper PoP zones will become even more contested than they are now.<br />
<br />
Probably true... but this is a problem with the game... competition for raid targets is horrible.   There's so much my guild could try... but if it's not up on our raid nights, we simply don't get the chance.<br />
<br />
LDON was the perfect chance to offer multiple levels of difficulty to allow guilds of whatever thier strength to grow stronger and progress... but instead it's uberguild only.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shamad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Tell me one thing, do you think you would really care if they opened, say, Veeshan's Peak to the masses? I know most ubers wouldnt, nor should they. Who's to say they can't open up the elementals (well, make it somewhat easier/reasonable for non-ubers to get in) in a few expansions time?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I think a challenging quest for the highest zone is healthy.  Veeshan's Peak is an enjoyable, if time consuming,  quest.  Sleeper's Tomb ok.  Vex Thal ... iffy but ok.<br />
<br />
Elemental flagging is like filling out tax forms for twenty complete strangers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grimdreg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It is absolutely gay that people who pay the same amount of money I do can only see a fraction of the content out there, simply because they don't have 60+ friends to grind out the progression.<br />
<br />
<br />
Damn straight!  I see the flag system as a capitulation to people who got all bent out of shape over people tampering with their raids.  While I do think this is a valid concern, I think there were better ways to approach it.  I pay my 12.95 x 2 a month (not to mention my initial investment of $120 x 2 or however much EQ and all the expansions cost these days) but I'll probably never get to even set foot in the elemental planes because I don't have the time to raid in a serious way anymore.  <br />
<br />
I think Luclin system of keys with in zones as seen in the Ssra and Seru encounters might have been a better way to approach it.  (Obviously obtaining the keys would have to less ridiculous than the Luclin quests) The odd thing is that this is implmented in several pop zones anyway (IE the Bertoxxulous, Terris Thule, Saryrn?) but the flag system persists.  The result is that 99% of the player base will never see the elemental planes and 80% of the player base will never see anything past tactics, simply because they don't have the time to dedicate to a higher end guild, and that just aint right.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see access to planes continued in the following manner:<br />
<br />
65 = Tactics <br />
65 50AA = Sol Ro Tower<br />
65 100AA = Elementals<br />
<br />
Or a quested keying system as mentioned by Sariss.<br />
<br />
Time would be completely offlimits to those without flags.  I think that would keep some of the griefers and &quot;riff raff&quot; out of the higher tier planes but still allow good players who are unguilded or in small guilds a chance to taste the Elemental planes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">At this point, I could no longer care if EPs were opened up to the public.  They are already getting crowded and there is really nothing left there to do for most EP vets.  I doubt they are ever going to open them up to the public like they did for BoT and PoV, but I would still not be surprised if more and more people started getting access to the EPs once the new expansion has been out for a while.  PoP trivialized old content, and now practically any guild with 50+ members can kill AoW or work on emp/vt keys.  I wouldn't be surprised if, a few months from now, we can say the same thing about EPs and maybe even time.</div></div><hr />

Well of course you would, you don't have access and can't get it without putting in a lot of work you are not willing to take on.<br />
<br />
And here in the jaded been there done that who gives a **** corner is our resident time farmer Jinheim who will give access to anyone because he is finished.<br />
<br />
So, two different viewpoints. Now lets try the viewpoint of someone who achieved elemental access about 3 weeks ago. Keep it as it is. A lot of people bought Donkey Kong and never saw the last level. Name a game that you buy that you know you will get to the end of without having to put anything more than time into.....<br />
<br />
It's not easy to get into the elementals, but it shouldn't be.<br />
<br />
That's the middle ground viewpoint.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I could not agree more.  I fail to see why I shouldn't be allowed into plane of fire to get the phat solo root/rot exp like every other EP shaman, it's not like they're beyond my capabilities if all they require are the standard tools (granted ornate root pants would be nice).<br />
<br />
Afraid the masses may have access to your country club exp zones or mess up your raid? Hail, instanced zones- not like this is a new concept anymore.  This is reason #1 I will jump ship as soon as WoW is out.  Nothing pisses me off more than paying for content I can't see, and we're not talking about 1 zone/expansion a la VP, ST or VT- we're talking 75%+ of the expansion is off limits for no logical or technical reason.<br />

Its not that I don't WANT to put the work into it, its that I CANT put the work into it in the manner in which one needs to in order to get into Elemental Planes.  When the raiding guilds on Saryrn are doing their thing, I'm either working or sleeping.  My playtime comes in a four hour block between 11pm pst and 3am pst.  I play 5 or 6 days a week and if I had a more regular schedule would probably be in a raiding guild.  So its not a question of time or willingness to put in effort, its a question of scheduling.  There in is the problem with the Donkey Kong analogy.  You don't need 75 other people to beat Donkey Kong, you just need yourself and the time to get there.  I've got the time, I just don't have the 75 people.  I think a lot of other players are in a similar boat.  They love EQ, they put a lot of time and effort in to their playing, they just can't put said effort in between 6 and midnight on weekdays, and thats a lame reason to keep somebody away from content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I don't like the Donkey Kong analogy, because this is a multiplayer game.

<br />
This is the way it has been since Kunark.<br />
<br />
For Kunark, VP, Seb and HS still require a key.<br />
<br />
Velious changed thing in that you were required to do a heavy amount of faction work to see some zones.  But Sleepers Tomb required a key (yea, its simple to get, but still required) and still does.<br />
<br />
In luclin, yea you can travel around Ssra and do mobs with varying progression, but you dont dont have access to the entire zone.  You want in Emps chambers and access to not only his loot, but access to Vex Thal later on then you do the quest.  Vex Thal is a time sink of a zone, but in the days of over crowded elementals, it provides a outlet for a guild to get a few pieces of elem quality loot (AHR Drops) while getting a good quantity of gear for recruits who are normally way undergeared for elementals.  In addition you have Seru whos access required a time sink as bad as VT (but thats been changed) and Inner Acaylia which was never finished but required a time sink to key for.<br />
<br />
Now lets see: PoJ, PoI, PoN, PoD, BoT, PoV, PoS, HoH, CoD, Tactics vs PoA, PoF, PoE, PoW, PoT, SolRo.  Hmm 10 zones open or requireing a simple key quest vs 6 that are off limits (2 of those are not xp zones, and I excluded the B zones as those are raid only).  Hardly 75% of the expansion is not available to you.  With Earth, Fire, and Water you have different issues.  Three zones which can barely handle a full raid in them w/o lagging out, much less a Raid + multiple xp groups.  On top of that you have many hard coded timed events (Corinav in water for example) where lag will cause you to fail the event or triggered spawns that can be screwed up by XP groups.  <br />
<br />
You want access to Plane of Fire?  Join a guild who is elementals or progressing there.  Dont want to do that?  Fine, but understand that while you are getting AA #x while xp'ing, there are people who are not xping but raiding and learning these encounters so they can have access to these zones.  Not able to do that because of timing?  Sorry but EQ is not fair.  If it was then many timezone issues would have been fixed a long time ago (Vex Thal/PoE spawn on server reset for example).<br />
<br />

And Grimdreg, The War Council on Saryrn routinely raids from 8pm pst to early morning hours (doing targets that dont require a full raid). Most of our recent AHR kills have happened after 3am pst.</div></div><hr />

Oh, my point? ;)  I think it'd be an excellent idea to open up the EPs only via alternate access quests, and to either allow Aid Grimel to be done with alternate access flags or to have seperate, lesser-quality results if your flags are alternate access.  It's certainly not the ideal state for the game to be in, just the lesser of two evils - the best available solution after The Great Mistake (PoP).</div></div><hr />

If everyone could have the same top of the line gear, this game would have been done a few years ago.  To be honest, the time that people put in to get PoT flagged, they deserve the best gear.  Now with the release of LDoN, people who aren't capable of being in Raiding guilds can grind out ADV pts for some pretty fine gear.  Most of the high end stuff is equal or better than Ornate armor IMO.<br />
<br />
People who want to see EPs and PoT usually find a way.  The rest just complain and find excuses why they can't do it.    <br />

Actually, people are complaining that they will never get a shot at Time gear.  Yes, the gear creates a gap, but you need those HPs to survive PoT even though they trivialize non-PoP encounters.  How does LDoN not bring landmass to the game?!?!  I don't remember those dungeons from previous expansions.  You should salute LDoN for giving people hope of having nice gear instead of only shooting for gimp Velious quest gear.  This actually shrinks the gap that PoP created, and you don't need a guild of 70 Elite players to get it, and you can do it at your leisure instead of coordinating with the rest of a guild.<br />
<br />
I can't disagree with Aid Grimel....that is an outrageous amount of money and time for 1 uber item.  But then again, the prayer shawl isn't that easy either.  The tradeskills have been fubar'd for awhile in EQ.  I doubt you will ever see Raiding guilds with crafted armor again.  They keep enough nice stuff out there to keep some people interested in them, but it's not really a large focus of the game anymore.<br />

And opening Time by number of AA points you have is stupid.  You don't get exp in Plane of Time.  You raid.  Plain and simple.  There is no place to sit with a group just to kill stuff.

I like flags.  I came from a guild that didn't have flags, while it was frustrating to not be able to go to the places my friends were, I dealt with it.  I knew what I had to do to get there.  It's a reward.  Elemental planes aren't for the casual gamer.  The mobs hit harder, faster, they have more HP.  Folks without at least decent gear will have a lot of troubles keeping themselves alive against these mobs.  And I'm not saying casual gamers are bad players.  Not at all.  However, gear does make a difference.  That extra hp might keep you alive.  The typical BoT group or even Tactics group that I have run across would not be able to handle Ele's.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like I give a rat's ass for 'has been designed' and 'follow set procedures'.  Sorry, but those are exactly the sorts of phrases that I actively try to avoid outside of my day-to-day work life.  I prefer phrases incorporating words like 'flexible', and 'alternative' (and even 'fun'), particularly in the context of discussing a video game.  But then maybe that is why we disagree. &lt;smile&gt;<br />
<br />
My point was this: because virtually everything in EQ is a function of overall time spent, it is appropriate that really high AA (read: REALLY large time investment) players get to exploit the same content available to raiders with a similarly large time investment.<br />
<br />
Yes, I am familiar with the usual arguments against this.<br />
<br />
The most common one is that the quality of one's usual grouping experience will be diminished because of the typically low skill level of those players that are allowed alternative entry.  While this assertion may have some merit for places like BoT, it seems distinctly less tenable when you are considering those players with 200+ AAs.<br />
<br />
The other argument generally devolves down to something along the lines of 'I had to do it, and so should you'. These arguments are usually buttressed with frequent references to 'the vision', or 'the designers', or maybe even a circa '99 quote from Brad or some other equally ephemeral bit of trivia.<br />
<br />
In fact, this is really just an example of cognitive dissonance in action.  You spent a lot of time and effort obtaining your flags, and you feel that effort and investment represents something that you should be able to exploit without interference.<br />
<br />
I don't even disagree with you on that point: you did put in the time, and you should be able to reap the rewards.  Those that did not, should not. Fine.<br />
<br />
However, guys like Xarrasis ALSO put in that time and effort; they too should be able to fully enjoy the fruits of their labors...<br />

I don't think anybody here is suggesting that Elemental Planes should simply be opened to any yahoo who can make their way to the zone in in Plane of Tranquility.

From a design standpoint, they should have made the gear less phenomenal and tuned the encounters according to that.  Honestly I'm not quite sure what they were thinking; I look at PoP &amp; the items, think about the dev team, and in my mind's eye see a bunch of kids sitting around a table with milk and cookies, wide-eyed, spittle flying, yelling animatedly at each other about how much 250 or 300 hp on an item would 'pwn'.  I wouldn't care so much if it didn't intrude on my gameplay; if they stuck to the EPs &amp; time - but as I'm currently doing certain quests (Chardok quests, at the moment) on my shadowknight, I see these vastly overpowered god-mode characters ganking the mobs I need either for twinks or out of the sheer boredom of not raiding (o n0z!!1) and the enjoyment of screwing others.<br />

Aye but it's a fix that you have to pay for, and not a good fix at that because it further trivializes older (aka. good) content.  I went over this.<br />
The day they open elementals will be the day most people I know delete EQ off their computers.<br />
Due to the 'doods' training and such?  Got news for ya, I see just as many doods in EP/Time guilds as I do in lower guilds, just as many 65 doods as I do 1-50 doods, etc.. they transcend levels and guilds, they're everywhere like an infestation :(  Opening the EPs might raise the population, but wouldn't lower the general maturity level aside from the effect overcrowding has on any zone.<br />
And opening Time by number of AA points you have is stupid. You don't get exp in Plane of Time. You raid<br />
Good point, I still like the idea of having alt or AA amount access to the EPs though, mostly only because I want to do the Grimel quest.  I'm closing in on 1750 without any chance in hell of being EP flagged currently as the system stands.  I can't do my hatred for soe justice in the written word concerning PoP or that quest in particular.</div></div><hr />

I don't know what your server is about, but on mine people with hundreds of AA train the heck out of places like BoT since they are open. The number of AA or level you have don't show the least what you as a player are capable of.<br />
Since the day I had access to zones like Tactix, SolRo and Elementals, I stay away from zones like BoT as if the devil would reign there. Overcrowding, multiple trains, insults in open channels, etc. No thanks.<br />

When I zone into PoE, I usually know that I can group up with like 99% of the people there, cause they all know how to play their class well and got the gear and spells to handle the mobs. I do that in BoT I am on the way to a CR.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, backflagging for new people, or for people who had to stop playing for a while out of numerous reasons, is a pain. But I am still trying to figure out a way to make this easier for guilds to do without ruining the challange for everyone else.<br />

The fact is, if you can't get there with the regular flagging progression, odds are high that there is no way you're strong enough to get elemental armor.<br />
Elementals, aside from exp-grinding, are raid-oriented, not single groupable.<br />
<br />
Thus entering the elemental planes without flagging a moot point.<br />
<br />
I agree however that there are too many flags to get. They should suppress hedge, HoH trials and the whole Saryrn pre flag event as necessary flags. These are just not necessary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Volfie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">I agree that getting 400 or 500 plus aa is investing a great deal of time just like someone in a raiding guild invested a bunch of time to go through the flagging process. That is why I don't have 500 aa, 400 aa, or even 300. When people with massive aa were out exp grinding I was raiding, dying &quot; losing exp&quot;, and helping other in my guild get flagged. I am not trying to trivialize the time they invested to gain what they have. However, granting them access to the zones I spent tons of non exp time gathering flags for does trivialize the time I spent not getting exp to help get my guild and myself flagged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">Basically, what it comes down to for those of us without EP access and who will never see EP access is a sense of injustice.<br />
<br />
In order for me to get EP flagged, I would have to leave my guild.  That means abandoning the people I have played with for 1+ years and are my friends because we all have different schedules and don't have the ability to bring enough people on at one time to do the raids required for access.<br />
<br />
Those few times we have had enough people on to try something, we always find an &quot;uber&quot; guild already with EP access backflagging their new recruits, effectively blocking us from trying.<br />
<br />
In effect, I'm being forced to not have fun in order to get access to more game content.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, but the system should be changed.<br />
<br />
They should set up an alternate quest method of entry for each elemental plane and Sol Ro. This quest should be VERY difficult and rather long, but should also be able to be done by a group or raid force of less than 20.  Set up the quest so that in order to complete it, you have to be strong enough to survive in the elemental plane you're trying to get access to in the first place.  That eliminates the &quot;you're not strong enough to make it here&quot; argument.<br />
<br />
In order to prevent backflagging, a Guild Flag system should be instituted.  So long as you are a member of that guild, you have every guild flag that guild has managed to obtain.  So, an EP-level guild would have their people automatically flagged for EP without having to backflag them.  When you leave the guild, you lose all the guild flags.<br />
<br />
This should have been done anyway, since you can &quot;raid in&quot; people without flags in the first place.  The &quot;raid in&quot; function would be removed in place of this system.<br />
<br />
In addition, they should limit the flag access of a single person so that, as they gain access to a higher tier plane, they LOSE access to a lower one.  Each keyed/flagged zone would be assigned a priority based on its difficulty rating, and every player would have a set number of flags for access.  If you get a flag for a higher zone and you're at your limit, you lose access to the lowest priority zone for which you are flagged.  This keeps people/guilds in places where they are supposed to be.  And since you can't &quot;raid in&quot; people who lost access, it forces uber guilds to go through the pain of rekeying for a lower level zone, with inferior drops compared to what they can get elsewhere.<br />
<br />
You would, however, be able to redo the quest to get your key or flag back, but such a flag would be classified as &quot;corpsed,&quot; meaning it only lasts for seven days.  And you can only have 3 &quot;corpsed&quot; keys/flags active at any one time.<br />
<br />
I think these changes would give anyone with the skill an honest shot at reaching EPs, and also fix some of the nagging crowding problems at the raid points.</div></div><hr />

(1) Non guilded people could inadvertedly ruin events.<br />
(2) Non guilded people maybe would struggle with the mobs there.<br />
(3) Non guilded people could get  in the way of raids.<br />
(4) There are really not many grouping spots apart from Fire and Earth. Earth I guess people could spread out. Fire there are limited areas to exp really in my opinion. <br />
I don't see the use of it being open to everyone with the arrival of LDoN. They are raiding zones, the exp is very good admittedly but its damn right boring exp. I can see one use however and that is to obtain tradeskill items.<br />
I don't believe in any leetest argument as I have been both sides of the fence, where I have been both guilded and non guilded and I just consider the elementals as raid infrastructure. Its kinda as much use to the non guilded as ssra is to the nonguilded.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Rubitt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">i dont think the flaging system for pop is a bad thing, however i also dont think they should implement another such system in god or beyond.  zones such as sleepers, vt and time are restricted because of the limited spawns and to keep an over flow of end game gear from happening.  i think ldon and hopeful god will provide adaquate high end content so that pop can stay the way they are.  with the amount of content available in the game a small percentage of elite zones is not a bad thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Padraic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">If it's the same Xarrasis(there's like 3 similar spellings) he's in my guild and he will see end game content, I can promise ya ;)<br />
<br />
Fairly certain he's talking about Xarrais.  Monk in Lords of Misrule.  Guild probably has 7 total people in it.  Maybe 10.<br />
<br />
Fairly nice guy.  Has almost 0 concept of raiding though.  He spent alot of time in Ct until pop.  Then PoV back cave until Ldon.  And Now nothing but ldons.<br />
<br />
Last I checked, his monk was number 1 on the leader boards.  His 2 box shaman, which I cant for the life of me remember the name of, is number 4 or 5.  I think 300 wins or more.  I remember him having over 350 aa's a long, long time ago.  And his guildmate did must inform me that Xar maxed his aa's several months ago.<br />
<br />
Ok, nothing to do with the original post.  But, i thought I'd clear that up<br />
<br />
Ok, to clear it up.  Just checked the leaderboard.  Shaman's name is Roman.<br />

And Xar has 497 wins</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">Basically, what it comes down to for those of us without EP access and who will never see EP access is a sense of injustice.<br />
<br />
In order for me to get EP flagged, I would have to leave my guild.  That means abandoning the people I have played with for 1+ years and are my friends because we all have different schedules and don't have the ability to bring enough people on at one time to do the raids required for access.<br />
In effect, I'm being forced to not have fun in order to get access to more game content.<br />
<br />
Well, what about Luclin content then? Did you feel injustice there too? Cause for the guild you describe 2 zones are completely nonsense. One you cannot reach without doing the badass quest (VT), other is a pure raid zone (Ssra).<br />
What about LDoN raids? Injustice because you never see the raid zones?<br />
<br />
If it's just about seeing the zone (not fighting any mobs) there are some ways to do that.<br />
<br />
So long<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Namurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">All expansions have had raid zones, the difference is they had zones for the rest of us too, along with good storylines.  Furthermore the fun quests have been available to everyone.  Further-furthermore, the top-end raid gear didn't make one character as powerful as a group of 'peasants'.<br />
[EPs are] kinda as much use to the non guilded as ssra is to the nonguilded<br />
Except that tradeskill components don't drop in Ssra, Ssra is bad exp compared to other places, not amazingly good exp like EPs, and you don't need access to Ssra to do one of the only good quests the game has seen since the Velious rings &amp; shawls.

&quot;The same is true for NToV, yet strangely enough what prevents me from going there is my gear, not some artificial and arbitrary game design decision.&quot;<br />

So basically...you are pissed simply because there are flags?  You wouldn't utilize these zones anyhow.<br />

Flags were put in place to keep the idiots away from messing up certain encounters.  I would be pissed to find some newb group went into PoW and killed GoD cause they thought he was a named for loot.</div></div><hr />

It's called reward for the amount of effort you have to put in to get there. You just want the amazing xp. Well, go get flagged. Seriously it's not a case of the haves vs have nots any longer.

Erm, Naturd, I quoted you. If you don't want the &quot;amazing xp like EPs&quot; then don't write a post about it. It's a shame that you cannot complete the TS quest but it's not that there is not a way.... Its just that you don't want to do it that way.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">1/ if you cant do ntov, what would you do in EP beside asking for rezzes? Thus why would access EP be a matter to you,<br />
<br />
2/ instancied zone was fully implemented one year after POp, with LDON. Time instance is teh buggy suck.<br />
<br />
1- I'd be using the same spells as the EP shamans to root/rot myself some nice exp.  The EP zones aren't strictly raid zones unlike NToV, they're country club exp zones as well.  <br />
<br />
And what does it matter if casuals can't handle the zone and end up begging for a res?  See, I heard this same argument about opening tiers 2 and 3 to the unwashed masses, how we couldn't handle it, how we'd get killed, blah blah blah.  Well, after a week of adaptation those zones are candy.  I think the real reason is you don't want to share your precious sandbox with the other paying children.  Especially if said children could get the same exp and tradeskill drops as you- you'd lose some of the uniqueness that is necessary to keep your insecurity at bay.<br />
<br />
Funny we never heard this bitching back in Velious about casuals having access to NToV, nor did you frequently hear casuals bitching about not having access to Sleeper's Tomb- there was plenty for them in the rest of the expansion and it wasn't like they were being denied access to both loot AND good exp zones, adding insult to injury.<br />
<br />
2- Why should it be my problem that SOE's suck developers can't handle the design and development issues with instancing?  Instance the raid content at the very least, but open the rest of the zone to everyone.<br />
<br />
Go go artificial separation of paying customers in an online, multiplayer  game!  One can only hope future competition does not make the same mistake.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">Pop was very much a raiding expansion and unfortunately it trivialized a lot of old zones with the heightened level cap and only allowed a limited number of pretty dull exp zones in its place. This I disliked about pop. And I was one of the few people that did not see the objection to tier 2 places being opened up and actually saw it as a logical idea to the amusement of my guildies.<br />
<br />
I do,  however,  feel that with Ldon that there is no reason to open up Elementals. Elementals is very much a raiding infrastructure, you are not going to be able to take a single group into say poair and get amazing exp and tradeskill items. Its just not viable.<br />
Opening the elementals to the mass would completely disregard and be a laugh in the face of the guild progression system.<br />
Its feelings of greed that compel you to believe you should get access to the elementals without taking the route everyone else has taken to get there. <br />
If you continue to feel strongly about this then I suggest you send some feedback to SoE as I think complaining on a messageboard where there are a large majority that would be opposed to opening up of the elementals would be detrimental to your single minded appeal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">Opening Tier 4 is a bad idea.  Its bad for the same reasons that opening Tactics would have been bad.  Zones with complex events NEED to be restricted.  There is just no analogue outside of PoP that I can think of ... no way to relate how much of a mess random xp groups that cannot do the bosses and do not care about the zone would cause in Earth, or Air.  The ring events in Earth, in particular, are a buggy mess even without non-guild groups.  For example, there is a means by which the Mudwalker ring can be interfered with to produce duplicate trigger mobs (this isn't good, no matter what it sounds like).  The record I've counted up is 17, but that's probably not an all-time high.  This renders important parts of the zone flatly unusable for the people who earned their shot there.  Non-raiding players get (perhaps rightly) testy when EP folks show up and expunge &quot;their&quot; content out of boredom or whatever.  It does not make things right or balance the scales to give others a way to &quot;turn off&quot; EP events.<br />
<br />
Besides, its not impossible to get here.  I know on at least 3 servers, non-guild &quot;raid organizations&quot; have, for all intents and purposes, led pickup raids all the way to Tier 4.  Somewhere, they've even dropped Fennin and Xegony.  I'm sure someone can post and say what server that is.  Not on that server?  Get it started yourself.  Pickup Grummus and Aerin'Dar are both pretty easy to host.  Make a name for yourself and you'll get regular attenders.  Work with the &quot;uber&quot; guilds that you hate, instead of bashing them, and they'll send you backflaggers, recruits, and alts.  If you can lead a pickup Behemoth, you can lead anything up till Rallos, and that's been done enough to prove that it can happen.<br />
<br />
But let's say you don't want to raid - you just want it given to you.  I understand that, even if I don't agree with it.  I know a lot of people who want &quot;open Elementals&quot; - especially on a shaman board - want the solo xp we talk about in Fire.  For XP per time, you can probably do almost as well in Tactics, or Storms, or ...  Its good in Fire, but its not THAT good.  But the loot, you say?  Short of raiding, the Elemental armor (as in, like Ornate, only not) is just impossible.  The easiest mob that I can think of with Elemental drops is probably Pyronis, who hits for 1800 or so with a 1k AE + stun.  Comparisons to NToV just fail - this is like AoW, with the biggest of Luclin's AEs strapped on for measure.  But the crafted stuff is a different story, and isn't bad.  Its also possible to get.  I *am* flagged through Fire, but I've gotten as many components from the bazaar as from the planes.  I manufacture and resell gear at profit.  A friend of mine, a 250 fletcher, has made over a half million net profit on Earth bows ... having never seen an Elemental plane in his life.<br />
<br />
Aid Grimel, on the other hand, IS unfair.  But, really, there are ways to get those flags.  They take time and dedication.  If you have the dedication to get 220+ in all 7 skills (btw, you want 250 in a couple of the hard ones.... *cough* tailoring *cough*), then you have the time and dedication to get the flags, either through independant raids that you organize, or that others organize, or through coordination and cooperation with other guilds that can get you there.  Both parts of the quest are hard, but the item is (more or less) worth it.  I didn't get the item for free when I got my Fire flag - I had to put in the sweat and tears to get the skills (and fail the accursed Fire silk combine more times than I can count); it would be no more fair for a tradeskiller to get the item for free without the flags.<br />
<br />
I'm sure that someone is going to call me names for this post, and deride me as an elitist pig who wants to oppress the masses, or something along those lines, despite the fact that I provide information, strategy, advice, and often even spoilers to folks who aren't as far along as I am.  I don't really care if I'm thought of as elitist or not ... but I don't think I am.  I just think that, in a game where success - whether for good or ill - is measured in the bounty of hundreds of days played, that reserving a EP-sized slice of that content for those players who do have the commitment, time, and organization to pull off raiding on the PoP scale is not too much to ask.  If you dislike the vision of the game that you have at the moment, then think what a miscarriage of &quot;fairness&quot; it would be if all that planning, effort, and time provided no real benefit at all; it would be a very brief, very boring, very same-ness-filled game, and the casual player wouldn't like it for long any more than the raider would.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Namurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">Aid Grimel, on the other hand, IS unfair<br />
That's probably my biggest pet peeve.  I'm not big into exp grinding, and I don't like raiding.  I'm not sure I'm 'entitled to' earrings as good as the final Aid Grimel rewards without EP flags, but then IMO all PoP gear is overpowered and created too big a gear gap - a fact SOE admits, judging by LDoN gear.  I just want to do a damn freakin' quest, something like the Coldain rings &amp; shawls, something fun.  Mostly though, I think that in appealing to the masses with PoP &amp; beyond, they've brought in too many powergamers for the good of EQ.  I'd be happy with a 75/75 earring with say, mp4 or what-not with the TS requirements of Grimel but not the flag req's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>lfclan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">The above poster stole my thunder =(<br />
<br />
On ARo we have a group of people in lower end guilds and non guiled that get together in a channel and do flag mobs 4 to 5 times a week.<br />
<br />
Instead of complaining about how unfair it all is and wanting Eplanes access given to u why not work inside of the system?<br />
<br />
The system is set to insure that the 01noobie doesnt ruin events for those that have progressed to the end game. <br />
<br />
Eq has always been a game of progression... you earn the right to go from one zone to the next by putting in the time to level up. You earn the better loots by killing more and more difficult mobs as you learn tactics and skills.<br />
<br />
1 Newbie zone outside your city<br />
2 Zone attached to noobie zone<br />
3 LOIO<br />
4 Fmountains<br />
5 OT<br />
6 Dlands<br />
7 Karnors<br />
8 Seb<br />
<br />
Just a example of the progression back in Kunark days...These examples can be seen in every expansion.... In POP its the same thing.... everyone is maxed level pretty much or well on thier way to getting it so they institued flaggs as the new way of earning the progression to move to the next zone is all.<br />
<br />
Flags are as much a road block as leveling up was back in the day.... Sit around in Seb as a 54 shaman for hours on in OR you can stop bitching and whining about how unfair it all is cause theres a 60 shaman in every group there and MAKE YOUR OWN GROUP!!! Its the same thing as the flag problem.... You can cry and whine and bitch about how unfair it all is or you can get over it, and put together the tons of people that want the flaggs but have no guild that can get them it.<br />
<br />
Put in the work for gods sake people... There are tons of spoilers out there u can spend 30 mins looking up a flagg mob, talk to others in higher guilds and get the specifics down and then advertise to kill it.... Once u kill a flag mob you will be suprised how your little group of killers will get recruits coming to help you... AOR (our servers kill group of unguilded or lower level guilded) Has developed a life of its own... any time of day u can join the channel and theres 100 to 200 peeps there....<br />
<br />
Guess the point of my long winded post is to stop whining about your supposed fate and just be proactive and get your flags... You say u want a quest that will allow alt access... This is the same concept just DO IT and stop bitching about it for god sake</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>jyphant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">Opening up the eps would be disastrous to certian events and mobs that most guilds can do for flags or loot.  I have been with my guild for 2 to 3 years at that time we would wipe to kunark dragons.  I only play 4 days at maximum and 4 to 5 hours a day max.  I have all flags and have seen all of plane of time and our guild has killed quarm.  So its not a matter of having time its having a good guild thats got some drive to get you there.  Also i only have 125 aa.  If you only have 2 hours per day then do ldon and get very good gear verses little risk.  Dont ruin the game that so many of us have worked to get to by opening them up to anyone with aas.  IF i didnt raid i could have 500 aa easy.  Thats not the point.  ITs getting in guild sticking with them and making progression.  ITs not as hard as some of you make it out to be.</div></div><hr />

People keep pointing out that EQ is a social game and they are very much in the right.  It is those social connections along with player ability and organization that get you into more difficult zones.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u79"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p79">So the biggest issue with opening zones like Tactics or elementals is that casuals may blow triggered events out of ignorance or malice?  I go back to my previous point, how is it the fault of the casual player that the suck devs at SOE don't know how to instance content properly?  This is a design issue that can and should be handled with code, not some artificial flagging system to further divide the playerbase.<br />
<br />
I laugh when I see people telling casuals to &quot;get to work&quot; on getting flagged and to &quot;put their time in&quot;- see, I don't play this as work, I play it to escape work.  Time is also something casuals have in short supply, hence we rarely raid.  Six hours of raiding a night, 5+ days a week is not possible.  Either open the zones, or deduct the cost of all the zones I'm barred from entry from my monthly fee, subsidizing the privileged in EQ is quite lame.<br />

Again, I look forward to seeing what future competitors to SOE do to get around the enormous divide between ubers (~10% of playerbase at most) and the 90% who pay to keep the servers up.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u80"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p80">Do you guys know what it means to be in a hardcore riding guild and get access to such content? You have to play EQ at least on 5 days for 5hours each day. You get about 2 new items in a month. From time to time (every 2-3 month) you have to do reflags from the scratch. Reflagging means on week killing stuff that won't give you any upgrade.<br />
<br />
If you are willing to do this then join your local EP guild (or guild getting close to killing RZ) and earn your access. If you don't / wont to burn so much time then enjoy LDoN. The equipment you can get with LDoN adventures are close to emp / vt drops. Put some augments into these items and you have EP quality.<br />
<br />
If there would be a quest (or better a trial) for EP access then it should be some like this: Take 3 groups, enter room. Now you have 15min to kill Vindi, Statue, AoW for 6x access to EP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. You don't pay your monthly fee for access to any zones. You pay it for them to keep the infrstructure (i.e. server, network access, a little bit of customer support) up and running. BUT you payed a 1 time fee for PoP, that's the thing you can complain about. SoE wasn't upward honest to the player base on the content, how it is structured, what that means for the casual player like you. In the end, would you be happy to still be lvl 60, missing some serious good AA skills, some nice loot especially small group of people can get (like BoT tower for example)? If you answer that with yes, you probably have a cause to be angry.<br />
2. Yes, it sometimes feels like work. But you sound like the people who buy an adventure game and then use hacks or walkthroughs because you 'don't want to invest the time' to get it to the end.<br />

Again, I look forward to seeing what future competitors to SOE do to get around the enormous divide between ubers (~10% of playerbase at most) and the 90% who pay to keep the servers up.<br />
<br />
Elemental planes nowadays isn't for the 10% ubers anymore. There are far more people flagged for that by now. And yes, I am very interested how other companies gonna handle this too.<br />

Certainly don't have any numbers to back it up, but even 10% seemed high to me when I read that post.  My own guesstimate would be from 2-3%.<br />
some nice loot especially small group of people can get (like BoT tower for example)<br />
Stuff is a joke compared to EP/Time stuff.  Again, if EP/Time people stayed only in the zones where you folk claim they 'need' this gear (how'd they succeed in these zones before they got this gear?), it wouldn't be an issue, but when they come gank old content out of boredom or greed it becomes our business.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u83"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p83">lol, if you think that only 2-3% are elemental flagged you really are a delusional newbie :(<br />
<br />
Seriously, getting into tier 4 is not hard anymore, all it takes is dedication.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u84"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p84">In EQ, content is a reward for time investment and I have no problem with this.  I'm in a very small guild and through open raids on BB Raiders I am only 4 fights from SolRo (TT, Bert, MM, and RZ).  Now granted, open raids on BB are painfull, but you get flagged.  I haven't worked on my flags since November and honestly, if I never see EP I won't be too disapointed at all.  I've been playing since June 99 and I can tell you, the gear might be better, the mobs cooler, but in the end it's the same damned thing.  You fight, you learn tactics, you farm.  If it's that big a priority in your life, you too will be EP flagged, it's far from impossible and in fact, there are many unguilded folks in EP these days.  I don't know why folks get so bent out of sorts for &quot;/cry I don't have EP access and all the ubers are having a feild day&quot;.  Flag access was a stupid idea in the first place, it destroyed many family guilds, but the damage is done, live with it, move on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">I'm guessing there are 7+ EP enabled guilds on most servers now.  IMO, that indicates that getting flagged is not that terribly difficult.  I know on Tribunal there is at least one EP enabled guild that has no mandatory raid attendance and is about as much a 'family' guild as you can be and still play at the high end.<br />
<br />
EP access isn't like VT or ST or even NToV.  Those zones were only seen by the top 2 or 3 guilds in the relevant expansions.  Based on the fairly large number of players with access to EPs I'd say the requirements aren't too terribly far from where they should be.<br />
<br />
At best I'd say they should have perhaps put in some side quests for EP access similar to the BoT access quest/fights but of course much more difficult.  A Quest requiring the typical time sink gathering of rare drops/mobs with a single group and ending with a small raid encounter that'd require 18-36 people to win.<br />
<br />
This would kill two birds with one stone to some extent.  EP/Time enabled guilds would have a streamlined path to backflag their recruits instead of having to take the whole guild back to catch mobs up that are typically dead within a few hours of spawning... The recruit would have the burden on them to get the first part of certain quests done and then a small crew from said guild could go trigger the final fights and get the flags needed, NO LOOT.<br />
<br />
Using AAs as a way to enter EPs is a horrid idea.  As pointed out already, those of us that are in EP/Time guilds spent a LOT of time getting there at the expense of xp/AAs.  I COULD have full AAs and probably fully augmented all my gear with 1150 augments, except for one little problem... I spend at least 50% of my time in EQ raiding.  Instead I have about 100 wins total whereas I know non-raid guild friend that have 2-3 times as many wins and a whole lot more AA than I do, because that's what they do every day.<br />
<br />
Most likely, just as with every other expansion, when GoD comes out there will be ways to advance your char that will somewhat trivialize many PoP encounters, thus you'll see even more ppl flooding the EPs and even PoTime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u86"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p86">Wildaar, BoT sucked before it was opened.<br />
<br />
It had the same caliber of campjacking, training jerks that it has today.  It's the nature of the zone.  <br />
<br />
That's a totally bogus argument in my view.<br />
<br />
Bull. Take it from someone who was there before AND after the opening.<br />
<br />
Before the opening, on a crowded day, there would be 5 or 6 groups, divided among the four lower wings at one or 2 per wing and the upper courtyard. Accidents would happen because accidents do, but they would be rare because the density of people would be much less. <br />
<br />
Nowaday, 5 or 6 groups is for the downtime hours only. Usually, it's twice that, scabbling, bitching, stealing MOBs and training each other out. And zoning in is a gamble because at least twice a day, some moron who logged in south top would have trained half the sand wing to the zone-in, including a couple of the see invis MOBs.<br />
<br />
And you know what? I still agree that opening the tier 2 zones, as welll as BoT and HoH, was the thing to do when they did it. That was before they revised the exp range and there was three quarter of the server population between 61 and 65 crammed into Innovation, Nightmare, Disease, Justice, Valor and Storm. And THAT was even more insane.<br />
<br />
Problem is you can't do that with Drunder (way too many scripted **** goes on there, especially with the RZ event running every few day). HoHb is just the dullest zone in the game, really. And, while everyone think they want to be in the elementals planes (heh man.. doncha know that where all that bitching elemental armor drop?), the reality of it is that 3-quarters of the zones are event areas and only the mini-bosses and the bosses drop anything worth killing for, something you won't do if you can't get there through the system already in place.<br />
<br />
You still want to find a way to open the EPs to more people? Here's what... let them open the zone to anyone insane enough get 4 tradeskills to 250. Because, honestly, only the most deranged tradeskillers are going to get ANYTHING from gaining access to the EPs without killing Saryrn, Bertoxx, MM, Agnaar, SolRo and Rallos Zek first.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, thats not a bad idea.  Or, modify the aid grimmel quest or something.<br />
<br />
Hell, tradeskills are kind of worthless anyway, and with all the upper-end tradeskill drops in EPs, it would give guilds that are already there a way to avoid arduous backflagging requirements, since they could just pass their junk TS drops down to their unflagged buddies.</div></div><hr />

You need EP flags to do that quest in the first place, unfortunately.  If you needed 250 in 4 trades to get in, I'd be flagged :p</div></div><hr />

NToV also doesn't yield armor literally 3-10 times better than anywhere else in the game, creating a huge gap in character power, erecting walls between players in a social game...   <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u90"><b>Fenril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p90">As I said in the poll... Before I join a Time Raid Guild I was in a guild who still can't kill the Behemot.<br />
<br />
Now, I'm in another guild raiding Time, I'm full flaged and I can see why there is flags. I won't ever think about entering PoFire or PoEarth with a group who is stuffed like I was (check &quot;my old stuff&quot; link in my Magelo) just because I'm 65 with 200aa.<br />
<br />
Mobs in EPs hit HARD, FAST and mitigate slow heavily. I'm able to solo in PoFire (like many others ;)) but one mistake and no matter what is my stuffs, my aas, it's a direct TL bind point naked.<br />
<br />
What's funny, it's until you are flaged for EPs, you won't see the point and you won't trust those who say this ;).<br />
<br />
You can do a simple test. Built a group of level 30-35, give them common gear (not uber twink gears, COMMON) and go hunt in Sebilis with this group. The result is exactly the same (I choose Sebilis because you need a key and try to do the quest with the same group WITHOUT any outside help ;)).<br />
<br />
The other reason I don't want to see EPs open to public, it's because the day it happens, these zones will be unplayable for everyone like BoT is (only ?) a pain actually. Too many people, LOT of lag, train, train, train and noobs all around the place who don't know how to play without ruining other's pleasure or just don't giving a crap, ruining rings event as it actually happens in HoH by killing a trigger &quot;by accident&quot; and mostly ignorance.<br />

There was this one day when i was minding my own business in PoE and this like guildess pack o' noobs zoned in and started asking what mobs dropped Elemental molds....<br />

Tartantabigolenastyaligator (forgot his name, cant ya tell?) was up and I like suggested that he *might* drop phat loots cuz he was a named,, and we all know that names in BoT drop ornate.. RIIIGHT?<br />
<br />
So like, 2 hours later (for those not elemental... you can get to him in 15 mintues with only a few mobs to clear) he sends me a tell and says that they finally got to the alligator dude... Apparently a few wipes along the way when those roaming dillos decided to say HI while they were engaging wall mobs... and one fruitless attempt at single grouping a Dusty Warder(trigger mob for event.. sorta like single grouping the HoH trial trigger mobs.. like WHY?)  <br />
<br />
Anyways... dude says &quot;Pre-grazts us our first mold!!!!&quot;<br />

Few mintues later, they wanted to know if I had a rogue to drag them...<br />

So in other words, it's a non-issue having subpar gear since even with the best gear, if you screw up you'll be dead anyways.  Sounds like a reason to open the ep's right there.<br />
<br />
What's funny, it's until you are flaged for EPs, you won't see the point and you won't trust those who say this ;)..<br />
Probably because all we heard prior to opening PoV/PoS/BoT was how we had no chance of surviving there and now those zones are candy.  And why shouldn't we be allowed to at least try and fail?<br />

Let me get this straight- we (casuals) should be relegated to zones that in your own words are unplayable, just so you get country club zones to yourself?  Huh?  I maintain that instancing these zones would solve at least this argument from those in the zones to raid and those who just want to exp, explore, etc... in zones they paid for but never get to see.<br />
<br />
Bah... I'm a &quot;ubber&quot; who want to keep his playfield for himself because I'm selfish ;).<br />
At least you're honest, unlike the majority of EP flagged people posting in this thread who simply want to preserve their zone exclusivity and expansion hegemony.<br />

So was I Crageal.  That's why I said it.  BoT was full of leapfrogging, camp-jacking, training d00ds who spammed the zone with OOC wars - before it was opened.  I don't go to BoT much now, but when I do, I don't really see any difference.  If anything it's pretty quiet these days because of LDON.<br />
<br />
All these same arguments were used against opening Valor, Decay and BoT and they were wrong then too.  &quot;They couldn't handle it&quot; &quot;mobs are too hard&quot; &quot;its not like prior zones&quot; &quot;they'll mess up events&quot; blah blah.  <br />
<br />
To me, the answer isn't just opening Elementals up fully, but in greatly reducing the number of flagging requirements.  <br />
<br />
They went way too far. <br />
<br />
I have zero sympathy for any complaining &quot;but I worked so hard...&quot;  It's a game, effort should be rewarded but if it was that miserable then it should be modified because that represents poor design.  And while effort should be rewarded, there are some folks for whom time has no value and you can't design a game reward system around them.  <br />

Things I spent huge amounts of time doing nearly 5 years ago have been removed from the game.  What does that mean?  Nothing.</div></div><hr />

It's the cluephone ringing.<br />
Hello?<br />
Yes, one second please.<br />
It's for you.<br />
<br />
The EP zones aren't strictly raid zones unlike NToV, they're country club exp zones as well.  <br />
- Earth: small zone, half it's keyed (aka you have to kill a gian gator). Rest of it has FOUR pyramids, each is a ring event. One solid group on each wall can clear mobs between keyed area and zone in. Wich leaves you zone interior. Another two solid groups can clear the inner trash easy. Wich leaves you pretty much with an empty zone. As soon as you touch triggers for events, you risk bugging the event. So you can have what? 5-6 groups XPing max. Compare it to Plane of Valor (a PoP experience zone), in the wastelands alone, you can stuff 5-6 groups easy.<br />
<br />
- Fire: divided into 3 parts. First part has utter crap XP. Around 2% AA per kill (read: Plane of Valor). First castle area is very nice, it can hold however barely 2 groups. Second field is filled with named minis (read: non XP mobs). Hell to get there, you have two raid mobs staring at you at bridge. Second field doesn't have many XP spots either. Too many roamers not to mention the roaming named that quads for 3000 and has an AE of 2000. Then finally there is castle 2 wich has maybe 1-2 solid spots, one is usually taken up by kiters, the other is nice, again if you can sneak in. <br />
<br />
- Air is strictly raid, water I never XPed in it really. But it has it's own named, not to mention the bottom floor is patrolled by an Avatar of War on steroids.<br />
<br />
Elemental zones are SMALL, they are not made to support as many groups as BoT or PoV. Not to mention you can screw up raid event triggers and train or be trained with mobs that quad 3k and AE for 2k.<br />
<br />
And what does it matter if casuals can't handle the zone and end up begging for a res? <br />
- No one gives a damn about rezzes. But I sure would pissed if my raid was trained with a mini in fire because casual Peter is a clueless dumbass. Same time I would be pissed to go to EarthA finding out that many rings are messed up because some people have no clue what's a triggered raid event is. Not to mention I would be pissed when waiting on a GM to warp the mobs in Earth B so we can enter the triggered area because mobs warped and finding out that this GM is too busy ressing idiots in Plane of Air because they keep getting slaughtered by the roaming recluse upon zoning in.<br />
<br />
Well, after a week of adaptation those zones are candy.  <br />
- Newsflash. BoT is barely harder than PoV. Does any casual players XP on sharks that triple 1000+ and mitigate partially?<br />
<br />
I think the real reason is you don't want to share your precious sandbox with the other paying children.  Especially if said children could get the same exp and tradeskill drops as you- you'd lose some of the uniqueness that is necessary to keep your insecurity at bay.<br />
- Oh sweet, the I pay the same amount excuse. Ok ... let's see ...<br />
<br />
I despise tradeskills.<br />
I hate tradeskills.<br />
I have NO TIME to do tradeskills.<br />
<br />
But since I pay 13$ a month, give me all the benefits/items that go with tradeskills. Afterall, I pay my 13$ a month.<br />
<br />
Funny we never heard this bitching back in Velious about casuals having access to NToV, nor did you frequently hear casuals bitching about not having access to Sleeper's Tomb- there was plenty for them in the rest of the expansion and it wasn't like they were being denied access to both loot AND good exp zones, adding insult to injury.<br />
- Do you buy a CD player when you really need a DVD player? If you are not stupid, I hope not. Do you complain that a &quot;raid&quot; expansion is actually *gasp* for raiding guilds? You do. Pretty sure SOE said a zillion times that PoP was aimed at RAID GUILDS. <br />
<br />
Why should it be my problem that SOE's suck developers can't handle the design and development issues with instancing?  Instance the raid content at the very least, but open the rest of the zone to everyone.<br />
- THE RAID CONTENT IS IN THE GODDAMN ZONE. Even if it's instanced, the raid would still be subject to the insane lag in elemental zones (small zones, crammed on same server). Ask anyone if they liked the Plane of Fire LagFest 2003(c) when there were more than one guild in zone. Not to mention, instanced or not, clueless idiots will train/grief the raids. If they fully instance zones, they will have to redesign the entire expansion, wich is much $$, and they won't do it. <br />
<br />
If people bought a raid expansion while not raiding are going to complain about it, they are stupid. VT, ST, VP where all raid zones in non raid expansion. No one EVER complained. Now you have a RAID EXPANSION and people complain about raid content. Go figure.</div></div><hr />

If the zones are too small to handle multiple groups, use technology to solve the issue and instance them.  Your raid has its copy of the zone to itself where you don't have to worry about trains, events being blown, etc...  Why am I having to come up with solutions to an easy problem?  And what does it matter if the zone is useful or not? I have yet to zone into Plane of Torment, but I'm happy that I at least have the opportunity. I'll ignore the &quot;get a clue&quot; insult for now as I'd prefer to keep this an open discussion with the free flow of opinions and information.<br />

No, because there aren't any exp mobs of that difficulty (that I'm aware of at least) in open zones to which we have access.  I'd welcome the opportunity to at least try, however, even if it means a quick death. Why does someone having the opportunity to do something challenging like this bother you so much?<br />
<br />
<br />
I think the real reason is you don't want to share your precious sandbox with the other paying children.  Especially if said children could get the same exp and tradeskill drops as you- you'd lose some of the uniqueness that is necessary to keep your insecurity at bay.<br />
- Oh sweet, the I pay the same amount excuse. Ok ... let's see ...<br />
<br />
I despise tradeskills.<br />
I hate tradeskills.<br />
I have NO TIME to do tradeskills.<br />
<br />
But since I pay 13$ a month, give me all the benefits/items that go with tradeskills. Afterall, I pay my 13$ a month.<br />
<br />
Your tradeskill analogy isn't valid because there's nothing inherently in the game design that prevents any player from maxing tradeskills.  Certain items, yes, require one or more components from locked areas but getting to 250 in a tradeskill is something any player can do in short chunks of time and does not require a large number of other people to progress.  I said this in another thread but it bears repeating: I am not asking for equality of outcome, only equality of opportunity.<br />
<br />
<br />
Funny we never heard this bitching back in Velious about casuals having access to NToV, nor did you frequently hear casuals bitching about not having access to Sleeper's Tomb- there was plenty for them in the rest of the expansion and it wasn't like they were being denied access to both loot AND good exp zones, adding insult to injury.<br />
- Do you buy a CD player when you really need a DVD player? If you are not stupid, I hope not. Do you complain that a &quot;raid&quot; expansion is actually *gasp* for raiding guilds? You do. Pretty sure SOE said a zillion times that PoP was aimed at RAID GUILDS. <br />
<br />
Cite please.  Please also link me the part about where only 6/19 (or thereabouts) of the zones would be accessible at launch to a casual player unless they are willing to bail on their family guild (if even guilded at all) and devote the large, contiguous time investment into joining a high end raiding guild just to zone into the majority of the expansion.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Why should it be my problem that SOE's suck developers can't handle the design and development issues with instancing?  Instance the raid content at the very least, but open the rest of the zone to everyone.<br />
- THE RAID CONTENT IS IN THE GODDAMN ZONE. Even if it's instanced, the raid would still be subject to the insane lag in elemental zones (small zones, crammed on same server). Ask anyone if they liked the Plane of Fire LagFest 2003(c) when there were more than one guild in zone. Not to mention, instanced or not, clueless idiots will train/grief the raids. If they fully instance zones, they will have to redesign the entire expansion, wich is much $$, and they won't do it. <br />
<br />
Don't blame me or any other casual for SOE's bad design.  I don't blame those wanting to restrict the PoP flagged zones, I blame SOE and their poor design decisions that artificially separates the paying playerbase.  Don't think this is a big deal?  Look how worked up those who want to continue to see the zones restricted are getting.  Go back and look at the myriad of threads bemoaning the imminent opening of PoV/BoT et. al.<br />
<br />
<br />
If people bought a raid expansion while not raiding are going to complain about it, they are stupid. VT, ST, VP where all raid zones in non raid expansion. No one EVER complained. Now you have a RAID EXPANSION and people complain about raid content. Go figure.<br />
The reason they didn't complain about VP, ST, VT (excellent examples, you prove my point) is because they were one (1) zone out of an entire expansion, not 13 out of 19.  See the difference?  Don't mistake justified indignation over a bait and switch with stupidity.  <br />
<br />
I'll leave you with this, a link to EQ's official page on PoP:<br />
http://everquest.station.sony.com/power/<br />
<br />
To save time, here's their summary of PoP:<br />
Cross over to realms of ancient power, where legendary creatures guard long-hidden secrets. EverQuest: The Planes of Power will take you to places not meant for mortal eyes, reveal treasures and challenges mightier than any before, and bring you face to face with the gods themselves. Prepare yourself, the Planes await!  <br />
Odd, I don't see the term &quot;raid&quot; anywhere.  You don't see why people might be upset when they purchase this expansion and don't get to see the majority of the content?<br />

If the zones are too small to handle multiple groups, use technology to solve the issue and instance them.  <br />
- Who's gonna pay for that? You? Me? PoP is history. SOE is not going to invest a lot more money in it. For them it's GoD and the next raid expansion the priority. Did Intel recall his zillions of Pentium Pros because they frankly sucked? No, they developped the Pentium 2. Did  AMD recall and fix the craptastic K5? No, they developped the K6. Did Intel recall and fix the first Pentium 4s? No they optimized it with the Nortwood core. <br />
<br />
Your raid has its copy of the zone to itself where you don't have to worry about trains, events being blown, etc...  Why am I having to come up with solutions to an easy problem? <br />
- Sorry you are a bit late. Game companies already came up with instancing, take a look at AO. If you want elemental level instancing, try LDoN hard missions. And remember the above paragraph, PoP is a dead end product. SOE will not going to invest a lot in it.<br />
<br />
Instancing- see point above.  Poor design is not a valid reason to deny content to a paying customer base.<br />
- So you are saying the craftskills are a poor design because they are denining content to many people who (1) Don't like it. (2) Don't have the time. Or how about simple levels? Your artifical barrier argument doesn't fly. Every level based game has already artifical barriers. Every RPG game has progression (some fast, some very slow), if you want to reach the top, you need to put the time in it AND you need to like doing it. I am not saying PoP flags are great, they suck, but no one was complaining about VT, ST, NToV, VP. Considering those were regular expansions. SOE did something for raid folks and everyone who doesn't want nor can't reach the end complains. I paid 30 bucks for LoY and the only thing I got out was a spell and charm slot. The extra bank space I don't even use. Do you hear me complaining? No. I did product research, I knew that LoY was geared to casual 55ish crowd. If I hate LoY I am the only person to be blamed for buying it. If you didn't do enough product research and bought PoP and you don't like it, you are the only one to be blamed for it. I am sorry.<br />
<br />
Your tradeskill analogy isn't valid because there's nothing inherently in the game design that prevents any player from maxing tradeskills.  <br />
- What is in the game design than prevents you from reaching the Elemental Planes? Nothing. You need two simple things: being able to press buttons on your keyboard in a certain sequence (aka playing EQ) AND you need time, lots of time. If you have those 2 prerequisites all you need is to join an elemental guild or one that is aspiring to get there. My tradeskill analogy is perfectly valid. I have NO DESIRE nor I have any TIME to invest in it. Thus I am not entitled to reaping the benefits and this prevents me from seeing and enjoying some game content. The same way, if you have no desire to join a raid guild OR you have no time, then you are not entitled to be in Elemental Planes. It's how the game is designed. It's how single player RPG/Hack and slash/Pseudo RPG games work. If you don't want to spend time or you don't like hack slash to the extreme you won't get to Hell difficulty in Diablo 2. Simple as that. <br />
<br />
I said this in another thread but it bears repeating: I am not asking for equality of outcome, only equality of opportunity.<br />
- Will you willing to spend 3-4 months doing ONE single quest that will require about 300+ hours to get to Elemental Planes? If yes, I will support people who want SOE to add quests that would allow one to get to elemental planes, keep in mind, that quest will be the mother of all timesinks in any game. My guild spent nearly 5 months getting there, with countless manhours in trying encounter after encounter, wipe after wipe, kill after kill. If you are willing to put in those hours to get there, I will be first inline to support that petition.<br />

- No I will not dig out the countless interviews about SOE PR guys touting the expansion as God's gift to raiders, how people love the idea of killing Gods and how this expansion is filled with them.  Not to mention the countless people in beta telling nothing more than raid this raid that. <br />

No flames are necessary when adults discuss something of intense mutual interest to them both, though the debate may get heated at times.  Personal attacks are the last resort of a losing argument as it were.  With that out of the way, let me once again respond...<br />
<br />

<br />
Well, we're paying for it for one.  SOE is sadly mistaken if they believe I'm going to continue to subsidize expansions for content I cannot see as a casual player.  But your point is well taken, SOE rarely addresses issues until an embarassing amount of time has elapsed (c.f. melee fixes), if even then.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
LDON, sadly, is about the only thing left if you don't want to raid or spend your time in non-challenging zones outside of PoP, leaving you with basically PoV, BoT, HoH and if you're fortunate, Tactics.  But you're right, the fix for the poor design of PoP will more likely come from a competitor's product than SOE.<br />
<br />
<br />
Instancing- see point above.  Poor design is not a valid reason to deny content to a paying customer base.<br />
- So you are saying the craftskills are a poor design because they are denining content to many people who (1) Don't like it. (2) Don't have the time. Or how about simple levels?

Every RPG game has progression (some fast, some very slow), if you want to reach the top, you need to put the time in it AND you need to like doing it.<br />
It's not the time that's the issue, it's contiguous time, time in large, continuous blocks.  For the sake of argument, let's say it takes an average PoP raider 200 hours to gain access to tier 4.  I can spend 200 hours over the course a year but I'm still not going to have access to tier 4.  That's the barrier I'm referring to.  Tradeskills, exping, LDON adventures, many quests, etc... let you do these things in reasonable chunks of time.  If you have more time, great- you get more done!  But those with less time will still get there, it'll just take a lot longer.  With PoP, however, I could play my schedule from now until 2008 and still not be there.<br />
<br />
<br />
 I am not saying PoP flags are great, they suck, but no one was complaining about VT, ST, NToV, VP. Considering those were regular expansions.

I am sorry.<br />
<br />
What in LoY is denied you by artificial game barriers?  If you don't use the very poor zones in LoY, that's fine, much like I never use the poorly designed Plane of Torment.  But neither of us is denied access by any game mechanism.  As for product research, in my last post I linked directly to SOE's marketing material regarding PoP.<br />
<br />
More marketing fun from the official PoP web site:<br />
How many new playable zones are you planning to add?<br />
Twenty<br />
<br />
How will I get to the Planes?<br />
The planes will be accessed through numerous portals throughout the existing world.<br />
<br />
Like EverQuest: The Scars of Velious, will I need a level 35 character or above to play the game?<br />
The Plane of Knowledge will be available to players of all levels and will be a source of many new quests, making travel throughout Norrath far more convenient. All other new planar zones will require players to be level 46 or above to enter.<br />
 <br />
This is out of the company's own mouth.  Maybe just a little misleading?<br />
<br />

 <br />
I'm working on the Tactics alt quest now.  It's a pain, I'm not happy about it, but at least I feel it's attainable.  Log on, check track on the druid I keep camped in PoS, kill any Diaku Raiders that are up.  See, it lets a casual gain access to content they paid for without having to deguild, change their playstyle and most importantly: change their lifestyle to advance in a game.<br />
<br />

<br />
Odd that their marketing material neglects to mention this if it's such a great selling point for PoP.  Be honest: it was bait and switch.  If they had announced prior to launch that all you'd get out of the gate were 6/20 zones unless you join a fulltime raid guild, who'd have bought it?  And of those 6 zones, two are primarily zone connectors and the other four are higher level versions of LOIO/FM/OT/DL.  Not exactly the best way to market a product.<br />
<br />
You listening, SOE?  Provide alternate means of entry at the very least for Sol Ro and PoFire that are single groupable.  Or wait until your competition goes after the casual market that is paying your bills.<br />
