<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ravenspire R Merquise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Earlier in the week when EQ had it's first patch I downloaded it and played but when I rebooted my computer the next day I found that it kept restarting itself. I then had to go in safe mode to find out what was wrong only to find out that my graphics drivers for my Gforce 3 Ti card had been changed. The only files that I had downloaded onto my system were the EQ files from the night before. I switched them back out and updated my drivers again and went back into EQ and played again through another patch only to find that when I logged on this morning my PC would not even log into Windows unless I again took the graphics drivers out and put the standard ones back in and then once again do a complete reinstall on the new drivers. <br />
<br />
I have since went back to an older driver set and am scaried to even log on the game for fear that my PC will not boot up after I shut it down and there is yet more of the same routine that I have went through for the past two days now. <br />
<br />
Yesterday when I was on I was talking to guildies that were having the same computer problems as I was so I need to know is anyone else having these issues were your computer has been going AWOL in the last two patches? Until I find out more about this I am not going to log onto the game because this is becoming a tiring project every single day. <br />
<br />
Please, if anyone else is having this problem please post on the thread and let me know or send me an e-mail at Ravenspiremerquise@yahoo.com and tell me about it. If this is causing issues with a lot of people we need to talk to SOE because something needs to be done about this problem. <br />
<br />
Thank you for your time, <br />
