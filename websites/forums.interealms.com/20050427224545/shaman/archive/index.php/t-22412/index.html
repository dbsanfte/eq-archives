<br />
Just about to hit 51, and was wondering the thoughts on AAs for shammies.  Do you start at 51 with a fair amount to AA or none til 65?<br />
<br />
Second, I'm just guessing here, but the first three AAs would go to Regen? THEN Run3?  Just checking.<br />
<br />
Thanks, love this site!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd do run 3 first if you do a lot of dungeons.  I'm personally going to skip regen3 and get inate metab 3 to eat less food when on my horsie! :-)  With Stoicism I just don't see where regen 3 is a MUST have anymore :-)<br />
<br />
I plan on getting run3 once I hit 51 using 50% to aa and then going 90% reg exp for the most part.<br />
<br />
bleah - sig out of date -  I'm 50 now :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jhaiisiin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Something to consider is that each AA uses the same experience value as level 51 does.  AA's are therefore far easier to acquire at higher levels when the mobs are worth more raw xp per kill.  When you start is up to you.  Some people put a trickle into AA's from the get go (10 or 20%), while others wait at least until 60.  Personnally, I started the trickle at 55, and I killed it as I was getting close to 56 (REALLY wanted that group regen, darnit).  It will seem to go a lot faster and easier if you're at least 60 or higher though, which is what's been pounded into me by my friends.  The final decision is really personal preference, and what you want your shaman to do.  If you feel you're lacking in a given area, and an AA will fix that, then by all means do so.  If you're good as you are, then consider leaving off until you can bust out an AA per hour like the 60+ toons can in places like HoH or PoF.<br />
<br />
Hope I wasn't too confusing.</div></div><hr />

That helps.  I just dinged 51 one last night.  I continued to hunt, and I noticed after I hit 51 that the eps were coming slow.  Seems like doing AA's now will be a pain in the ass.  Someone told me, going 50 to 60, takes like the same amount of time to do 1 to 50.  I think if I do them, it will late 50's.  It would be cool to get the regen, run and title, but it looks like this new grind is going to take awhile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I found that LDoN got awful for me around 52-54 up through 58-59, so during LDoN's I'd go full AA, which at least moved faster than LDoN exp.  Between that and an occasional AA Exp day I got 6 and the title mid to late 50's, went full exp to 62 and have pounded out 9 aa's in a very very short time since.  59 itself is a stinky awful level and you don't want to do aa's during it at all since it drags.  60 flies though, which is the good news.<br />
<br />
59 is where you could stop and grind out the title Mental clarity 3 and cann 5, but as it was soooooo slow anyway I waited until I hit the last level I had most of the pells for (62) and am now getting aa's and supposed to be sacing money but found that I'm addicted to bazaar bargain hunting and equip upgrading.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>sharookan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">at 51 id go to empty places with easy mobs and grind for some AAs. It really makes your leveling more easy.<br />
at 51 each frog in lower guk bottom (frenzy, lord etc) gives you 1-2 % AA exp. Considering how easy you can kill them and how fast they die i made my first 10 AAs there. run3, regen3 and then went for archtype.<br />
<br />
Nothing is worse then a lv 65 shammy with just run/regen3.</div></div><hr />
