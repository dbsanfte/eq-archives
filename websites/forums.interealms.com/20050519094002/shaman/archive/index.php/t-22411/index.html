We are not aware this is any problem, and the situation now is that the bulb is working as intended. If you want us to talk about thinking about discussing the possibility of changing the status of the bulb, please provide us detailed parses about the effects of the bulb (we found it way to powerful, as the ability to see monsters in a distinct advantage to PCs I'm sure you will agree).<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, please provide a detailed list of, say, 10 issues about the bulb that need to be fixed, then another list of anything else we think about asking you for. Oh, and then throw in a nomination for a correspondant. After that we may take a little while, cos there is talk of a major bug that needs fixing -- the fuse blew on our toaster. Also, since we need to make a new expansion to scam you all some more, we have only got 1 week to deal with all the issues around the bulb.&quot;<br />

<br />
No updates are planned as yet to fix the problem, as we are currently busy with the next expansion, which will see an entirely different kind of lightbulb set-up.  New features include:<br />
<br />
- A more power efficient bulb.<br />
- Longer lasting duration.<br />
- Glow in the dark light switch.<br />
- Several new focus effects, including Lampshade of ambience, straw gel, red gel, blue gel. <br />
- AA ability, 'Dimmer'. (requires 60 AA points)<br />
- AA ability, 'Multiple bulbs'. (requires 60 AA points)<br />

The following have already been found on Lucy:<br />
- Ancient bulb of the ancestors.<br />
- Ancient Floodlight of the forgotten.<br />
- Ancient Candle of discontent.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Ashkani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">In and effort to address the unhappiness in the vast majority of the community, as you may know, we held a summit. We invited all the leaders of the major guilds who play under floodlights, and whose names begin with the letter X and end with the letters ZoZ (case sensitive of course as otherwise there would be too many in attendance). The outcome of this summit was that nachos are really tasty *hooray*. <br />
<br />
 It was also found that the perceived problem with light bulbs is actually nothing to do with lightbulbs at all! *hooray!* It seems that doors are opening the wrong way in many cases, and hitting poor people (those with no floodlights) in the head and blinding them! Hence we will be working to fix doors asap. As a gesture of our goodwill, we will immediately stop working on the next expansion which is entitled HaHa (in which we will implement worldwide rooms with no doors *hooray*). <br />
<br />
I personally have not had any problems with lightbulbs, and I am quite familiar with my class and its problems. But rest assured, we are working hard to make you all happy!<br />

See you in game folks!<br />

Since shamans can see well in the day time, it would be unbalanced to allow them a light source to see in the dark.<br />
<br />
And yes all new expansions will be either night time only zones, or zones in unlit dungeons.  We found that no one likes the sun.  But don't worry shamans, you'll still be able to see well in older content when the sun is out.<br />

We also cannot allow them to be any brighter.  This is due to the fact that lightbulbs have switches.  And, switches have been determined to be an extremely powerful tool.  If we &quot;fix&quot; the perceived lightbulb issue, we'll have to give the sun a switch too in order to maintain the lighting advantage the sun already has.<br />

It turns out that light bulbs are not the problem. The way the game is coded, each PC has his/her own light bulb.<br />
For various reasons, the shaman have had a minor complication in that whilst all other classes use a bayonet fitting and have an inherent socket available, shaman actually have a screw fitting and no socket. For this reason we have been trying to screw you in an orifice for the past few expansions. Since this hasn't worked too well, we are now bayonetting you. Once the socket becomes available, we will enlarge it a little more for ya over the course of a few expansions, and see whats noises come back after that.<br />
<br />
Hope that clears things up a little for ya guys!<br />
<br />
See ya in game!!<br />

If you want us to talk about thinking about discussing the possibility of changing the status of the bulb, please provide us detailed parses about the effects of the bulb (we found it way to powerful, as the ability to see monsters in a distinct advantage to PCs I'm sure you will agree).<br />

<br />
Dev &quot;DirectX 9.0b does not support lightblulbs, we have it on good word from Microsoft that DirectX 10 will. Therefore we are ceasing development on all projects (including bug fixes) regarding lighting of all types&quot;  <br />
<br />
Dev &quot;Please note this will in no way affect Rogues and we apologize profusely if any Rogue was negatively affected by this topic, we will however in a prefunctory omage to Rogues provide them with an innate 15% to all damage starting at level 1&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Piwacket</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">We have determined that it is not a problem with the light bulb.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>dmuscat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">We have had to take the light bulb functionality out of the game after a flaw in the manufacturing process was allowing players to smith a new light bulb and resell it to the vendor for 100 times the cost price.<br />
<br />
An additional coding error was allowing players to hand in burnt out bulbs to their tribute master for 10000 points.<br />
<br />
As a result, light bulbs will now no longer be worth anything to a vendor and require a smithing skill of 330 to craft.<br />
<br />
As you all can understand, these changes are necessary to keep balance in the game.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Osmodia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">I've just decoded the Light Bulb key... or Brilliant Forum Flourescence(AKA BFF). Follow me...<br />
<br />
BFF is mathematically written B2F.<br />
B2F is a homonym of &quot;B to F&quot;.<br />
In Light Bulb we change the 'B to F'  making Light Fulb.<br />
Light Fulb is an anagram of Bull Fight.<br />
A Bull Fight is something to Watch.<br />
A watch is a portable Counter.<br />
A Counter is also called a Sink Top.<br />
Sink Top is an anagram for Ink Spot.<br />
An Ink Spot is a Page Blip.<br />
Page Blip is an anagram for Big Apple.<br />
The Big Apple is sononomous with a Tyranny free New York.<br />
If you take the NY out of Tyranny you have Tyran.<br />
Which of course is an anagram for Rytan.<br />
<br />
I don't think I can make it any clearer than that. This proves imperically that Rytan is against BFF and any other Class Enlightenment.<br />

lol well there you have it. The thread is just about done now. Had the obiligatory stop whining post in it. <br />
<br />
and you really think a dev would nerf shaman because of this thread? This thread was mostly in fun. The way for sony eq person to get back at shaman is to make an effect on an item and call it shaman whine or an npc named Enihw Namahs. Something like that. If they were to nerf because of a funny thread than i'm playing the wrong game.</div></div><hr />
