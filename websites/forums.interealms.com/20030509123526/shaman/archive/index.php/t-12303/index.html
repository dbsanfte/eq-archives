<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>pacman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What is the maximum you can extend buffs ??  I have a 15 % buff extending item.  If i get Reinforcement Mastery 50%  would that equal 65 % ??<br />
<br />
meaning 24 secs of Quiescence will be 39.6 secs ??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>njorls2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes, SCR and extended focus buffs will stack, for 65% duration.<br />
<br />
There is only 1 item that extends Quiescence, the Crown of Ambivalence from VT. As far as the time calculation, I always did it by ticks, Qui is 4 tics, 4 * 1.65 = 6.8 ticks, meaning you might get 2 or 3 extra ticks.<br />
<br />
I never tested that out though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Someone told me there was a 50% cap on extension, and that everything past that point was worthless.  Never done any testing to support this though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>njorls2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There's a 50% cap on haste, anything higher than 50% haste is wasted.<br />
<br />
Extended duration doesn't have a known cap, so at SCRM and Coldain 8th shawl buffs will indeed last 70% longer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">currently the longest duration is 70% .. next tuesday that should be patched up to 75% with some of the elemental focus items needing to be &gt; shawl</div></div><hr />
