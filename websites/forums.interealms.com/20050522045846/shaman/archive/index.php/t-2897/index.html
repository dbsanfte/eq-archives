<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Tried putting this in the quest area, but it doesn't seem to be getting much traffic there.<br />
<br />
I may have a chance to do Kirn soon. Guild raid is going down there for another shaman, but we may have enough to do that we would still be down there in 2 hours when Kirn respawns. <br />
<br />
The &quot;normal&quot; progression is to turn in Ghiosk's books, pick up the icon off the floor in COM, and have the spirit send you to find Kirn. I am still missing the student's log from the spectral courier, so I haven't even turned in the booklet yet, and I don't have Ghiosk's books. <br />
<br />
So the question is, will the icon turn-in work with Kirn if I haven't done all the preceding parts of the quest? Will he just not aggro? or what? <br />
<br />
I guess all I'm risking is the icon, which is trivial to pick up, but I don't want to waste my guildmates' time waiting for the respawn, either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes, faction is an issue.  Ghiosk is a fairly substantial hit.  I think the books may be as well.  If you do not have sufficient faction (and every step of the shaman epic is a faction check except the first I think), then the mobs will not work properly.  If you can't get the log, go do the initial turn in a few times, or go kill the two dummies in Rathe and turn in the items to the wandering spirit in WK.  A few of those will get you sufficient faction.  I think warmly is sufficient.<br />

<br />
What Chutoi said.  Ghiosk Books are a big hit.  Twoflower, look me up tonight and I'll show you the best spot to get that darn Student log (stable area).  You got to get your dreamcatcher stick now!<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hi Widda!<br />
<br />
I know the stables pretty well, my wife and I sat in there for 2-3 hours last night, but no courier.  We kept the right side (as you enter) completely cleared and cleared the front left room on the left side as well since the eqshaman.com guide says that's a hotspot for the SC.  I'm planning to try again tonight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hehe,<br />
<br />
Doh!  The right side is the temple area, the left side is the stable.  Looks like you sat in the wrong spot  : P<br />
<br />
Maybe I'll be your lucky charm.  I'll see if I can get a port to EJ and join you there (if I am welcome).  I personally got the student log in the temple area (right from the entrance)  Stable is left.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>DevvNull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I would heavily recommend completing the Ghiosk portion first.<br />
<br />
On a side note, has anyone confirmed that Kirn's re-spawn is two hours?  I have heard from multiple sources that is set to four hours.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
No, no, I meant the left and right sides OF the stable area, or the east and west sides if you prefer.  I'm sure we were in the right place.  There's a nice map with the courier's spawn points marked at<br />

<br />
We were clearing all of these except the SE corner one, which I didn't know about last night.  <br />
<br />
We did get the Captain of the Guard twice, not sure what he is for.  He had three nodrop items both times - Fine Steel Ulak, Ancient Coin, and some AC8 nodrop shield.<br />
<br />
Of course you're welcome if you want to drop by, it'll relieve the boredom a bit if nothing else ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Twoflower, <br />
<br />
I'll bring some beer  =)   1 1/2 blue from 40, so I should be able to contribute a little bit.  : )<br />
<br />
<br />
Prost,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Snowfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Some added info.  Kirn fight is not that difficult.  I did it with 1 group the other weekend by accident (do not bring anyone kos to True Spirit near him...he agros).  <br />
<br />
If you can bring 1 group all 60's excluding yourself (or a slacker like me who was near 60 when getting it) of course.   Will make some nice exp along the way too and have some fun doing it one group.<br />
<br />
Of course more the merrier...2 groups is sufficient for any problems in The Hole.   <br />
<br />
Well good luck with that part of the quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dagor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Someone mentioned above that Ghiosk himself was a big hit as well as the books.  I dont' believe that killing Ghiosk is a faction hit at all.  The only Ghiosk related faction comes from turning in his books.  I got my spear a week or two ago, and don't believe I killed Ghiosk before then.  I picked up the books I turned in when I was hanging around in CoM during a reaver raid.<br />
<br />
And what they mentioned about Kirn agroing on folks KOS to truespirit faction is true.  Two enchanters had to go through considerable effort to charm/mez/blur Kirn after he agroed on an epic bearing wizzard in our party.  I believe the wizzard epic is also tied to truespirit faction, although apparently theirs is ruined.  Another note was the the wizzard was quite a ways from Kirn when he agroed.  We charmed/blurred Kirn and let him return to his spawn point before I handed him the Icon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hail,<br />
<br />
As a victim of the faction problems, I seek out these type of threads to try to help.  I finally finished my epic last Sunday.  I've become fairly well versed in the Truespirit faction problems along the way.  You can read about them here:  http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=1515<br />
<br />
My strongest recommendation is to NOT DEVIATE from the quest.<br />
All the ramifications of the May patch stealth faction mod to our epic quest are still not known.  I would NOT repeat earlier steps to try to get around handing in the Ghiosk books.<br />
<br />
Grabbing the icon and trying the turn-in as is would be folly in my opinion.  Without the Ghiosk turn-in hit, he'll likely eat it.  But trying THAT way would be BETTER than trying to cheat your faction hits by repeating earlier steps and then trying Kirn.  Almost ALL the GM's know about the faction range now, and I seriously doubt they'll help you on later steps if you screw things up by knowingly repeating earlier steps to bypass Ghiosk.<br />
<br />
Camping the Spectral courier can be a pain, but it isn't very hard, just time consuming.  Get one or two friends for company (and a safety margin) to help you, and you will get it eventually.<br />
<br />
Kirn isn't going to disappear, and with the mobs being mezzable now in the Hole, it really isn't that hard to crawl through to him.  A ten person party (myself included) went on my Kirn raid, and that was overkill.  One solid group group could probably do it, as long as you keep moving steadily forward.  Took us four hours, and that was with forming up, a half hour to get one person through the crack (/laugh), and an hour spent on repops before we changed tactics to keep making progress.  (We finally created and then defeated our own train to move forward.)<br />
<br />
Go with your friends on their Hole raid for the experience if you can't nab the Student's Log beforehand, and you'll know more for when you go for Kirn on your own.  I thought Kirn was a 4 hour respawn not 2, but I could be mistaken.  We didn't stick around after we finished Kindle and Kirn on our raid. ;)<br />
<br />
Btw, cross-posting is frowned upon.  If you had been a little more patient, you would have received more responses.  I currently can't access the Crucible boards at work any more due to governmental censors (maybe it is the word alchemy, I dunno!), so I have to check at home.  Regardless, I'll respond here for your convenience this time.  <br />
<br />
Take care and good luck,</div></div><hr />
