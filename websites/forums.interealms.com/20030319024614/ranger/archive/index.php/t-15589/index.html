<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">...get my arse into the planes for some sweet XP? I know 42 is too young but when could I really think bout going up? I have some pretty nice gear for my level and hopfully will have Swiftwind by 49 at the latest (guild is helping me and another ranger get em over Xmas break, at the least I should have the Jade Reaver, VSR stone, and PoS stone rest only needs me to level includeing Hole Hammer). Anyways, when can I go? I have heard 46 to 55 and all the levels in betweem.<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
Good Luck!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Yuma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">id say 55 you will start getting a group with LFG , anything below youd have to prolly bring your own group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Katalaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd agree. 55+ and you could start finding groups, though it could still take some patience. The only sub-50's I've seen in the new Planes were folks getting PLed so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tirronan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've seen some 51 to 53 clerics getting groups but this seems more desparation from groups needing healers.  Pick up groups for rangers require 55 and up.  I've had a pretty hard time even then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Eorendil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It depends on your server population and who you have for friends.  I was in PoN from time to time with higher level people grouping at 51... now, I wasn't doing most the work but I was snaring and I was contributing a considerable amount of damage as the ac of the mobs in the planes is incredibly low.<br />
<br />
I was organizing and joining groups at 54 but most of my time 51-55 was spent in Jagged Pine, which is where I maxed most of my weapon skills.  <br />
<br />
At 55/54 you'll still get passed up some but more often than not you'll get a group with a little persistance and if you don't here is what I do... go into PoT and PoK... look for people with LFG tags on.  Most people with LFG tags don't want to expend the energy to put together a group or are uncomfortable doing so unless its friends.  I will find one or two people LFG and tell them I am putting together a group for PoD, PoN or PoI and ask them to join... join up and tell them you are finding *whatever classes you still need* then do this /who all enc 54 (continue through other levels as necessary), etc etc.. cause more likely than not you will not get more than a page full of names and by looking at where they are (nexus, low level zones, PoK, PoT... or if they have LFG up) you can usually tell your chances of them being busy... then start telling those people, &quot;Sorry to bother you.  I am putting a group together for 1st tier planes.  Are you available/interested?&quot;  I can usually put a group together in ten minutes using this strategy.  My groups rarely let me down.  I make sure its a well rounded group and quite often my groups are still goin after I leave.. I even go to the extent of finding someone to replace me and take them to our camping spot if they need it.</div></div><hr />
