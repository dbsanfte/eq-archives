<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>brokenlimit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">just did the coldain military bracer quest and am quite pleased with the focus effect, so i was looking for an item that would also improve my dots.  My guild is easily capable of killing lendi for the boots of superiority or feshlak for his item, but i'd prefer not to use points on an item such as this, and was wondering if anyone knew where this item dropped.<br />
<br />
allakhazam has it that gem encrusted ring drops in sebilis, but does not list a mob.  i lived in sebilis when i was in my 50's and never saw the ring.  any ideas on what drops it or is it one of those sbc/ods super rare drop tables off anything in the zone?  thx<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Uurgugg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That ring no longet drops as far as I know</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Worgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Was my understanding its a rare random off the shroom reavers that spawn at L56+ (not many of them spawn high enough to enrage,  but some do).  YMMV though, this is flakey hearsay level info ;).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Gem ring doesn't and hasn't ever dropped in sebilis. It Dropped of the giants in kurnak the first week after it was released. The stopped it from dropping there and has never been found since. Best off just getting felshaks booties since a gem ring is going to be just shy of impossible to find.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Durdend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Gem Encrusted Ring was the Box of Abukar of Kunark.  Dropped of any ginat in Kunark lvl35 or higher.<br />
<br />
The first week of Kunark a TON of those rings were farmed.  I actually think they took them out of the day DAYS (like 2-3 days) after Kunark went live.  And they haven't been seen since, although I'm sure a few hundred dropped on each server those first few days.  Problem is many were taken out of circulation as players retired, were deleted, rings accidently destroyed, etc.<br />
<br />
Very nice of Verant to add a NICE focus effect on an item that you can't get any longer.<br />
<br />
Reminds me of when they nerfed Pumice Stones.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I believe this ring only drops in Veeshan's Peak now..if at all.<br />
<br />
A nice Focus effect and stats indeed!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Meecham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I was lucky enough to pick up one of these babies for the bargain price of 25k in bazaar.  Knowing where it came from, and that it no longer drops I snapped it up asap, but would never consider selling it.<br />
<br />
I remember the first week of Kunark when these were dropping, they were the best melee ring in the game at the time (that anyone knew about anyway).  Black pearl jewellery was all the rage for melee classes at that time, for those who could afford it.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ridik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I love my Box of Abukar.<br />
<br />
Its 10times better than a Tink bag just cuz it has the cool squeaky box sound when you open it.</div></div><hr />
