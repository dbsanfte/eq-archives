<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jvrebi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A little background first.  I just hit level 55 with my Shaman.  I solo &amp; group about 50/50.  With ReGrowth &amp; Fungi I am 80% of the time never going below 5 bubbles of health.  Yes I Cani when mana is needed but on a horse &amp; with the JBB I am setting pretty good mana &amp; hp wise.  I have a level 38 SK that I like to play also when I'm just ready to go wack something.  I am considering giving the Fungi Tunic to my SK &amp; replacing my BP with one of the Dragon ones or possibly a Barbed Ringmail.   My question is am I gonna regret this big time?  Shaman is definately my main &amp; I love him.  A Fungi on a SK would rock big time.  Just not sure if I am going to miss it on my Shaman.  Thanks for your help all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Give it to your SK.  When you want it back, take it back...not like your SK is gonna refuse :)<br />
<br />
Keep your other BP...when you get bored, give the Fungi back to your SK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah, it's not like it's high risk to give it to a twink of yours.  But, you'll be taking it back soon enough.  It's still useful at 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Israi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">when you hit 60 fungi isnt htat important rather wear a vindi.. *cry*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Besides Fungi the only one I would consider wearing is iksar regen BP till you get torpor.<br />
<br />
I had my CoV BP rotting for months until I got torpor; had no use for it except for the occasional incoming dragon, but even there I found myself banking it mostly, since the fungi was more important than the resists.</div></div><hr />
