<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've solo'd the entrance several times over the past few levels, and I've learned a few things that might help you maximize this awesome exp spot (if you are on MT please read no further until I ding 60..thanks).<br />
<br />
Tools<br />
Needed:_____________Optional (very helpful):<br />
Turgur's_____________KEI<br />
Ebolt or Bane_________Ageo (for eating those nasty harmtouches)<br />
Enstill/root___________Epic<br />
Batwings____________&quot;Project Alpha&quot;<br />

<br />
Getting there:<br />
<br />
Step 1:<br />
Charasis sits in the middle of the OT zone, deep in the canyon that splits the zone in two.  Fortunately you are a shaman, and have tools to make this location easily accessible.<br />
<br />
One way to get there (if you’re lucky enough to be a lizard) is by using your portstone /or FoB port potion.  This will set you down in FoB, requiring a leisurely jog through the city and Warsilks Woods to get to OT (from here proceed to step TWO).<br />
<br />
For those of you who are scale-challenged your next best option is to ask a friendly wizzy/druid for a port to Skyfire and a succor to the zoneline.  This trip is probably one of the most dangerous that a porter can make, so offer a few extra pp to sweeten the deal as needed, mobs in Charasis drop 3-5pp per kill plus kunark spells and runes, so it’s not a big deal to pay 15-20pp for a ride if needed.<br />
<br />
**Edit 2/19/03: Since PoP you just have to click on the OT book and follow the directions from the SF zone-in temple..ahh simplicity**<br />
<br />
Step 2:<br />
<br />
Get to the temple entrance to Skyfire.  It’s on the zone edge directly opposite the WW zone, requiring people zoning in from WW or FM zone to turn left and follow the zone line around.  These areas are patrolled by DE dragoons who don’t like lizards and most other races, but will tolerate ogres, trolls and dark elves unless you have messed up your Venril Sathir faction, which is exactly the faction that killing in Charasis ruins..so be aware.<br />
<br />
Assuming it’s daytime, or the ‘goons are far away (they stay in the fort during the daylight hours), head out to the ramp heading out of the Skyfire zone entrance.  Buff yourself with HoS, stamina, a shield spell, regen, and whatever you can beg in HP buffs.  Once you are all buffed up canni/mem to 70m or more. When you are ready to roll,  give yourself a fresh SoW and Levitate.  This is a good time to mem Invis as you will be using it in a moment.<br />
<br />
From the ramp run straight out, not turning left or right.  You should pass over a mudpit, past a small clump of trees, and then just to your left you should see two ‘ramps’; a pair of cliffs that thrust up over the chasm looking ready for a Michael and Evil Kenivel reunion tour.  At this point veer towards these ramps..and stop at the edge of the chasm between the two ramps.  If you have doubts about your ability to stop make sure you’re levved BEFORE you get here..’cause it’s a 10k drop if you miss the Crypt.<br />
<br />
Looking down into the chasm the crypt below you is the entrance to Charasis..there are 5 or more crypts that look exactly like this in the chasm, so this approach is the fastest way to know that you are at the RIGHT one.  At this point, levitate yourself if you haven’t and cast invis.  Everything else you do from here is constant action until you kill the entrance mobs, so be ready.  <br />
<br />
Get out your HS key (you DO have a HS key don’t you?!?) and hold it in your hand (after the first time it goes it your /keys keychain, but I’m assuming you’ve never been inside).  Making sure you are INVISIBLE and LEVITATED, do your best skydiving imitation straight down.  I’ve found it helps to corkscrew a bit on the way down to speed it up.  Land on the ramp into the crypt.   The scorpikus’s should all be very green to you, but they are all SK’s and in concert can lay enough harmtouches on you to make you wish you’d stayed at home, so make sure invis is UP the whole time.<br />
<br />
From the ramp head straight into the crypt to the back, then turn right and make your second left.  This leads to a series of ramps that lead deep down into the bowels of Kunark.  At the bottom of these ramps is a big red glowing stone.  This is the entrance to Charasis/HS, so click on it with your key and zone in!<br />
<br />
Step 3: The Zone-In<br />
<br />
Once you zone into HS you are in a very tenuous position.  Technically this is a ‘safe’ spot, but it’s really only safe until you move or cast a spell, and not 100 percent safe even then, so don’t go make a sandwich while you zone. <br />
<br />
One school of thought says that your first move should be to cast your pet spell, but I’ve found this often causes more harm than good. I typically use my f9 views to look around to find the entrance skellies.  Typically this will be two sepechular skellies.  These are SK’s and cast a 500-600hp HT.  Occasionally a lucky spawn will have a devourer (sperm) or a goo instead, making this part MUCH easier.    Turn towards the closest skelly, cast root and slow on it.  If you’re really lucky you’ll be out of range for the HT, but this is unlikely, expect a flaming OUCH.  Then turn around and find the OTHER skelly or mob and root/slow it as well.  At this point assuming you’ve eaten 2 HT’s you have 600-1000+ hps left (hopefully more).  Heal yourself, and then hit the skellies with epic or plague (or both). <br />
<br />
Pathing in this room is complex, which is pretty useful for the soloing shaman. If you don’t have the HP’s to wade into battle, you can root and rot pretty easily here.  If root breaks run across the center of the room to the right or left or far side of the center.  The mobs here will path AROUND the center, giving you an extra second to cast another root.  Stay clear of the stairs to avoid aggro’ing the golems up there (we’ll get to them later).  <br />
<br />
It’s is important to note that any non-undead mob in this room will flee towards the EAST staircase, which is a pit trap leading to the basement.  To prevent aggro’ing the basement and causing a NASTY train, make the landing to the WEST stairs your ‘home’ spot.  If you are having a problem landing a root at any time make sure you call your pet off before he reaches the base of the east staircase, or be prepared for evasive maneuvers!<br />
<br />
Getting back to the skellies, you can now enjoy the benefits of fighting in Kunark vs. Luclin or Velious. The mobs here are relatively low on MR, and have approximately 3-4k in hps.  This means that a Bane/Epic or a Plague/Epic (my favorite for root-rotting) will do more than enough damage to kill whatever you meet here.   Keep those skellies out of your hair and you can watch them die while you med/heal up.<br />
<br />
Once the first skelly dies, note the time.  These guys are on an 18 minute spawn, so you’ll need to keep an eye on the clock.  I find it helps to kill one off quickly, and then let the second one linger a while, so if one pops while you are busy with a golem, you aren’t completely overwhelmed with TWO skellies.<br />
<br />
Once the second skelly is dead, it’s Miller time.  Now you can go to the bathroom, make a sandwich, step out for a smoke or whatever you need to, as long as you’re back in 18 minutes or less that is.<br />
<br />
Step 4: Chewing up those juicy Golems.<br />
<br />
Ok..you’re ready to start exping.  Hit yourself with FoGB if you can for regen, or any bearform.  Cast shrink on yourself once to make yourself a tiny bear, and then cast Grow on yourself twice.   This will make you a BIG GIANT bear, which makes things a bit easier.<br />
<br />
Make pet and park him dead center of the room.  Give him str/regen/celerity or whatever you prefer in pet buffing (*cough* alpha *cough*)<br />
<br />
Each staircase has two pillars next to it.  Very carefully climb up onto one of the pillars.  I typically start with the EAST side for reasons I mentioned earlier.  Pull with slow (malo__ not needed here typically), and run to in front of the WEST stairs.<br />
<br />
Hit the golem with a dot or two while your pet hits him from behind.  From here it’s your choice to tank for pet, root, or wait until pet has agro and back off or any combination thereof.  It’s your choice, and you should make quick work of it.  When the golem gets to less than 2 bubs of health make sure it’s rooted to prevent it from running to the east stair pit trap (if you can snare, more power to you).<br />
<br />
Proceed around the room pulling from pillars until your clock says that 17 minutes have passed.  Check your health.  If you have 1.5-2k of health available and plenty of mana you have no problems, keep pulling.  If you are low on health heal up because you have one minute until you will be eating one or two 500-600hp HTs.<br />
<br />
If you follow these instructions, you should be able to pull consistently for as long as you want.  Occasionally the East door will open and a mob will come wandering out.  Sometimes these will be just a sepch. Skelly or a sperm, but occasionally a higher level undertaker skelly or helot skelly will wander in.  These summon so treat them carefully.  They will also occasionally wander out to the very top of the stairs, which is in agro range if you pass to close to the stairs. This will agro both golems as well, so treat it with care.<br />
<br />
Step 5: Evasive Maneuvers in the Dark<br />
<br />
I have already mentioned that you can use the pathing to make things easier here.  In addition, over the short walls around this room is a drop into the basement.  If you have levitate on, or are relatively high on health you can jump over the walls as close to the stairs as possible and land on along the wall to the main room in the basement.<br />
<br />
This should give you a precious few seconds to cast GATE or heal up in case of a train.  Some people have reported that mobs that follow you into the basement become stuck down there until they are killed or despawn.  In my experience most of the mobs I have seen have warped up and down just fine, but your results may vary (this also smacks of exploit..so be warned).<br />
<br />
The platform in the center of the basement is a teleporter back to the entrance room you’ve just left.  If you have SoW and/or enough health you should be able to jump down and zap back to the top with impunity.   Watch the pathing carefully here, and you can even decide to stay here and solo the basement.  <br />
<br />
All in all this should result in a challenging and productive experience for you.  Be prepared to improvise, use bandaging or potions when things get too hot.  Keep an eye on your pet, and watch for pops.  Be friendly with groups passing through, or even join a few occasionally (you CAN die here..so they may need to rez your giant bear butt).<br />
<br />
I have been able to grind out a blue or more an hour here (I don’t watch closely enough).  Loot is mostly PP and some kunark spells, so you won’t go broke coming here.  Groups passing through often are grateful that they don’t have to contend with the entrance mobs, and can be quite helpful in making your grind go faster (nothing like an unexpected KEI, or Ageo,  or anything.)<br />
<br />
Good luck and safe hunting!<br />

HHK was insane for 52-55..but was camped 60 percent of the time I was there..and I was BOUND there!<br />
<br />
I JUST arrived in Katta tonight.  I only killed 3 guards before I went LD and decided to check on the boards just now, but they were easy kills. They actually reminded me of killing nobles in HHK..)<br />
<br />
From what I saw, 1 epic with 'project alpha' pet and melee'ing alongside was enough to kill a guard in katta.  But I'll have to work out the most efficient method before I make a full report.<br />

I tried this last night and OMG was it easy.  It was so easy I felt bad, really I did, it should of been a crime.  I know exploits that harder than this camp, how sad is that.  Csin's walk thru is perfect, follow it step by step for break in and you will have no problems.<br />
<br />
Here's what I had:<br />
56troll shammy to start (57 within an hour of break)<br />
Fungi<br />
JBB<br />
Aego (wanted to be sure about those HTs)<br />
KEI    (well worth the 50pp, made it back in 40mins)<br />
Alpha<br />
<br />
There was only 1 thing to really watch out for, and that is the running thru the illusion floor.   After you break the 2 roamers.  Pull the west door, for these initially, keep them rooted at low health.  Once that door is pulled you can plant dogdog, on the stairs near the center on the west side.  When pulling other mobs, back yourself up just to the west stairs that go up to the door.  When the mob gets to you, dogdog will attack from behind, and begin pushing the mob the opposite of his Flee pathing, giving you a longer safty cusion to root/kill/snare or whatever before he falls thru the floor.  Do NOT let the mob and especially dogdog go thru the floor.  It happened to me twice, both times the aggro mobs below ported up to me and even worse Dogdog poofed!!  Upon restabalizing the camp, I tried a bit different tactic with much success.<br />
<br />
Used the same placement, but just really went full Alpha on it with SBD and GHL.  Full buffed Goner (HoS/Shroud/Str/Dex/Agi/Sta/Regrowth/Celerity), pulled with slow back to the stairs spot, hit it with Plague, a simple little lowest lvl Root, and moved to the center to Canadance back to full and let Goner do all the work.  When I got FM I started JBBing.  With proper placement and Alpha snare/stun mobs never even made it to center of the room.<br />
<br />
I made an average of a little over a blue of regular xp in 57 an hour.  Good cash from gems, pp, spells and miscelanious crap.  It was easy as hell and I dont even have my epic yet, with epic I think it'll get so easy that I'll I'll have to solo some of the wings just to feel good about myself.  Great camp, much like Csin if you are on Karana plz stay the F out till I'm 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Stormaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Great post!<br />
<br />
Just for reference, at 55th with, well, no gear (200 wis, but no jbb, no fungi, only buffed by myself), I was able to do the break and clear up to 3 of the golems before repop.<br />
<br />
Watch out for the oblations, they're wizzie (or mage?) model skellies that chain nuke (what else would wizzies do?).  They're worth burning down fast.<br />
<br />
I'd also recommend keeping in gate and your favorite root at ALL times down here.  It's risky enough to die down here, and risky enough to make it fun!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Revisited here recently for Cudgel fight.<br />
<br />
Same tactics made for very nice AA too.  Hopped into the basement later with a 60 SK and still made 2 AA blues just hanging around for 30 minutes or so.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I tried the camp for the first time yesterday. This little mofo made me regret that.<br />
He was on me when i was happily beating up 2 golems. The golems did NOT aggro the undertaker, they were both rooted at the center. And the undertaker was NOT a respawn from the entrance. I had killed them 8 minutes before.<br />
<br />
I still have no clue where he came from. He was upon me from just nowhere, HTed me, resisted 2 roots, 1 malise, 1 slow and then handed me my hairy troll butt on a platter.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have a clue if there are wanderers now who cross the zone in?<br />
<br />
I won't go there again until I know what happened. The exp was great before this incident, but the zone was empty at that time and of course I didn't get a ress, so i netted minus 2 blues that night...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Islowem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">there is a roamer that comes out the east? (i think) door, and stops at the top of the steps.

<br />
Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Codlugarthia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I know that roamer,<br />
it was up when I fought there and I kept track of him when I was pulling the golems.<br />
However, at that time it was a helot skeleton, not the undertaker skeleton that appeared out of nowhere and apart from that I couldn't have aggroed it cause I was fighting at the center and a bit to the west stairs, so the golems would not fall through the floor at the east stairs when root wore off.<br />

Ive seen what you are talking about.<br />
<br />
Ive solo'd here a couple times now, and both of my adventures ended with a mob aggroing from 'somewhere'.  Once in the basement with a Helot Skellie and once up in the entrance with the Undertaker.  <br />
<br />
Both times, I had good control of the mob I was fighting and the extra mob came from nowhere.  Once it was obvious that I wasn't going to win I just punched out and gated back to nexus...makes for a long run but I've never died here.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>thevolcanogod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Ok, I spent about a full day in HS trying to solo the entrance. The XP was pretty good - about 1% regular XP per 2.5 kills at 55. The only problem was the previously mentioned roamer. I would spend some time killing the entrance, being very careful to med in the center of the entrance gazebo and even leaving the 2 golems on the east side alone. But it seemed just about every time I gained 10% XP, the roamer would come out of nowhere and destroy me. With a 700HT and a couple good nukes for 500 or so, I was dead before I could gate out.<br />
<br />
Like I said, I spent the entire day there trying to figure it out and it happened every couple hours. I would suggest trying the basement here. You will fight multiples on occasion but at least there is no high-level roamer to make your day miserable.<br />
<br />
BTW - the entrance is easy to break at 55 even naked. Just slow them and DOT them and med up.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>thevolcanogod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Aye, completely alone in zone. I have noticed major pathing/ghosting problems in this zone so maybe it is related to that. Every once in a while in the basement something will appear to roam towards a wall and dissappear into it but it was just a ghost (not an NPC ghost but a ghost image).<br />
<br />
Last time I died to that Helot Skellie I checked and I was in the exact center of the gazebo happily rotting a golem nowhere near the east side. He still came out and destroyed me. Maybe in a level or 2 I will head back and use that area for AAXP when I can resist some of those nukes better.</div></div><hr />

I tried dual boxing entrance, and found it very easy (shm 59, war 58), so I tried the north wing.  I was surprised how many times I could either single or double pull from a group.  Even three mobs at a time wasn't too impossible.  I was eventually able to kill every mob I could get to (one room was locked, never got a key drop for it), including the crypt keeper.<br />
<br />
Question:  How much harder is the west wing?  Other wings?  Basement?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>VeldamirVZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">One very good tactic for this Csin, is to get a rune on break.  Now, in my experience there is 1 mob up when I zone in.  Usully either a goo type mob, a sperm type mob, or a skeleton.  If the skeleton is up, rune works very will if you can't get aego, since you bugged the chanter for KEI anyway.  Saves you some damage from the HT, so after that fight you can cannib up to setup your dogdog and such.<br />
