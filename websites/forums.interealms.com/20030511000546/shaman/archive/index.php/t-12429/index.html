Well I come to find out that Iksars are KOS  everywhere so how do you other lizards get around this when traveling throughout Norrath??<br />
<br />
I dont want to mess up the wrong factions, for instance I know if I go to freeport and just kill every orc pawn I see in the newbie yard I can eventually enter the city of Freeport.<br />

Im sure a similiar tactic would work other places, but What Factions should I stear clear of ??<br />

Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just keep your home city factions in case you ever do cultural tradeskills.  Other than that, faction is useless for anything other than quests.  With PoP letting you port anywhere you like, and bazaar, SH, and PoK being full of anything you could possibly want to buy, faction doesn't matter that much.</div></div><hr />

Probably my most loved item is still my ring of stealthy travel, hence why I still cling on to it even though its stats are pretty terrible =)<br />
<br />
Tbh these days iksar faction is far less of an issue than it used to be, the only real reason to near old world cities is for quests.<br />
<br />
Don't expect to be able to get TRUELY non kos in old world cities without an incredible amount of work and effort, there used to be a website of how an iksar monk pretty much got non kos in most old cities, but without sneak/fd it'll be impossible to achive the same everywhere.<br />
<br />
Remember though that in velious, pop and the parts of luclin that actually matter, faction isnt a problem for iksar in the slightest.  Iksars are fine in Knowledge/tranquility/Shadowhaven, why go elsewhere with the PoK book's? =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Its shaman , not shamens ... Sorry i couldnt let it go</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Koemoto</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Sorry Teacher, It won't happen again!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yes ive never worried about faction with my Iksar. For epic you go to freeport once and can invis around to where ya need to go. Just be careful and remember your a Iksar when you need to go close to cities in oldworld  that arent iksar and Katta on luclin. ( just ones can think of off top of my head)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Aye, on SoL, Katta and Seru factions are dodgy with iksar, I'm not 100% clear on how seru faction starts out as I was killing grieg and being habitually invis before I paid any attention to the twisted horror that is the seru factions =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Its just not an issue. Buying certain spells is the only real pain in the butt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shjekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Used to need to be able to bank on Antonica back before Luclin gave us the bazaar. All trading was done in EC on my server so you had to bank in NFP or RV. You can do the Bandaid quest for RV faction (beware of assling clerics tho) or just kill East/West FP guards to get NFP faction where the bank is. I loved killing Slate in my 40's so that faction was easy enough to improve. You can also kill billions of gnolls and get faction in Qeynos. One problem you will be hard pressed to get around are the random placement of NPCs on various factions. Bards are everywhere in and out of good cities so you have to avoid them or kill a lotta crap in Mistmoor. Gnomes are everywhere so watch out for them. <br />
Usually invis and watching your back is enough. But all that work is pointless now with PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tranzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">pfff faction..you dont need no stinking faction..i mean good lord you can get well into your 40s maybe even higher just hanging about on our home continant anyway. But serious like everyone has said faction mean squat really anymore.</div></div><hr />

That's the charm of being a leezard, everyone hates you, and you hate everyone. Which gives you free reign to kill anybody you want and not worry about it. With PoP and the Bazaar, faction just isn't an issue any more. <br />
Anyone without scales is JAV ( Just Another Victim ) !!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">To answer the question you asked:<br />
<br />
Without PoP getting to Nexus is a challange, but not impossible.<br />
<br />
My first instinct would be to zone into LoIo and see if there's a druid or wizard around who can take you.  LoIO used to be THE place to level 21-30 in the old days, and sometimes people are still there.<br />
<br />
After that you'd have to try a run to FV...avoiding the spiders might be a challange, but they don't see invis so it can be done.<br />
<br />
See if you can get a ride from there.  If that doesn't work your only real choice is to run across the dreadlands to the Luclin portal.  Of course I'd ask any local wizards or druids along the way.<br />
<br />
Once you're on the moon you probably won't think about faction again for a long time.<br />
<br />
In the old days I had good faction in many 'good' cities because it helped.  I amiable or better in Freeport, Neriak and Rivervale.  We used to spend our time trapped in hostile zones because the 'safe' zones were just as bad.  Now things are easy..<br />
<br />
You picked a great time to be a lizard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Back in my day, we hid on the OT boat to get to Antonica and by golly we liked it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">This is why I named my lizard Curst, because he is discriminated against wherever he goes :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>windfinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">faction was never a problem for me ( well buying the 50 to 60 spells was a PITA ), I killed them all couse WE the Iksars are going to RULE the world, there all our slaves anyway just need to be retold that.<br />
<br />
Boy i remaber going to the outpost for the first time and waiting at the beach for the boat come ..... thouse where some tense moments ). couse you where in a totaly red zone in a total KOS zone waiting on the boat that never came ( it felt like ). but seruisly i have always falloed the zone wall in warslike to get to the overthere zone then wait on boat, or once in lake you could travel to the FM zone then to the tunnal to DL and take port up to luclin ( did this at lvl 20 at the time was going for a port but that is not the point now ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">and faction becomes even less of a problem with today's patch (reportedly).  You can buy or make an illusion potion (turn Human for Freeport for instance) and enter the city of your choice whose residents will love you if you haven't screwed your base faction up somehow.  I suppose that means I could click my inky illusion potion and be liked in Neriak?  I haven't tested such things today yet. <br />
<br />
A &quot;human&quot; lizard should be well liked in Freeport, as a &quot;barbarian&quot; lizard should be well recieved in Halas.  <br />
<br />
Not sure why you need to visit old world zones tho.  On the moon . . faction is much less of an issue.  In velious, faction is what you make of it.  In PoP, what faction?  <br />
<br />
Faction just isn't worth worrying about for any race anymore.  <br />
<br />
Your biggest problem will be people like me who try to make handbags outta you! :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">In the begining the Iksar faction was a pain, everyone hated me and I had to go all the way home to bank :( Then SoV came out and I suddely had more places to bank, then the bazaar, and now PoK. In time I found that everyone hateing me was an advantage. I could kill what ever got in my way with no latter regreats for faction loss, becuse they already hated me anyway :P<br />
<br />
Dont worry about your faction Bro life gets better... Just dont kill in upper guk if you want to later get the Quest Helm, or in Chardox if you plan on doing that quest... In fact kill every RoK gobbie you see. And by the time you are high enugh to do the quest you will have a jump on the faction. Also avoid killing snarks(sp) when able that will also help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kryscha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I pretty much go with what all the other Iksar say here.  Bad faction is an advantage - you get to kill all those annoying halflings and gnome guards.... Plus, you're the only (I think) race that can bank in runnyeye from the word go!  How cool is that eh? eh? Kill the halflings, and sell their loot in runnyeye!<br />
<br />
The frogs in uguk will hate you no matter what - you gotta do a lot of killing of undead for them to like you (and I mean LOTS and LOTS) since you worship Cazic Thule. The only time you really need to worry about faction is for your epic, and from memory, so long as you invis to the guy, you're fine, as he's on truespirit faction.  <br />
<br />
If you want to run from Cabilis to Bazaar, the safest way is head into LOiO, it's a pretty safe run to FM zone if you pay attention, zone into FM and head left for the DL tunnel, sticking highish on the wall, zone into DL and head right, again sticking on the wall.  Follow it all the way around to the ice tunnel and you're safe. Again, pay attention in DL when you're running on the wall and you should have no problems.  I've done that run many times with my iksar characters and never had a problem. Running through the FV zone is (imo) a far more dangerous proposition, as the spiders tend to hang around on the zone walls more than any other mob I know of. (haha.. get it? hang around?) <br />
<br />
Oh, and if you ever just want to bum around for a while, you can raise your faction with all the dark elf factions by killing gnomes, certain butcherblock dwarfs, halflings, and humans. I can't remember if killing barbarians helped or not, but I had fun killing them regularly anyway! (Just doing my bit to keep the barbarian population down) Each one raises a different faction in the city (not talking about inner/outer dreadguard either) and eventually, after much killing, you can walk around safely in the dark elf city. However, if you want to go this route DO NOT EVER hunt in crushbone, as it will just make raising the DE factions that much harder.<br />
<br />
Just my 2c anyway.</div></div><hr />
