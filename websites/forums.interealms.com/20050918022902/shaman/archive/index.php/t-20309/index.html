Please reply here if you can offer any additional confirmation or any denial of the number of 'healing bursts' received with Q (or any other 4-tick HOT) and any of the above combinations of buff duration modifiers. I would like to have at least three separate sources validate each combination if you have the ability and time to help out.<br />
<br />
This is an excerpt from my listing at http://morelight.org/samanna/focus.html which I am trying to validate. I find this very interesting because reported results seem to be in disagreement with the Focus Effect descriptions.<br />
<br />
Thanks very much!<br />
<br />
EDIT: 18 Mar 04 - Updated to refer to 'healing bursts' instead of ticks of duration for clarity. Updated through post 36.<br />
EDIT: 22 May 04 - Added my own EB4 experiences.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Uusal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">According to your chart FoM does 15% extension=6.6. ticks round up so you have 7, then sever tick you always get adds 1 = 8. Also look up Umbracite Hoop drops from mini aten in VT has focus effect Chill of Umbra 26% damage focus for Ice based nukes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Interesting. <br />
<br />
If I understand you, &quot;ticks round up&quot; and &quot;sever tick you always get adds 1&quot; would convert 6.6 ticks to 8 every time. This matches with the reported data. <br />
<br />
But why wouldn't this convert an unmodified Q up to 5 every time with the &quot;sever tick you always get adds 1&quot; magic? <br />
<br />
And why wouldn't this convert Q + SCRM + Eterninostrum to 9 routinely, instead of the 'rarely' reported?<br />
<br />
I will try to get a 7th tick with Q + SCRM next time I log in, by playing with how long after a tick I start casting, and report back.<br />
<br />
And thank you, Chill of Umbra now added. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">bah im such a moron, I swore 8th shawl was able to be used with Q...anyway, I like the chart a lot, and you page with focus effects, thanks for putting it together :)</div></div><hr />

Using hotkey for Cannibalize 5 followed by Quiescence.<br />
<br />
With 6 ticks of Quiescence plus 20hp / tick regen, I end up with about the same health as when I start.<br />
<br />
Routinely I end up with 7 ticks and 300 hp more than when I started.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can confirm that I get 6 ticks with the Shawl and with Reinforcement 3.  I have not yet spent the 8 points for Mastery, in part because I thought it would not extend my quiessence beyond the 6 ticks.<br />
<br />
Lucy reports min duration for the effect on the shawl at 48, but I definately get 6 ticks when wearing the shawl.<br />
<br />
When I log in tonight, I'll run tests to give you more exact numbers.<br />
<br />
Can someone who has SCRM please also run these tests?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>SisterLi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">According to Lucy, Extended Blessing IV, Focus of Mediocrity, Eterninostrom, and Chrononostrom all have a minimum duration limit of 24.0 sec.  Lucy reports it as:  Limit: Min Duration(24.00 sec)<br />
<br />
Zephyr of Brell has a limit min duration of 48.0 sec. (Shawl effect)<br />
<br />
So I'm asking someone to check and see whether Lucy is correct about this.  Does the shawl effect the ticks on quiessence with SCRM?  <br />
<br />
I will check and see whether it effects the ticks at level 3 reinforcement.  <br />
<br />
Will be very disappointing if it does not.  I wonder if it can be fixed?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Njorls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You can just cast Quiescence, if you see the shawl glow (which it shouldn't) then it affects the duration.</div></div><hr />

<br />
SisterLi, do you ALWAYS get EXACTLY 6 ticks with SCR3, or is it sometimes 5 or sometimes 7? This would be helpful to know, thank you. :) I'll add this info to my main chart.<br />
<br />
And FYI, Shawl and SCRM do stack. In general, AAs and your best applicable Focus effect will stack. Common belief is that the Shawl will not affect 24 second spells, though, only spells with base duration of 48 seconds or greater. Please let us know if your Shawl 'glows' or whatever when you cast.

<br />
Zephyr of Brell<br />
Limit: Min Duration(48.00 sec)<br />
<br />
If you want 20% extended duration with Quiescence in addition to SCRM, you must have an eterninostrum item.  <br />
<br />
There is no &quot;rounding&quot; involved with ticks.  It all depends on when the spell finishes casting and lands, and when the last second is.<br />
<br />
If you land Quiescence a millisecond before a tick, your &quot;pulses&quot; of Eterninostrum + SCRM Quiescence (43.2s duration) you are guaranteed 7 ticks every time (7*6=42).  If you get very lucky you will get an 8th tick IF you get your timing right.  I'm not sure how people are getting a 9th tick at all.<br />
<br />
Eterninostrum = guaranteed 7 ticks, possible lucky 8th (43.2s duration)<br />
Chrononostrum = Guaranteed 7 ticks, half/half you get 8th tick.(45s duration)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>SisterLi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">With Spell Casting Reinforcement 3, I get 6 ticks on quiessence every time.  It routinely heals me for 1860 - which is my regen + 6 ticks.  I tested it over 10 casts.  <br />
<br />
The Blessed Coldain Prayer Shawl has no effect on quiessence at my level.  It does not glow when I cast, and taking it off does not decrease the 6 tick heal.  <br />
<br />
Is it glowing for anyone who has SCRM?<br />
<br />
This is an odd result.  Means that for 8 AA points, you sometimes get an extra tick.  If you combine the 8 AA points with 1450 LDON points, you always get an extra tick, and sometimes get 2.   <br />

Well, if SCR(M) and the Quiescence-affecting focii are working as intended (huge if, here), then Q with:<br />
<br />
SCR3 = Always 5 ticks, lucky sixth (31.2s duration)<br />
SCRM = Always 6 ticks on the nose, regardless of when you cast. (36s duration)<br />
<br />
I think you're probably right about those phantom ticks.  Ask Grizlor, he's canni'd himself to death because of (at the time) Torpor lag.<br />
<br />
<br />

Notice eight ticks.  I would imagine the server only counts the passage of time in milliseconds, so you have a space of about 1200ms to land Quiescence after the tick fires to get the 8th tick. =)  If you have Chrononostrum that &quot;window&quot; opens up to about 3000ms, or 3 whole seconds to get an 8th tick.<br />
<br />
This same &quot;model&quot; can be used for all the focii and AAs.  Again, assuming the focii and AAs are working properl, which is a big assumption, you will not get a 9th tick, no matter what focus you have.  You have to go all the way up to a 40% duration bonus focus in addition to SCRM to get a 9th tick (50.4s duration), and even then it's extremely sketchy (a 400ms window after tick fires to land Q).</div></div><hr />

I suppose if Quiescence landed at the precise moment the 5999th millisecond ticked away to 6 seconds, you would get 7 ticks out of it.<br />
<br />
Unless something's not working right, which is always a possibility.  Someone should parse out the &quot;You fall into a state of Quiescence&quot; time and the &quot;Your state of Quiescence fades&quot; time for a whole bunch of casts.  We might have sniffed out a &quot;bug&quot; if in fact people are getting a constant 8 ticks.  <br />
<br />
A possibility also is that a server tick is something like 6213ms or some other &quot;almost 6 seconds&quot; period of time.  Parsing would be most conclusive obviously.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I agree.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I'm curious to try now, because every time I kept a carfeul eye on my exact hp count, IF I even got the 7th tick (with Q and SCRM), I'd lose the hp's shortly after. With stoicism and no focus effects or aa's, same thing - if I got the 5th tick, it was taken back shortly after. With torpor, it's too hard to say, as I had varying levels of extensions as I was aa'ing, so can't say really. I always just thought that the extra ticks and such are from the uneven percentages in duration extension, meaning with SCRM, and an even 50%, you are not splitting ticks so to speak and therefore no extra ticks at all (same with stoicism and no aa's), but when you throw a focus effect with say a 15% extension or whatever, it is possible to time it to get an extra tick out of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>SisterLi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Did 10 more tests, this time watching for 2 ticks past to discern whether some of the ticks where phantom ticks.<br />

I have SCR3 and am wearing a shawl.  The shawl does not glow, so presumably it is not adding anything.  I am casting the post patch revised quiessence for 350 hps/tick heal.<br />
<br />
Out of 10 tries, I got 6 ticks on 6 of the casts.  On the other 4 casts I got 5 ticks of heal, plus a 6th &quot;phantom&quot; tick, which was taken away the next tick.  <br />
<br />
<br />
It looked like I was more likely to have the tick taken away if something else was happening during that tick -- i.e. a buff wearing off.  This conclusion is tentative as I did not study it much.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Iynna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Was confused with your treatment of Q duration first time I read it.  This thead got bumped and I saw your numbers again.<br />
<br />
Eterninostrum does not add 20% duration to the SCRM duration of Q.  Eterniostrum adds 20% to the base time of Q!<br />
<br />
With SCRM and Eterninostrum I get 24sec * 1.7 = 40.8sec. Not 43.2sec as you claim.  <br />
<br />
That AA and equipment focus effects add as a percentage of base spell duration can be easily assessed by timing out FA.<br />
<br />
With SCRM the base 6min 30 sec of FA lasts 9min 45 secs. (plus or minus a sec or two for measurement error).<br />
<br />
With SCRM plus 20 extetion I time out a couple seconds over 11mins. (exact calculation is 11 mins 3 sec).  If AA and item focus effects were multiplicative as you suggest, then FA should last 11mins 42 sec.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Relative to what you are are calling the &quot;phantom tick&quot;, I've been observing this ever since the first time I equipped a ceramic shield and timed out Q.  This is no more the the realignment of the client's estimate of health and server's actual health. Although I have never tried to prove it, my feeling was that the phantom ticks are more common in laggy zones.<br />
<br />
<br />
Samanna, relative to your request for more data.  Please be aware that at &quot;tick zero&quot; when the Q lands you get a health boost of 350hp.  When peeps say Q lasts 4 ticks, I interpret that as 5 incremental heals.  Just saying for me the terminolgy &quot;it heals for 5 ticks&quot; and &quot;the spell lasts for 5 ticks&quot; leaves room for mis-interpretation.<br />
<br />
<br />
For me<br />
<br />
SCRM = 36 sec Q<br />
4 out of 7 casts I got 6 healing ticks.<br />
3 of 7 times I got 7 healing ticks.<br />
I did this in a somewhat laggy zone and all of the &quot;6 healing ticks&quot; were actually 7 heals with one subtracted when the client-server adjustment was made.<br />
<br />
SCRM plus 20% focus item = 40.8 sec Q<br />
3 out of 4 casts 7 healing ticks.<br />
1 out of 4 casts 8 healing ticks.<br />
Again, all 4 casts actually resulted in 8 healing ticks and in 3 cases the last healing tick was removed when when the client-server adjustment was made.<br />
<br />
My best GUESS would be SCRM plus 25% focus item = 42 sec Q would always be at least 8 healing ticks and sometimes 9.  Hopefully I can do that experiment someday.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Hi, and thanks for the feedback!<br />
<br />
Was confused with your treatment of Q duration first time I read it.<br />
<br />
Fair enough - let's consider counting how many 350-point 'healing bursts' we get from Q, since I think that's really what we care about.<br />
<br />
Not 43.2sec as you claim.<br />
<br />
For the record, if you'll read http://morelight.org/samanna/focus.html#hot you'll see that I do not claim to know the duration. I present both theories, and the reports of users - which, oddly enough, vary. However, your reports do support the chart on the left (modify base) rather than the one on the right (modfy each other).<br />
<br />
So, if I understand your results, after discounting phantom ticks where the hp boost gets taken back after server-client sync (a very important consideration, thank you for specifying):<br />
<br />
With SCRM you recieved a net effect of sometimes 6 and sometimes 7 'healing bursts' from Q.<br />
<br />
With SCRM + 20% extension focus, you received a net effect of usually 7 and rarely 8 'healing bursts' from Q.<br />
<br />
Is this correct?<br />
<br />
&lt;hr&gt;<br />
EDIT: <br />
<br />
Please be aware that at &quot;tick zero&quot; when the Q lands you get a health boost of 350hp. <br />
<br />
I may be completely dense, but I don't remember getting an initial 350-point healing burst when the spell lands. Can I have missed something that obvious? And then shouldn't that push Q + SCRM from  '6 or 7' to '7 or 8'?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I may be completely dense, but I don't remember getting an initial 350-point healing burst when the spell lands.

<br />
I think what happens in that instance is that Q lands right before the server tick, hence you would get the 350 right away. This does not happen all the time though, so I think it has to be the tick timing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Wouldnt the best testing method be to check the hp amount actually healed, rather than counting tics?  I.e.:<br />
<br />
-take off all hp regen items and regen spells<br />
-verify your standing regen rate, multiply by 6 (if you are testing Q+SCRM) for an estimate of standing regen<br />
-canni down<br />
-cast Q, noting starting hp<br />
-note finishing hp when last Q tic is seen (or last server-client takeback occurs)<br />
-deduct estimated standing regen and round the result to nearest 350 hp increment (should be obvious how to round and shouldnt matter if estimate of standing regen is off a bit, since a couple tics either way on standing regen is far less than 350).<br />
<br />
I will try this tonight myself.  Great thread, Samanna, and all others who have contributed!  I am really trying to decide if that 1495 AP EB4 item is worth getting for an extra tic on Q.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Thanks, I appreciate you posting your results. <br />
<br />
I was counting pulses of 300+ HP gain - I was actually writing my HP count down on paper after each pulse, but I only reported back the counts. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Ok I just tried my &quot;count the hp healed&quot; methodology suggested above.  I did observe on some trials the &quot;rollback&quot; of the last tic when the server client syncronized, as noted above.  Here are the results with Q (350 hp new version) +SCRM only.  My standing regen was 10hp/tic, so subtracting 60hp for that during the Q heal itself.  The data is hp at start of Q landing, hp at wears off message, and hp on the next tic after wear off:<br />
<br />
Trial 1:  1065hp &gt; 3585hp &gt; 3245hp  (rollback to 6 tics)<br />
<br />
Trial 2:  382 hp &gt; 2902 hp &gt; 2912 hp (7 tics)<br />
<br />
Trial 3:  182 hp &gt; 2702 hp &gt; 2712 hp (7 tics)<br />
<br />
Trial 4:  130 hp &gt; 2640 hp &gt; 2550 hp (7 tics)<br />
<br />
Trial 5:  88 hp &gt; 2608 hp &gt; 2618 hp (7 tics)<br />
<br />
Trial 6:  96 hp &gt; 2616 hp &gt; 2266 hp (rollback to 6 tics)<br />
<br />
These results seem consistent with what is reported by others using the count the tics method.  This suggests the 6 vs. 7 tics is a timing thing, which could be used to further extend Q with an Extended Blessing 4 item as some others have observed.<br />
<br />
Another thing I learned is that if I start casting Q in the middle period between displayed &quot;tic&quot; updates of my hp, the timing is such that I get the 7 tics.  To get 6 tics, I cast Q starting right over the top of the tic.  Of course, this may vary with lag in a given zone situation, and internet connection.  I was doing this in a low lag zone (FV tunnel at book).<br />
<br />
Bottom line, for someone like me with SCRM but no Q focus item, Q is now a 2100 or 2450 heal.  Not bad at all.</div></div><hr />

Relative to whether item extension focus effects stack with AA extension effects as a (modify base) or (modfy each other).  This was discussed and resolved on this board a long time ago and I was poking fun at Haagen cause he is an old salty dog and should know.<br />
<br />
If you try to distinguish between (modify base) and (modfy each other) with Q ... you need to be able to resolve the 2.4 sec difference.  However if you use FA, the difference between these two possible combining methods is almost 40 seconds, something that can easily be measured. <br />

<br />

------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Yes basically, but I did not say &quot;8 'healing bursts' from Q&quot; with SCRM and a 20 percent extension was RARE.  For me 8 is common.  I ran 6 more Q tests this morning:<br />
<br />
2 of 6 times I got 7 healing bursts<br />
4 of 6 times I got 8 healing bursts<br />
<br />
<br />
I said:<br />
&quot;Please be aware that at &quot;tick zero&quot; when the Q lands you get a health boost of 350hp.&quot;<br />
<br />

<br />
This was poor use of words on my part.  All I was trying to say was a &quot;24sec = 4 tick&quot; dot like bane actually does 5 ticks of damage.<br />
<br />
But yes, if one observes the heals occuring at each tick you see some funny stuff. I have a buffed standing regen of 40hp/tick.   Watching the ticks as Q lands I have seen:  +40 +40 +350 +390 +390 etc. Whereas most often I seen +40 +40 +390 +390 ... etc.  I have also seen the client server adjustment made two ticks after Q finishes.<br />

Worst case was 42 seconds, 24+70% (24*1.7) is actually 40.8, so I think there may be a theoretical chance to get a 7 tick Q/BoT with SCRM+Eterninostrum. You just need to land the spell within 1 second of a new tick - perhaps ;)</div></div><hr />

And I'm sorry to report that in the four tests I ran, I only got 7 tics or 'healing pulses' from Q. :(<br />

Durations were 42, 44, 43 and 43 seconds, according to the log:<br />

The third run actually had an 8th, 'phantom tic' which was taken back on the following tic. Of course, perhaps I was unlucky, and will get an actual 8th tic once in a while. If so, I'll update my initial post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">let this thread die.<br />
<br />
there is no mythical 9th tick, if you get an 8th tick ... its regen ! by worn and passive effects !<br />
<br />
damn, seriously let this die.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I really don't understand your apparent exasperation.<br />
<br />
Please remember that not all of us are in Tipt, Sol Ro, and Elemental gear like you. I'm just trying to document (not predict, like with a formula that may or may not be accurate) the number of HoT tics based on different AA and focus modifier combinations, so that others (and I) can make informed decisions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">I agree, this thread is a help to me as I look forward to getting Q and doing all I can to maximize the healing it brings.<br />
<br />
I do think however that it might be time to sum it up and move to Medicine Cabinet.  I think we've pretty much seen all the data we need in order to understand the effects involved and make informed decisions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">I don't understand Kurth's point of view at all.<br />
<br />
The only reason to buy an EB4 augment is to extend Q, and it is pretty important news to see that it may not work for Q.</div></div><hr />

Not everyone has Samanna's Reference Desk saved in favorites, so it is uniquely useful information available only here.<br />

It is very useful to know exactly what you are getting for the points you spend in AA and/or for the upgrades you make to your gear.  Just because the thread is no longer full of useful information to you does not mean that it is not valuable.  A thread like this that uses experiment to establish what is happening, as opposed to simply repeating unverified statements, is very useful. <br />
