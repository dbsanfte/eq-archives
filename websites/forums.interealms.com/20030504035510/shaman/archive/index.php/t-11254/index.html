It's a level 44 spell!  If you're not canni-ing until you're in your 50's there's something wrong.  I just don't get it.</div></div><hr />

Stop bitchin, this is really starting to get on my nerves. You don't suck do you? You don't die everytime you fight DB mobs do you? NO so ****. The way some people keep going on, you may aswell make SoE give everyone natural C3 and just give you all your class spells at level 1. You don't like this game go play some other mmorpg like DAoC......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you're not high enough to be canni'ing, then you don't need to worry about the usefulness of stoicism yet. Try to relax and enjoy the spells you do have and try to find some useful/creative ways to use them. On a side note, though, if you are over level 24 and aren't canni'ing, then you aren't playing a shaman. You're playing a cleric or druid clone. True, if you pay for a kei or someone gives it to you, then at low levels you dont need to canni as much, but more mana is always MORE mana. I don't know about you, but I can always find a use for more mana, even when I'm not having a hard time keeping up. In those instances, I just do more (nuking, healing, whatever) to be more useful in my groups. I do agree that pure blood is being poorly implemented, with disinfecting aura right after it, but stoicism is very nice for the younger shamans (or those who are higher level but without torpor or quiescence). Get the spell and use it some, before you start moaning too much about how useless it is. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bamkaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I just love how everyone is complaining about this spell. my god i have been drooling over this since i read about it. its a mini topor. what more could a sham want 44+. cani 2 you get a spell lvl earlier. great for that if you get it. or you get Can 3 short while later. great for when you get that. and i know it wont help alot at 60+ but it will be a big help for those of us who can't afford the real topor. because everyone who don't need Topor gets it. and then makes us pay a ungodly amount of money for it. then turn around and bitch because no shamans have it. durrrr i wonder WHY we don't have it.<br />
<br />
Currently i am searchin all over the new zone tryin to find info on how to ques this spell. so far i havn't seen any details about this anywhere in the zone. and no people on emarr have any clue about it so far. post any info if you find out about it and for any other shams<br />

Disinfecting no longer cures posion only disease (read your patch message plz)<br />
Personly I have been canning for lv24 to 65. And would have loved to have a spell like this at the time. Like meny others I can rember when clarity was the ONLY form of mana regen spell. I gess thats why it bugs me when I see the yonger shm bitchin about caning. So I ask you one thing.. What the %^&amp;*!! would you do if there was NO Kei, NO PoTC?? I will tell you what you would be canning your hind end off like we did and praising the lord for this spell.<br />
<br />
Has for the root portion I think its good, first root then snar then no ill effect. It keep the spell line improveing. Most of the time when I solo I am not moveing around while fighting so root is not a factor that I can see there. Same with groups and if by chance you have to run (hold onto your socks brain storm here) Click the effect OFF then run</div></div><hr />

Maybe you should look into rerolling as a druid ya sure whine like 1</div></div><hr />

And for the cani comment... wow, hp to mana regen is what shamans do lol... thats almost like a necro not using his lifedots and lich. *boggles*</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It's actually a decent spell at that level you get considering we can only heal for 300 hp at till 51. My only real complain with it is when compared to torpor the mana cost seems way to high.</div></div><hr />
