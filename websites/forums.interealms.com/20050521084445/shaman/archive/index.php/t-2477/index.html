<br />
One was Duoing with a Monk.... it procced enough that when the monk feigned, the mob turned to the shaman, 5 seconds later when the monk stood up.. the mob turned right back onto him.<br />
<br />
Unless you totally clear aggro.. this weapon will pretty much put you below every melee around you pretty fast... a nice idea.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I don't have Sprinkler of Spirits, so I can't give you a field-tested comparison, but I will say this about the Mace of Confusion.  It's a damn fun toy.  Yeah, it has awesome stats, and it's the first item that's caused me to bag my Spear of Fate.  But even moreso, it's just fun to swing this fast and still do some damage.  Now to get a better haste item than fbss and get my 1hb skill above 70. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>JenamdarAL</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Abit off topic, but there is another issue involved when talking about blood loot. It should not exist. All it causes is a growing situation with guilds farming blood and blowing emp spawn. Its the same as old statue/aow was until they fixed it with idol. One would hope people would leave blood alone unless they are taking a serious shot at emp, but we know this won't happen. Instead you will get guilds farming blood and gating out, at times just to screw over other guilds. The encounter as it is now, is poorly setup.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The issue was adressed last week when they brought Ssra down, Jen. Not sure if it was handled in the best way possible, but it definitely was a positive change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">hm? they changed blood/emp encounter? didnt notice anything?</div></div><hr />
