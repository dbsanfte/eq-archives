They always coem back and since the quest isn't all that popular u will get this fast.<br />
<br />
Concentrate on what is truly the hardest part of the quest. The YUN SHAMAN powder.<br />
Yeah some of us got lucky and made the powder seem liek the easiest part but even with a tracker it is easy to die in tt WHEN or IF u ever see a yun.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">2 things, I hear the bag pops every 8 hours as a groundspawn near a green golra.  second, the grey bones are fairly commomly rotting in KC by a T1, well, moat, or CY group, or even a train.  Most folks do not announce as they have no clue what it's for, so ask for it.</div></div><hr />
