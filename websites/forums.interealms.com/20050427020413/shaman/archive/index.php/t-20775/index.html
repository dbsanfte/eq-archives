<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>agentorange83</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">greetings all,<br />
<br />
I 3 bot a shaman, cleric, monk combo every now and again, and was wondering on best place for xp?<br />
<br />
right now i've been doing BoT, usually s bottom if its free, xp is decent I guess, and mobs are pretty easy (monk can tank 2 at a time)<br />
<br />
monk has 6818 hp's buffed by cleric and shaman, LR 5, CS 3, VT ish level gear<br />
<br />
cleric has a few EP items, FT 15, 5k mana pool, 450 aa<br />
<br />
shaman has mostly bazaarish gear, with some raid stuff thrown in, FT 3 or so, Canni 5, 100 aa or so<br />
<br />
<br />
any thoughts on best place to trio?  can't be Sol Ro or EP's as the shaman and monk do not have access there, but everywhere else should be good.<br />
<br />
Thanks for input</div></div><hr />

you can do sol ro, but i suggest in letting the shaman tank. why you ask ?<br />
hes going to mitigate better, and be hit less than the monk, and besides, if the shaman dies you still have the monk to save the cleric.<br />
use low level poison dots to hold aggro.<br />
and keep chain nuking the Spear of Torment, its not much aman but its enough aggro.<br />
<br />
since you don't have acess, do tactics, or failing that CoD.<br />
both of those zones barely get touched, some nameds drop some pretty spiffy stuff.</div></div><hr />
