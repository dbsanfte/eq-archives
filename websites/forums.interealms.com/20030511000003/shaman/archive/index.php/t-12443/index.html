<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Basically I'm kinda screwed. Many people in my guild have gotten themselves flagged in PoJ, and I didn't 'cause I was busy IRL when they were going.<br />
<br />
So I'm flag-less.  I get no less than three tells for PoV groups the moment I log on..and I am stuck baby-sitting hedge groups in PoN or begging for a castle spot in PoD.<br />
<br />
The constant refrain I hear is that &quot;Shamans dont' add enough DPS &quot; when I go looking for a trials group.<br />
<br />
I don't want to be a drag on the group.  Slowing is useless, so I'm left with Rain spells and Spear of Torment, which all together don't add that much damage.  Add to that an alpha dogdog and I still put out a lot less damage than adding another ranger, or even a necro.<br />
<br />
So my questions are:<br />
<br />
What are some successful Trial's groups/strategies that would include a shaman?<br />
<br />
What can I do/say i'm gonna do to increase DPS?<br />
<br />
Every time someone asks me for buffs so they can go to trials/planes and pays me 10pp I wanna kick em in the stones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It depends on your level.<br />
<br />
Trials were challenging when people did them at level 60--nowadays you can grab a couple of 65s from the guild and breeze through.<br />
<br />
As far as dps and your role in a trial group go, you can do decent dps with rains and nukes, or you can be backup healer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm in the same boat, Csin :( I'm so sick of tier1 zones but it's damn hard to find a trials group because we are on the least desirable list of classes. Yet I get about 2-3 tells a night asking if I want to slow for groups in PoV/PoS lol.<br />
<br />
Looking for hints also :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">30 extra points of damage shield on the MA would probably add up to some pretty decent extra DPS, especially if you aren't mezzing adds.  Then bring a 5-dose kilva's skin of flame potion for the MA.  (Hope nobody thinks of the fact that they can probably buy one in the bazaar.)<br />
<br />
At least that's what I'm planning to do once I get around to doing a trials group.  Seems as though chain nuking + alpha pet + damage shield would actually add up to a fairly respectable DPS, especially if poison rains aren't resisted much on the trials mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>jvrebi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I was in the same boat as you are.  Level 62 &amp; have failed Exe trial numerous times.  I finally resigned myself to tier one.  Then one day a 65 Cleric (a very good friend) asks me if I want to be flagged.  She gathered a 65 Warrior, 65 Rogue, 65 Chanter, &amp; a 63 Mage.  All already  flagged.  We BREEZED through this trial.  Needless to say I owe her a lifetime supply of sow &amp; shrink potions.    :D <br />
<br />
IMHO if you have one of the sub par &quot;Exe Trial&quot; classes, (a low dsp that is not the main healer), your group needs these high level players to pass.  Sure there may be the exceptions to this rule, but the majority of these type groups fail.  I know this doesn't help you much, but I just wanted to share what happened to me.  Friends are &gt; all things in this game.  Chose friends over loot, exp, everything.  It will pay off in the end.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>AlynaRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">1) Make a doggie.. Give it weapons (even though shaman pets don't use it)/haste mask from a mage and buff it<br />
2) Get a group with an enchanter, cleric, uber rogue, plate tank + (Any other damage dealing class)<br />
3) Enter trial<br />
4) Summon companion. <br />
5) Assist main tank.. and pretend you're a wizard.. <br />
6) Assist on heals if needed. <br />
7) Malo main boss - And slow it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The more 65's the better.  Use pet classes when possible, mages in particular outdamage melee's of any kind.  You need 1 cleric, 1 enchanter (or really good bard), yourself, a tank, and 2 high damage people like mages or melee's with good gear.<br />
<br />
You and your nukers should try to get mage focus items: speed ring and nuke bracer.  Your job in trials is to be a really bad wizard with a pet.  Manage your mana to allow you to nuke everything possible.  Buff up your dog and give him toys.  Don't slow or cripple anything but the Prime executioner.  Its a waste of mana.  If the mobs live long enough for slow to make a difference, you will lose.  If the casters are low on mana when exe spawns, kite him around while they med.  If you are a parsing nut, shoot for 300dps or so from your damage dealers.<br />
<br />
The other approach is to kill AE style, but I have no experience with that strategy.<br />
<br />
Basically keep your low dps classes to one per attempt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Phinger Bang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">AlynaRN pretty much nailed it.<br />
<br />
Here is my view on the trails.  The trials are a sprint but shaman are marathoners.  What we bring to trials indirectly are our buffs, and what we do directly in trials is not much : (  When I went, I just nuked and nuked and nuked and slowed the very last mob.  To be honest, the best way to do it is with a guild.  Most established quilds don't have a problem with trials, I'm sure they have 4-5 people that can blow through it and just plug in the classes that have problems.  That is exactly how I got through (at lvl 60) and that's how you get level 53's looking for groups in PoV.<br />
<br />
Maybe not the answer you want, but it's one of the truths.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Don't buy this dps crap would be my 2cp. I could go crazy, when i hear &quot;but we need 362.5 dps or we can't pass ...&quot;.<br />
<br />
Of course you need to kill the mobs quick, that's somehow the point of trials, but just staring at the dps numbers denies player skills and learning and lessens the fun (it's a game, look at the CD box  ;) ) of such events imho. I did the trials with 5 complete strangers and the first 2 tries were a complete desaster, but we got better with every new try.<br />
<br />
You sound like you have not tried the trials yet, so get a few friends together (focus on some experienced main tank and as another poster said, pet classes like mages are nice as well) and make sure, you get a few hours time ... (3 should be enough).<br />
<br />
Here comes the complex strategy(tm):<br />
1. read some spoilers for tips, obviously i suck with tips  :D <br />
2. buff up<br />
3. make a plan and be sure, group understands and agrees<br />
4. go in and kill the mobs<br />
<br />
If you fail, sit down and discuss, what went wrong. Try to improve your tactic and repeat.<br />
When you finally succeed, you got some accomplishment(sp?) and not a convenient taxi drive into the next plane. <br />
<br />
After all, when you still fail after a few tries, you can still call your uber lvl 65 friends and be done with it.<br />
All rambling aside, there were already some nice hints in the thread, that should help you out. Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I am a guild leader for a small Family guild on E marr.<br />
<br />
I was for the longest time the highest level. At 62. (Now I have 180 aa) But when got through trials I had 150ish aa.<br />
<br />
I am a die hard, stubborner than ****, tank shaman. <br />
<br />
I got through trials the first time With a 62 cleric. 60 warrior, 60 druid, 62 shaman 60 ranger and a 65 thief.<br />
<br />
None of us have any uber mob loots. None of us have ToV loots. The thief has a ragebringer, and a Dagger from Radiir.<br />
<br />
Yet we got through trials. I was crowd control. And Pretty much the Pinyata. I get full buffs and I am at 4860 hp. I had druid and My Potions damage sheild. Mutt and weapons and Everyone Mage and Buffed to the nines.<br />
<br />
I would drop Ae slow. On all the mobs to get em beating on me. (Damage sheild is huge) 3 would beat on me and 1 on tank normally. If tank starts getting hurt I direct heal and I am pretty much assured the aggro. One Poisen nuke and Dps is decent<br />
<br />
Cleric keeps me alive. And tanks pick and kill.<br />
<br />
This is a highly fluid. Risky way to do it. But you are important. Really the druid is the linchpin, banish, heals and or nukes. But Other than a paladin noone can get all the aggro and take the beating.And a paladin can't Have mutt chewing and slowing and all.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyways. It is how I did it. Now 85% of my little guild is Flagged thru trials. And Just a couple days ago We killed a storms Mini named with three people. And the night before the Other mini named with 18 with some friends. So we are BoT enabled. (Yay!)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Step 1 : Ask your friends in your guild to spend half an hour helping you get flagged - on most servers there isn't much of a wait to get into the trials anymore.<br />
<br />
Step 2 : Pick a tactic from the above.<br />
<br />
Step 3 : Execute said tactic and have fun with your friends.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">if your guild is in tier 2 and has been for a while they should have the power to get you through trials. Yes Shamans are gimply in Trials. Thats why you have your buddies usher you through.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>kamfool1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Why don't you do trials that utilize your strengths instead of punish for weaknesses? Something other than execution, maybe...<br />
<br />
if you still don't know what I'm saying, not all of the trials required damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I was in exactly your situation.  3-5 tells as soon as I logged on for groups in PoV/S, BoT, you name it.<br />
<br />
Got flagged.<br />
<br />
Now?  I hear &quot;want a group at ZO2 in pon?&quot;  &quot;want to come to pod castle?&quot;  It's kinda hilarious.  ;)<br />
<br />
My trial was complete touch and go.  No enchanter, but a 65 warrior and 65 monk; cleric, ranger, me, and paladin- all 62 or so.<br />
<br />
We used nothing fancy.  Had an outside C3.  No DS potions (ran out after too many tries), but the cleric and I traded heal aggro back and forth a lot.  I nuked my little heart out.  Used my spirit call on the 3rd wave as folks' mana was running low.  We had no nameds pop (would've been the end of that attempt).  Paladin did a lot of those lovely prexus waves.  I canni5'ed twice, if I remember right.<br />
<br />
I swear it's all repetition.  Once you get to the point where nobody's making any mistakes at ALL, and the group is finally meshing perfectly - that's when you'll win.<br />
<br />
This is fantastically difficult with pickup groups, IMO, as you spend the first 5 attempts or so just learning how the others work.  It's a very interdependent experience.<br />
<br />
Good luck.  I quit the game for a month out of frustration at this stupid flag.  Came back and flagged within a week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Anyone that can't get flagged through exe has some serious EQ problems.<br />
I went through EXE trial 6 times in a row with no failures, missed 3 trying to get my 55 monk flagged, then passed the last 4 in a row without a failure.<br />
You want to get flagged?  DO THIS:<br />
<br />
1.  Play your shaman.  Shaman are good in trials.  They slow the boss.  they play patch healer for whatever the main healer can't heal.  You heal the healer.  You nuke when you aren't healing.<br />
2.  Get a main healer.  Cleric or druid is fine.<br />
3.  Get a main tank.  Paladin, Warrior, Shadowknight, or Ranger is fine.  You want good taunting ability here.<br />
4.  Get a mage.  MAGES OWN EXE TRIAL.  level 60 mages can kill the rocks in the trial in 1 cast.  (druids can too).  level 61 mages can nuke for 2000 damage a pot.  Mages also have beefy pets than can do CC work for your.  Mages have pets that do good damge.<br />
5.  See #4.  Where 1 mage is good, more mages is better.<br />
6.  See #4.<br />
<br />
You can do the trial with most any well balanced group, though the above group dynamic is the best I've ever seen for it.<br />
<br />
In general, you group needs:<br />
Main healer<br />
Backup healer/nuker<br />
Main tank<br />
3 Damage dealers<br />
<br />
Work with that dynamic as a group, and you'll rock the trial.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Alyss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">If your already flagged guild won't pop 5 people back for the short time it takes to flag you then you need another guild I'm afraid.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">2 mage 61+ , 1 good tank , 1 cleric 62 and 2 peeps who need the flag . Even lvl55 is ok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">What Snoww said works.  I passed trials in a similar fashion with cleric, pally(mt), me, rogue, ranger, SK, I think.  Something like that.  Anyway, the way it works is:<br />
<br />
1) I torpor myself, then the cleric RIGHT before spawn. <br />
<br />
2) Pally sits on the floor in the middle.<br />
<br />
3) Mobs pop, they all aggro him, I aoe slow em all (wether it takes is unimportant) and 3 of em come to me. <br />
<br />
3) I pop a small rain, just to keep their attention, and when health gets uncomfortable, cleric DD heals me.  Cleric uses Celestial mostly on the MT, low aggro.<br />
<br />
4) Clerics heal on me is usually enough to grab a little aggro from my mobs, which works nice because its just about time to refresh her torpor, then mine, and I aoe slow/rain to yank em off her again.<br />
<br />
5) Mob 1 is either dead or almost at this point, so if its almost, I can throw in a poison nuke.  **Also throw a poison nuke if the Exe says &quot;Do you have any last words&quot; or whatever, coz you got about 4 seconds at that point.**<br />
<br />
6) Rinse, repeat til Prime Exe shows up.<br />
<br />
When we first did it, Prime wasn't slowable.  You got the &quot;Yawns&quot; message and everything, but he didn't get any slower.  This has been somewhat remedied, but he was a serious pain then, took a few trys.<br />
<br />
I had some tanking aas I think and Cannibalize I'm sure when we did this first.  Would prolly be kinda hard without em, especially if you're not an ogre, and I honestly don't know how it would work if you didn't have Cannibalize, but you kinda need that to be real useful in tier two anyway, so...<br />
<br />
What I like about this style is a) you get 5 damage dealers, not 4, and b) the shaman gets to be one of them.  :)<br />
<br />
Lots more fun than getting 5 ubers to let you coast through, and easier to arrange.<br />
<br />
<br />
:edit:<br />
<br />
Almost forgot, DS potions, preferably one for the shaman, the cleric and the MT, but in a pinch the MT can go without.  31+ point, 15 minute DSs rock.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Taarne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">In my opinion, AE style is by far the best way to do it..<br />
<br />
The people you need:<br />
<br />
1 - Tank, with big hps and taunt =)<br />
2 - Cleric for comfort and taking down the boss<br />
3 - Smart, high level chanter.<br />
4&amp;5 - Wizards.<br />
6 - The one you want to get flagged.<br />
<br />
Basically, you get in the middle of the spawn that they all instantly aggro you, causing them to be in range of AE stun. Chanter stuns, wizzies nuke once or twice. This is an extremely quick way to dispatch of the normal waves, so even if something does go wrong, you have the time to fix it.<br />
<br />
This is a pretty guaranteed way to get through it, but you need a pretty high level chanter so he doesn't get resisted.<br />
We actually did fail once on the boss, as two of our casters got rampaged to death, being too near :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Shjekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">My guild uses 65 Chanter (was 61 when we started flagging) , 60+ Wizard, 60 cleric, Almost any tank and 2 others of just about any class. <br />
Chanter and Wizzy on horses and AE all 4 waves in no time. They can be OOM for Exe himself. Then tank and cleric take over. <br />
When I was trying to flag my shaman I was getting way too many resists with Torrent so I switched to whatever single target nuke I had. I would spot heal, sic pet and if the exe was getting close to the prisoner I nuked whatever the current melee target was. Worked fine. <br />
<br />
With a really really strong wizard and a decent chanter the exe trial is very easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>zathrys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">really this can be done with about any group makeup.  My shaman just missed getting flagged at 58.  Group was 62 gnome war, 62 wiz, 60 dru, 60 chanty, 61 mage, and my 58 shm...yes the druid was main healer.  Had I thought about it I woulda saved more mana back for final boss heals (had 50m when boss came up), got boss slowed and he was down to 8% when the dru went oom, 4% when I went oom (woulda killed for canni5 at that moment)  I was last to die watching the target health bar not move from 4%.  Had I saved back a touch more mana we would've won as my gimp 600 nukes weren't making much of a difference.<br />
<br />
Incidentally this same group passed trials just before with me subbing out the shaman for my 60 monk.  The added damage negated the need for a backup healer.  But without the monk we were killing fast enough, swap the druid for a cleric, or save back more mana for heals, or use a pally for MT....there are many many different ways to do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Kraaga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I just got flagged last week. <br />
<br />
my group was:<br />
61 Shaman (me. main healer)<br />
63 Rogue<br />
62 Beastlord<br />
61 Shadowknight<br />
63 Bard (mezer)<br />
63 Druid (nuke/backup heals)<br />
<br />
We made many attempts, but never failed on the waves. We lost the SK to the executioner several times and since he needed to be flagged it meant trying again.<br />
<br />
The key for us was fast targetting and excellent assist. If you have that you can make it through. I highly recommend mounts for all casters. When we reached the executioner I was FM and I ended the battle at 42% mana. I let the beastlord slow the executioner to avoid aggro and we just kept at him until we won.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">My guild typically uses a 65 tank, 62+ bard, cleric and that seems to really work well for us (fill in a couple dps and one other from there).  The bard ae slows and has stacked DS on him and usually gets agro of most mobs while the group beats down on another one (he can also charm if he wants).  As a shaman I just worked to keep the bard alive, while the cleric keeps the MT alive.  Most of the time was backup healing, nuking and curing slows (if that happened).  By the time you are down to the 3rd and 4th mob they are half dead from the DS beating they took so they die really fast and you have a good amount of time to med after the fight if you need.<br />
<br />
Best bet is what others suggested, dont get in a pickup group, do it through your guild.  We've had a few nights where we stack a group and then get the rest of the guildies in line, usually 4 that have passed the trial and 2 that have not at a time.  Have all the classes not going in to help out with buffs.  We got 7 flagged last time we spent the evening trying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>stewardx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">The following has worked for me several times.  Grab as good of a tank as you can get.  Grab as good of a bard as you can get.  You as the shammy play main healer.  Then fill out other classes as necessary.<br />
<br />
I've gone thru several times helping people get flagged and it works great.  In fact I think my shaman (who is lvl 62 and very very far from uber) is a better in the trials then most clerics.  The MT generally only needs one CH per wave which leaves me lots of time to DD and canni.<br />
<br />
The bard does CC and never runs outa mana.  Also as each wave progressess he adds more damage.  IE, initially he is mezzing 3mobs with little or no time to melee, then its down to two mobs and he is meleeing some, then mezzing one and meleeing alot etc.  This allows u to stack damage up on first mob and have a chance to slow down and gain some mana towards the end of each wave.<br />
<br />
Granted this strategy takes a decent MT and bard.  But, we have successfully completed the trials several times this way.  The only thing to remember is that without the cleric people have to pay very close attention to enrage etc from high ex.  It sucks to get all they way thru only to have the people you want to get thru die to enrage and not be able to rez em.<br />
<br />
Just my 2 cents.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Snoww, do you think there is any way a shaman with a lot less ac/hp (I dunno how much you have but with 150 AA I'm sure you have plenty) could possibly tank trials?  Any min ac/hp numbers you could suggest?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Wargbearjumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Dear Csin....<br />
<br />
<br />
Here's what I do for EXE Trials.<br />
<br />
<br />
As was said early... Shamans are slow, steady DPS, given enough time.. we can kill almost anything.    The problem with an EXE Trial is that the key to that is fast, burst-type DPS.. that means, Melees, or Wizards, and the all-time King of Fast DPS, Mages.  <br />
<br />
Build yourself a Group like this.  Tank(Warrior,Pally,SK), Cleric, Rogue/Monkx2,Wizzy/Mage.   Then, there's you.    The best way a Shaman can cotribute to an EXE Trial I have found is this.....<br />
<br />
Each Wave is 4 Mobs, and as your party chews through each mob, the Executioner Resets, and generally, by the 4th Mob, you party is going full guns to kill the last mob in time.   Here's where you Turn the Shaman's weakness into an Advantage.<br />
<br />
1.  Load your Slow, and all the Posion DOT's you have.<br />
<br />
2.  Make your group aware that when the 4 mobs spawn, they will Assist the tank and engage them in the order the tank chooses... EXCEPT.. the 4th Mob, is yours.   You will split from the group and Engage a 4th Mob... the LAST mob.    You slow it, and DOT the living heck out of it and Torpor Tank it while the Party kills the other 3.   By the time they get to you, the will be falling behind on keeping the Executioner at bay... when the Warrior assists you, he will be happy to find the last mob will be sitting at about 50% HP and be a very fast final mob in the group.<br />
<br />
3.  Do this through all 4 Waves and you will find it works quite well.  When the Executioner pops.. he mitigates the slows so much, it's almost not worth doing, just Assist your Cleric and Spam heal the tank as the rest of your group chews him to pieces.<br />

<br />
You'll be better off in the long run.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Loramin,<br />
<br />
I am not nearly as well equipped as most shaman. Fully buffed I have I think 1072 AC And 4968 HP. I dont have a single skyshrine peice of armour. And a mismatch of everything else. I am still wearing my fungal also. (If someone tried to take it off my cold dead corpse I would rise just to whip thier ass)<br />
<br />
But alot can be done when a cleric has Supernal elixer on you through the whole fight. Plus fungal plus regrowth. Plus tapping tnarqs now and again. Heck For one trial I had a greater rejuve potion going too for the spare 40 HP a tick. <br />
<br />
The best suggestion I can give you is. Use what you have learned through playing.  Get friends to help. And refine your tactics till you get one that works. You only have to win once.<br />
