<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Toshizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Before you ask no I didn't search, I am going to be raiding the local Food Basics store and I figure by the time I get back I'll have my questions answered.<br />
<br />
Like the title says I'll be going on my first Naggy raid. I would like to know the do nots and do's of the event.<br />
<br />
<br />
Next I also have a raid friday so would like to have other things that I can do to get my computer raid ready. I hope to be using a 1ghz, Pent 3, 512 MB RAM, with a Radeon 8500 120mb Video card. But if I have too many problems I'll switch to my tried and true laptop = 1ghz, pent 3 256RAM, no clue on video card.<br />
<br />
<br />
Are there any steps that I should take in making sure that I know which settings needs to be set to what? and etc.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Turn off all particles.  Use old models.  I'm guessing this is your first large raid where alot of stuff goes on in a small area.  And be prepared to buff everyone.......twice......by yourself while everyone else goes afk.  Bring any fire resist gear you can as well.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Toshizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Okies, thanks for the quick replies. Are there anythings that I should try to do personally on the raid? Is it possible to land a slow? I hear you need to be in melee range to cast on it?  What level is naggy? What are the things around him? ETC.</div></div><hr />

I swear I langed torgors on vox but no ss so no proof, I tried turgurs at 52 and waisted my mana, imo once you know she's be debuffed by the chanter try to land your debuff then torgors a few times, once you get to 50m forget it and concentrate on either doing damage or healing someone..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">From my exp, dont bother slowing vox or naggy. You will just managed to get your self killed and waste mana. Your time is best spent as a spot healer to help the cleric's mana. I was able to slow naggy at 55 without a problem, let tanks agg, ran up, slowed, got booted from zone. But when I scrolled up, I got the naggy yawns message. But naggy's a chump. You probly wont get a chance to cast slow twice.</div></div><hr />
