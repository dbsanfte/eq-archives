<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hyperd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yep, I am now in a real fix, I have levelled so fast that I have not been able to raise my defense properly. The last two levels up to 32 only gave my 2 points in defense, even though I wasnt PLed, and I melee soloed most of it. I was PLed from 24 to 28, that is the bane of having too nice, higher-level friends. I am starting to believe I should regret that :) . (My defense is around 118 on first bub into level 32)<br />
<br />
So how do I raise defense in a consistent manner? Naked troll-run into Gukta-guards ;) ? I am looking for a tactic, not just &quot;getting hit&quot; :)<br />
<br />
And what statistic is most important to raising defense, agility ?<br />
<br />
Thank you, advice on this would be highly appricated.b</div></div><hr />

2. Fight mid blue mobs.<br />
3 .Fight toe to toe with the paladin and heal each other as needed.<br />

This is how i raised my defense</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Agility is the statistic that determines how fast you gain skillups for defensive skills (like Defense).<br />
The fastest way to gain Defense skill is to get hit by unslowed mobs that will give you xp if you kill them (blue, white, yellow, red cons).<br />
I've seen speculation that red conning mobs give you the most chance to increase skill, but I haven't ever seen any proof of this.<br />
When you start levelling more, the xp will slow down more, and you'll have more time to work on defensive skills.<br />
Just keep slowing mobs and tanking them to kill them and you'll get your defense up soon enough.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grann Met</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have an SK friend and we found out this little trick worked nicely ...<br />
<br />
Have the SK summon a pet and then challange the SK to a duel (dont worry you wont be fighting him/her if all goes well). The pet is and NPC and as such WILL level you defense when ya get hit by it.  Have the SK summon the lowest pet he/she can that still cons light blue to you, give your self all of the AGI you can (I am pretty sure that AGI is what defense is based on), and Cripple it (or disempower it what ever is avaliable).  Heal your self and have the SK call it off when ever you get low.  This worked wonders for me.<br />
<br />
P.S.  I would assume that this works will all pets but i have only tested and seen it work with the SK skelly pet.<br />
<br />
P.P.S  I do not have and form of a spell checker on my computer yet so please forgive spelling in my posts untill i get one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hyperd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for the answers, I think I will try the pet idea out. Raising wep skills with /pet hold should also be doable :) But of course on at the time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Go to Echo Caverns.  Look for needelites.  I think they would still be blueish to you at 32.  They hit really fast but never really hard.  I think the max hit Ive seen was 9 or 10, with most hits 5 or 6.  Dont slow them.  Just stand there and let it hit you.  You should be able to channel heals if you need, but your regen should take care of most of the damage.<br />
<br />
Its good that you are concerned with getting your problem fixed now instead of when you are 58 and dont have defence maxed yet.  At higher levels it gets much harder to fix it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Amphybius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have noticed that skill ups are much more common when fighting dark blue mobs and higher.  Fighting the light blues tends to slow your progression down quite a bit.<br />
Just an observation I thought I'd pass along.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Hyperd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Just a quick side note: What is my defense skill supposed to be at 32? Eqshaman says level + 5, but that must be wrong as I am above it already :) , but is it 5*level + 5, 4*level+5 or just level*5 ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Just a quick side note: What is my defense skill supposed to be at 32?

<br />
I believe it is 5xlevel+5.  So at 32 it would max at 5+(5x32)=165.<br />
You still have plenty of time to work on this, though I DO recommend you take a few days out now &amp; catch up NOW when you can still have some low level mobs smacking you for skill-ups.  I didn't fix this until my low 40's iirc, and it was a pain letting Ping Fuzzlecutter whack on me for skill-ups.  Once you are caught up, just spend an hour or two duo tanking after every ding and get your 5 points quick.<br />
<br />
Oh, I also recommend you try the search function with key words &quot;raising defense&quot; or something similar, as this was a somewhat common problem a long time ago.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tidykat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I never actually paid much attention to my defense skill tbh, but, I was soloing from 28-50, and I was a gnoll/giant bashing toy.  I hung out in SK and offed gnolls (melee'd them after i had my pet) then moved to FV and camped the 3 giants out there and took quite the few hits...skillups just  seemed to happen..by 46, i *think* i had maxxed my defense skill out completely...and dodge and most of my other primary melee skills =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>jraven1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Defense is capped at Level * 5 until you hit the hard cap at 200 (level 40). If you keep everything maxxed at every level until then, it should lag Sense Heading and casting skills by 5.<br />
<br />
Best way to raise it at your level is get your agility buffed as high as you can and fight needlites in echo caverns. There is no better way to do it. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Webber</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I was 2 boxing a beastlord and cleric. At 36 the cleric's defence was 13 so I decided to do something about it. I had the cleric /duel the BL and let the pet eat away at the cleric for a few days. Four or five Kei's later his defence was around 185 and he had gained many hundreds of ac. <br />
<br />
It's a pain but it can be done.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">it's level*5 for shamans IIRC.<br />
<br />
Anyway, another tip is to look for mobs that are low dark blue to you and hit fast.  If you're 32, the Needlites in Echo Caverns (the side that goes to FG) might still be DB, if so, they're perfect.  They hit for very little, but hit really fast, so you get more chances to raise defense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Higher level mobs definately make a big difference.  I'd go for an enchanter air pet that is dark blue to you.  The air pets don't hit for that much.  Just have the chanter back the pet off when you need a heal.<br />
<br />
I've read conflicting reports about whether you want high AC or low AC.  High AC obviously helps you take less damage, but it may avoid some of the blows, which may or may not keep you from getting skillup opportunities.  At low AC you'd obviously take a lot of damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Swiftfisted</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Check out the Exterminatory in Neriak C.  He's a level 60 mob that hits for a whopping 6 MAX, and has about 3 million hit points.  you can raise all your melee skills, and your defense at the same time, you'll never die.  Just put auto attack on and go watch a few movies.  There's a good guide over at monkly-business, done for monks but is still applicable for shammies too.  It's here..<br />

Good luck, personally had a bard friend raise his piercing to max and my girlfriend raise her 2hb from 0 to 200 in a few hours.<br />
<br />
EDIT: ack you're 32, well for you higher shammies out there.... :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Bahamute</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I would just wait till you got stoicism and then start tanking. This way you can take a beating for a long time and rais it fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>JomoMojo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Go to the Tower of Frozen Shadows, get key to get to the 2nd floor library.  There is a trap infront of the collapsed bookcase on the right hand side of the giant library room.  If you trigger the trap it will hit for around 50 damage fairly steadily.  Takes a while but your defense will raise up and you can just back up off it to heal as needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Hamenu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Pick up a DS potion and do the needlites as suggested above, its the fastest way to raise your defensive skills at your level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Trena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">What I did with Amorae (and 2 of my druids and my ranger) was recently nerfed, from what I understand.<br />
<br />
Senina Jolik in Erudin<br />
<br />
Level 52 NPC that hit for a max of 8 (unarmed. 12 with a weapon). She had about 50k or so hp with crazy regen and no one assisted her. So, I had my friend's druid cast Replenishment on Amorae, equipped her fungi, buffed her up (Fo7 + Wrulan prior to going to Erudin), turned on attack and went afk. While checking back every 30 mins or so (to keep replenishment up), 2 hrs later Senina's at 30% health and the toon practicing has gotten several weapon skill ups and defensive skill ups as well.<br />
<br />
Something else I tried was having a Mage friend go into the Arena (usually Thurg or another totally deserted Arena to avoid any static) and go at it with the highest level blue con pet the Mage can summon. Again with the druid for heals, I could watch TV while her skills went up. I never had any luck /dueling a pet class but just stepping into a PvP area (without /duel) worked like a charm.</div></div><hr />
