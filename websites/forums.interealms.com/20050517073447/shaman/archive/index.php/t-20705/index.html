<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My card is a little less than sufficient for EQ with all the bells and whistles turned on (and I like having them on).  Currently am using a PNY GeForce 4 MX 440 card.  Read about it here (http://www.pny.com/products/verto/geForce4/mx4408xagp.asp).  Memory on the card is a bit low, and it is a lower end model.<br />
<br />
I'm an NVidia guy, but have trouble deciding between all the models out there.  The GeForce FX 5700 with 256MB for about $127 looks promising, or should I go with the GeForce 4 TI 4800 for about $129?<br />
<br />
Or is there a better card for that price range?<br />
<br />
For reference:<br />
AMD Athlon 1300+ (1.3 GHz)<br />
512 MB RAM<br />
Asus A7A266 motherboard</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would go with the 5000 series, its newer and will have more up to date features including better DX9 support I imagine.  The amount of memory on a card is less important than the age of the chipset behind it and its clock speed imho.<br />
<br />
I hear good things about the Radeons, but have never tried one.  The DX9 patch supposedly really made them run smoothly in EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Graskulis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Avoid the 256 meg version of any model other then the newest one. Chances are you can get a faster card with 128 memory for the same cost as the slower card with 256</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm useing a fx5200, my gf is useing the mx 440, both 128mg cards, I can not tell a difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gruog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">First of all you might have problems getting a new 8x card to work in that older motherboard.  I am not saying you WILL have problems, just you might.  I have tried to put a FX5200Ultra in a A7V133 and it flat out failed to work. Your A7A266 is an old Ali chipset that was notorious for compatibility issues. If your running DDR in the a7a you might want to consider a nice cheap DDR 8x agp board before upgrading the video card.  Anything KT600 will work great.<br />
<br />
Now that said, you need to determine a budget and get as fast as possible for that price.  Someone said don't get a 256mb card and I cant stress how accurate that is. <br />
<br />
You will want to look only at DX9 accelerated cards so stay away from the Geforce4.  Games (especially BF:V and Far Cry) look soo much better on a GeforceFX or Radeon9xxx.<br />
<br />
Your best bet in a budget card is a Radeon 9600XT ($150-190) or FX5700Ultra ($160-180) or GeforceFX5900XT ($180-210).<br />
<br />
If you want another step up you can get a Radeon 9800Pro for $220-260</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Interesting Gruog.  I never knew that motherboard had compatibility issues.  I know I do have a bit of trouble with the USB ports, but I hardly use em so I don't worry about it.  :)<br />
<br />
I know the AGP slot is not 8x, but it will handle 4x.  I don't have the money right now for the cards you mentioned, but it does help give me an idea what to look for.  If I try to spend more than say... $150, then I am pushing my luck.  Who knows though... I might get lucky.  (yeah, right :))</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>grootz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I had a problem with a radeon 9600 all in wonder card with an asus a7v133 motherboard.   My machine wouldn't boot or it would suddenly lose video.  It would work fine for short periods.  I read that the early versions of the KT133A chipset had problems supplying sufficient power to the agp slot.  The newer cards use a lot more juice.  <br />
<br />
I wound up buying a new machine with Gateway retail stores going out of business.<br />
