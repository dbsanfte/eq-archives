<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was just curious because I think its just great for 65 shammys with some aa's - it really lets you &quot;go your thing&quot; and you can have all sorts of fun with oddball groups because - well because you can, lol.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I was wondering how things are for the lowbies - you having fun? getting groups? are the dungeons hard/ok/easy? etc.<br />

<br />
Haven't too many (5 or so) but they have all been different (bad idea though because I spread my points between the camps) and I have lost and won.<br />
<br />
So this expansion is a lifesaver for me because I was getting kinda burned out on the sit your ass here and slow inc mobs all day game.<br />

<br />
All of the camps potentially have stuff you might want to get.<br />
<br />
Plus, being diverse means you burn out much slower.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But, I'm still having a blast, nice loot, decent xp, and *much* more enjoyable than sitting on the wall in PoN or PoV pulling singles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>taggletoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">59 shaman here and 2 for 3.  Two wins in guild group, one loss in pick up group go figure.  I think on normal these are perfectly tuned for an average group. If you're a well equiped group or familiar with the people in your group on normal it can be fairly academic.<br />
<br />
The big difference I saw between the guild group and pick up group was the puller.  In the guild group if I said 30m our monk would say &quot;pulling might be two&quot;.  In the pickup group if the cleric said 60m the paladin would say &quot;holding pulls&quot;.  <br />
<br />
People seem to waste a lot of time looking for the right classes to put a group together.  Give me a good puller and I'm GTG.<br />

Group was 60 Warrior, Me and a 59 Druid 57 Cleric and Beastlord, and 53 ding 54 Enchanter. We all had a blast though :)</div></div><hr />

Ldon rocks and its just exactly the way I like to play.<br />
<br />
In dungeons, GTG<br />
<br />
My main role has been slower, root parking adds, buffing, and back up healing.<br />
<br />
It seems like no one seems to know how to root park adds, they just yell add and continue to assist the ma<br />
<br />
Boggle<br />
<br />
So it gives me a sense of pride when I slow the add and park it off in a corner.<br />
<br />
I never have a problem getting a group, at first I was a little worried thinking clerics and mezzers would be taken over me. But I have found that I more than pull my weight. <br />
<br />
Ldon really has made EQ fun again, as I was getting sick of the lvling grind.</div></div><hr />

I plan to shop around because I like variety, but I will probably have to pick a &quot;home base camp&quot; and boost my point value there to get the stuff I want.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You don't need 2 wins in a camp to raid. I am not sure how it works but I took part in a Sol Ro raid on Saturday and I had only one failed adventure in that zone, and 1 win across all of them. Some of the guys with me had no wins at all. You can read that I/we suck from the win/loss but the point is that we raided without 2 wins per person. I assume that the raid leader has to have 2 wins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>peleg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">So, being a 63 shaman, LDON has been interesting.  Easier for me to get planes groups for some reason... if I put LDON only in my LFG message, it seems to take quite some time to get a group (up to 45-60 minutes at times) but if I say PoP or LDON, I get a PoP group in about 10 seconds.<br />
<br />
As for the adventures themselves, its nice that you are forced to keep a decent pace going so you don't have &quot;afk&quot; every 30 seconds, but the role stays the same.  Slower/debuffer/add aggro grabber, backup healer, sometimes nuker.  Only time mana was ever even remotely an issue was when the group made me the primary healer.<br />
<br />
Oh, and the other thing... apparently the level of your adventure leader makes a significant difference in the points you get.  At 63 with a 65 leader, I get 47 points on normal.  When I went on one with a 58 leader, I got 30 points (granted, the mobs were way easier).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>RangerKeaianea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">LDoN is great if you find competent people to group with.<br />
<br />
As a level 55 Shaman, new to the server, the people I know are 65 so I can't group with them.  I've tried two adventures, both pick up groups and both have been failures.  One because I think the puller was being TOO careful pulling and taking just too long, although he did train us at the end because he fell down a pit full of mobs (*boggle*).  We had to evac so we couldn't even finish for the lesser reward.  The paladin tank of that group was great though.  The second one was a *collect* mission - those just suck and I'll never ever ever do that kind again.  We easily killed 70-80 mobs and only got like 21 of the 27 we needed before we ran out of time.  The random number generator has far too much power to turn that type of adventure bad.  At this point, I'm trying to level up a bit so I will be able to join my level 65 friends when they need a shaman over my 65 Ranger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Bits of LDoN Dungeon Wisdom...<br />
<br />
1) Main Tank should be with in 2 levels of the highest character if not the highest.<br />
<br />
2) GET a map.  It cuts down the time you spend trying to decide to go right or left.  (Sometimes it don’t matter, other times it VERY much matters)<br />
<br />
3) Only pull the mobs far enough that they will not cause adds when they try to run.  (You should be moving every pull or every other pull, unless clearing a Room)<br />
<br />
4) Don’t be afraid to call for evac or to RUN.  Turn around time to get back on track is FAR less then with deaths.<br />
<br />
5) Mob Difficulty is based off of Group Average Level.  So the larger the spread between levels the more likely your going have troubles.<br />
<br />
6) KILL those blasted Healers.  Nothing is worse then having the Melee mob that hits like a freight Train get CHed in stead of the mob CHing himself.<br />
<br />
7) If you get two healers separate them by pulling one back the way you came in and rooting him.  If they are far enough apart they can’t assist each other with heals.  This works even better when there is no mezz casting player with you.<br />
<br />
8) Slow and steady progress is far better then burst progress.  You mana pools tend to find a nice equilibrium.  Just because you have time to cast more DD don’t mean you should.  If you’re killing a mob a min on most collection or slaughter missions you will complete it in plenty of time.  Rushing will cause you to wipe and fail an adventure just as fast as going too slow.<br />
<br />
9) Have the Puller set up a hot key &quot;%T incoming Move to me no Farther.&quot;  This gets everyone in the habit of moving.  Lets the Puller set the spot to kill at.<br />
 <br />
10) Be ready to turn around and head back to the last intersection when you reach a dead end.  Waiting on stragglers wastes time.  By saying CLEAR or ROOM CLEAR.  You let people know what is going on and that they need to go back the other way instead of continuing on the way they are headed.<br />
<br />
11) On collection &amp; Slaughter Missions clear all routes so you do not have to back track.  Unplanned back tracking wastes the most time of all.  (Map help 100% here)  Clear the tunnels in a systematic manner if you don’t have a map it makes keeping track far easier.</div></div><hr />
