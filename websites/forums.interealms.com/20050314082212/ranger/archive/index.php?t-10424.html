<br />
*you have become better at thread hijacking*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tulouis</div><div class="date">09-26-2002, 03:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I assume this is the thread for susggestions of new guides?<br />
<br />
I hope so....&quot;Fire away&quot; is kinda vauge, and well, this thread looks pretty well hijacked anyway.....<br />
<br />
Well. here goes: <br />
<br />
1) A guide on the angle technique for fear kiting would be nice. Or maybe just a guide on fear kiting in general =)<br />
<br />
2) The guide to AAXP from Skills and Stats should be in here.<br />
<br />
Erm...well...that's all I can think of now.<br />
<br />
Maybe a guide to ranger buffing is in order....I know our wierd stacking issues confuse some rangers...<br />
<br />
:)</div></div><hr />

<br />

is a set of wis gear good for spell increases and tradeskills?<br />
dex for archery and tradeskills<br />
<br />
thats the sort of thing i mean</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vendikarr DeWuff</div><div class="date">09-26-2002, 06:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">How about &quot;A Forager's guide to tradeskills'.  Put up some guides to upping our tradeskill levels primarily using our foraged goods.  Also which recipes use foraged goods.  Might help those of us who like to accumlate and sell foraged items, knowing who needs them</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">quixotic</div><div class="date">09-26-2002, 09:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as foraged items go, Niami DenMother at EQtraders already has a very good list of all foraged items and their uses. It can be accessed at:<br />
http://www.eqtraders.com/location/foraged.htm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Utherwayn Leafwalker</div><div class="date">09-26-2002, 10:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One topic that recently came up is the effect of AGI.  I would love to see that posted here for a while the answer was, we did our tests we wont get our old data, finally I think it was Locz, or Vladimir who pulled the data up and showed it in what I thought was a very understandable format.<br />
<br />
So requesting AGI guide I guess =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arath</div><div class="date">09-26-2002, 02:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well since weapon and equipment questions are so abundant how about a guide along the lines of ..<br />
<br />
Weapons at 20, 30, 40, 50.<br />
<br />
Along the lines of average good and &quot;oh man you twink&quot; Would be nice for a newbie..yeah there are still some out there to be able to have a good list/guide to shoot for and actually know if its appropriate for his her level<br />
<br />
And of course if were doing weapons may as well do armor. Same idea: Average, Good and &quot;oh god what a twink&quot;<br />
<br />
Would not suggest going over 50 though seems people get a bit touchy at that level being told their gear is only average =)<br />
<br />
And since we are talking about guides that give you a way to compare your gear how about a zone hunting guide with some additional data such as ..zone A is good for level 20-25 with average gear but if your in the good to twink levels then you may want to move to zone B as the xp will be a bit better but the risks are increased.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Davnar</div><div class="date">09-26-2002, 03:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How about move some of the links for PP farming to guides.<br />
<br />
I second the buffing-guide-per- level with-stacking-conflicts-suggestion.<br />
<br />
A faction guide would be huge, showing:<br />
      Various factions for important quests.<br />
       Easiest ways to increase certian factions.<br />
       Factions that would have little effect, so don' worry bout it.<br />
       Eventually possibly even a factions/zone tied to mobs.<br />
<br />
Archery LoS bug explaination and ways to max archery guides.<br />
<br />
A guide to items with clicky effects or useful procs. <br />
<br />
Parsing: What where how why?<br />
<br />
Using Gamepads to automate stuff: what where how why?<br />
<br />
Thisa may be obvious or already covered elsewhere,  but how about in the guides area, sub areas for forum threads that cover it. The idea being that it would be useful until more formal guides could be created. For example for plat farming, you could just move the two or three threads to the guides section for now, and as folks get a chance to compile the info in the threads into straightforward guides, others have a single reference to work from . <br />
