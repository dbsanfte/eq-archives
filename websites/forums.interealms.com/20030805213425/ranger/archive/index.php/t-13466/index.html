<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lokriek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I made it to KK late last night and soloed some lancers by the zone for a bit.  I  was wondering what tactics people use while soloing KK around level 36.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drunia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Finally, someone else is doing KK. I dragged everyone I could find down there from 37-44. 37-39 I did all the lancers easy, kept them cleared. Lull animal actually gets some use here. At 39 with KEI I could do the whole room, piercers and impalers. Have to root the impalers and heal halfway through. Pull back to the wall and wedge yourself in the corner. This helps when you DoT (swarm, flamelick) keep your DS up, all of them. Occasionally a named will pop (fierce impaler) who are major under-cons. Luckily Phinny raids show up about then, just  ask them to kill it for you. For perspective, I did 37-44 in four days of this, about seven hours a day. And I always run back to bazaar when KEI wore off, so even more time used there. Good luck in Kedge, I loved it.</div></div><hr />
