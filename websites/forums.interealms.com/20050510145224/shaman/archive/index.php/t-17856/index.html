<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm 61 and have Torpor and an Extended Enhancement III item, Amulet of Insight.  Does this extend Torpor?  I read about folks saying how EE and/or SCR/SCRM can extend Torpor and Q, but I'm a little confused.  Reason I ask is I'm almost 62 and will be using many 61+ buffs soon which the amulet won't affect . . . and I just won a really nice neck item and am considering replacing the Amulet.  I appreciate your assistance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No, it won't.  The amulet of insight only affects spells which have a duration of 48 seconds or more, torpor is 24 seconds.<br />
<br />
The AAs SCR/SCRM do affect Torpor/Q. There are also some high level focus effects which work on beneficial spells of 24 seconds or more.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Duurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's probably been posted elsewhere, but I don't have time to look it up, but is there a big difference in the time going from SCR3 to SCRM? I've noticed now I get 1800 HP almost 100% of the time with quiescence with just SCR3. I know some have posted getting up to 2100 with VT drops and others, just wondering if that is more a chance with SCRM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I normally get 2100 with SCRM.  I've also read the sparkling ruby of fortune with extended blessing IV adds a tick.  It can be purchased for 1450 points at the Takish camp and is type 7 so it'll fit in pretty much all items except ldon purchased gear.<br />
