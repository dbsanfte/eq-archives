<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bonemance</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">hi, I was wondering if it was possible for a lvl 64 shaman to solo in PoG now since there has been some changes... I have never been to PoG, however i have heard that one group 55+ can do it. So, I'm looking for advices if possible.<br />
<br />
Btw, i have epic, malo, torpor, POX, BON, VOTB and about 2300 HP's unbuffed if that helps  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rewts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not really anymore.  Was quite possible before recent changes to the Protectors, now its pretty near impossible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I wouldn't say impossible, especially at 64.<br />
<br />
PoG's spawn every 20 minutes with 1 or 2 spawning. They can be rooted but they cast druid spells.<br />
<br />
What I would do is keep a timer and have it time every 19 minutes after you kill the PoG. At 62 I can kill regular mobs in 3 minutes so you could get 5 or 6 in before you had to worry about PoGs.<br />
<br />
Try it out by binding outside and keep gate memmed and let us all know how it goes.</div></div><hr />
