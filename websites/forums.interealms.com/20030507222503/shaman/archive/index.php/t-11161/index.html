<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>godgav</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My Magelo profile is linked in my tag. Just dinged 54 and have saved up some cash and am willing to acquire a bit more if I have to, but if a piece costs more than 10k it better be damn good. <br />
<br />
I like most of my equipment but am concerned about a few spots I've had trouble finding reasonable upgrades for.<br />
<br />
For instance, I've had a pair of Platinum Jasper Rings since level 5 that I got from a friend. Recently swapped one out for Circled Toe Bones but not sure what to do with the other ring. <br />
<br />
Likewise I'm satisfied with my Chains of the Accused on one wrist but have struggled awhile to find a reasonably priced upgraded to my Jarsath Scale Wrists. <br />
<br />
My arms and legs also don't seem to be serving much of a purpose - what can I do to upgrade them?<br />
<br />
Ears, shoulders, back all give Wis but not much else, are there specific pieces that will put me in a better position?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Definately lose the Plat/Jasper ring. Even a Velium fire wedding ring would be an upgrade. The obvious ring for that slot is, IMO, a Shadel Bandit Ring, unless you are very rich and can afford the Valorium ring of Gallantry<br />
<br />
The Jarcrap wristguard has to go. The obvious thing to do would be to complete the Coldain Military Bracer Quest - you can solo it easy at 54, but if you don't have Kromriff faction, you need to make a RZ alt..there are detailsed walkthroughs for this quest elsewhere in these forums. The Coldain bracer has better stats and AC thean the Jarjar, and also has Extended Affliction III which gives extra duration to DoTs, Roots, Debuffs, Cripples, etc<br />
<br />
Ok, here are a few possible upgrades for other slots:<br />
<br />
Ears: Earring of Cleansing, Earring of Purity, Earring of Twisted <br />
Leaves, or if you are rich, Earring of Solstice<br />
<br />
Face: Golem Jawbone, Deathmask of the Elysians<br />
<br />
Arms: Barbed Ringmail sleeves<br />
<br />
Soulders: Tattered Mantle, Elder Wolfhide, Imbued Granite Spaulders, Obulus Death Shroud<br />
<br />
Back: Cloak of Truth, Lodizial Shell Shield<br />
<br />
Waist: Chitinous Belt, Girdle of Mithaniel, Silvery Belt of Contention<br />
<br />
Legs: Kromriff Military leggings, Jarsarth leggings<br />
<br />
Primary: Rune Etched Icewurm Fang, Howling Harpooon<br />
<br />
to be honest, you would be well advised to concentrate on on camping for Velious Quest armor: If you are on Dragon / Dwarf faction, camp KD arena (you can do that with a single grp these days) for the Rune Crafter's armor quests - Rune Crafters would be an improvement in any slot. If your guild is good enough, doing HoT in ToV will get you Wolf Callers quest armor, which is as good as you are gonna get until your guild can cap Derek the Vindicator</div></div><hr />
