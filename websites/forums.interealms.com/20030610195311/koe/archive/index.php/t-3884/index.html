<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Willowwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Saying Hi to all the KoE that I know :)  I am starting to play EQ again and am considering joining the KoE.  As a former member of LOA I know a lot of folks in the Veeshan Alliance not to mention a few former LOA who are in Keepers now....Falamil, Eariana, Fawnea, and I know of a couple others but can't remember now.  From Falamil's praise and from my own experience grouping with KoE on some VA raids and romps I can see why they all chose this guild.  I would like to group with everyone some more so be on the lookout for a Half Elven Bard at some events :)  I'm 47 right now but after a few hours I'll be 48+ soon.  See you all later.<br />
<br />
P.S. A special thanks to Zelfani for that port yesterday..LD deaths can be a pain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Willowwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This is for Zelfani and others to see I can make little flash movies or sigs for anyone in KoE or VA for that matter.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Willowwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hehe actually you know from LOA boards that I use flash a lot.  You know now that you and I are the same level as far as a Bardic duo we could do some damage on some foes.  Heh I'm picturing 2 bards kiting using chant of frost and chant of flame....oooh :).  Look me up on the weekends.  I'm off this Friday maybe we could plan some mayhem eh ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Fallanthas Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hrmmm, bard fear kiting. <br />
<br />
<br />
One twisting chain and fear while meleeing, the other doing the two chants.<br />

<br />
I think I even know a good spot for it.  =)</div></div><hr />
