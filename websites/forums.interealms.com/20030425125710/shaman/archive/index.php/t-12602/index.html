<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chewy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Alright, I just helped a guildy with Lodi this morning and got the belt which sells for about 17k on my server.. My question is, what should I buy with the money?  I've got a good bit of the pieces for solstice ear, and my guild is gonna be doing fear very soon for me.  My guild is in ToV atm, farming HoT and Vindi, occasionally doing WtoV as needed..<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help.</div></div><hr />

Veil of Executioner, Shadel Bandit ring, Coral Ring, switch shiss gloves for Coldain Skin, Solstice earring of course, Metal linked crown, Chitinous belt, Hardened Grey Flesh sleeves, and earring from exec trial (can't frikkin remember the name of it).<br />
<br />
That stuff should give your Sta, AC, Wis, and resists a needed boost.  As it stands, you have segxy hp, but need to give some much-needed luvin to other areas of your profile. :)</div></div><hr />

After that Metal Linked Crown, Bracelet of the Spiritcharmer, and Crystal Chitin Vambraces would give you a lot of bang for the buck.</div></div><hr />
