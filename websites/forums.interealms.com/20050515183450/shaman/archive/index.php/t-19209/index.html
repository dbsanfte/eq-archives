<br />
Thanks everybody :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">As a Shaman Public Service Announcement   I must warn all those in the Shaman community NOT to actually read the comments that are likely to be generated by Gloriana&#8217;s Shaman Proposal post on the Newbie Forum on the Official SoE website.  Reading such inane drivel may actually decrease your intelligence.  While most folks in the Shaman Community are blessed with a surplus of intelligence and wisdom or common sense, it is best not to chance such an unprotected excursion into idiocy.<br />
<br />
If you do wish to post your assent to the proposal as you are encouraged to do, just type &#8220;I agree with Gloriana&#8221; and get the heck off that thread before your brains start to ooze out your ears.<br />
<br />
You have been warned<br />
<br />
We now return you to our regularly scheduled program</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thlexian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Great job on the proposal, everyone!  And ROTF Sionnach!</div></div><hr />

Did you notice I was a big wimp on TNZ and didn't link back to here :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Nice job Gloriana and all who contributed to the proposal.  It doesn't 100% jive with everything I'd personally want (as I'm sure is true of most people, since we have so many diverse abilities), but everything in there makes sense and would be beneficial to everyone, so I threw in my support.<br />
<br />
..and omg, now I know why I don't read those sony boards.  What a bunch of spiteful idiots.  Most of the responses clearly indicate they didn't (or maybe can't) read the proposal at all before hitting reply.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah, I haven't been back since I posted.<br />

Why do people suck so much?<br />
Why daddy why?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">PLEASE, for the love of god, take Sionnach's advice...  DO NOT READ THAT SWILL!!!  I only got half way down the responses before the migrane (sp) set in.  Glorina, I thank all that is sacred that you did not link back to this site.  The last thing I want to see happen to this wonderful website is it being innondated by those intellectually deprived lunatics.<br />

I just went through it really quick and didn't bother reading much of the BS.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Geal Icehammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I read bits. I think its funny they are mad at us for calling them noobs. This is ofcourse after telling us (in the other thread) that we shouldn't ask for changes to help the high end shaman cause there low levels do just fine. Not that calling us hybrids helped the opinion that most of them are noobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Sorry Glori, my advice to just say &quot;I agree with Gloriana&quot; was so that folks would not just type &quot;I agree&quot; which may leave readers wondering which post they agree with.  I guess I could have said type &quot;I agree with the original post.&quot;  <br />
<br />
You are not a wimp by any means and in EQII I think that when the Barbarians rediscover their gods, Gloriana should be one of them.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Turtle is funny. Ever since a &quot;you are an uber so you don't know&quot; rant he posted to me (the very non-uber me) every post of his I read the same picture pops into my head: balding man with a beet red face sputtering madly while frantically typing a reply. It's hard to get annoyed when you're too busy giggling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Chutoi, I read some of your additional posts in the first thread (that inspired the proposal). I'm really impressed with your eloquence and patience!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">They locked it.  They locked it after I tried submiting a response to a couple of the idiots on that board.<br />
<br />
Screw em ... here it is anyway ...<br />
I'm not getting into a flame war here, but how do you expect people to take you seriously when every single thing you post is rude?<br />
The first posts I saw where Chutoi has been rude have been on this thread where he calls Turtle a moron (a label turtle has worked hard to earn IMHO).  On the other thread he was patient and kept his posts civil.  I understand his frustration with a few of the posters here as they seem to be posting out of their butts.  If you want to look at the numbers, a decent and somewhat detailed analysis of upgrades by release is posted:<br />
http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=19149<br />
I can't be bothered with BBCode so copy and paste.<br />
<br />
The analysis details how shaman have fallen behind other priest classes.  The qualitative &quot;proof&quot; offered here is obsurd to say the least.  Warriors have soloed Yedelma (AKA some poster refered to us soloing dragons ... what a joke) as have many other classes and classes like SKs have done significantly better than us soloing in many encounters.  Shaman are no longer the soloers we once were and such statements are laced with ignorance.<br />
<br />
Gloriana was attempting to be honest when she said we can do it all, but we don't do any of it as well as we used to, or as well as we are suppossed to.  Chutoi has given a well worded analysis that I provided a url for on page one of this thread.  If you choose not to read it then you post in ignorance.<br />
<br />
Turtle, speak for yourself.  I am a lvl 65 pre-EP shaman in a small casual guild.  I've been playing since June 99 and I know my class.  I know in LDoN hard missions my heal is a joke and I can't keep an EP geared SK alive on a double pull with mitigating resistant mobs.  Last night in a LDoN NORMAL advent the bard told me to stop slowing as they were not really all that effective considering the Bard was slowing on the pull and that the mobs lasted 25-35 seconds each.  On and LDoN missions where I am grouped with a BL, they usually slow and I cover them with AE slow on overpulls.  Shaman are not a DPS class in a game where DPS is increasingly the winning factor in any encounter.  The era of the long fight is effectively over and this KILLS shaman effectiveness.  To compensate for this and the miserable upgrades we've recieved over 4 expansions, we've put together a coherant proposal that tries to ask for a few minor upgrades to increase our effectiveness in areas that have clearly and quantifiably fallen behind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Heh, the thread over there is locked already.  It amazes me that people can't propose some improvements for the class they play without many others taking offense.  <br />
<br />
I was actually almost to the point where I was going to respond to some of the posts there, but since I have a low post count, it would've been dismissed anyway.  I guess I should've put in some prep time nay-saying other class suggestions to get my post count up so I could've been taken more seriously.</div></div><hr />

Oh well, let them laugh at their own ignorance. So far it looks like the Devs are improving the new Cann close to what we asked for and hopefully some other areas will be addressed. <br />
<br />
If it does, I recomend we go back to TNZ and just put up a Thank You Post for them listening to us. No flames, just an honest thanks for listening. <br />

Thanks for everybody who posted your support there :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>shamanarentbright</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Let me hand you guys a clue:<br />
<br />
The name of the forum is &quot;The Newbie Zone&quot;.  It is provided to assist newbs in learning how to play the game, to share stories, and SPECIFICALLY has a note saying that DEVS DO NOT READ IT.  So why do you spam the board with something that does not fit its use?  Why not go over to the SWG board and post it there too, I'm sure alot of folks who heard of Everquest or maybe canceled there accounts would agree with you too!<br />
<br />
The appropriate place to post is on this board, on server specific boards, and on the developer's forum.  Calling people newbs, insulting them, etc, is not the way to win support and simply makes you look like you do not deserve it.<br />
<br />
All you've done from cross posting in places it doesn't belong is earn yourself a troll... thanks for having me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Kaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">ok I give up where is the developer's forum?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe if the Dev's actually came to the board once in a while and talked to us we would. Frankly, the only board I ever see any SoE person post to regularly is idiotville (IE your board) and the gucomics fourums.</div></div><hr />

Idiotville? You're so cute. You people spend enough time to write up your unabomberesk list of demands, post it on a forum where people obviously don't want to hear it, and then you call THEM idiots?  Isn't that like walking into a Democratic Caucus, striking up a conversation about a Republican, then calling them stupid when they don't want to agree with you?  <br />
<br />
How about we make a little deal: You keep your monkies on this board, we'll keep our monkies there.  <br />
<br />
Oh, and just FYI, for anyone who thinks Sony gives a damn? They don't. If you haven't figured that out by now, then maybe you need to start considering who the real idiots are.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I play a lot of classes and actively participate on a lot of boards. Reading some boards were the people actually make sense and then going to read posts on the newbie zone makes you wonder how some of these people can figure out how to log in to eq even. Or maybe they can't and thats why they just post on the boards all the time. <br />
<br />
Anyways I'm not going to get into a flame war with someone that just came over here to troll. Nice to meet you, enjoy your stay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">If they don't care about our community then why are they making changes to the spells on test that resemble things we asked for?   Oh yeah because they DO care.<br />
<br />
Or what about that ridiculous list of demands from druidville that actually saw them getting live changes that looked suspiciously like their list of demands? <br />
<br />
Oh yeah they do care.<br />
<br />
But you're just a troll,  and you don't care.   All you care about is belittling other's hard work and dedication, and trying to get a little attention the only way how.   I actually feel sorry for you.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Ciele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Considering the quality of responses to the proposals, on the TNZ I'm pleasently surprised.  <br />
<br />
I was expecting much more a sh*t storm.<br />
<br />
Lobbying like this can only help.  Do you really think opinions like &quot;you want to be the most powerful blah blah&quot; or &quot;you already heal too much&quot; or &quot;you want paladins to be nerfed&quot; are really going to affect the thought processes of the live team?  <br />
<br />
One thing I did notice is the total disconnect of people in imagining where EQ will be.  We're at the cusp of a new expansion and people are making comparisons and conclusions based on content and abilities which are OVER A YEAR OLD.<br />
<br />
The aim of this sort of lobbying is to insure that Shaman don't get screwed over in the next expansion (which looked very likely, from the early beta rumors and spell parsing).  <br />
<br />
Many players  could care less about old trivial content.</div></div><hr />

but aslong as it noticed then all good i supose.<br />
<br />
the letter itself is good, but some the first parts do make easy pickings for poeple to take it apart. i.e our confusuin and they we can solo/group/raid, probably should be taking out. we all agree to some extent that healing,dps,buff and debuffing are the main things to look at.<br />
well basically the who class at post 65 (hard ldon. elemental, time)<br />
needs to be rebalanced. and for the quickness eq now goes for.<br />
<br />
the major thing is the speed of casting for most of this, that affects dps, debuffs. if we could cast quicker  both these would improve. <br />
even healing if out ch only took 5 sec to cast it be much more effective.<br />
<br />
basically we are in race, we are tractors and everyone else is supercharged. it all very good saying a tractor is a powerful vechicle.. yes it is but it wont do very well in a race.<br />

<br />
I didn't follow all the threads there on that forum, there are too many clueless morons posting there. But I DO hope that you posted this on Dev boards as well, as the Devs don't really read that much any other forum? And perhaps also e-mailed it to SOE, to few people preferrably?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">Glori, you da bestest!  I laughed till it hurt when I read your edit on the troll's post.<br />
<br />
I can't believe the rampant stupidity on TNZ and the satire post on our suggestions was at best humourless, at worst insulting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>VXThis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">I hope this isn't edited by Gloriana (I thought that was kinda funny, I'm just saying I don't want this viewed in the same respect), though, my purpose is not here to troll so much as to state some obvious facts.<br />
<br />
I am ashamed to be part of the Shaman community, one that turns against one of its own over a simple disagreement about the class.  Yes, I can understand the heated discussions from time to time, and maybe we've all said things we regret (I can say that I have, can you?)  My disagreeing with anyone is not an attack on the Shaman community either, and I have done my best to keep quite civil, and yes made some rather rude comments to a long-time... hrm, (well, shall we say we have had many disagreements before?), on the boards... named Gurck.  I have remained fairly polite, and yet adamant, on the issues and stances that I have taken towards other posters.<br />
<br />
I have a different perspective of things, I've admitted this.  I've admitted I am far more concerned with balancing a class for the majority than the minority, no matter how accomplished that minority is... the majority still matters.  I know many of you are not part of that end game minority, and I honestly have to say, knowing my own abilities it comes across as simply jumping on the bandwagon of some high end players hoping that you get their leftovers, not because you need anything special.<br />
<br />
It might frankly surprise you, Chutoi, that I could most likely get into your guild, or many others, given enough time to aquire certain gear, flag, and AA requirements.  Skill is not something that I lack, and while it is not an indicator of a players skill... why do you think I have different opinions of the class compared to the average poster on the Crucible?  Is it really because I suck and don't know how to play my character, that somehow I would still think the class is quite powerful?  I ask you to use a bit of logic here, as well as others who think along the same lines...<br />
<br />
If I sucked, I would be asking for upgrades too.  This is not saying that all people who want upgrades suck, just, simply, that trying to say that I do defies logic.  I suppose anyone who agrees with me must suck as well?<br />
<br />
Ironically, because I continue to disagree and did not just bend over to those that I disagreed with, it is being told that something is wrong with me.  No... I am afraid that is not the case, but, to the contrary, those who assume that just because someone disagrees, that they are somehow inferior, is an attitude best left to faschists and immature children who have not quite grown out of high school.<br />

By the way, I am hardly some old balding man, I am a 21 year old in the prime of my life and doing well all things considered.  And, honestly, the arguments themselves have not  got my blood boiling.  This childish, immature, and rather pathetic insecurity bubbling up from some folks here is honestly enough to make one ashamed to play the same class as them, or even the same game.  I understand there will always be children in the game, or d00ds, or l33ts, that don't have a friggin clue about the ability to disagree, even passionately, time and time again while still being adults about it.  I am sorry that, in particular, I thought Chutoi was an educated individual... you do not see me calling him a moron, and idiot, a skill-less loser... and I respected his initial postings, but then he digressed, assuming that anyone who disagrees with him is flawed.  This may be popular in American politics my friends, but in the real world, it is disgusting.<br />
<br />
Not everyone on the Crucible, mind you, has been worthy of my negativity on this particular issue.  Some have kept themselves above it, and for that I applaud them.  They will continue to fight the issues without spluttering off insults because I or others don't cave into their way of thinking.<br />
<br />
Just remember, all I have done is disagree, some have added fuel the fire by doing the exact same thing as me... they will say this, I will say that, they will say this, I will say that and so on.<br />
<br />
I don't care if you like me, I don't care if you respect my ideas, I don't care if you agree with me...  but, grow up.<br />
<br />
There is a reason I haven't made it overly obvious who I am, I don't want to be attacked by people who use the security of a computer screen to generate and overblown ego and attempt to annoy someone with their immaturity.  Yes, I do have reason to call people here childish... and it isn't for their ideas, their passion about issues, or anything of that nature... it is the petty name calling, babbling, threatening that is going on.<br />
<br />
Do I really scare you guys, or do you just think that somehow I'm supposed to be intimidated and change my mind?  <br />

Let's see.. I have read quite all your messages and I still not get the point: why, if you think shamans don't need an upgrade and that you are enjoying your playing time as a shaman, are you always contesting what other shamans are saying?<br />
<br />
If you are happy to play like this, all the requested thingies won't have any influence on what you can do nowdays... all it can do will even make it better for you later when you'll be at the step we are reporting issues with shaman. So why does it bother you so much that we call for a different upgrade instead of those SOE want to give us?<br />
<br />
It is true that shamans are powerfull. I've been playing my shaman for many years now and my only alts are bazar trader and guild mule. I have never had the need to play another class as I'm enjoying my shaman.<br />
<br />
But.. because there is a but.. since I hit 65 and met hard hitting mobs (not even yet in EP, but close) I'm loosing something: I'm loosing the excitement of the game where I was able to slow a mob and self-heal myself if I was in trouble.<br />
<br />
Since I was a young shaman , this is what I have always been able to do. This is what makes a shaman powerfull : we don't rely on another class to do our job.<br />
<br />
This is not new, this is since the beginning of EQ. And this is why other want a shaman in group before any other slowing class, regardless if this is not true anymore (we are still speaking of a 65 shaman facing hard hitting mobs, not the other EQ contents where we remain the same).<br />
<br />
This is what we are asking back to SOE : let the shaman be in high encouters events what they were in all their EQ life: the same.<br />
<br />
We are not asking for more power, we are just asking to remain the same and not be a buff bot.<br />
<br />
You said in your messages that perhaps we need a little something in healing, this is true, we do. This means that you actually noticed a lack of healing but you found a way to bypass it. We did that also, but at some point we cannot bypass that anymore.<br />
<br />
You said also (or someone else did, there was so many messages) that all people want from a shaman is to be a buff bot. I don't see myself as a buff bot, I'm sorry. Even if I enjoy buffing people (even the dext and agi or whatever request, I try to buff if I can  :) ), I don't want to stay away from groups because I can't do anymore what I was able to do before and that one member of this group has his own bot shaman to buff while exping without the need of a real shaman.<br />
<br />
If you can see this point, then maybe you'll understand why we are requesting this tiny adjustement for shamans to SOE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">vxthis, i think the other guy was deleted because he broke the posting rules, which are quite clearly stated.<br />
<br />
back to you though.., the main problem i see if you are argueing something that most shaman agree with, you are or where below 65 ,<br />
<br />
for me up to 65 we are still very viable as a class in normal ldon and lower planes and as said need no change, which is what you are saying from your prespective.<br />
<br />
however, once you get 65 and 100+ aa and can do hard ldon adventure and elemental exp groups you will find out what the rest of us are talking about, and it is not just group in raids too.<br />
<br />
the problem as i see it is not really a need for new spell as such, but the only way to correct it would be new spells is 2 fold, <br />
1 our mana regen is active meaning while we regen mana we can`t move,cast other spells do any other command.<br />
with ldon in particualer you dont have a static camp, therefore you are moving and can`t canni while moving, if like me you get extremely fast groups you never stop moving, therefore you can`t canni. bang goes your extra regen  but you still got high mana spells to cast.<br />
2. our spells are slow casting, there fore you can only casting a few before mobs now die, that is a timed limit, something that wasnt so bad before ldon as mobs take longer to kill and you are mainly static.<br />
<br />
what most poeple are worried about, because they can see where we are heading in GoD is that we will only be able to cast slow and debuff .,and nothing else,  if we have to heal we are too slow and cant heal enough to even make up for one mobs round,  thats it your dead. we will become extremely marginalise as the group needs dps more than a very mediocre heal that pallies will almost match , and beastlords slow is pretty much as affective especially for mitagated mobs. why have a shaman who cna only slow, when you can get a pally to tank and help heal almost as good and a beast to slow almost as good but both have extra dps much more that a shaman can with our slows and slow casting spells. (and i am not for one second saying that those classes need to be nerfed or not get the new stuff they get as with all expandsions all classes need a boast, just shaman need a to be realigned too)<br />
as most encounters are becoming faster, huge dps fights. which started with PoP, and was expanded on in LDON. and most likely will be even more extreme in GoD, the shaman will be left to solo, and frankly i dont want to do that.<br />
<br />
edit, whether you choose to believe what 90% of the shaman here are saying or go about happy in what you have got is up to you, you do have a right to have an opinion, just say it and then leave it. you know what you know and we know what we know , and despite the slightly confused first part at the front of the united shaman letter, most shaman know the things that will help put shamn back on track, it is just there are various ways of doing it, and agree which is best is hardest.</div></div><hr />

It is effortless to find two quotes by him that directly contradict one another, and when confronted by them, he comes out with a third thing as &quot;What I really meant&quot;. Its evasive, and points to not being very bright.</div></div><hr />

You said it perfectly.  &quot;I am ashamed to be part of the Shaman community, one that turns against one of its own over a simple disagreement about the class. &quot;<br />
<br />
I think I can safely say most of us are ashamed to have you.<br />
<br />
You're like a bad penny.  It's pretty clear that most of the class seems to disagree with you, but you clearly think you're gods gift to all shaman because you have to reiterate your minority opinion several times a page on any thread on topic.  I'd venture to guess that, from the MASSIVE outpouring of support of the various threads by fellow shaman, that a large majority of shaman have noticed a problem.  That you disagree is also obvious.  Of the three or four shaman who I’ve seen who disagree (compare that with the number that posted in favor!), they were content to post a disagreement, then move on.  They didn’t crap all over class solidarity, didn’t feel the need to post 10 responses on every page trying to argue ANY changes down, and didn’t crap all over a series of threads that MIGHT, for once, have the attention of the developers.<br />
<br />
I find it DOUBLY ironic that you are complaining that changes at level 65 would be too unbalancing when you are (or were) still 64.<br />
<br />
As for getting into our guild, I kinda doubt you would make it.  It’s not a question of gear, or AA, but attitude and intelligence.  We are fortunately in a position to be highly selective in who we recruit.  My personal read on your posts, which I will freely admit can be very different from in-game personas, is that you are someone who cannot let something go.  People with a heck of a lot more experience than you (talking about people other than myself) have identified problems at levels that you admit you haven’t seen.  Nonetheless, you seem to feel it incumbent on yourself to post again and again on the topic.  That sort of dogged determination to hold onto an opinion (in spite of the number of posts dismantling your arguments) does not make for a pleasant guild mate.  It makes you appear to be unable or unwilling to learn or listen to anyone else.  No doubt you’ll be one of those types of people who like to spam raid leaders with lots of ‘suggestions’ during raids, no doubt repeating them multiple times in tells and /gu.  That kind of massive egotism is awful in a guild situation.  I’ve had to put up with guild mates like that.  Not posting your in-game name is probably the smartest thing I’ve seen you do on the boards yet.  You’d get blacklisted.<br />
<br />
Do I doubt your skill?  Hell, yes.  From the sound of things, you really haven’t put yourself into challenging groups or situations on a regular basis.  If you never have trouble keeping up, then you haven’t been in a decent, fast-paced group.  Don’t tell me about your elite PoV desert group that could clear all 6 west castle golems before respawn.  <br />
<br />
You seem to be incapable of understanding (or just don’t care) that shaman arguably hit more of an artificial cap than other classes at the end game.  You seem to think that because you’re not having issues at your level, that no one else is—nor should anything be done about it.  Never mind that from reports it’s about to get HARDER in GoD, and with no changes to shaman.  Go follow your series of posts from my initial post onward.  You’ve waffled, crawfished, backed-up, and changed arguments numerous times.  As soon as you’re proven wrong, you try to find some other justification for your position.  Actual facts haven’t proved to much of a hindrance to you.<br />
<br />
Initially, I was willing to have a debate with you on the topic.  However, at this point I think it absolutely clear that you aren’t really interested in debating.  For every person who posts that you’re wrong, you feel the need to immediately post reiterating your position so that every other post on the topic is effectively you bashing your fellow shaman.<br />
<br />
Eventually quantity of posts may be able to drown out quality.  I think that’s what worried most of the people who’ve spoken with me—that any dev’s hitting the thread(s) will skip around and only end up reading the your 10,000th post.  I guess that’s what you’re hoping for.  At any rate, I have yet to see any of your posts contribute something meaningful to any of the threads.<br />
<br />
I can’t say I’m surprised to see your age.  That kind of intransigence and refusal to entertain arguments is typically the purview of the very young.<br />
<br />
Is this a personal attack on you?  Probably.  Do I care particularly?  No—you destroyed your own credibility early, and turned yourself into an annoyance factor.  I don’t mind debating, nor being proven wrong.  It’s happened before, and will happen again.  I encourage suggestions from people—however, I don’t have much interest in hearing the same thing over and over when it’s been effectively disproved.  That’s destructive, not constructive.<br />
<br />
Please stay on the newbie boards, or at least, away from here.  :p<br />
