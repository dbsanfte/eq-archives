The only detailed DOWNLOADED Slow list for your story window I can find is from eqinterface and its huge crap.  Anyone know where I can get a very recent version??</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zammatacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Science of War had one that goes into the LDoN storyline window.  But either they took it down, or my browser from work can't get there.  I keep hitting a 404 error when I try.  I'll try again from Home tonight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mohadeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Zammatacus could you post the link you can't get to.. maybe we can.  If that doesn't work.. post the link to Science of War... I will look for it, but incase I don't find it please post.  Thanks</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Numgrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I looked thru all of the slow listings that I could find, and also used our own Crucible slow chart and compiled them into a new storyline mod. Most seemed to be incomplete or inaccurate including the old Science of War one. <br />
<br />
If interested, it can be downloaded here Num's Slow Index (http://www.eqinterface.com/sdownload/fileinfo.php?s=&amp;id=2816) <br />
<br />
Hope it comes in handy  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It most assuredly will. At first glance you managed to add quite a few mobs that were missing from the older ones, thanks ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Detron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I got another slow list which I keep updated as I progress through POP. This list was taken from a guild that broke up and I decided to adopt it.<br />
