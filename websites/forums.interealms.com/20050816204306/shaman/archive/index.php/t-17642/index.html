<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yes, it's that time again.. donation time! This is our 6th donation drive which means we have been completely self-sustaining for three years now. It is through the combined effort of all of our contributors that you can continue to read this board with no popups, banners or advertising of any sort.<br />
<br />
Everquest still manages to have hundreds of thousands of players and it shows no end in sight. This site and the people that visit are part of the great community base that keeps the game still going. I'm proud to have run this place for so long, all the while maintaining a knowledgeable, fun and entertaining destination for not only Rangers and Shaman, but every class in Everquest. The next installment in the Everquest series will no doubt provide us with even more enjoyment for years to come. There are also many other MMORPG games out and more to come. I hope this community continues to thrive and with your help, it can!<br />
<br />
So, I ask again of you, please help keep this place going. As most of you know, bandwidth isn't free, especially with the huge amount of traffic this site still has. The cost for this bandwidth and the dedicated server I run on for the next 6 month period will be $1800 and our licenses for the vBulletin software are current, so it's just the $1800 needed for this drive. As usual, I'll keep everyone informed as to how much money we have received and provide updates when I can to how the drive is going. Every little bit helps! We now have over 26,000 registered users, 5,000 more than we had 6 months ago! It just goes to show this place is still thriving. If I could get every person to donate a buck, I'd never have to ask for donations again :)<br />
<br />
Last drive, there were some questions as to how these donations are used and what these drives are for. It's quite simple, EVERY dime from these donations goes towards the server payment. Once the $1800 dollars is reached, I make a post that we have reached the drive goal and I stop the drive.. that's it! In the past, in what started as a joke, someone sent me a donation after the drive and said, &quot;Use this for beer money!&quot; That grossly got turned around by a disgruntled visitor and resulted in a lot of wasted time on everyones part to clarify things. I never use any donations for personal reasons unless you say I can :) If I receive donations after the drive has closed, they can be applied to the next drive, or I can refund them to whoever sent them, if you wish. I hate that I have to explain this... after all, this has been the case for three years, but one or two squeaky wheels can waste a lot of time. At any time, I could have commercialized the mess out of this site, but it has never been about any money. Sure, it would be nice to make money for this, but I have a real job :)<br />
<br />
As usual, you can donate via PayPal, or you can send me a PM, or email at sunmoon@interealms.com and I'll send you my address if you want to donate via check or money order. Thank you everyone that can help keep this site going. I can't thank you all enough for the years of enjoyment I have had running these sites!!<br />
<br />
To the future...<br />

After reading some of the stuff that goes on here and seeing how far people can push and get away with it you probably deserved to get banned and therefore you arent welcome here.<br />
