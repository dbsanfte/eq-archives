<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Banana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How does one go about getting the expedition? And how hard would it be for a group of ele/time geared people? Good solid group cle shm enc (or bard )war dps dps. Any help would be appreciated, thinking of farming them for rings ( heard they drop ALOT ). <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">the one ikkinz trial where there is a garage type door infront of you as you zone in with  2 mobs infront of it...and on teh other side of the door are about 6 mobs with a named...that one? i've only been in one, 1 groupable ikkinz trial.<br />
<br />
if so you can farm that zone-in named every 24 hours. takes about 30 minutes to clear and kill him, give or take a few minutes.<br />
<br />
the person to see is an FD monk. that's all i know. oh and the named is immune to slow. i cripple it and dump my heals on the tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Honestly?  I'd say pretty hard--though I did it last before they made the changes to content.  That first named used to be one of the two hardest encounters in the ikkinz trials.  Assuming you have a beefy warrior with good agro proccing weapons and augs, it's doable.  Replace one of your dps mobs with a druid.  My recommended group would be:<br />
<br />
war, clr, dru. ench. shm, dps<br />
<br />
Clear around named.  One mob is around corner and will add--have ench use an eyeball to target it and (if it's not yellow) you can paci before pull.  Alternately, send a pet in after it.  The named and the mob will eat the pet in half a second, and charge.  Mez/root the non-named and everyone zone.  Root/mez should hold until you get back, and you can agro without getting the named.<br />
<br />
Shaman are a real hinderance in that encounter.  We're poor dps, too low for healing, and high agro if we do start dps.  Let the warrior fire repost disc to get solid agro, then go pure dps.  I stacked 3 DoTs and almost chained a rain and VS (pause occasionally for crits and the like).  Let the druid DS eat the mob up (since it's unslowable).  Druid and cleric will have to basically chain heal, and it's a horserace to get it dead before they go OOM.<br />
<br />
(Keep in mind, this is pre-change.  Not sure how much is different now)<br />
<br />
To get the expedition, you south past the first temple (with the smoke pouring out), then follow valley right (west) past the next temple.  The path will turn south again, and shortly thereafter, there is another temple on the left hand side of the next intersection.  At the NW corner of that T-intersection is a FD leezard monk.  Talk to him and follow [ ] script and he'll give you the expedition.<br />
<br />
To get in, get lev and SoW up (SoE better).  Lev across to the south west wall of the T-intersection, then get high on wall.  Go east across road/valley to wall along side of temple.  If you have a rogue in group, send him to scout out which of the three entrances it is (left, right, middle).  The cleric should BDA the enchanter and DA himself, and everyone run for the entrances with SoE.  You can lev over most of the monsters, and, hopefully, either make it in by following the DA folks (as mobs will chase them), or at least die close enough that your rogue can drag you in, or with the new expanded /corpse circle, someone can drag you from the ramp and not agro the mobs.  I don't recommend trying to clear, there are a TON of mobs there to get into the temple.<br />
<br />
Remember to warn in /ooc about trains to the temple.  /ooc TRAIN LEFT IN IKKINZ 1, WARN YOUR GUILDS  That way people don't zone out into a train if they have a pull going badly in another trial.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>SneakyB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You can always use a mage's CoH for pulling too.<br />
<br />
I was told by my friends yesterday that after the last patch, the nameds are not always up, and it is a one hour lockout to get another instance.<br />
<br />
As to being Time-geared? Well, my group was not, although we are the best geared group in our guild. We passed the first 3 Ikkinz Trials.  Of course now we have some of the time equivalent gear from Ikkinz.<br />
<br />
I personally haven't done a trial after the patch, but seeing as someone posted that DD was slowable now, maybe the other named are as well.<br />
That will certainly make shamans feel a bit more useful in these trials.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The biggest problem with shaman and Ikkinz trial is shaman as secundary healer.  I'm time+ geared, and I blow a whole mana bar during one named fight.  But before I finished all healing AA's and made sure I had both an improved healing and a quickening item equipped my healing, combined with a SL spamming cleric, was not enough to keep an 11,000+ HP warrior up.  3rd healer might be advisable if you're &quot;only&quot; elemental geared.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Did this trial yesterday. Annihilator wasn't up when we zoned in. Also the slaughterer and whatever the other one was (used to be triggers for the DD) Weren't up either. we just pulled and cleared to the DD.<br />
<br />
about 15 minutes in, the druid went LD, and the cleric had to run to the store and was gone about 20 minutes. I was able to heal on the trash, but we had a time geared tank from another guild with us, and I have pretty much every focus available in tier 4 of time or under and I have Daluda's (Helps a TON)<br />
<br />
Luckily we had just gotten the named alone in his room when the druid came back from LD and the cleric got back from the store. The Diabolic Destroyer himself is slowable now (Partial). You can't defensive on him or he ignores your tank. you CAN riposte disc though, which with a beefy 2h weapon might knock off 10% of his HPs alone. I basically kept bane and clicky pox on the DD and kept people alive who were soaking up damage from the adds, and spam healed the tank when I could. He dropped and I scored myself a new bracer.<br />
<br />
This expedition is pretty fun and challenging now :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Pfft...we used to do the first named with a cleric/shaman combo before we started raiding time, and Henora used to do it regularly and her guild isnt even elemental flagged. On one occasion we had a shaman keep my warrior up solo (the cleric agroed and bit it) from 20% down to 3%. Granted, that was lucky, but it does mean that the encounter was not as difficult as some here would imply. On the other hand I was once in a group that failed 3 times in a row with 3 clerics in it. The skill and experience of the healers plays a large part in success (or it did before the nerf). They do need the basic capabilities of course, but any mature elemental and above cleric/secondary healer combo should manage just fine.<br />
<br />
Your melee also need to know what they are doing btw ;).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It sounds like they made PA an uncommon spawn now with the recent changes though. Since the encounter has basically been nerfed, I suppose they dont want people easily farming the GPR.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Serranex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm absolutely shocked right now. Just wiped 10 times in Ikky 1. Shaman are SO useless on this trial it's not even funny. What the hell am I supposed to do. I'm with the best equipped knight in my guild (10k+) best equipped cleric and best equipped druid (both have 7.5k+ mana pools). Like we're barely in time, and this cleric/druid are better equipped than many time equipped clerics. Should be no problem at all. The SK is pretty damn good too, knows how to keep aggro and such.<br />
<br />
GREAT. What the hell am I supposed to do. VS + Bane? Yeah ****in right...Our healers were running LoM because we couldn't do DPS fast enough. I'm so pissed right now. I feel like I've let the whole group down because of my inability to do anything. I'm not sure what my role should be. Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I beat trial 7 with warrior, bard, cleric, shaman, rogue, ranger, all heavy EP gear and solid aa. <br />
<br />
We were first (and only so far I think) group in my guild alliance to beat this, so shaman don't suck totally here since they made named slowable.<br />
<br />
If you want my suggestion, dump the druid and get another DPS class ;) If you have healing aa/daluda secondary healing here is very doable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>EQOracle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have been farming rings for about two weeks now with a few guildies. The rogue has completed all three single group trials and was able to get each of the expiditions. We would check for named each time lockout timer was up  (an hour if you dont kill a named, 8 hours if you do kill a named). We did not kill the DD only if there was PA or Rav etc. Ikk 2 named is the easiest to get to if I remeber, since he is right at zone in. The other two named arent hard to get to at all, only need to pull a few mobs (pacify owns for single pulls here). We have never failed on one of these and the groups where normally war cler sham rog wiz ranger. Almost all of us have the ring now, and most the meelee have the earring/bracer that can drop. Also was able to get the Incantor mask of death to drop for us while we were pulling to a named. It isnt hard at all with a beefy tank, a slower, good cleric (Holy Light helps here) and nice dps. Also we are not time geared.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sinjuneq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Our group has tried it several ways with several classes. We took him down with War, ench, cleric, shaman, 2 rangers with TS. As for my duties, I sent my dog, Cast AA dogs, slowed, and spam healed my ass off and threw in some dots in between. Ikkiniz 1 (Trial 7) last boss is the nastiest of all the 3 Ikkinz trials. The adds are killers and good CC and major dps is the answer there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I did this trial the first time yesterday. Our group was: cleric, warrior, enchanter, shaman, monk and bard. We succeeded on the 4th attempt.<br />
<br />
DD was partially slowable. I caught aggro and bit it the first couple of attempts by attempting to add DPS so on our final, successful attempt I just back up healed (after slowing). I did send in swarm pets and pop my healing ward.<br />
<br />
The ring did drop (grats bard). Two other named in the zone dropped nothing, which I thought was pretty lame (still 0 spells).<br />
<br />
BTW - anyone noticed anything odd with crit heals? During one of the fights, I crit healed 5 times in a row. It was pretty nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Serranex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Interesting, all the posts below don't include a druid in the mix. Maybe if I asked the druid to do DPS and have me and cleric heal? I have Daluda's and maxed healing AA's (and a pretty sizable mana pool myself). Would that be more effective/enough? Thanks for all the advice though, slept on it, and I'm ready to go back for more rofl.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Glori.. I went a streak once where I kept up my guilds main tank about two months ago versus the Tipt final Archer from 90% to 5% when I didn't get a single freakin crit heal.  I must have landed about 15 non crit heals.. pissed me off cause I could have used a couple here and there (cleric died to ramp 2 seconds into the fight).  I also did trial 3 run once about two weeks after that where I hit a crit heal on the main tank in 5 consecutive casts and then 7 for 8.  Was weird, but nice at the time.  It's just steaky.<br />
<br />
I haven't done this trial since they made the named slowable, but I have completed each and every one of them when they weren't slowable providing either dps, or being the back up healer.  These can now be done with lesser geared characters, but you kinda have to know what to do and how to play your class.  Really, I would honestly not go into any of them expecting to complete them the first try, especially if you haven't done them before.  Some of the most rag-tag groups I've been in tehre with before have succeeded first go (try, me and cleric healing, pally, bard and warr dps when the mage died to the second priest 2 secs into the 2nd trial final named... we got the last Priest down to 1% when we lost) and have failed miserably with a far superior group (two rogues, shaman, cleric and druid healing and the servers beefiest warr tanking).  It's all just in the makeup of the group and how good the people are that are doing it.  I've taken over for extended periods of time as the main healer and only slower while the cleric was medding or ld.  Just have to be on your toes and smart about things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The biggest trick i've noticed to the healing is not to just spamm heals on the mt. Thats just asking for them to die. Really what you want with 2 healers is alternating heals. You still wanna be casting pretty much as fast as you can but you want your heals staggered so tank is getting 2 small heals every 2 seconds instead of both every 4 seconds. That does a much better job of keeping a tank up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Nakukak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Incite will cause the aggro to bounce around, just as if DD memblurred every tick. Beware.<br />

<br />
-Nakukak<br />
<br />
Didn't do anything of the sort when I did the trial after the changes. You probably just had a tank who doesnt know how to tank mobs like this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I think he meant defensive. if the tank uses defensive, evasive, or stonewall, each tick it drops the warrior to 2nd on the agro list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">did this a couple of weeks ago with warrior, paladin, shaman, enchanter, cleric, monk<br />
<br />
we ended up winning barely with the monk tanking the DD for the last 1% after the warrior, paladin and cleric all bit it, we then kept the 1 add that was up mezzed untill we got everyone back.<br />
<br />
got slow in right away, which was pretty helpful</div></div><hr />
