<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I need some advice, we had our first shot at him tonight (THO that is), I am sure we had enough people and power but we had a nightmare with the adds. (32 peeps, 5 Clerics tons of DPS, I slowed him second shot with Malos and Sinia plus OOS and Tash)<br />
<br />
We started fighting Elders and never stopped with at a minimum 3 at any one time in camp all the way to THO.<br />
<br />
Then as soon as we were ready to do him he Fury'ed the MA right into a couple more adds, we held out for about 2-3 mins but the MA was having trouble staying on target due to Fury? (is it a fear type spell?) and the THO tore the skirts off our Clerics and so we evaced since the 2 adds were still there too.<br />
<br />
I am sure someone here has some advice on how to approach this guy without ending up with so so so many adds, any advice avail?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Be prepared to engage when you knock out that last elder. They have a long respawn (30 minutes I think), so should allow time for some mgb's and the engage. <br />
<br />
To keep your tank in line, have your other melee line up behind him at max melee range to stop him if he gets feared. <br />
<br />
Don't want to spoil the whole thing for you though. It's a looooong fight, think 20 minutes or so.</div></div><hr />

Overfiend's fury is one of his AE's (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=2073&amp;source=Live).  It is a slow spell, and is what makes THO suck.  If your tank isn't holding aggro, try getting chanters/sk to cast aggro spells on him, and give him plenty of time to build up aggro before engage.<br />
<br />
His other AE, Feeblemind, makes you fizzle a lot (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=2899&amp;source=Live).  In my experience, though, clerics have never had an trouble casting CH with this effect one.  Your nukers will fizzle all their mana away, but you should be fine on healing.  RGC takes this one in one shot.  What I do on most THO fights is stand behind his pillar and cast RGC on every nuker I can.<br />
<br />
If you are getting elder respawn, then you just need to engage faster and make sure you aren't positioned anywhere where they can aggro you.  Casters behind the big pillar, everyone else meleeing.  We have never gotten respawn adds, not sure how you did it.</div></div><hr />

[QUOTE]<br />
<br />
Most people doing THO now will have no chance at getting RGC first. No one in my guild has it except the lead cleric as far as I know. Two casts of regular remove curse also works. Which is what I'm usually doing with my shaman during the fight. <br />
<br />
Keep all your healer types behind the right side pillar.<br />
<br />
He's very easy to slow so after initial agro just about any tank type can tank him.<br />
<br />
Have a mellee time and call out his AE. Casters should have enough time to get a few nukes off between each cast. <br />
<br />
Overfiends fury you can't really do anything about until after the fight so just ignore it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Fury isn't a fear or knockback that I recall,so I'm curious how your tank got &quot;Fury'd into adds&quot;.  I don't remember ever seeing him cast any sort of fear/knockback at all...<br />
<br />
It's a pretty straightforward fight just takes forever and has been pretty much explained in detail here already now.  /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">THO is a heck of a lot harder than Rhag1/2, who have a good chance of dropping RGC. RGC is also researchable...where the pieces for it drop I have no idea. Lacking that, regular remove curse is good, and better still is radiant cure, which IIRC can be cast through the fizzle curse. Make groups accordingly.<br />
<br />
Last time I fought THO, we engaged almost immediately after the last room guard died. He's not a belly caster, and is rooted, so it is trivial to debuff the hell out of him before you start the fight. Melees in close proximity to THO, all casters behind the pillar. The overfiend's fury is a procced AE, can't do much about it, but you can get the timing down for the fizzle curse. Nukers (and for shamans, dotting, THO has crappy PR/DR) step out from behind the pillar, cast a couple times, then hide again. A good tactic is to have your int casters (and shadowknights) practice their no-fizzle-below-level-X AA...it supercedes the fizzle curse, and allows them to cast freely...lower level spells, but better that than NO spells. Never had any adds.<br />
<br />
The elders adding during the pull is just how it goes. There are lots of them, and they respawn fairly fast, so they need to die in bunches.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">yeah i'd wonder how you got adds too. He doesn't cast or proc any sort of fear or knock back that I've ever seen. He's really about the same as the RoS for a fight. His dps is a joke just has lots of hps. Have the casters hide while the melee's beat him down and throw an occational heal on other people to heal up from the ae and just collect your loot.<br />
<br />
Either you took a long time, 30 minutes plus to clear his room and kill him, or someone was wandering an aggroed things they didn't need too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">How many points is Radiant Cure, 2? I think it cures Feeblemind, and you can MGB it. You get the idea, if you have enough shaman and don't blow MGB just before the fight then you can pretty much RC a whole raid 2-3 times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Radiant cure isn't a buff so it isn't mass group buffable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Best thing to do is set up your raid behind the pillars and wait from the elders to repop.  Once you clear the repops of them, go ahead and and debuff/slow THO then send in your MT.  It may take some more time to wait on repops before clearing, but it works out in the long run.  1st time we did him fight lasted about 20 minutes or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>rebul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have done THO with guild twice now, for the elder's last time we ended up with 8 or 9 in camp initially, took a while to take down.  The 2 on the right side of the THO room were left up, but when we got him to around 35% or so, someone either aggroed them, or THO feared one of our tanks close enough for aggro.  I think your problem is you need to take out the elders faster, pull more than 3 at a time and have people offtank them all =)</div></div><hr />

My guild had never been able to find this mob up on our server as we raid PST timezone. It is researchable, but requires yaelth's compendium 73(R) which is ultra rare (same damn piece needed for PE as well). I remember reading a while back in the spell section of someone getting 73(R) to make PE, but made RGC instead and sold it for 100k. <br />
<br />
I'd really love to get this spell if I could though, getting rid of things like grieg's AE using normal remove curse is the suck.</div></div><hr />

Who said anything about a raid? Rhag1 is 1-groupable easily. Just have a group in there to hunt for pieces for emp key (which you'll probably need to work on anyway, and might as well get it over with as fast as possible) and make sure they have someone who can track...when Rhag1 pops, go torch him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Lor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">yaelth's compendium 73(R) has dropped several times both on the way to THO/BB spawns and to the various mobs in Ssra.

Best to my knowledge Radiant Cure IS MGBable.  MGB just takes a grp spell and casts it as a AE.  Radiant Cure is a grp spell and as such is MGBable.  I know MGB Radiant Cure is done a lot on Grummus raids and I have personally done it on a late night Trak raid.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Hiho,<br />
<br />
Elder in the cave of THO have a long respawn (very different from the ones on the way in). So clear them fast and engage THO shortly after and you won't get adds.<br />
Overfiend's Fury: Cannot cure with RGC, can be cured by Radiant cure 1 (it's magic based and can be dispelled though). I wouldn't even bother with it, he procs it way too often. Just drop Regrowth on all and it takes care of the damage. ure when THO down.<br />
Feeblemind: Caster can hide from Feeblemind behind big pillar. Make someone call when he AEed, it's timed. Nuker/Dotter can come out after AE and do their stuff. Can be cured with 1 cast RGC or 2 cast RC.<br />
<br />
Some of you might have done THO a while back .. so you might have missed that he got a targeted Fear effect now. Might be a melee proc. Only the one who gets hit (which should be one tank as you can give him some time to get good aggro) is affected. Either get VERY high MR on this tank, or use a fearless tank (AA skill).<br />

Ask others near you not in your group if they got cured.  The answer will be no.<br />

No icon = not MGBable.</div></div><hr />

MGB Celestial Elixir is cast on Grummus raids, or other heal over time spells of that variety.<br />
Mass Group Buff only affects buffs.<br />
It's not called Mass Group Spell.</div></div><hr />

Probable quote from SoE:  To put to bed the rumor that we hate Shamans, let me say this; we weren't even aware we HAD a class called that.  We just thought we had big Druids running around.</div></div><hr />

If no one goes near them you can kill THO without ever aggroing them. It's pretty easy for someone to screw it all up though and bring them into the fight.</div></div><hr />

Grats on wasting mass group BUFF then. If it isn't a buff it isn't mass group BUFFable. Don't beleive me test it out yourself. If it don't have an icon it don't work.</div></div><hr />
