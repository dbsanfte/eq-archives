<br />
<br />
ps don't post wrestling is fake, I know that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I dunno man, I dunno.  Seems to have become pervasive.  Other than that it's great now.<br />
<br />
HOLLA......IF YA HEAR ME!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Racknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Rasslins fake</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ridik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The nut shots don't bother me, I've been watching since I was 6 and after 20years, you just develop this mental filter that sifts out all the homo stuff.  But ever since it was pointed out to me, I can't filter out the sweat stain that RVD gets down the crack of his ass week after week after week.  He used to be my favorite wrestler, I was a huge mark for him in ECW days.  But now that magic of the whole ****ing show is ruined forever by that dire need of a maxi pad to put on his flooded ass, just kills it for me.<br />
<br />
btw, BIG props to Angle for having the work ethic and testicular fotitude to go on with his WM main event despite having a severly F'd up neck and needing major surgery.<br />
<br />
Also, I've been looking for a good wrestling forum for some months now.  If anyone knows one thats not just filled with stupid fanboys and is actually populated by smart marks let me know.  I've been without a home for such discussion since X-Entertainment killed thier forums.  Matt is a nazi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Angle has a phenomenal work ethic and it's a credit to his drive that he will go through with it, but I think he's going to cripple himself at Wrestlemania.<br />
<br />
On the side note, Rock vs Stone Cold.  Will they finally let Rock win?  Ahhh hell no!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I like Rock better as a baddy, he is sooo good at calling people it laugh my head off.<br />
<br />
PS wrestling is getting really crap, haven't watched it properly for bout 1 year now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you haven't watched it properly, then you do not know how it really is :)  ther eare some great athletes now, but I hope they stop the Rock vs. Austin thing and use Austin to elevate someone's career...like Test.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ridik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">From the scoops I've read, Austin will win, because rock is going hollywood fulltime.  Goldberg is already signed, may debut at WM or the week after to set up fued with winner of Rock/Austin.  <br />
<br />
I agree that WWE needs to use it old stars to push the young talent, but dont look for Austin to job too much since he just got back and the reason he left was cuz he had is back on the mat too much.  If anyone should drop a strap, drop a win, and drop off the face of the planet its captain a$$forehead himself, HHH.  Its a shame that getting all roided up, spiting when you talk and banging the boss's daughter will get you farther than actually having god given talent.<br />
<br />
Test gets to knock stacy nightly, that is reward enough for a clumsy mulefaced man, he doesnt need airtime too.  Unless its footage of stacy going to town on the ground round, then it'd be worth a viewing.  <br />
<br />
WM winner predictions<br />
Austin (standard welcome back WM win, ie; HHH last year)<br />
Lesnar (cuz Angle is a cripple, a brave cripple, but TIMMAH!! none the less)<br />
Team Angle (still in mid push, WM win establishs them as a legit tag team and not just gimmick spin offs)<br />
Dudleys (only real tag team left in the whole Fed and they know it)<br />
Underseller &amp; Jones (big show loses every WM)<br />
HHH (cuz steph likes anal)<br />
Hogan (just signed a new contract)<br />
Jericho (cuz Michaels is finally humble and knows when to suck it up for the betterment of someone else)<br />
Rey Rey (cuz he is the sh*t, thats right the sh*t)<br />
<br />
man I need to find a real rasslin forum, look what spills out of me with only minutes to type.  I'm pent i believe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I went through a phase where I was hardcore into Pro Wrestling for like a year.  <br />
Then I kinda lost interest and only caught it every once in a while.  <br />
Then my interest in it dropped off completely and I haven't watched it in over a year.  Just got way too cheesy with stale, repetitive storylines.<br />
<br />
Something here that caught my interest tho concerning The Rock.  What's going on with him?  He's going heel or on his way out of the wrestling biz all together?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ridik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Rock wants to concentrate on his movies for a bit, and has been pretty much a part-timer for the past year.  He'll put Goldberg over in the next month or 2 and then be gone for a year or more.<br />
<br />
Also after watching WM on sunday I have to say what a surprise.  I worried the whole time that Angle would be the one to break his neck, and instead its lesnar that took the hella evil face first shooting star into the mat.  One of the worst missed moves I've ever seen, its amazing his head didnt just rip off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zmabik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Actually Lesnar doing the Shooting Star was amazing, but he tried to do it from way to far away. Angle was over half way across the ring, and doing the shooting star doesn't give you much distance. (Proved by Billy Kidman)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If you think &quot;wrasslin&quot; is fake, tell it to Owen Hart.<br />
<br />
Yeah, it's scripted, yeah it's gratuitous violence mixed with sexual innuendo, but they DO go flying through the air and they DO get hurt.<br />
<br />
Soap Opera for men I like to call it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Rasslins fake<br />
<br />
You lie, Racknar you're a big fat lier....<br />
<br />
it's all real.<br />
<br />
I knew my wife was the one for me when I took her to see the WWF about 9 years ago before we were married. I bought her a big foam hand. Expained who people were and why so and so hate each other etc. She didn't think that she was going to enjoy it but as the night wore on she got into it more and more, until the final match between the Undertaker, and Earthquake. <br />
<br />
It was a casket match where Paul bearer, brought the undertake to the ring in a casket. It was going backwards and forwards until the undertaker got the upper hand. The crowd went silent as the undertaker was about to slam earthquake...<br />
<br />
my wife got all excited jumper out of her seat and shouted &quot;eat mat!&quot; waving her big foam hand... I grinned and thought that's-ma-girl.<br />
<br />
She realised what she'd done and sat sat down going red from all the looks she got.<br />
<br />
So you go someplace else and spread your dirty anti-rasslin properganda elsewhere  :p</div></div><hr />
