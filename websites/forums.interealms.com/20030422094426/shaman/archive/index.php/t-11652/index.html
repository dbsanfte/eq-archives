<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tepxal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am a level 52 Shaman and mostly solo. I generally play at off times and have to go AFK frequently.<br />
<br />
I am trying to determine if the JBB is worth scimping and saving for the next 2 month or so to get the money to buy it. <br />
<br />
Does anybody know how difficult it would be to hunt and loot a JBB instead of buying it?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you for your assistance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Juff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you mostly solo, the JBB/horse combo will prove invaluable to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>howie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">JBB is well worth the money and effort to get.  I always joke with friends and tell them it's my best dot.  Being that I can cast it continuosly every 10 sec for 263DD.  Over the length of a fight that ADDS up to alot of damage.  At 52 I was able to solo white and yellow mobs in Maidens Eye, the fights were close but the JBB made the difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">At level 65 I still use it. Nothing beats mana free damage.</div></div><hr />

 i can back that up.<br />
<br />
Recently i have decided to get another wrist item to up HP and wis and such when im not wearing my JBB , but this would likely only be on raids and such or soloing in PoP content like HoH or PoV or something of the such. I do ALOT more then those 2 things.<br />
<br />
If its going to drive you nuts working for it , you can live without it , if you feel you can make the cash for it without burning or something  then go for it. You will love it when you get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Reave</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm still using mine a good bit at 62 as well.  it is worth whatever time it takes you to save up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah I do the same thing. I have a better stat bracer that I switch out my JBB with when i am not going to be using it. However I just got the Winterstorm off THO and I might use that instead of my JBB for mana free dd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yep...its a great buy.  I didnt have enough for mine till I hit about 48, but Im glad I was able to get one. <br />
<br />
Still use it all the time.  True, 263dd agains planar mobs isnt much, but it the fight is 90 secs long, Ive done 2014dd, assuming no resists and partials. Add in my ebolt to that and its over 3K damage.  nothing to sneeze at, when all the group wants me for is slows and buffs.  /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Reave</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I use mine mostly in xp groups after landing a torrent of poison, or when soloing.  Many, many uses for that damage still, especially if you have a horse and are outdoors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tepxal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thank you all for the input. Think I will work on raising money for a JBB. Now I just need to figure out how to multiply my bank account by 10 so I can get the JBB and a horse.  <br />
<br />
Been hunting Seafury Cyclops and Gornit whenever I can. Hill Giants in Rathe Mountains are over farmed. Does anybody have any other ideas on making money?<br />

<br />
Thank you,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I just finnaly got rid of mine at level 61 but only because I picked up torpor today. Definitly get it if you can very useful to you until you get torpor, especially if you solo.<br />
<br />
Oh for pp camp the arch magi in guk. Least on CT the robe sells for 4-5k and it's an easy solo spot at 52.</div></div><hr />
