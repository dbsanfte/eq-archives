<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Orecets Ellrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a level 30 shaman who came out of a 2 year retirement, and he is in need of something in his shoulder slot. (cuz he has NOTHING)<br />
<br />
What could a solo level 30 shaman.... Or my girlfriends solo level 50 druid do to equip that slot? <br />
<br />
I like quests!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">buy a tattered mantle for about 200pp.  I wore one from level 10 to 60 (and am still wearing it).  12 ac 20 hp, nothing you can solo will give you anything better, and it's dirt cheap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gorck Da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I use the Jade Chokidai Spaulders from Chardok. VERY nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Orecets Ellrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My new best friend just gave me a pair of those spaulders last night! As well as a Earring that casts Scale of wolf and a KICKMYASS charm that goes in the range slot (7 ac 5 wis!)<br />
<br />
I LOVE PASQUE!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Tattered mantle is good (12 Ac +disease resist from memory)<br />
If you can get 3 or 4 friends of level 45 - 50 or thereabouts, you can get the mantle yourself - it drops of a girrila thingy in Burning woods.<br />
<br />
A good alternative is the Sonic Wolf Hide shoulders; only 10AC but with +wis and various other stats and resists too. Again, campable with a small group of 45+ characters.<br />
<br />
You could also do the Thurgy Shawl Quest - getting to the 3rd shawl is easy enough, but thereafter it becomes time consuming. Not much AC on shawl tho - bit too druidic for my liking heh heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Inqubus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Tattered Mantle drops off Gullerback in Burning Woods.  My regular group of a 50 Druid and 50 Rogue took him down twice last night.  From what I could tell, he is Very magic resistant.<br />
<br />
First time, I tried to Malosi and Turgur's him while Rogue meleed straight up, never got either to stick, was a tough fight.  Second time, I just dotted him up with Plague, VoTS and EBolt and kited him around while the rouge BS'd and Druid dotted, was a quick and easy kill.  Something to keep in mind if you're thinking about soloing him.  He conned blue both times we killed him, and after they left, I saw a white con Gullerback.<br />
<br />
So I don't think he would be soloable at all due to his MR, unless you're going to kite Druid style with no melee to help out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Heelah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">OMG...starting to feel dumb.....VoTS and E-Bolt stack?!!?<br />
/puke<br />
thats tha sheeot! (gonna go try this soon as i get home!!!!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Check out an elderwolf hide from hollowshade.  Good Ac, nice little wis bonus, easily obtainable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Heelah:  *Every* one of our DoTs stacks.  I think we are the only class that can claim that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bozze Blightbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The Obulous Death Shroud. This isn't an easy item to get, especialy now (drops in seb), but with the new focus effect, it is much beter than most other shoulder items.<br />
<br />
The new ODS has Mana Preservation 3 on it; thats a 10% mana reduction on all spells you cast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">snapdragn,<br />
<br />
Just to clarify, all dots within a line stack.  For example:<br />
<br />
Venom of Snake would stack with Bane of Nife, but Bane of Nife will not stack with another Bane of Nife.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Heelah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">wow, i've just been using EBolt &amp; Plague this whole time...<br />
/beats self about the head and neck with a crooked stick<br />
now i REALLY gotta check this out!!!<br />
i wondered how the proc from the 7th cudgel could stack with another poison spell, rofl, that shoulda tipped me off!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">ODS really isnt that rare if you just spend a little time in Sebilis.  I have spent maybe one level there and seen 4 drop, won one roll too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Umbriel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If you are Iksar you can get an Imbued Cabilis Scale Mantle<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=4901<br />
I make and sell these on Druzzil Ro, it has decent ac and a little bit of wis and str to!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">When you're 50 take an xp group of 6 to The Hole and get imbued granite spauldors (:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Gloriana:  yep...dat's what I was trying to get at.<br />
<br />
Most casters can't stack spells in a similar line, however. <br />
<br />
A druid can't stack Drones of Doom (34 DoT) and Drifting Death (44 DoT) since they are in the same line.<br />
<br />
waiting for a Druid to drop by and prove me wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Been looking at other shoulder options myself lately, but for your level a Tattered Mantle really is the best call.  Giant Scalemail Mantle (quest), BS mantle, and Engraved Bone pauldrons (quest) are all pretty cheaply bought as well.  If you have a bit more cash to spend I would recommend Chodkai Hide spauldors and they are great if your Wis is low.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">had IGS...gave them to an alt in favor of an obulous death shroud</div></div><hr />
