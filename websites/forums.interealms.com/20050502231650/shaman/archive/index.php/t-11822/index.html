In xp groups (HoH guards/suits) I usually get 2k or so (had  friends do a few parses).<br />

I was also quite suprised on our recent HP in SSra fight, dogs clocked up 1500 damage ;)<br />

There is a fairly famous poem, that I don't remember the title of, or the author, but a line is &quot;Let loose the dogs of war&quot;  the preceding line I think is pretty cool too, though I forget it.</div></div><hr />

Its from Shakespeare's Henry III.  The line is when Henry stands and gives a long speech to the English Soldiers...  I think what you were refering too as the other line is &quot;Into the Breach one more time Fair English men.  Into the breach one more time and let slip the dogs of war!!!&quot;  IIRC, that is how it goes.<br />

Seen tons of people with this incorporated into their pull message.  It's the most often misquoted piece of literature and I hate it when it is.   :p  Makes the person who says it every time they have inc look like a freakin retard.</div></div><hr />

Immediately after you cast the pet skill, you can straff around the mob. As the pets pop out one at the time (over a 3 or 4 sec interval), they will surround the mob and not pop on top of each other. This helps to separate the pets for hasting purposes and more importantly helps eliminate pushing the mob.<br />

When I cast the group sow on myself my pet doesn't get it, so I would guess not, unless pets are treated as there own group and casting the group spell on one gives it to all of them.<br />

for hasted pet, it really not worth it, I can simple just use same mana to nuke for more damage rather than hasted pet for 1 minutes<br />
<br />
for a buffed lvl61 pet, it do 20-23dps with just hasted or up to 30dps with full buffed/avatar but not weapon</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">dogs of war used to be formidable beasts.

I like the skill for when I am in an xp group or soloing and get that unexpected add. Keeps the mob busy for awhile and gets them dead a bit faster. Or on raids (or any situation) when you need to push a mob.</div></div><hr />

Hummm....  It is a great speach but it is in Henry V *giggle*<br />
<br />
Henry V III.2<br />
<br />
&quot;King.  Once more unto the Breach, Deare friends, once more; <br />
Or close the Wall up with our English dead: .....<br />
<br />
.... [and at the end of this same speach] ....<br />
<br />
For there is none of you so meane and base, That hath not Noble luster in your eyes. I see you stand like Grey-hounds in the slips, Straying upon the Start.  The Game's afoot.  Follow your Spirit, and upon this Charge, Cry, God for Harry, England, and S[aint]. George.&quot;<br />
<br />
Henry V is full of great speaches on the part of Harry ( king Henry ) that are very martial in tone and can still speak deaply to any who soldier for a living.</div></div><hr />

I don't think you can buff SC pets at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">SC pet can buffed, at lease I see buff message when cast on them but not sure if it is faked message or not, since if I buff PvP player I see buff message but it is faked and not hold</div></div><hr />

It works.  When bored I often click my epic snake on the 'dogs of war'.<br />
<br />
At least I get the stick message and the 'pulses with the spirit of the Shissar' so I presume it works.  66% haste, all things equal, should result in a 66% increase in dps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">SC is also useful for holding mobs off for a moment, great for handing adds. Extremely usefull just after a rezz or if you get jumped without the right spells memmed. Interrupts on caster mobs, particularly gaters, are great. (Someone mentioned using on Emp whilst soloing in Sebilis)<br />
<br />
People have already mentioned pushing and positioning, which they do very well too (sometimes a boon, sometimes a bane).<br />
<br />
Most of all though, its good fun!</div></div><hr />
