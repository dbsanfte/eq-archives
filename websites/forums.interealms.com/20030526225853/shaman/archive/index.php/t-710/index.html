may be a n00b question but is this normal? never noticed it before</div></div><hr />

as you can tell i dont group with bards to much (when you've duoed with a monk almost exclusively since level 6 it happens) and come to think of it both times i noticed it i WAS grouped with a bard.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ludgurorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I occasionally get a cann bug where I actually lose mana when I cann. It clears up when I relog though. I have reported it but it still returns once in a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Many times before I've had the spell fizzle on me and it'll actually lower my mana a bit.  I've always just thought it was updating to correct values with the bar and server, &lt;add other technical jargon here&gt;, but it sounds like you're meaning that every time you Cann you lose hp *and* mana?   Crazy.<br />
<br />
I'm still waiting for the day we log in and everytime we Cann we get a bit more xp instead of mana. :)</div></div><hr />
