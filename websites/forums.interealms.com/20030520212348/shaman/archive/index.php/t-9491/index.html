<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tnit Shammy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just started a shaman and was wondering if people could give me a quick sum up of a shaman's responsibilities in groups. Is there more to it than just buffing and slowing? Any info would be appriciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Buffs:<br />
Haste - all melee (if enchanter not present)<br />
Hitpoint buff - self, main tank, other melee if mana is sufficient (ask casters/clerics before casting since it interferes with their own buff lines, they might want it)<br />
str/dex - melees, if you have the mana, str for overburdened clerics/casters if applicable<br />
agi/sta - A little more AC/stamina never hurt anyone, give to everyone if mana is sufficient<br />
regen - good for you, the main tank and any necros if applicable<br />
SoW - puller, everyone else if they're scaredy cats<br />
infravision/ultravision - good for night blind races (barbs, humans, erudites) wizards/enchanters get their own line<br />
<br />
Debuffs:<br />
Slow - everything<br />
Malo-line - helpful if you have mana (especially with nuking casters present)<br />
Cripple - not hugely useful at the lower levels<br />
<br />
Heals:<br />
Your job if you're the only healer<br />
Assist heal if other healers are present<br />
Watch out for enchanters, they drop fast.  If a mob is mezzed, make sure no one breaks mez until the mob is taunted, if no taunt, root it.  Sit aggro to save an enchanter is sometimes necessary.<br />
<br />
Offense:<br />
Root park if necessary, get the mob's attention (slow works nicely) walk it over out of harm's way and park it <br />
Nukes - if mana is sufficient<br />
Dots - if mobs live long enough for it to be mana efficient<br />
<br />
Can dance mana back during fight so when fight ends you are full health/full mana ready for next pull.  Downtime = the devil.</div></div><hr />
