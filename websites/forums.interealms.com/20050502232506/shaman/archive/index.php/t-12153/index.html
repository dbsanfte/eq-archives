<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Think I got the FunLove Virus somehow last night. Anyone know anything about it, what it does, or how to get rid it? Norton picked it up but I don't think it helped much, kept popping up in different files.<br />
<br />
From what I gather it eats through .exe files, and more.<br />
<br />
Anyone got anything that would help me?<br />
<br />
(Not sure where I got it, but I did click a link from this board and not long after was alerted it had entered my system. Not blaming you guys or anything, just unsure of where I got it and don't know if it's from here or somewhere else.)</div></div><hr />

Check the removal tools section for your type of funlove as there are several different varieties</div></div><hr />
