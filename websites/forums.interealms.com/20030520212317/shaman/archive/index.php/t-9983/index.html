<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey, I used to be a pretty darn good athlete, but then things like school, real life, and eventually real life's opposite, EQ, added up to get me more and more out of shape.   So I've been thinking of trying to get in better shape without joining a gym, because if it's raining out, I won't go, or maybe be if there's a breeze, or say a dog is barking...well, you know.  I've always been better at working out at home than the gym.<br />
<br />
Wanting something to give my legs a good hard work-out and something with lat-pull downs and good back exercises, I looked around the web for something that would let me do good heavy exercises for all parts of the body without requiring a spotter or putting me in any danger.  I don't like weights at home much cuz they're very noisy and if you ever drop them, an apartment doesn't have the kind of floor that can take any abuse.  Plus changing weights when you're solo is incredibly time consuming and clumsy, especially putting heavy weights on and off a barbell.<br />
<br />
Here's what I found: <br />
<br />
www.thecrossbow.com<br />
www.bowflex.com<br />
www.exerciting.com<br />
<br />
Two good sites to check people's opinions on some of this stuff: <br />
<br />
www.fitnessinfomercialreview.com<br />
www.epinions.com<br />
<br />
The bowflex Ultimate is super expensive and not without detractors.  I find it hard to imagine that the machine, or any machine, could be worth that much money.  And the $200 shipping charge is absurd.  But it does seem really complete.  I especially like the inclusion of a good benchpress/squat bar and the pulley at the foot end of the machine to let you do those exercises in a clean, straight line.  The lower-end Bowflexes seem pretty consistently noted on the epinions reviews as being more shaky and lower quality than the Ultimate -- yet if you add on the extra weight and leg extensions and lat attachments etc, they come out to be pretty close in price to the Ultimate.<br />
<br />
The web site for the weird machine from exerciting.com doesn't really illustrate well how you can get a variety of exercises in.  The black box of the machine really IS a &quot;black box,&quot; as far as I can see.  Seeing the picture of the model seemingly doing curls by lifting that machine arm directly really made me think something lame was going on.  And it's just about as expensive as a bowflex Ultimate(which runs 2k).  Somehow the consumer raves for it seem very convincing, though.<br />
<br />
And the Weider Crossbow is the cheapest by far.  It doesn't seem to have as much flexibility overall as the Bowflex, and I have some uncertainty as to what the quality might be.  Sears sells it, but they don't usually have it in stock; the local store didn't.  The long cables are good for tall people like me.<br />
<br />
Sears is very reliable on customer service, and they had a sale knocking the price to the same price as you can get the machine direct from the Crossbow website, so I decided to buy the Crossbow from Sears.  I figured if it's great for the 500 bucks it costs, fantastic -- I've saved a thousand bucks over what the other two alternatives would have cost me.  If it sucks, then it's better something costs $500 and sucks than that it costs $2,000 and $200 shipping(plus like $100 bucks I think for the extra rod &quot;weight&quot; and sucks.  I also ordered the lat bar and the 200 pound add-ons so I would be able to do the back and leg stuff I wanted to, actually, which totaled $190 together, so I really spent about $700 on the machine.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any experience with any of these machines?  <br />
<br />
Hints, flames, suggestions?  Not like, just use free weights -- that takes tons of room and is not too safe when alone if you do deep squats or leg presses like I like to do.  Or, just go out jogging; jogging is not enough and I can jump rope, etc. for aerobics without even leaving my living room.</div></div><hr />
