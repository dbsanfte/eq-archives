After reading some responses and considering the idea some more, I decided that a boycot would probably not be a good idea.  Although I have to say that I personally will be probably boycot GoD if its released with the spells/AAs as they currently standon Test/Lucy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">boycotting an expansion is useless, firstly SoE won't care, secondly the expansion is about more than class balance. Its a provision of new content which a lot of people are waiting for eagerly. And possibly addition of other features. I myself though am hesitant in buying it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Arctarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Can't boycott expansion, because you cannot mobilize enough people for it, and you'll soon find yourself alone not ebing ablt to join your friends in the new expansion.<br />

As for me, i want wow and EQ2 because im seriously tired of EQ mechanics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I dunno how effective a boycot would be, but petitions have been effective in the past and they had no real threat behind them.  As for not joining your friends, we might not be the only class getting jack in GoD.  Have you seen the Rogue AA list?  Chance to pickpocket with backstabbing, oh yeah, that's useful ;-)</div></div><hr />

          NAh we don't wait them .After we have saw luclin ,pop and ldon zone ,many of us certainly don't wait anything from GoD zone !</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Mcroc is right.  Not everyone cares about how they stack up to other classes and many are riding high on the new wave of fixes that SOE has put out (melee generally, with warriors in particular).  But more than that is the fact that PoP is OLD at this point.  Even if you are not in Time and still mucking about the lower tiers its still been a long time since you saw anything &quot;new&quot;.<br />
<br />
Even LDoN was lame in the &quot;new&quot; content department because it was the same 10 or so dungeons with the same 5 or 6 models for each theme.  The &quot;new&quot; aspect of LD was the instancing, which was for the most part, good stuff.  Oh, that and some new weapons that further trivialized previous expansions.  (Do you have any idea how fast you can kill splitpaw gnolls when everyone in your twink group is wielding Frightfull orbs with that 300ish proc that hits ALL the time?)<br />
<br />
Even though I am totally unsatisfied with the current state of the spells and abilities shaman get in Gates, I am still finding myself considering getting it for at least one account just because its been over a year since Ive seen &quot;New&quot; stuff.  LD just doesnt count for me.</div></div><hr />

Then quit playing EQ.  Why is that such a hard thing to do.  You are tired of something that you don't need.  Its a game, you don't get paid to play it.  Do you?  You pay to play.  Put it in a different context.  You get tired of drinking milk.  Do you continue to buy milk and drink it just so you can complain about how tired you are of drinking milk?  No, you simply stop purchasing the product.  Do the same in this case and make yourself happier  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I haven't seen anything so far to make me want<br />
to buy the new expantion. New content will likely<br />
mean tougher mobs, but we aren't being upgraded.<br />
A large part of EQ is a sence of progression. <br />
Growing in power and ability is important. Right now,<br />
we're stagnant. <br />
<br />
I often wonder why anyone cares about &quot;trivializing&quot;<br />
old content. Stuff I had a tough time with 10 levels<br />
ago SHOULD be trivial now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>doedel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I wont boycott GoD.<br />
I wont pre-order it, cause nothing, really nothing so far has me convinced to do so.<br />
Maybe i will buy it later, if i see that there is enough content provided which a non-elemental guild can access without doin the daily ratrace for rare named raid bosses. And if at least one usable Shaman AA and spell is included.<br />
Yes i am a dreamer....</div></div><hr />

<br />
I will buy it later, because I got screwed with LDoN by preordering.  ****ing SOE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Lorianna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">At present, I have no intentions of purchasing this expansion until I know what is on it. And I sincerely hope that most shaman do the same. <br />
<br />
I have absolutely no idea how many active shaman characters there are on eq - but I am going to use a simple number of 10,000.  Take 10,000 and times that by $20 (base price for the expansion) and you have a bottom line figure of $100,000.<br />
<br />
ANY corporate structure is going to look hard at that dollar loss on a new expansion.  ANY corporate structure is going to research why that occured.  <br />
<br />
With any luck some of that research will lead them to this board, and they will see that the Shaman class has better uses for its money than expansions that add nothing to the pleasure of our time on eq.<br />
<br />
And for the record, I get tired of drinking milk sometimes.  But I am smart enough to run to the store and buy some chocolate syrup to add to my milk.  Same milk, just added incentive.  <br />

I am just now accepting that PoP is a semi alright place to go, and am sorta enjoying collecting what flags and such that I can; its fun seeing what you can get flagged for with no guild support :p<br />
Later, if/when GoD proves to be a semi decent place to Exp and loot, then I will snag a copy, but for now I am LDoN and PoP oriented.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, I would consider not buying this expansion not because of what it does or does not contain, but because of what has happened to shamans in recent expansions.  Our relative power has dwindled to the point that we are arguably the weakest class in the game.</div></div><hr />

Just to play the devils advocate.....<br />
<br />
<br />
You can only play that card so long. Mind you i think a boycott will do prescisly squat, but i think at this point its safe to say what the shaman is and isnt getting. No nothing is iron clad since the game isnt out yet, that is true. However if you look at the track record of this company and factor in whats already out there and also add in the facts we know about how SoE feels a shaman should be, then you can makea pretty good deduction of whats in store at this point.<br />
<br />
I mean this isnt the first week info has been out on this expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Geordi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">We all know that each and every one that plays EQ and visits this forum will purchase this expansion one way or another. Why? Cause thats what we do.<br />
We will bitch and moan about NOT buying it then buy it then come here to the boards here and complain about it, but we will HAVE it.<br />
<br />
We have done this with all all expansions hated or not; and how can you all be complaining about it already when we dont exactly know for sure the entire content.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Skadi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">People say these things about every expansion.  Im not buying it! OMG Im telling you im not going to buy it! Dont try to stop me Im not going to buy it! Wait why dont you care that Im not buying it?<br />
<br />
Thats what boycotts mean, nothing , because nobody cares.  The fact is that most people are going to buy the expansion who continue to play EQ.  Ofcourse people who are going to quit or are on the verge of quitting are not going to buy it, why should they unless they just have money to burn.<br />
<br />
Am I happy about the new AAs spells or what not? No.  Thats not the only reason to buy an expansion though.  There is new zones to go to, new loots, new tradeskill stuff and other things like that.  So Im probably going to end up buying it because Im still playing EQ and I want something new to do.  I cant be the only one or this game would be dead and no new expansions would be released.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">God i want your staff Skadi :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">SOE will make sure that, regardless how poorly their next expansion meets your expectations, there's something in it that means you will decide that you have to buy it.<br />
<br />
In the event that they themselves decide that the expansion is borked beyond repair they will simply ramp up the exp gain in the new zones.<br />
<br />
From what rumours Ive heard so far GoDs is PoP with instanced zones.  So 80-90% of the EQ playerbase are for the shaft on this one.  But have no doubt, there'll be something in the expansion that will pretty well force everyone to buy it, so the Devteam can continue the pretence that they are doing their job and not just pandering to an exclusive club of players yet again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Moregar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I see many posts that say 'I am not buying this expansion for my shaman...'.  Does that mean you do not play any other classes?  One of the things I truly enjoy about Everquest is that there are many different classes/races to play.  I personally have several different characters in the mid-50's, my shaman is merely the first to 65.  So in my opinion, I benefit from new things in any expansion, even if my shaman does not.<br />
I guess everyone has a 'wish list' they would like to do with their character, how they feel it could be improved...but at this point in my shaman's life, I am satisfied with what he can do.</div></div><hr />

Has the pre-order caused any technical problems yet, like the last one did?<br />

Yes, I'm going to get it. Even if it's almost entirely crap, EQ is my 'big' hobby, and another few bucks isn't gonna break me.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I will be buying it (allready have). Personally imo anyone who bases their decision to buy or not to buy based on what spells they are/aren't getting is an idiot. Put it this way, if the expansion consisted only of new spells and noting else, would you still buy it? For what? So you can kill that orc 2 seconds faster?<br />
<br />
I don't know about the rest of you, but I have seen allmost everything in the game outside of time, and frankly the content is getting old. The primary purpose of expansions is new content and new things to do. LDoN failed in the sense that it is really very shallow content wise (there are raids, but the limitations of the instancing used make it difficult to get people interested in that). LoY failed in the sense that it was too low for the regular EQ player (most of whom are 65). LoY would have been a big hit (personally I love the theme and design of the zones there) if it had come out before PoP, but after PoP it was either too low, or bypassed in the drive to sixty five. It's been a long time since real new content has been introduced for the 65s. Opening some of the lower planes in PoP was a &quot;stealth&quot; expansion for the average Joe player, but really, unless you have done the planar progression quest you have missed out on the best part of PoP.<br />
