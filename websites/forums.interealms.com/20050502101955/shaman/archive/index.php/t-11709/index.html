<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>thelordtrey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just curious for inputon 2 questions. <br />
<br />
First: My shaman finally got to 51 and my question is whether to start AA grinding now while the xp mobs are really pushovers, or get to 60ish as fast as possible and then worry about it, or do a mixed percentage along the way, and<br />
<br />
Second: I know you go straight to cann5, do not pass go and do not collect $200 =), but other then that what is generally the best way to spend points in other AA skills?<br />
<br />
Any input would be appreciated, thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hiho,<br />
<br />
go straight to 60 at least, no AA XP to slow you down.<br />
<br />
After that it's Run3, other 3 from general stuff (doenst matter much, most go with Innate regen), then MC3 (sad sad, since you don't really need the extra 3 mana per tick), then Canni5.<br />
<br />
So long<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tiktak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Alright first off, get level 60, try to save money for Torpor and malo<br />
<br />
Secondly, after Cann5, it all depends on your guilds status.  If you are in a large raiding guild and you're only 1 of 2-3 shamans, go MGB next for sure.  If you're guildless, go for SCM or well actually, its your choice, anything from Spirit Call, SCM, SCR, CA would be good here.<br />
<br />
basically<br />
<br />
<br />
MGB - Great for raiding<br />
<br />
SCM - Great for all around casting<br />
<br />
SCR - Nice if you dont like recasting buffs + longer torpor<br />
<br />
QB - Cuts casting time down nicely<br />
<br />
CA - helps you live =P<br />
<br />
those are some of the best choices for right after Cann5, its really your choice<br />
<br />
<br />
I am going for MGB then SCR then SCM then SCR then QB then CA, because of my guild status, need to be able to buff a whole guild fast.<br />
<br />
hopefully that helps a bit, next time use the Search feature to find some info =)<br />
<br />
if anymore questions just leave a responce</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Another very doable option is to get to about 53 and then go grind out some AAXP in HHK.  Just kill nobles and bards and guards on the second floor and save up lots of plat.<br />
<br />
A long time ago I sold my shaman exp bar to a necro to twink a monk and then I quite EQ.  When I came back I was naked (except for No Drop equipment) and level 51.  I farmed HHK for aaxp and cash to cover my body and by the time I left that place I had some resonable equipment including jbb / horse / ods / solstice earring and 52 more aaxp then when I started.<br />
<br />
I was getting about 1 aaxp in 3 and a half hours towards the end but it was slower at the start.  A couple of nights ago I hit lvl 59 with 30 aaxp in the bank and got<br />
<br />
scrm<br />
mgb<br />
can V<br />
qb1  <br />
<br />
Elder :)<br />
<br />
last night I finished another aaxp point for qb2 and am now on my way to 60 with 63 aaxp spent.<br />
<br />
I have yet to suiside with can V but I did die last night from low health agro.   I just cant wait for 60 and focus and my torpor will cast fast and last long.<br />
<br />
If you wanted to pause for a bit in the low 50s and grind out some aaxp for run3 and reg3 I would not let anyone stop you from doing it.  A lot will depend on your play style and what you find to be fun.  For me it seamed the smart thing to do becuase naked at 53 is much safer then naked at 60.<br />
<br />
I now intend to level to 61 so I can have the new pet to help farming for trade skills and then go back to aaxp grinding and raiding with the guild.  I did a MGB Stam the other night for the guild and it was funny.  Soon it will be Focus :).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd get run 3 asap after hitting 51. I found it to be damn annoying being outrun in dungeons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Go 50/50 on your XP till you get run3. If you dont you WILL wish you had latter. Consider it an indoor sow, helps with pulling and out running umm.... mispulls we shal call them :P. And liveing to make it to the zone SAVES you XP in the long run. Even a 96% res loses you 4% XP each time not to mention the time you spend Meding and buffing agine that could have been spent getting XP.<br />
<br />
Now has for doing your AA's after you get can5. The first thing I would get would be ND3 more HP's helps you no matter what. Next the one thing all shm have in commen is that we buff and debuff. SCM will save you 30% mana on all your alteration spell's. QB3 will take buff casting time down by 50% but there are items that will do that to. Now from here you need to look at how YOU personaly play no 2 people are the same. Look at what skill's will best fit the way you play and that will give you the best advantage. Exsample someone who solos and never raids, will have no use for MGB. Now with that said...<br />
<br />
At 61 you will want to get SC, RC, VP. All 3 are usefull and SC is just plain fun at least to me :P Pet hold and Suspended Minion are also usefull in thire own rights. Now for the arch skills. I think you can break the arch skills down into 2 catagories. the first and most usefull being...<br />
MC, ND, CA, SCM, CF. The second being. CS, SCF, HA, HG, SCR. What order you would want to them in would agine depend on how you personaly play. Your gear can also effect what AA's you want to get. MP3 is about that same has SCM2. But what happens when your gear changes and it will. Once you have the AA skill you have it 24/7 no matter what. Say you have a ODS you maynot want to get SCM right off. But it still wont hurt to get SCM2 simply becuse what happens if you get some better stats sholders that dont have MP3 on them. <br />
<br />
The reason I bring up tailoring your AA's spent to the way you play. Is that with 136 AA's spent atm I have a few put in places I wish they were not. I tried to do what others had done with thire AA's. Thats why I say plan ahead, look at the skills and say &quot;ok which will do ME the most good next?&quot; Max it then move on to the next :) Almost all of the skills are good and usefull, I just wish we had a few more fun ones besides VP and SC. One of my favrot things to do is to face the oppist direction that the tank is standing, VP the mob, then watch the tank look around for it:P The kock back from VP is like a stun spell it will throw the mob in the direction that you are faceing. So if you are face to face with the tank and VP, it will knok the mob behind the tank and root it there:P. <br />
<br />
Sorry about this being long winded I cant sleep tonight and I'm bored :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">RC1 is a nice investment too.  Costs 2 aa, and I haven't had to mem disinfecting since I got RC1.  Very convenient.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>thelordtrey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks for the advice. Ive got a JBB but no horse, and no where near done on my epic since im not in a higher end guild, but I have found that the ships in Dulak have been absurd normal xp... 1% per dark blue kill at 51 if i can get on to the dandolak or higher. It shouldnt take all that long to get run3 at 50/50 or so. Here's to the hopes of enough high end merchant trash to get even a slow horse =).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If you have torpor after cann 5 SCRM is the way to go. 1800hp heal for 200mana is tough to beat.<br />
<br />
Personally after I get cann 5 and scrm I plan on going for nd 3 as the extra hp will be more then welcome. After that theres a variety of directions to go really. We really do have quite a bit of nice aa skills. <br />
<br />
However I will say this once you hit 60 just stop and do aa at least until you get flagged. I had picked up quinsience before I had torpor and was planning on powerleveling to 65 so I could use it. Problem is once you hit 61 exp just crawls tier 1 and your aa slow down from the level up. So wait till you get flagged before you ding 61 if I were you and just get all the aa you can.</div></div><hr />
