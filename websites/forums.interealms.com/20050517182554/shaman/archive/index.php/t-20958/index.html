A post in the shaman class board has been moved to the Dev board.<br />
<br />
Brenlo responded twice, and so has a dev.<br />
<br />
I've posted there a few ideas I've read on this board and one of my own.  If you have any ideas, now is the time and that is the place.<br />
<br />
Just please, keep things civil.  Brenlo seemed to reply quickly that time to me when I was being very polite.  Let's not ruin a good thing, now that we finally have their attention.<br />
<br />
Good luck, let those creative juices flow, and let's all hope that our beloved class gets the fix it needs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I find this statement to be interesting considering recent events.  We have recently had some very good dialogue with shaman that resulted in many changes to healing.  The team, at that time also stated that they were looking into slow and a few other issues.  Since then I have had no news to report on the issue and have been in communication with several other classes that are all concerned about their state as well.  However, I am once again being barraged with claims that we are ignoring shaman, it is simply not true.   Communicating with all of the various classes is a lengthy process and they are all as passionate as shaman are.  They all demand to have their time in the spotlight, deservedly so.  Each class wants to be heard and I am here to listen to them all.  Please be patient.  No one has said we are done talking with you, no one has said we are done making changes and there are 15 other classes that all want our time.  Continue to post your concerns, I will read as many as I can and I will reply when I have something relevant to say, as I do for all of the classes.  <br />
<br />
Thanks all.<br />
<br />

This statement really perplexes me. If it's your job to have face time with the classes and be the intermediary between staff and customers shouldn't you be taking the time to maintain those lines of communication. It doesnt take that much time or effort to prepare statements to each class figure if nothing is actively happening 5 minutes and probably 30 minutes max for a large update on a class. At the most they probably make 1 or 2 &quot;Significant&quot; changes to a class per month so total time would be on average 2 hours a week. I say get off your A$$es and simply start posting something anything to inform your customer base what is actively happening in the development of the game. <br />
Just think of all the hate and discontent that could have been averted had someone simply continued posting even irregularly (weekly or bi-weekly hell even once a month) on the class boards. Instead we get a dribble of posts on what 2 threads and the overreaction of &quot;Look they are doing something so shutup and quit whining.&quot; Now we see that that something was little to no effect on the situations that are actually broken and have been posted on repeatedly for months.<br />
<br />
Perhaps they are actually attempting to open those lines of communication but I really question what motivation is behind it. Is it increased competition or the extreme rate of customer's departing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Foramorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There are several class balances issues that have the team’s attention at the moment.  Generally these relate to the Gates expansion and the content style specific to that area.  There are several classes that have expressed issues specific to the new content that we feel are valid and deserve attention. <br />
<br />
 Specifically in regards to Shaman:<br />
<br />
-The ability to function as a secondary healer<br />
<br />
-The impact of shorter fights on DoTs spells and Slow<br />
<br />
-The increased number of slow mitigating NPCs in some areas of Gates.<br />
<br />
 Are three areas that we feel deserve attention.  Personally I feel that shaman are relatively well balanced in most other areas of the game outside of Gates content, which is in agreement with most of the feedback I’ve seen on the shaman boards. Therefore, I expect any change to the shaman class to be specifically aimed and alleviating their concerns in Gates of Discord.<br />

I don't know how others feel, but just SEEING that they are in fact listening is comforting.  If it takes another expansion to get us fixed, i'm willing to wait around.<br />
<br />
It seems Rytan knows the issues we are bothered with.  I encourage you all to put it some imput, and keep it civil.  This is a step in the right direction.  We have a good dialog going, and that is indeed... &quot;a good thing.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think in a job like Brenlo's, saying too much can be more damaging than saying too little.  We can already tell from the bits of info that were gathered from the Fanfaire that we were thrown a bone with the revamped spells.  The Devs goofed, I don't think they were supposed to let that piece of information loose.  As soon as you tell a class that you gave them a freebie because it was worthless then they will immediately go to the boards with it and demand an audience with an actual fix.<br />
<br />
From my standpoint, I don't think the developers know what to do because the shaman is just the tip of the iceberg.  We are dealing with a game that was never supposed to evolve past Velious.  We have been spammed with roughly 7 years of content in a 5 year period.  It is like going to an auto dealership and yelling at them that its broke.  The car was designed to work for three years, but here we are 4 years of content later screaming &quot;I paid you, fix the damn thing.&quot;  The major issue with the shaman is that our primary ability was factored around a mechanism in-game that was flawed.  With the speed that dps increased you either have to nerf slow or deal with mobs one rounding tanks.  Nerfing slow was the easiest solution.  The next major issue is that everything else we do is set to a certain percentage because of a full 75% slow.  We all know this, and for us the answer is simple: improve our heals and dps to compensate. Simple right....wrong.<br />
<br />
Here is the issue that the developers are seeing, because its been a problem since Luclin- and they know it exists.  In Luclin, there was a definite split in the Casual, the Raider, and the Uber.  The Ubers are moving at twice the speed of the raider and about 4 times the speed of the Casual.  Where in Velious, we saw the standard that with a new expansion there would be a mass exodus to the new content.  We didn't see that in Luclin because it came out &quot;too early&quot;.  How many servers had waxxed AoW before Luclin came out?  How many had cleared NToV? How many had awoken the Sleeper?  Most of the casuals were still finishing Thurg armor quests or just started clearing HoT.  There was no need nor appropriate gear level for them to move to Luclin.  The &quot;Ubers&quot; stopped what they were doing and headed to Luclin and started clearing the content, this speed up their progression and gear level much faster than the casual and relatively faster that the raider.  They were done by the time PoP came out.  <br />
<br />
The game developers have been trying to get the casuals to &quot;catch up&quot; with the rest of the group since PoP, but its not going to happen.  The Casuals move at a certain speed that will not change, so the developers are forced to create new expansions where the casual can &quot;jump&quot; old content with some skill, but difficult enough to slow down the ubers from devouring the end content.  Equipment was and still is the current fix to the problem, and that is why we see the staggering differences in gear that we do today.<br />
<br />
Yes, this was a bit lengthy, but I am getting to a point:  <br />
<br />
THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH IS BY NO MEANS A RANT- IT IS JUST MY VIEW OF GAME DYNAMICS.<br />
<br />
GoD the present Expansion:  Groups from all three genres will see the new content, and many from each group will get the spells.  The Casual is hurting the strength of those spells. Now, before the casual players out there start screaming let me explain.<br />
<br />
The Uber will more likely set up camp in GoD, with only a few excursions to LDoN/Elementals.<br />
<br />
The raider may move to GoD, but will more likely play in Sol Ro/LDoN.<br />
<br />
The casual may do a few groups in GoD, then head to BoT, do some LDoNs, play in Tactics, solo, etc.  (This is where the problem is.)<br />
<br />
Game Developers like to see new spells and new gear being used in new content.  Using new stuff in old expansions trivializes old content.  They have already seen what an extra 50-100 aa's can do to- look at BoT and LDoN.  By many it is considered &quot;trivial&quot; content, but it is still well traveled by the casual player.  You make the spells weaker and it hurts those in the new content, you make the spell stronger and it further trivializes old content.  You can't change a 65 shaman's abilities without effecting all content.  Unfortunately, Game developers tend to go with the flow and expect the nerf police to be their watchdog.  The Nerf-police didn't move fast enough on MGB HoT's and Charm, and now its too late because the Developers have taken it as the norm.<br />
<br />
The Game Developers are not worried about what the 8k monk can solo, because they can write it off as trivial content.  What the Game Developers are worried about is what the 5k monk can solo, because then it becomes a class balance issue.  At this current time we have players scattered across 3 high end expansions: Luclin, PoP, and GoD.  The majority of these players are 65.  They all have roughly the same spells which each group having a different level of gear.  The Game Developers don't worry about what the ubers are going to do- they already know what is going to happen.  They are going to park their butt in the new content until they see the end of it.  The Game Developers are worried about what the casuals are going to do, because the will be the players that will bounce between the three.<br />
<br />
I didn't write this post as a rant on the casual player.  I am merely saying the casual group is the most unpredictable of the three groups.  Sometimes the casual will jump over to the new content, sometimes he will stay put, and the Game Developers have to predict that.  It is a major issue because as a class we are having major issues in End-PoP/GoD, but we are fine in LDoN normal/BoT/Tactics/older re-vamped zones. So, I salute the casual player..you have confused the **** out of SOE, and quite honestly, I don't think they have a clue on how to fix it.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Personally I can't follow the pattern of &quot;dealing with other classes&quot; and Brenlo/Rylan's earlier comments that &quot;they regularly visit these boards.&quot; As those statements have been made they were done so to comment on the topic at hand.<br />
<br />
If they are in fact taking the time to &quot;regularly visit these boards&quot; then surely taking an additional 30 seconds to post in any of the numerous ongoing threads - &quot;thought I would drop by to say nothing new at this time, but we are still taking a look at your concerns&quot; - would do a great deal to alleviate our frustration. Customer service isn't giving the customer what they want as much as paying attention to the customer.<br />
<br />
Interesting in this thread Brenlo states 'confidently' that shaman received upgrads ... clearly he checked his notes between last week and now. Yes, this is sarcasm ... because - equally clearly - he still doesn't understand what the problems are.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Pretty much, I am not currently in the Elemental Planes, but I can't see too much of a change in standard shaman tactics.  I find that in Hard LDoN's I do well, but that I think is due more to the level of gear attained and the amount of aa's completed.  There have been numerous posts though from Time Shamans that feel they should be seeing more oomf post time-geared than they do.  Our current raid stackability sucks in general.  Trash mobs die to fast to really need slow, and unless you hit a major wipe, one shaman can keep re-buffs up on the recently rezzed.<br />
<br />
Now, I have experience GoD up to Vxed Trials, and I feel absolutely worthless.  It takes approximately 2-2.5 hours to complete the trial with a charmed pet (hits for 1k+), so you can get a general idea of how long a trial will take without a chanter.  Running with a chanter pet, you perform 2 functions: debuff the pet &quot;target&quot;, and buff it up once it is charmed.  That's it, they don't want you doing anything else because of the pet/aggro rules where only 3? pc's can be on the mob's hate list, otherwise the pet can't keep aggro.  After about 20 mins sitting there doing nothing you start to wonder if you really are contributing to the group..  The mobs you will face have incredible dps, but have hitpoints near or slightly about LDoN standards (it seems that way at least) to where 2 strong healers can accomplish more than a slow that will only effect about 1/2-1/3 of the fight.<br />
<br />
Edit: grammar is the debil!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I still feel our buffing needs some attention but at least Rytan/Ryan seems to have a good grasp on our GoD specific concerns.<br />
<br />
Brenlo however seemed pretty clueless. So getting your spells fixed to get the same that everyone else gets means we had &quot;many changes to healing&quot;? And weeks of silence equal &quot;very good dialogue&quot;? Of course he did say he would answer if he had something relevant to say so that may be why he rarely talks.<br />
<br />
I sure would prefer repeated statements of &quot;We are looking into these issues at the moment . . &quot; though.<br />
<br />
The highest content I have experienced is Elemental PoP.  I've played a friend's EP flagged shaman with some friends in a few Earth / Water groups.  I can easily keep myself busy there, and my groups always do well.<br />
Our issues are a combination of fight length, equipment and AAs and slow mitigation. Generally speaking the shorter the fights, the higher the slow mitigation and the better the gear and AAs of your party (especially mana regeneration) the worse shaman look in comparison to other classes.<br />
<br />
Exactly where you draw the line between &quot;well, this is not all that bad&quot; and &quot;shaman are useless&quot; differs from shaman to shaman. The general consensus seems to be that time geared shaman in LDoN hards have serious issues and that everyone has huge glaring problems in GoD. (Sewers and up that is. I have not really seen anything about pre-trial content.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>korask shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Posted what i thought to the thread directly, so feel free to support or attack what i have to say.  Sadly im not joking when i say focus is a buff i go without a lot now (on my warrior) because its just not enough for me to worry about.  Often my GOD groups look like Cleric, Druid, War, Paladin, Ench, Spare.  Put a shaman in spare slot and dps sucks, nothing is gained, and it just makes everything more of a pain.  And i agree wholey with above post.  We are the masters of the slow fight... which is why we were powerful through luclin.  But with the introduction fo the fast paced game, we are becoming far less useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The problem is there are too many classes in everquest. I will summarize my stance (which I have posted in the past many times) on balance:<br />
<br />
There are about 7 or 8 raid-crucial roles. These roles are split across 16 classes. This is done by making each class a jack of several trades and the master of none. Classes intended to be masters of their trade have lines continuously blurred by hybrid classes who are situationally better than the 'master' and who have their own complaints about being worthless in the other situations.<br />
<br />
The Enchanter Sayeth: This is ridiculous, when there is one or two targets, the bard is at least equal or arguably better at crowd control! They don't even have to meet high mana demands of crowd control!<br />
<br />
The  Bard Sayeth: Our third most important job is crowd control abilities, but on the high-level GoD monsters if there are more than one of these mobs, we can't do squat for crowd control reliably! Enchanters have stolen one of our key roles!.<br />
<br />
let me summarize further. TOO FEW JOBS, TOO MANY CLASSES.<br />
<br />
Shaman do NOT need to be healers. You will NOT be happy as a healer. We got a better heal, did that satisfy any of you in the least? The magic DoTs entertained for a few weeks until the novelty of completely-mana-inefficient DPS wore off. Rains, despite a hard coded 20% resist rate, were shown to produce better DPS.<br />
<br />
The blurring of the class with improved healing or DPS will just anger clerics and necromancers respectively.<br />
<br />
conclusion? Sony needs to create new jobs for classes.<br />
<br />
Ideas I have come up with so far:<br />
-&quot;channelling&quot; heals over time and damage over time spells, that heal massive amounts over time or damage over time but constantly drain large amounts of mana.<br />
-I came up with this one recently - tank linking. An int caster or wis caster could gain this ability, doesn't matter. The caster links to another character through a spell set. The caster cannot move, but serves as a &quot;rune&quot; that consists of his or her mana pool. If the tank is hit for 900 damage, the mana pool suffers a 900 point subtraction. Perhaps higher levels of the spell will offer a better rune:mana ratio.<br />
-resistances to certain damage types (slash, pierce, bludgeoning blah blah)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Shaman do NOT need to be healers. You will NOT be happy as a healer. We got a better heal, did that satisfy any of you in the least?<br />
Speak for yourself. I was happy as a healer from original game up to somewhere in mid to end PoP. And we did not get a better heal. We got a heal that is at the same level we had in PoP - which just does not cut it when you cut fight lengths in half.<br />
<br />
The magic DoTs entertained for a few weeks until the novelty of completely-mana-inefficient DPS wore off. Rains, despite a hard coded 20% resist rate, were shown to produce better DPS.<br />
What are you trying to prove here? That some sucky spells are more sucky then other sucky spells? That shaman DPS did not get a boost in Luclin?<br />
<br />
The blurring of the class with improved healing or DPS will just anger clerics and necromancers respectively.<br />
And the loss of our DPS and healing angered shaman. We need a fix not an upgrade to our class. We want to return to early PoP where slowing was mitigated but still mattered, where fights lasted long enough for poison to finish and where our mana regeneration was meaningful. We do not want to outheal clerics, we do not want to outdot necromancers. We want to contribute.<br />
Why is it that healing less then druids and DoT less then necromancers would step on those classes' toes, much less clerics'? Why is it that getting new spells a month into an expansion somehow angers certain classes while not getting them at the start of the expansion is just fine?<br />
<br />

-&quot;channelling&quot; heals over time and damage over time spells, that heal massive amounts over time or damage over time but constantly drain large amounts of mana.<br />
You know, replacing healing with healing-in-a-can does not create new raid roles.<br />
<br />

-resistances to certain damage types (slash, pierce, bludgeoning blah blah)<br />
Speaking for myself - healing is fun. Being a battery is not. Twitching an entire raid long bored necromancers to death. Producing rods by the million made magicians quit in droves.<br />
<br />
We had a ton of good suggestions for fixes on this board, both upgrades to existing spell lines as well as new spell lines and AAs. I do not think that your channeling or HP battery spells are preferable to them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I mean tank linking for example, how is 1:1 ratio healing going to save us when our 5k manapool meets a 2200 hitting boss? or even 1300 hitting trash?<br />
<br />
I think shaman are fine pre-GoD, nothing that a few tweaks wouldnt fix.<br />
<br />
I think the GoD expansion was badly designed and implemented at the higher stages (kodtaz+), which in turn has broken the shaman class.<br />
<br />
Ie: ikkiniz trials. When a second cleric is a better choice than a shaman, assuming cleric and shaman have equal gear/aa doesn't this SCREAM horribly broken? What are you going to give the shaman to make him replace that second cleric?<br />
<br />
Also, Brenlo doesnt really seem to have a grasp of the situation. To say we have 'upgrades' when our healing has been brought in line with clr/dru Gates ratios; then add the fact that our debuffs/slow/dots have been marginalised by fight length<br />
<br />

I feel totally validated having quit my shaman for a cleric.  I simply assumed based on their treatment of monks (another near useless class) that they would treat a 250 hp upgrade to our woefully underpowered fast heal as an end game solution.<br />
<br />
I don't raid but healing more than any other issue is why I gave up when we ran into content where slow is mitigated and I can't function as main healer.  It is NOT just in Gates and it is NOT just a highend raider issue. I take solace in the fact that under no circumstances will my new cleric ever get nerfed or be useless- just wish I had known this earlier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>smaaltz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Hell I wouldn't need any additional spells/upgrades if they would just make all the one-groupable named mobs in GoD mostly slowable.  That's right..  go through every single one-groupable named, let the shammies have the ability to play their role and slow them. Admit when you designed these zones you had ab-so-lutely no shammy role in mind, because you don't know what you're doing. It's okay, we all realize it, just come to terms with it and we can co-exist peacefully and I'll keep giving you 40 dollars a month.  Tell some coding intern to go to the 40ish total mobs I'm talking about and remove the immunity, could be on test tomorrow mornin. <br />
<br />
<br />
Immune to slow != Super way to make super difficult encounters. <br />
<br />
<br />
Immune to slow == Super way to make groups form with cleric cleric tank instead of cleric slower tank. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Honestly I would think as part of beta-testing an expansion you'd have taken a shaman through a trial or two.  I bet people at Blizzard have a QA dept. Or maybe the 500 shammies screaming to high heaven would have had some effect by now.  (thanks for the 50 extra hp per tick on our heal-over-time.. that will help a ton on the 2k quadding unslowables)<br />
<br />
Anyways, I'm not going to start rubbing on my personal bits just because the clueless one and spell guy finally admit their may be a problem.  I'm rub my bits when we get a buff with some freaking utility..  like a +50 avoidance buff, or a mini-defensive buff like Bulwark of Vie, or a +5% shielding buff.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Shaman do NOT need to be healers. You will NOT be happy as a healer. We got a better heal, did that satisfy any of you in the least?<br />
<br />
We are a priest class, we should be able to heal.  I'd rather be confident that I can HEAL someone to stay alive rather than say, &quot;My healing sucks.&quot;  Hell, I don't know how many times, I've been stuck as a main healer on raids, because not enough clerics or druids to go around (until more log in).  In fact, I was one for phase 1 in Time, just a week ago.  I had the beastlords slow and mages debuff... boy I felt important.  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Someone on these boards in some other thread, talked about another game that all major healing classes (maybe it's WoW or DAoC) heal the same and it's other abilities that seperate them.  Maybe that is what's wrong with EQ and healing classes.  Healing became too much of a focus for clerics and they end up with a gazillion different healing spells and the infamous CH, so it affected druids and shamans it terms of having much lesser healing.   Maybe we all should have the same healing except for CH and special AA's for clerics to give them &quot;the edge.&quot;<br />
<br />
I can make a chart of all the stuff a shaman can do.  Too many are equal or worse to other classes (and some spells don't have any business being shared by them or by us) and ONLY TWO areas we are better at:  Buffs and Slows.   One is obsolete and the other is nerfed with mitigation.  <br />
<br />
Devs can't possibly sit back saying nothing is wrong (Fan Faire reports) but they did.   I was glad when they acknowledged a while back that our healing was poor and actually made changes, but it felt like duct tape over a gas leak.  Taking months to &quot;get around&quot; to us just makes people quit.  I know it can't be an overnighter process, but you also don't got an expensive restaraunt and be told &quot;we'll look into it, but no promises&quot; and then only get an appetizer out of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Gates was just the double whammy that completely screwed us up.  We were a little underpower in some places and over in other places before.  Overall a shaman had a chance to be effective.  Making the fights shorter AND making everything mitigate/immune to slow was just too much.  Either one alone very effectively reduces the value of slow.  I know they dont want so much of the games' content designed around slow, but frankly, its too late.  So very much of this is designed around the bad decisions of the past, theres no way to straighten it out.</div></div><hr />

Speaking for myself, I do not wish to be the MAIN healer in anything other than trivial content. I made my shaman to buff and debuff, and contribute to healing and DPS as I can. <br />
<br />
I think one of the biggest problems is the amount of resources that SOE is willing to put into EQ-1 at this point. EQ-2 is on the horizon. And you KNOW Sony is looking at WoW as its MAIN competition. I imagine there is a HUGE chunk of SOE's resources focused in that direction (toward EQ2), rather than at the current cash-cow that is funding their PC gaming department. <br />
<br />
Other classes need attention too, there is no denying it. However, I also think that we have been ignored for FAR too long, in relation to some other classes especially. Warriors and other non-mana Melee got upgrades recently, Hybrids have always seemed to be one of the companies favorite group of classes to &quot;tweak&quot;.<br />
<br />
I think its totally ridiculous that our Hybrid class is SO superior to us in so many ways. How can they POSSIBLY justify giving our Hybrid class such better buffs, and such a MASSIVELY better pet, yet keep them SO close to our &quot;Class Defining&quot; ability. Its ridiculous. Can Paladins heal or buff as well as Clerics? Can SKs DOT or regen mana or summon pets as good as a Necro? Can rangers buff and heal and nuke anywhere CLOSE to a Druid? This is the stuff that fustrates me. <br />
<br />
I want a better fast nuke. Period. I dont care if its an AA with massive pre-requisites. I dont care if it only affects a single spell, like Spear of Torment. I think its time. I don't want to be a wizard, but is a 1000-1200 nuke with a 4-5 second cast REALLY unbalancing? Make it too expansive to chain cast if they want, I DONT CARE, but we NEED that utility. <br />
<br />
I also want a better MGBable buff than BLs have. Lets face it, SD is SO SO SO much bigger for BLs than BSS is for Paladins as their &quot;primary&quot; buff. My gosh, what were they THINKING when they made SD and didnt give us a similar version. I want a better buff than that, period. One that overwrites it too, BLs still have buffing utility with Paragon, Vigor line, etc. SD is a bunch of crap in relation to our best buffs. Focus and FA are a joke. Paladins dont get any buffs even CLOSE to Virtue or the biggest Symbol, why do BLs get buffs equal or BETTER than ours. <br />
<br />
I also want a legitimate de-buff for the 20 second fight world that SOE has created. One that actually MATTERS. Casting slow when a mob is 1/2 dead is not cutting it. Give me something that has a big -resist rate, that cuts a mobs attack ability, and maybe even puts a 50% slow on. The difference between a 50% and a 70% slow in a 20 second fight is minimal, especially if the 50% slow includes another mitigating feature. <br />
<br />
I dunno, I am just rambling now. Fustrated with my role, even on POP EP minis. I sure am the KING of trivial content though, . . .<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Ubex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I wonder if the developers realize how much the &quot;Well Played Enchanter&quot; has reduced the demand for shaman in xp groups at lvl 65 on.<br />
<br />
For slowing, the chanter can tash and slow is a bit faster than malos + tugur's.<br />
<br />
For attack buff, i think most melees would  would easily chose SoV + NDT over SLTW + FA, Chanter provides more haste, nearly as much +atk, and an aggro generating lifetap proc.<br />
<br />
Almost any caster and many hybrid classes would chose C3, C4, or C5 over 500 hp if choice had to be made.<br />
<br />
And finally, an able chanter can outdamage the entire group with a CoD pet in many zones.<br />
<br />
For knowledgabel groups with a good chaner available there is little reason to chose shaman other than friendship.<br />
<br />
While the case is nowhere near so strong, one could argue that the beastlord is at least an equally valid choice as shaman for slower in group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">All that matters in EQ today is fast damage, fast healing and tanking.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I feel the healing upgrades we recieved were CLOSE to the mark, but still fell a bit short. Speaking for myself, I do not wish to be the MAIN healer in anything other than trivial content. I made my shaman to buff and debuff, and contribute to healing and DPS as I can. <br />
I did not see us getting any upgrades - Daluda's Mending is the fix to us not getting a new heal like every other healer, including paladins. The slight upgrade to Quiescence and Trushar is all but meaningless - we already did well on the long term small amount healing chart, not that that chart matters much in GoD or the previous expansions.<br />
<br />
And speaking for myself as well as looking at our one big petition I can tell you that as one of the three original healer classes I do want to heal. Healing was a primary role of the class from day one and it was the top issue on the &quot;what do we need most&quot; poll that lead to the one voice post. Furthermore healing stacks, giving us a little more stackability on raids. More debuffs would be nice of course but with the current encounter length the upgrades would have to be enormous to restore us to our early PoP position. Improving healing is more feasible, gives us more raid stackability and is what most shaman want.<br />
<br />
I think we should heal as well as clerics on fully slowable MOBs, a bit better then druids on mosty slowable MOBs, about as well as druids on partially slowable MOBs and worse then them on slightly slowable or unslowable MOBs. Of course a cleric with only bard slows will still outheal me but at least a cleric and a shaman will heal better then a single cleric without slow. The current state of healing is just ridiculous.<br />
<br />
Other classes need attention too, there is no denying it. However, I also think that we have been ignored for FAR too long, in relation to some other classes especially.<br />
Amen. I do not mind any other classes getting fixes. However we have been ignored for ages now while other classes have been in and out of the spotlight several times already. How long are our pets unshrinkable now?<br />
<br />
I think its totally ridiculous that our Hybrid class is SO superior to us in so many ways. How can they POSSIBLY justify giving our Hybrid class such better buffs, and such a MASSIVELY better pet, yet keep them SO close to our &quot;Class Defining&quot; ability. Its ridiculous. Can Paladins heal or buff as well as Clerics?<br />
Actually paladins outbuff clerics. They should not though, just as our hybrid class should not outbuff us.<br />
<br />
I want a better fast nuke. Period. I dont care if its an AA with massive pre-requisites. I dont care if it only affects a single spell, like Spear of Torment. I think its time. I don't want to be a wizard, but is a 1000-1200 nuke with a 4-5 second cast REALLY unbalancing? Make it too expansive to chain cast if they want, I DONT CARE, but we NEED that utility. <br />
Agreed. The exact amount is debatable but I do not understand why we have fallen so far behind clerics (who used to nuke worse then us) and are now arguably being overtaken by hybrids.<br />
<br />
I also want a better MGBable buff than BLs have. Lets face it, SD is SO SO SO much bigger for BLs than BSS is for Paladins as their &quot;primary&quot; buff. My gosh, what were they THINKING when they made SD and didnt give us a similar version. I want a better buff than that, period.

Paladins dont get any buffs even CLOSE to Virtue or the biggest Symbol, why do BLs get buffs equal or BETTER than ours. <br />
Again, agreed. Melee focus effects on our focus line seem fitting, are already in game and are unique. I do not need to buff mana regen like everyone else does nowadays but being outbuffed in all areas by my hybrid class when the shaman was originally advertised as a buffing class irks me.<br />
<br />
I also want a legitimate de-buff for the 20 second fight world that SOE has created. One that actually MATTERS. Casting slow when a mob is 1/2 dead is not cutting it. Give me something that has a big -resist rate, that cuts a mobs attack ability, and maybe even puts a 50% slow on. The difference between a 50% and a 70% slow in a 20 second fight is minimal, especially if the 50% slow includes another mitigating feature. <br />
I disagree. There is basically two kinds of (melee damage) debuffing, static debuffs and scaling debuffs. Static debuffs are not in game as such but think of them as runes or the like, things that substract a fixed amount of DPS. Scaling debuffs substract a percentage. With the fight lengths as is any debuff better be dirt cheap and fast casting or reduce damage dealt by at least two thirds, however it does that.<br />
<br />
Now, if you are talking fixed damage reduction anything that reduces the damage of a GoD MOB by two thirds or more will lower the damage of anything pre-GoD to zero so that is out.<br />
<br />
That leaves us with scaling debuffs. As it does not make any sense to pair a weaker slow with an additional debuff to make up for the lost slow you basically have slow for scaling debuffs. You can still fiddle with mana cost, resist rates, spell duration, casting speed and mitigation (given that short fights are here to stay).<br />
<br />
As it would pretty much take an instant cast free slow to make taking a shaman to GoD worthwhile the obvious solution seems to be to either lower the resist rate or remove mitigation. I would be in favor if simply removing mitigation altogether from GoD (possibly let bosses mitigate mostly or partially).<br />
<br />
I sure am the KING of trivial content though, . . .<br />
And here I was thinking that was paladins and shadowknights and necromancers.  :D <br />
We sure are the best at surviving indefinite lengths of time against trivial content though or as a friend of mine put, the best at not actually killing stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Regarding short encounters:<br />
<br />
Why are there no long fights anymore? Apparently design thinks long fights are boring. Personally I find repetition to be boring.<br />
<br />
Imagine that the following series of MOBs are all upgraded to be as hard as GoD MOBs, though with differing HPs, damage output, etc. Which of these sequences of MOBs looks like it would be more fun to kill to you? Which one takes more skill? Which one takes a more balanced group?<br />
<br />
Sequence A<br />
- A Rubble Rouser<br />
- 3 x An angry Sapling<br />
- A Ra'Tuk Decimator<br />
- A fire mephit<br />
- A Krup Wizard<br />
- A Noc cadavor<br />
<br />
Sequence B<br />
- An Ukun Bloodbeast<br />
- A Noc Cadavor<br />
- A Ra'Tuk Decimator<br />
- An Aneuk Seer<br />
- A flinty cragbeast<br />
- A Pookah<br />
<br />
Why is it that we have a single cookie cutter applied to an entire expansion? If I designed an expansion that way I would expect certain classes to get obsolete. For every single given MOB you have a single or very few group combinations that are optimal or close to optimal. If an entire expansion is essentially a single MOB you have a single ideal group design for an entire expansion.<br />
<br />
TO me the obvious solution is to simply create more varied content - it sure does not seem to be harder then rebalancing ten classes, and doing it again in the next expansion when the favored group is cleric / shadowknight / shadowknight / shadowknight / shadowknight / bard.</div></div><hr />

Efficiency on DoTs is so meaningless now.  It's to the point where I don't even cast Blood of Hate (the highest dps 30 sec SK fast dot) because it's not like it will run to duration.

<br />
Personally, I would also like to not be a worse choice than a beastlord so often in pre-GoD content either.  I know if I'm on my SK and given a chance to have a shaman or a beastlord for LDON, for instance, it's BL hands down.  It would be nice if the hybrid wasn't just as good at the duties of the class he came from that he obviates the need for that class.  Nobody looks at taking a pally instead of a cleric for healing.  <br />
<br />
This happens quite often in PoP too -- people looking for slowers hold out for a LONG time to get chanters or BL's, as the slows are good enough and chanter/BL bring so much more DPS and/or utility to the equation.  They don't really need shamans to DOT anything to death there, and if they need shaman healing, they probably aren't going to start the group anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>sekcbaba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I forget who mentioned the intrinsic problem with casual shamans ruining upgrades for raiding shamans, but I really think you hit the nail on the head. I am most deffinately a casual player, have not been in a raiding guild for a good while now, and can say for certain that, compared to classes with similar equipment, I am overpowered in the content i play in. This power comes from the rate of mana regeneration acheivable from luclin era spells and aa abilities. These abilities are obviously phased out by current raid encounters - despite having the single greatest mana recovery rate, shamans have nothing to actually expend their mana on in large raids. Improving shamans healing will increase the power of the casual gamer. Increasing shamans slowing and debuffing can potentially drastically increase the power of the casual gamer. Same with defensive buffs. The only feasable ability that would give raiding shamans something to do without overpowering casual gamer shamans would be some form of strike through/ accuracy / etc enhancing buff. Put these on an upgraded ferine avatarish buff with a low duration to keep shamans busy. minus the old stat buffs, and make the spell available in kodtazish content. I dont think this is that unreasonable and would give high level shamans something unique without overpowering casual gamers. and move the ancient canny spell to ferubi etc so casual gamers can get it and be overpowered ^^. hehe wishful thinking, good luck to you raiders, i feel for ya.</div></div><hr />

But you did not list new jobs - you listed slight variations on existing jobs. How do your suggested spells differ from the current healing system except for promoting less interaction?<br />
<br />
I am not even sure if it is possible to truly create new raid roles, nor do I think it is necessary to create new raid roles. Just create varied encounters and the roles will follow from that.<br />

<br />
You don't know what you want, because you've never had any of it.<br />
We do not want any of it, nor have we asked for it. We want to be a healer in single group content, we want to buff better then our hybrid and we want to nuke about as well as clerics.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Zorash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Greetings,<br />
<br />
So many good ideas, so little time.  Hopefully they're actually taking some of them into consideration.  I'd love to see some positive changes, like so many others out there.<br />
<br />
There are definitely many classes in need of help, so patience is required, but hopefully they can show us that they're working on it, soon.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the link.<br />

Be Well,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">At some point we need to realize that a drive by post does not mean we have their attention.<br />
<br />
Thats all i got to say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">This statement really perplexes me. If it's your job to have face time with the classes and be the intermediary between staff and customers shouldn't you be taking the time to maintain those lines of communication. It doesnt take that much time or effort to prepare statements to each class figure if nothing is actively happening 5 minutes and probably 30 minutes max for a large update on a class. At the most they probably make 1 or 2 &quot;Significant&quot; changes to a class per month so total time would be on average 2 hours a week. I say get off your A$$es and simply start posting something anything to inform your customer base what is actively happening in the development of the game. <br />
Just think of all the hate and discontent that could have been averted had someone simply continued posting even irregularly (weekly or bi-weekly hell even once a month) on the class boards. Instead we get a dribble of posts on what 2 threads and the overreaction of &quot;Look they are doing something so shutup and quit whining.&quot; Now we see that that something was little to no effect on the situations that are actually broken and have been posted on repeatedly for months.<br />
<br />
Perhaps they are actually attempting to open those lines of communication but I really question what motivation is behind it. Is it increased competition or the extreme rate of customer's departing?<br />
<br />
The problem with doing that is the fact that if they were to say &quot;we are thinking about doing X&quot;, it will be translated into &quot;we are doing X&quot; by the player community, particulary if it turns out to be unfeasible. In the long run that creates more dissention than it alleviates. And if they really are &quot;doing X&quot;, if it doesnt happen next week everyone starts bitching. I think a case in point was the melee balanceing stuff they did. They went on for the longest while in their upcoming stuff updates, and nothing happened. And then slowly what was originally talked about evaporated, presumably as a result of more detailed examinations of the original ideas exposing what sort of domino effects those would have. In the end the changes to melee were just a pale shadow of what they could have been (all those abilities are still in the test database btw).The best way to deal with that sort of situation is not to say anything unless you are sure that you can implement it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Exactly where you draw the line between &quot;well, this is not all that bad&quot; and &quot;shaman are useless&quot; differs from shaman to shaman. The general consensus seems to be that time geared shaman in LDoN hards have serious issues and that everyone has huge glaring problems in GoD. (Sewers and up that is. I have not really seen anything about pre-trial content.)<br />
<br />
I think it would be more accurate to say &quot;Shaman with time geared groups in LDoN hards have serious issues&quot;, the problem IMO is that for groups of that sort, the content is largely trivial, and with trivial content the need for specialist classes is greatly reduced. Gear will let you deal with trivial content with setups that normally would not be regarded as ideal. The fact that the shaman themselves are time geared or not isn't the factor here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shaman are a specialist class? That is news to me.<br />
<br />
And the problem is not us being useless on trivial content. The problem is high DPS low HP MOBs that mitigate slow.<br />
<br />
And gear has a lot to do with shaman having issues. Compare a FT1 barely 65 shaman to a FT1 barely 65 cleric, even on MOBs that mitigate slow and the shaman looks pretty good. Does not heal as well, lasts longer. Buffs a lot less HPs, can buff haste. Fights last a lot longer too when people use windblades and unfocused nukes.<br />
<br />
Now look at time geared people. If the cleric ever goes out of mana a group relying on shaman heals has already wiped five times. The fights last half the time they used to if you are lucky. At the same time MOBs hit harder, lowering the impact of your heal over time spells and mitigate slow more. Shaman find themselves without the time to add a little damage or even to cannibalize.<br />
<br />
And then you enter LDoN and find out that MOBs hit harder and have fewer HPs then the elemental MOBs you used to kill for experience. A while later in GoD that trend continues and gets worse with each tier. Gear is just as much a part of that progression as the zones themselves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">I wonder if the developers realize how much the &quot;Well Played Enchanter&quot; has reduced the demand for shaman in xp groups at lvl 65 on.<br />
<br />
For slowing, the chanter can tash and slow is a bit faster than malos + tugur's.<br />
<br />
For attack buff, i think most melees would  would easily chose SoV + NDT over SLTW + FA, Chanter provides more haste, nearly as much +atk, and an aggro generating lifetap proc.<br />
<br />
Almost any caster and many hybrid classes would chose C3, C4, or C5 over 500 hp if choice had to be made.<br />
<br />
And finally, an able chanter can outdamage the entire group with a CoD pet in many zones.<br />
<br />
For knowledgabel groups with a good chaner available there is little reason to chose shaman other than friendship.<br />
<br />
While the case is nowhere near so strong, one could argue that the beastlord is at least an equally valid choice as shaman for slower in group.<br />
<br />
In the real world there isnt any significant difference in casting time between tash/slow and malos/slow, and in many situations the former is more dangerous that the later, and the class casting it happens to be less likely to survive the attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;For attack buff, i think most melees would  would easily chose SoV + NDT over SLTW + FA&quot;. Ummm...No!!! NDT is usually cast on the MT only, and the MT will pretty much ALLWAYS want hp over atk.<br />
<br />
Casters might choose C3/5 over 500hp, but I'm pretty sure that melee would want the hp.<br />
<br />
A charmed pet might out-damage an entire group in some zones, but not all zones have suitable mobs. Where chanters can do this, it is very dangerous and requires a LOT of the chanters attention, which means that they cant do other things during that time. Shaman complement chanters pretty well when you have a charmed pet running around. And as you pointed out, a charmed pet does a lot of dps, which means that group members dps is much less important than the utility that they bring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Sorry to break it to you, but monks are far from useless.<br />
I used to play a monk before they were destroyed, please enlighten me under what circumstances monks are still useful.  Bear in mind I'm a casual player in bazaar gear as is the one (1) monk remaining in my guild (rest quit and made BSTs).<br />
<br />
Actually I'll give you one scenario where our monk friend is useful- chain pulling mobs to our charmed pet in Tactics.  His pitiful dps is not missed and FD pulling can be handy because me (sk) am too busy tanking to do it instead.  Of course, swap in a bard for him and it would still be a better choice.<br />
<br />
A bazaar sk is better in every possible category over a bazaar monk, at least in my experience/parses.  Lay it on me and show me the error of my ways.</div></div><hr />

Where chanters can do this, it is very dangerous and requires a LOT of the chanters attention, which means that they cant do other things during that time.<br />
All the zones us casual plebians have access to offer solid charming, though.  I parsed our dual-wielding zek initiate at 650 dps in Tactics last week.  We did not use slow.  I tanked the mob being beatdown w/o slow while my L48 (at the time) cleric cast typically 1-2 cheals per fight.  Slow in the content we have access to is a non-issue when mobs are getting raped in &lt; 30 seconds.<br />
<br />
We could probably have just had the charmed pet tank, but this way when charm breaks the chanter only has to deal w/ the pet, not another angry mob.  This will only get more abusive when my cleric gets her L61+ stuns.<br />
<br />
It may be applicable to flagged content that we'll never see, however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">In the real world there isnt any significant difference in casting time between tash/slow and malos/slow, and in many situations the former is more dangerous that the later, and the class casting it happens to be less likely to survive the attention.<br />
Enchanters do not tank worse then shaman. Multiple runes make sure of that. And how come any difference in casting speeds is &quot;not significant&quot; while differences in aggro are?<br />
<br />
&quot;For attack buff, i think most melees would  would easily chose SoV + NDT over SLTW + FA&quot;. Ummm...No!!! NDT is usually cast on the MT only, and the MT will pretty much ALLWAYS want hp over atk.<br />
SoV+NDT buffs just as much HPs as SLTW+Fa - zero.<br />
<br />
Casters might choose C3/5 over 500hp, but I'm pretty sure that melee would want the hp.<br />
Hybrids? I am not sure of that at all, especially given that shielding type spells do not stack with focus anyways. Often a hybrid will have to give up a lot less then 540 HPs.<br />
<br />
A charmed pet might out-damage an entire group in some zones, but not all zones have suitable mobs. Where chanters can do this, it is very dangerous and requires a LOT of the chanters attention, which means that they cant do other things during that time.<br />
My guild's enchanters are entirely capable of mezing multiple MOBs with a charmed pet. How exactly does a charmed pet prevent you from doing anything at all by the way? The risk may go up - I am not even sure of that, given how many hard fights are made trivial with the pet - but the actual time spent on charming is minimal.<br />
<br />
Shaman complement chanters pretty well when you have a charmed pet running around. And as you pointed out, a charmed pet does a lot of dps, which means that group members dps is much less important than the utility that they bring.<br />
With a charmed pet around shaman heal and malosinia the pet. Clerics outheal us by a factor of fifty or so when you are talking emergencies, can rez, stun and provide more HPs then shaman. Druids heal better, have a charm of their own and can snare. Magicians can malosinia and offer more DPS then a shaman. Rangers can snare. Most importantly though another enchanter provides yet more insane damage, stun, mez, rune and root to deal with rogue pets.<br />
<br />
At best shaman are in the middle of the bunch when complementing a charming enchanter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ivloney: &quot;Best&quot; is always subjective and depends on what style suits you. Most needed though is clerics, for sure. Of course you always needed tons of clerics for raids. What changed is that you now need them for groups too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Ivloney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">So what I meant was there are no lines forming in the complaint section for the cleric class?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">No, clerics always complain.  If they had a CH for 20 mana they'd still complain.  Every class complains.  Clerics are often extremely paranoid; practically any and every new heal given anybody has led to virtual riots among the clerics.  Going all the way back to CHLOROBLAST for goodness sake.  Clerics complain plenty. But ask yourself, how many raids, guilds, or groups want or need clerics?  Being a cleric is still the quickest route the to the end game.  The only thing that is a bit of a pain is the epic.<br />
<br />
As for Tugela's remark, &quot;NDT is usually cast on the MT only, and the MT will pretty much ALLWAYS want hp over atk,&quot; forgetting the HP part since it doesn't make sense and pretty much invalidates your entire statement in the first place, it's worth noting that plenty of people like NDT, not just MT's.  Not everyone wants FA.  Rangers usually just tell me to skip it, for instance.</div></div><hr />

Then it's not really an argument. Not every group has a chanter, not every chanter is capable of keeping a charmed pet for long, etc. Monks have still a place, in raids as in XP groups. With the new pacify discs helping them some.<br />
But the new expansion has brought back the cleric, warrior, chanter trio again .. but if I remember correctly it was the same with PoP when it started, and with hard LDoNs too.<br />
What I mean is this: How many of you thought PoJ trials undoable with a shaman as main healer? And now look where you are.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH IS BY NO MEANS A RANT- IT IS JUST MY VIEW OF GAME DYNAMICS.<br />
<br />
GoD the present Expansion:  Groups from all three genres will see the new content, and many from each group will get the spells.  The Casual is hurting the strength of those spells. Now, before the casual players out there start screaming let me explain.<br />
<br />
The Uber will more likely set up camp in GoD, with only a few excursions to LDoN/Elementals.<br />
<br />
The raider may move to GoD, but will more likely play in Sol Ro/LDoN.<br />
<br />
The casual may do a few groups in GoD, then head to BoT, do some LDoNs, play in Tactics, solo, etc.  (This is where the problem is.)<br />
<br />
Game Developers like to see new spells and new gear being used in new content.  Using new stuff in old expansions trivializes old content.  They have already seen what an extra 50-100 aa's can do to- look at BoT and LDoN.  By many it is considered &quot;trivial&quot; content, but it is still well traveled by the casual player.  You make the spells weaker and it hurts those in the new content, you make the spell stronger and it further trivializes old content.  You can't change a 65 shaman's abilities without effecting all content.  Unfortunately, Game developers tend to go with the flow and expect the nerf police to be their watchdog.  The Nerf-police didn't move fast enough on MGB HoT's and Charm, and now its too late because the Developers have taken it as the norm.<br />
<br />
The Game Developers are not worried about what the 8k monk can solo, because they can write it off as trivial content.  What the Game Developers are worried about is what the 5k monk can solo, because then it becomes a class balance issue.  At this current time we have players scattered across 3 high end expansions: Luclin, PoP, and GoD.  The majority of these players are 65.  They all have roughly the same spells which each group having a different level of gear.  The Game Developers don't worry about what the ubers are going to do- they already know what is going to happen.  They are going to park their butt in the new content until they see the end of it.  The Game Developers are worried about what the casuals are going to do, because the will be the players that will bounce between the three.<br />
<br />
I didn't write this post as a rant on the casual player.  I am merely saying the casual group is the most unpredictable of the three groups.  Sometimes the casual will jump over to the new content, sometimes he will stay put, and the Game Developers have to predict that.  It is a major issue because as a class we are having major issues in End-PoP/GoD, but we are fine in LDoN normal/BoT/Tactics/older re-vamped zones. So, I salute the casual player..you have confused the **** out of SOE, and quite honestly, I don't think they have a clue on how to fix it.<br />
<br />
Edited some grammar.<br />
<br />
Hello everyone, this is my first post although I've been reading these forums for the last few months.  I spent 4 years being blissfully ignorant of any problems that shamans might be having by not reading forums on EQ in the past.  It seems that every game that I read the forums for I end up hating and quitting (DAoC, AO, SWG, SB, AC2, FFXI to name a few).  I guess I just figured stuff out on my own and none of these issues really seemed to effect my everyday gameplay.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, I finally felt that I needed to respond to this post in particular, even though I realize you aren't ranting at the casual players.<br />
<br />
Exactly what content do you think SOE needs to protect from being trivialized in this glorious, venerable age of EQ?  If the improvements in healing, slowing, dotting, nuking, etc., were given to all shamans, what effect will this have?  I can't imagine any of these things making any old world encounter any easier than it already is.  Am I now going to be able to solo myself 600 AA's or something?  Or now maybe I can go farm cash for endless amounts of time and buy the best bazaar gear I can get?  Or now I can actually contribute to groups a tad better and relieve ourselves of the dependence on the &quot;holy trinity&quot; of classes (particularly healer, not that this is really a problem anyway with pre-PoP stuff anyway).  LDON's can't get any easier than they already are and I would still have to spend hundreds of hours doing them to get a full set of 1492 pt armor with some 1150 pt focus and hp augs.  And then my gear will still not even be close to end-game guild shamans stuff anyway.  Not to mention that a lot of this content is already trivialized by a lot of other classes.<br />
<br />
Name some items or encounters that will result in worthwhile gear upgrades that a casual shaman would now be able to do that will suddenly imbalance the game?  There are few things that can be done solo (for good gear upgrades), and I don't think improved abilities of shamans are going to make or break any raid encounters.  At best maybe we can contribute better to BoT groups and can maybe actually loot that rare piece of ornate or a spectral parchment ourselves.  We're not going to flood any markets any more than they are already either.  Many of the ubers currently farm ornate in SolRo and sell it for 100's of thousands of plat in the bazaar (at least on my server).  Then they can afford to get their Elder Holgresh Beads or Mana Robes or whatever, as if they even need that crap anyway.<br />
<br />
Now I'm rambling, I guess this was just a long-winded attempt to say that I don't agree with this particular reason for not improving shamans.  So maybe a casual shaman in a small guild might actually get a bit more enjoyment out of playing their class, but making improvements to shamans in no way trivializes anything that would impact anyone. <br />
<br />

You don't get it I guess. Go all the way back .. you played in Luclin at best when PoP came out. What were the toughest XP mob hitting you? 200 maybe. Then we entered PoP, tried Exe trial, and 4 mobs spawned simultaniously and hit for like 350s max. You see the similarity?<br />

<br />
Don't forget I'm talking bazaar level- I have no clue how monks stack up in the raid game for dps.  Bazaar rangers w/ stonewood bow annihilate bazaar monk dps as do bazaar rogues w/ epic.<br />
<br />
In normal LDoNs my sk + pet will do as much if not more than a bazaar monk wielding a SoFW, and this is while tanking and pulling no less.  I've watched every single monk that used to group w/ us quit and start beastlords because after finding out you're getting out-dps'd by the tank and you're not even the puller (pet pulling &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; monk pulling) it gets old fast.<br />
<br />
If we're looking for a dps class:<br />
- any int caster (unless you don't charm, then skip enchanter)<br />
- beastlord (as much for utility as dps)<br />
- AM3/EQ ranger<br />
- rogue<br />
- sk (utility + offtanking + another FT10)<br />
- monk if not undead, paladin if undead heavy content<br />
<br />
Yeah, monks are very high on the dps list.  You aren't needed for pulling in most content, your dps is subpar, you can't offtank and you offer no utility.  Great class.<br />
<br />

Agreed - the problem is not that things are much harder then the PoJustice trials used to be.<br />
<br />
There is a problem though, and that problem is the entire expansion is that way. If all of PoP was modeled after the PoJustice trials people would have complained too (and there were tons of complaints even so).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Anjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">I don't think that comparing GoD to early PoP and the PoJ trials is a fair comparison.  In PoP, when you tried and failed the PoJ trials at the opening of the expansion, you knew that you still had 4 or 5 more levels to advance, had 20+ spells yet to get, and had an entire expansion of gear waiting for you once you got beyond it the first time.  Based on that, you knew PoJ would eventually get much easier.<br />
<br />
I don't see that happening the way things are in GoD.  The max level cap stays the same all the benefits you would get from that are non-existant.  We get 4 new spells instead of 20+, and none provides drastically upgraded performance over our current spells.  The only thing you have to look forward to will be equipment upgrades.  Now, I don't doubt that shamen that clear GoD will be pushing 10000+ hps and 2000+ AC, but even with those stats I don't see a shaman tanking trials past the sewers.  Current knights can't even tank many of the trials with better stats that than.  I think, post-GoD clearing, knights will be able to do so, but I'm not betting that you'll ever see the dramatic increases in all classes you did from pre and post-PoP.  Not with the fixed level cap and the spells we've seen so far in GoD.</div></div><hr />

Hmm....seems that this post was worthy of a red rep bump with the comment &quot;monks are more broken than Shamans and Shamans are broken.&quot; from some anonymous individual  :D .<br />
<br />
Last time I looked monks put out better dps than most melee, and are still the primary pullers for difficult content. SKs can pull with FD, but from my experience they are rather more unreliable at it, due to the cast time I guess. The SKs themselves defer to monks for pulling if one is present. Guess that makes monks broken  :p . And yes I know, classes with pacify/lull type spells can pull too. You regularly see them being mushed on hard content when it gets resisted :rolleyes:. Just because they can do it doesnt mean they should do it.  <br />

Yep, Anonymous_Individual_01 is entirely correct, Monks are truly broken, no group or raid could possible want such a useless broken class  :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">Hmm....seems that this post was worthy of a red rep bump with the comment &quot;monks are more broken than Shamans and Shamans are broken.&quot; from some anonymous individual  :D .<br />
<br />
I can assure you it wasn't me- I don't even have a clue how to access someone's reputation, much less care enough to do it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Last time I looked monks put out better dps than most melee, and are still the primary pullers for difficult content. SKs can pull with FD, but from my experience they are rather more unreliable at it, due to the cast time I guess. The SKs themselves defer to monks for pulling if one is present.<br />
<br />
In normal LDoNs I (sk) am always puller.  At this point though it's not like you need singles, so that doesn't count.  In LDoN hards if a monk is present sometimes the monk pulls, sometimes Jobaber pulls, sometimes we tag team.  Between insta-invis, pet pulling and snare splitting, sk's are usually as good or better pullers than monks.  Though I will say that I go through a lot of bone chips in LDoN hards when you're pet pulling hasted mobs.  Not many monks can pull WHILE FD, yet sk's and necros can and it's about as safe as you can get on a nasty split.  Group w/ an sk that knows how to pet pull well and you'll see what I'm talking about.  Hint: indoor sow can be cast on pets too.<br />
<br />
As for letting the monk pull, I'll pretty much let anyone else pull if I can get away with it.  Gives me time to med a bit between pulls to keep up my dps and it's hard enough being the tank and the healer w/o adding pulling into it also.  That doesn't necessarily mean the monk is the best choice, however.<br />
<br />
<br />
Monks are truly broken, no group or raid could possible want such a useless broken class  :eek:<br />
It's not that monks are useless- it's that, like shamans, they don't have any ability that is so useful and unique that there isn't a better alternative than them in every possible category.</div></div><hr />

No, we don't. We have their distraction.<br />
<br />
They didn't pick a mature thread were discussion had been going on for a while and issues had been, if not resolved, at least circumscribed and focused. They choose instead the latest of the most appeasing, low replies-volume thread on the subject.<br />
<br />
The instant result was a series of  very cogent and completely scattered replies as everyone suddenly grab at the limited opportunity to display their visions. Or, for the members of the 'I am god's gift to groups in BoT' group, their lack thereof. <br />
<br />
Folks, they ignored every other summation of the shaman issues we presented them for months. Now, they created a 'channel of communication' in the way that will the most certainly insure the lowest possible signal-to-noise ratio. They're setting up to do the same thing they have ever done... they're gonna pick the most inept examples, hold them up to ridicule, find the easiest, smallest bone to throw us and proclaim all is well. Everything else will then be open to classification under the 'beating a dead horse' heading if ever brought up again.<br />
<br />
We already had a reasonable consensus on the shaman issues. The 'One Voice (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=19207)' post covered it. It may need to be updated a bit from the latest changes, it may not cover EVERYTHING that is wrong with the class... but it's still the one thing that managed to pull the most agreement from our community.<br />

Life is power... eq is a game. If death in EQ makes you pissed off... not just a little pissed but REALLY pissed off, then you need to get out of the house more... and your problems have nothing to do with EQ. <br />
<br />
If you believe you have a legitemate issue, address it reasonably, otherwise how about comming to grips with the fact that you may not be able to get every single item in the game, and guess what... your bank isn't big enough to hold em if you got em. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Predicus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">Hello everyone, this is my first post although I've been reading these forums for the last few months.  I spent 4 years being blissfully ignorant of any problems that shamans might be having by not reading forums on EQ in the past.  It seems that every game that I read the forums for I end up hating and quitting (DAoC, AO, SWG, SB, AC2, FFXI to name a few).  I guess I just figured stuff out on my own and none of these issues really seemed to effect my everyday gameplay.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, I finally felt that I needed to respond to this post in particular, even though I realize you aren't ranting at the casual players.<br />
<br />
Exactly what content do you think SOE needs to protect from being trivialized in this glorious, venerable age of EQ?  If the improvements in healing, slowing, dotting, nuking, etc., were given to all shamans, what effect will this have?  I can't imagine any of these things making any old world encounter any easier than it already is.  Am I now going to be able to solo myself 600 AA's or something?  Or now maybe I can go farm cash for endless amounts of time and buy the best bazaar gear I can get?  Or now I can actually contribute to groups a tad better and relieve ourselves of the dependence on the &quot;holy trinity&quot; of classes (particularly healer, not that this is really a problem anyway with pre-PoP stuff anyway).  LDON's can't get any easier than they already are and I would still have to spend hundreds of hours doing them to get a full set of 1492 pt armor with some 1150 pt focus and hp augs.  And then my gear will still not even be close to end-game guild shamans stuff anyway.  Not to mention that a lot of this content is already trivialized by a lot of other classes.<br />
<br />
Name some items or encounters that will result in worthwhile gear upgrades that a casual shaman would now be able to do that will suddenly imbalance the game?  There are few things that can be done solo (for good gear upgrades), and I don't think improved abilities of shamans are going to make or break any raid encounters.  At best maybe we can contribute better to BoT groups and can maybe actually loot that rare piece of ornate or a spectral parchment ourselves.  We're not going to flood any markets any more than they are already either.  Many of the ubers currently farm ornate in SolRo and sell it for 100's of thousands of plat in the bazaar (at least on my server).  Then they can afford to get their Elder Holgresh Beads or Mana Robes or whatever, as if they even need that crap anyway.<br />
<br />
Now I'm rambling, I guess this was just a long-winded attempt to say that I don't agree with this particular reason for not improving shamans.  So maybe a casual shaman in a small guild might actually get a bit more enjoyment out of playing their class, but making improvements to shamans in no way trivializes anything that would impact anyone. <br />

Ok, first off- &quot;I&quot; wasn't saying no to upgrades.  I was merely explaining what SOE could be looking at.  Below is a link to an earlier post where I talked about the progress rate of the uber/raider/casual player.<br />
<br />
http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=20924<br />
<br />
In a nutshell, I basically explained that SOE sees content &quot;by expansion not by zone&quot; as trivial/untrivial.  Going to give an example so you get what I am talking about.<br />
<br />
X player is able to solo efficiently in new/last uber expansion to include named.<br />
<br />
Sony targets ability to solo efficiently and nerfs it. (ex: faction war in Tactics, chanters' ability to solo named in BoT.)<br />
<br />
X player is able to solo efficiently in old expansion to include named.<br />
<br />
Sony targets loot tables or solo xp modifier and nerfs it. (ex: Kael arena/manor drop rate; PoG loot drop rate)<br />
<br />
Somewhere between Verant/Velious- SOE/Luclin, someone decided that raiding was a natural progression that &quot;all&quot; players would go through.  They assumed that &quot;all&quot; players would spend 26 hours farming X key piece or go kill X mob that gives a flag.  The casual player does not follow these rules- they choose not to.  That being said, here is a list of &quot;xp&quot; zones for the casual/non-raider/non-flagger.<br />
<br />
all tier 1 PoP zones (46+)<br />
Plane of Valor/Plane of Storms/Crypt of Decay (55+)<br />
Bastion of Thunder/Halls of Honor  (62+)<br />
Plane of Tactics (quest key)<br />
LDoN<br />
<br />
Now, there are other zones that can give xp near this list, but these are the zones that are the heaviest traveled.  That being said, these are the zones that &quot;casuals&quot; will be in whether the content is trivial or not.<br />
SOE has to prepare for the likelyhood that &quot;casual&quot; shamans will bounce between GoD content and &quot;trivial&quot; content.  That being said, a spell which may be &quot;just right&quot; in GoD can be &quot;overpowering&quot; for the perceived trivial content.  While you may see the content as trivial, SOE does not because they know that the content is still heavily traveled by those who feel the content is &quot;not&quot; trivial.  There are still many players out there who are not 65 and who do not have 25 twinked alts out there.  If SOE only had to worry about the uber raiders or the casuals then it would be easier to create content because they could then tailor the content to their respective speed.  There will always be the &quot;fighting&quot; between the uber raider who burns countless hours on raid targets and the casual who burns countless hours in X grind zone.  Each group feels that have earned the right to whatever uber item.<br />
<br />
As far as burning countless hours in LDoN for the 1492 armor- there is always GoD.  I know you may have issues with the holy trinity, but to be honest, the sewers still function like a standard group (add an extra healer)- you just want a warrior to tank the named.  For Tipt and Vxed trials, you want a chanter- the warrior in the group is useless until you need him to tank a named.   Armor from these trials is Time or close in quality, and for much less time than the Timed/EP'ed uber raider spent to get his loot.  If you choose not to go there- that is your choice.  Do you provide a legitimate contribution to the group, well it kind of depends.  GoD is humbling at best to many classes, the enchanter is doing most of the work with the pet, the puller is pulling the other bit of work in the group.  You will be standing by along with whoever else watching the cleric cheal the pet and waiting for it to break.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with you that they already knew about the One Voice thread, which they chose not to respond to since they felt it was mere whining. Their lack of response or response that they had given a significant upgrade to healing resulted in a great deal of anger, frustration, and eventually a lot of clicks on end billing (including mine). The only thing that got their attention was the end billing numbers for shaman mains, in my opinion. <br />
<br />
I posted my thread because it had become clear to me they were too thin skinned to reply to justifiably angry posts.  I quoted a statement which demonstrated their thin skin, and proceeded to post what I felt was a brief &quot;executive summary&quot; of what I felt was critical in the excellent One Voice post. While you may see it as an appeasement post, it got what I thought we wanted--a response. I think getting a response is valuable. <br />
<br />
As a 65/37 shaman still working on the HoH part of my elemental flagging and my Vex Thall key, you may feel I have no &quot;maturity&quot; or right  to post on end game issues. However, the future of our class in the new fast fight design of EQ affects all shaman from about level 20 on through the end game. I agree that the One Voice thread deserved a response. I posted my agreement with that thread. I posted several times asking that other mature thoughtful threads from more advanced shaman receive a reply. Eventually I decided diplomacy was in order, honey rather than vinegar, talking calmly rather than shooting Rocket Propelled Grenades. My &quot;appeasement&quot; was in the interest of getting a response, and it worked. I hope that is appreciated. <br />
<br />
While some may feel that getting Brenlo, Rytan and other developers really angry will show that they can power-own the developers, there is another humorous thread about a guild applicant who thought that way on Firiona Vie. I think it has the 8th page in the title. Samanna has a great link to the counter-flame with photos thread page. Frankly, we are in a co-operative venture with the developers to make sure we enjoy the game enough to be willing to not hit end billing. It is not a war, and the phrase &quot;appeasement&quot; simply does not apply.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">AND THE WHEEL OF TIME TURNS....<br />
<br />
This same thread has happened on every single, EVERY single expansion they have ever put out. Perhaps it is not the developers.... perhaps it is that we are impatient. <br />
<br />
While I will agree that this is true to an extent, the last 2 expansions (Gates and LDoN-Hards) have basically made our debuffs more and more obsolete, while the EXTREME level of gear Mudflation has made our other primary ability, buffing, nearly worthless. The first 6-8 months of POP didn't do this. Luclin didnt do this (even as people started stacking up on VT gear, that was the &quot;elite few&quot; not the general masses). Velious and Kunark CERTAINLY did not do this. As it stands, any bazaar level character can practically max all his important stats, and knows that LDoN is about speed, not DOTs and a late slow. <br />
<br />
The bottom line is every expansion changes the game is sublte ways, but this time the changes are HUGE and they DIRECTLY affect our primary strengths. Sure, we are almost adequate back-up healers. Sure, we are very powerful in old (ie Trivial) content. But the current style of the game, and the obvious direction the game is headed, have hurt us more than any other class.</div></div><hr />

Showing as usual their complete lack of understanding of their playerbase.  Or maybe just their contempt, you decide.<br />
<br />
<br />
all tier 1 PoP zones (46+)<br />
Plane of Valor/Plane of Storms/Crypt of Decay (55+)<br />
Bastion of Thunder/Halls of Honor  (62+)<br />
Plane of Tactics (quest key)<br />
LDoN<br />
<br />
When you put it like this, maybe they're right.  And I'd even remove tier 1 and PoS/CoD for the L60+ crowd as they are wastelands on my server behind only PoTorment.  That's not much content.<br />
<br />
If SOE only had to worry about the uber raiders or the casuals then it would be easier to create content because they could then tailor the content to their respective speed.<br />
Or here's a crazy thought- do not design content requiring raid gear and do not cause an artificial separation of the playerbase through flagging and absurd differences in gear between the bazaar and raiding.  Then you could do &quot;one size fits all&quot; content and not have to seesaw your expansions between the two crowds.  I know, I know, that is insanity!  Who wants to go after the mass market?  There's no money to be made there!<br />
<br />
<br />
I know you may have issues with the holy trinity, but to be honest, the sewers still function like a standard group (add an extra healer)- you just want a warrior to tank the named.  For Tipt and Vxed trials, you want a chanter- the warrior in the group is useless until you need him to tank a named.<br />
As if it's not bad enough that Gates is more flawed, flagged content (8/16 zones right?), they nearly hardcode the required classes for a single group of six to include a warrior, cleric and enchanter, leaving 3 spots for the other dozen+ classes in the game.  Outstanding design yet again.<br />
<br />
<br />
You will be standing by along with whoever else watching the cleric cheal the pet and waiting for it to break.<br />
In other words how it is in Tactics now.  I honestly do not know by what bizarre reasoning SOE makes their game design decisions.  It never ceases to amaze and confound me.</div></div><hr />

Wow, you really have it all figured out.  The solution to all our problems in GoD is to bring more than 6 people into a trial that only allows you to bring 6 people!

If at some point that is no longer the case, there is a problem.  The information I see here says that this will in fact become the case.<br />

Hey there,<br />
Well, I guess my whole point was - there is nothing to be worried about with trivialized content in the old world zones.  Even if you could tear through the content, like BoT or something, what do you get out of it?  A full set of ornate?  A Cap of the Drowned Souls?  Decent stuff to be sure, but it's not even CLOSE to the gear of people raiding the aforementioned zones.  So why would SOE worry if suddenly more people could get this type of stuff?<br />
<br />
Anyway, I don't even have Gates... I chose not to even purchase it.  But based on what I've read from people who know about it, it seems like there are some nice changes that could be made to make them more useful.  I just don't see how improving spells for the Gates crowd would unbalance any old world content, and I hope that this is truly not SOE's logic, for I feel that it is flawed.<br />
<br />

Of course one of our magicians can easily tank in BoT. I myself can tank in earth just fine. A group of time geared melees can rip LDoN normals apart without any healing at all, 10 at a time of need be.<br />
I do not see why we should be worried about people who are two expansions further going back and trivializing content. Noone complains about 65 clerics being overpowered in Velious or Luclin.<br />
<br />
And even if that was a valid concern - add a vendor with the new spells in Kod Taz or maybe even a ways into Yxatta. If you can reach that vendor you need the spells. If you can get the flags, reach the vendor and then feel the desire to go back and play in PoStorms or LDoN normals so be it.<br />

Honestly Iz, how exactly do they do this? Wait, I know, eliminate raids !!<br />
<br />
I dont understand your reasoning sometimes. There SHOULD be a natural gear progression. There SHOULD be raid level gear for people who raid. I agree the gap is TOO big right now, but I think it will start to close up as people realize that Gates has trash mobs dropping 80+ hp items. Of course, by then, the &quot;Super Ubers&quot; will all have 220+in every slot, + a 50 hp aug or a 30/30 or something. <br />

<br />
you will find a ton of gear below 20 and a few pieces above 60.<br />
<br />
as they are moving more towards lvl limit gear, hopefully they will move away from no drop gear.<br />
<br />
but they won't.<br />
<br />
many many people have banked or destroyed better gear than a &quot;bazaar&quot; shaman has.  and will ever have.<br />
<br />
the major problem between the haves and haves nots, is still the differences between a player that can play 2 stretchs a week at 9 hours or the guy that can play 7 days a week for 3 hrs a night.    the 9hr man can out gear the LDoN player by a ton.<br />
<br />
bazaar prices are insane.  and Sony will not ever fix it.  they set the minimum price, by what vendors pay for items.  but they do not consider a maximum price, by putting anything on vendors for any price.<br />
<br />
Q for 99K?  you think Sony thought that?  the price of lvl 60 spells?  <br />

And they shouldnt, IMHO. Nothing makes me sicker to my stomach than seeing BoC and other AoW loot for sale. I think its pathetic. I think almost EVERY SINGLE piece of gear should be NO-DROP and harshly level limited. <br />

I really dont wish to argue about it here, this is not the proper thread, and even if it was, my head already hurts from multiple bangs against the &quot;Casual Brick Wall Vision&quot; problem some people seem to have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u80"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p80">the major problem between the haves and haves nots, is still the differences between a player that can play 2 stretchs a week at 9 hours or the guy that can play 7 days a week for 3 hrs a night.    the 9hr man can out gear the LDoN player by a ton.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's interesting Bonestomper. I would assume that the player on twice a week with a 9 hour duration would have the poorest gear to be honest.<br />
<br />
Raid guilds need active and regular attendees. I can't think of an encounter outside Fennin, spawning the earth arbitor, or the Xegony death run/summon that take more than about an hour. Even for spawning the arbitor you are talking several ring events.<br />
<br />
It is possible to raid only a few hours a day, a few days a week and gain elemental access, and good equipment.<br />
<br />
9 hours of raiding in one stretch is tough. VT clears are the only thing I can think of that require that kind of participation. Clearly a raid can last several hours but that is the overall event made up of several targets.</div></div><hr />

Heh, so Yantis gets more business selling chars?  Great idea.<br />
<br />
Blazz, I thought of you immediately the other day when yet another of my elemental friends retired.  He just dropped a L65 VT/Ssra sk into my lap w/ a Goldenrod and bunch of other nice gear I could never, ever get no matter how many lame LDoNs I did.  Needless to say the sk in my sig is retired and cancelled and I'm having a blast.  This isn't even an elemental sk (only a few Ssra/VT slots, mostly higher end velious) but the gear is so far beyond what anyone in my guild has it's not even funny.  I'm tanking in tier 2 w/o slow and having a riot doing it- I feel like a twink ripping through PC. This has given the game new life and given my friends and I a chance to do hard LDoNs w/ a much better chance at survival w/ a real tank.<br />
<br />
How dare anyone not in a raid guild be given this opportunity! The horror! Only ONE playstyle must be rewarded! One and one alone! You will play as we say and no other!<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Yantis continues to rake in the cash selling gear and chars due to SOE's stupidity in separating the playerbase.  A casual guildie friend of mine also just quit and sold his plat for $500 USD.  He had no other way to advance, so he took the money and ran.<br />
<br />
Winner: Yantis.</div></div><hr />

Buy Gates yet Iz? No? Gee, friend of mine in a COMPLETELY non-EP non-VT guild got a 100 hp BP the other day. Off trash. His group had people not even level 65 in it. He doesnt even have all his spells. You need to stop whining about the disparity when you refuse to even go places where the ITEMS YOU ASKED FOR are dropping. <br />
<br />
There are rewards for raiding. Period. Get used to it, dude, because I HIGHLY doubt you will EVER find a MMORPG that allows you to get the BEST of the BEST gear without SOME form of MASSIVE effort. You think WoW is your answer, but I seriously doubt it. Every single game WILL have content for &quot;Large Groups&quot; and I am willing to bet every game will have larger rewards for those encounters. <br />
<br />
Sorry your chosen way to play the game cannot net you the level of gear you want. I just cant seem to break 100 bowling throwing the ball between my legs. Dunno why, its a ball, its a lane, its pins, I should be able to throw it MY way and still score big right? Heck, I should be able to roll a 300. But alas, the through-the-legs thing isnt working. I think I will call up the Bowling Association and ask them to move the pins closer, so I have a better chance with MY STYLE to score big.</div></div><hr />

Bring real world analogies into this and you will lose every time.  Does bowling require 72 people at a time?  Do you need to be flagged to attend a bowling alley?  Are you required to bowl 5 nights a week for 4+ hours at a time in a group to improve your game?  If you bowl a 175 do you suddenly get equipped with a bowling ball that lets you bowl 175 even easier the next time?  Do you have access to bowling balls that are 2-3x as effective as those available to the public?  When you go to the bowling alley are you ushered into a special section just for you and your group of fellow players?<br />
<br />
Seriously, keep the real world analogies coming, they're fun to poke holes in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">Sorry Iz, I just dont see your point. If I want to &quot;score better&quot; in bowling,there are things I must do.

<br />
You want a better &quot;score&quot; in EQ (gear, I guess, if thats how we are keeping score, shrug) yet you refuse to take the steps the GAME DICTATES to achieve this score. You continue to play your own way, and complain that your &quot;score&quot; isnt going up.

I have agreed that the EPs should be opened up so casual players have access to better gear and faster AAs. <br />

<br />
Think I am feeling the same way on this.  The natural progression to get the best items in game has been to eventually raid.  It's nothing new, its not like SOE changed their mind last week and implemented it.  SOE also isn't stopping you from just grouping or soloing though.  You just will not get the best gear.  If you are not raiding do you need Time gear for LDoN hard? no.  Do you need Time gear for BoT/Sol Ro/Elem? no.  Do you need Time gear for Sewers/Tipt/Vxed? no.<br />
<br />
For the casual/non-raiding player you have a few options:<br />
<br />
LDoN Hards:<br />
<br />
1. Get your gear/defensive aa's to the point that you feel comfortable in LDoN hards.  <br />
<br />
2. MAKE THE GROUP.  I put this in caps because it works- people, in general, hate making groups.  Check the lfg window at night- there are enough on there to make 4-5 groups, but no one wants to &quot;make a group&quot;.  <br />
<br />
3. Know your player base. It should be too difficult to figure out which guilds are in what content.  Pick a tank accordingly.  Get a decent cleric.<br />
<br />
4. Add cc/dps.  Chanter or bard can provide your cc.  Monks should be able to single pull.  In Ruj, you really don't even need cc.  <br />
<br />
5. Accept the possibility that you are going to make mistakes.  Sometimes you will goof and get a 6k tank or a 65 baron cleric with acrylia studded armor- it happens.<br />
<br />
6. Farm away.  No-drop loot is going to be better than most of your LDoN bought gear, and for much less time/trouble.  After about a dozen addys you should have a decent /friend list to choose from, and it will be easy to put a group together.<br />
<br />
GoD:  Time and Elemental quality loot drops here in single group encounters.  Your casual shaman can be sitting at 4.5k unbuffed, so honestly I don't know why people are screaming about raid lewt.  Single group loot that comes to mind.<br />
<br />
    Natimbi: FT1 necklace- rare<br />
    Qinimbi: FT1 earring? think it drops here- upgrade for Solstice.<br />
    Riwwi: near LDoN hard quality &quot;droppable&quot; loot is here- mobs hit for<br />
             300-600 and I didn't see anything that summoned.<br />
    Barindu: FT2 100hp/100mana ring- rare of yard trash<br />
    Ferubi: hp/mana augs of trash, MP4 100hp rage item- rare<br />
    Sewers: spells, 80hp/100mana Druzzil's Distance cloak,   <br />
                100hp/100mana earring<br />
    Tipt: lore ANY SLOT hp augs (Specter BP can be aug'ed up to 170hps<br />
           now), 130hp Fury of E'ci chain bracer<br />
    Vxed: 100hp chain legs, 90hp/110mana ring, 100hp belt, other drops.<br />
<br />
My only complaint with GoD is that all the named near the zonelines seem to have the Hybrid loot tables while all of our drops are in the back of the zone.<br />
<br />
Need Plat?  Farm at these locations:<br />
<br />
Droga: low-high risk 100pp-50k an hour<br />
Nurga: low 100pp-10k an hour<br />
Acrylia Caverns: mid-high risk 500pp-40k an hour<br />
Cobalt Scar (othmir): low risk 500pp-3k an hour<br />
Dawnshroud (rockhoppers): low risk 500pp-6k an hour<br />
The Grey(outside SSra): low-mid risk 300pp-15k an hour<br />
Velketor's Lab(Upper Dogs): mid risk 500pp-3k an hour<br />
City of Mist: low-mid 500pp-15k an hour<br />
Plane of Hate: mid-high risk 300pp-15k an hour<br />
PoJ(Mauv's Hall Mobs): low-mid risk 1k-3k an hour<br />
Sebilis (kill anything): mid-high risk 300pp-100k an hour (depending on<br />
          camp)<br />
Natimbi (tailoring words drop like candy): mid-high risk 300pp-75k an hour<br />
<br />
Even if you have a 20 shaman with his newbie weapon and cloth armor there is:<br />
<br />
Shar Vahl Newbie zone: (skellies)- swirling shadows are needed in bulk for tradeskills- avg price is 1k per stack.<br />
<br />
Those high-end peeps that have all that plat that you are complaining about usually buy one of three things: twink gear/tradeskill components/toys.  Farm them and their plat will be yours.  Gear yourself up and start grinding through LDoN hards.  AA abilities LR5 and ID5 make life a lot easier.  Also, it looks like there was a stealth nerf to LDoN hard difficulty (i.e. mob's resist rate).  I had very few resists when slowing incoming mobs WITHOUT malos.  That should cut your mana cost and slow casting time by about half.<br />
<br />
Edit: fun with grammar</div></div><hr />

<br />
You really want to continue the logical beating by using poor real world analogies?  The steps necessary to become good at bowling can be done by a single person.  You can achieve complete mastery (300's every time) w/o joining a league.  No bowling alley that I'm aware of requires winning in other bowling alleys to gain access.  It's not like casuals in EQ are attacking targets wielding steins (i.e. throwing ball between the legs in your example)- they're doing exactly what raiders do but on a smaller scale.  They spend the same amount of time and money, for rewards a fraction of what the raider is awarded.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have stated that I feel the gap is too big. <br />
I have agreed that the EPs should be opened up so casual players have access to better gear and faster AAs. <br />
<br />
You say that then you say I should be happy w/ a 100hp bp from Gates? You realize you can get that in LDoN already while the best gear is, what, 225 hp?  The gear on my new sk (2-3 years old) is 125 hp already, I'm going to downgrade to 100 hp?  <br />
<br />
The only lesson I can see out of this is to do due diligence before starting a new MMORPG (e.g. WoW) and see if their highend game mimics EQ's (raid or quit).  You then have 3 choices depending on what you want:<br />
1) avoid it like the plague<br />
2) play and be prepared to be a second class citizen<br />
3) ebay<br />
<br />
The disparity in EQ wasn't always this bad- I grouped w/ raiders regularly prior to PoP.  Now it's impossible unless they want to slum w/ us peasants in an open zone.<br />

<br />
You grouped with the cream of the crop, the full VT guys, right after PoP came out? Cause that is what you are comparing your current gear too, the BEST, not just the average raider. Heck I am an average raider, as I have explained. My guild didnt win any races to the EPs. We still are 2 gods from Time. We have taken it slow, and steady, with no one being removed for not raiding unless you do not log in for 90 days in a row. You saying I am too uber for you to group with? <br />
<br />
See you want to get gear that only the top 5% of the server is getting. Why werent you crying about his in Luclin, when there wasnt even anything CLOSE to VT and Ssra stuff. Percentage wise, I think the &quot;casual&quot; gear vs the &quot;uber&quot; gear had a bigger gap then. No 40 hp augs, no LDoN, no ornate with focus, no tribute, no leadership points. <br />
<br />
Stop asking for the world in one fell swoop Iz. Theres a gap, its too big, but its not THAT big a concern, is it? What difference does it make what they are wearing in Uqua when you are in LDoN hard.</div></div><hr />

Yes, that's why in my limited experience, people rarely do anything but the front mobs.  Once they kill the front nameds, they start over and farm more front nameds.  So while the possibility of getting the loots at the back of the zone exists, it is functionally irrelevant, because the practical likelihood of getting the back mobs with any group but one that is die-hard committed to spending time doing just that very thing is actually very low.</div></div><hr />

Sure you're going to really have to stack the group makeup and be on yer toes to win.  But win you can.  For the non-uber, just use 2 clerics and a druid for pharming the named, and have other people outside waiting to come in and loot.  Umbiki for instance, pops every 25 minutes once you get an expedition with him up in it.  <br />

<br />
True, but is that really where the high end guilds are going to spend their time?  I'd be curious to see how the economy works on FV (if I understand the rules on that server correctly, most everything is droppable.)<br />
<br />
I do know that the disparity between casual and uber appears to be larger now than it was when I rejoined the game 2 years ago.  Does this bother me...not really right now, although I do wonder if it means future expansions will have less and less content available to me.  <br />
<br />
To be fair, I play the game to have fun and I'm more concerned with finding challenging encounters that me and my friends can handle - which often means helping someone level as opposed to camping specific mobs for specific drops.  For example, until recently, we normally didn't have a cleric in the group - so GoD was definitely out.  So, the fact that my gear hasn't progressed significantly in the last year is at least partially my own fault.<br />
<br />
In defense of no-drop loot, it does strongly encourage people to form a community in the game in the form of guilds - which I think is a very good thing for the game.</div></div><hr />

But then I could at least buy it from the bazaar, right? Ie, if I'm not allowed to earn the gear myself by killing the mob that drops it, at least I could play E*verTrade and upgrade my toons that way.  It's still broken design, but at least it provides a path to upgrading w/o raiding.  I'd transfer to FV in a heartbeat if you could do so w/ gear.<br />
<br />
For the non-uber, just use 2 clerics and a druid for pharming the named...<br />
Er, uh, who's doing the damage in that group?  2 enchanters and a tank?  Then the rest of us bazaar clowns that aren't snarers or members of the Unholy Trinity just wait around for them to finish and let us into their instance?  You realize we're still struggling to beat LDoN hards, right?  Aren't these supposed to be even harder? This is fun how?<br />

Gates could offer 300 hp items off vendors in the first zone and I'm still not going to buy an expansion as flawed as this and reward SOE for their contempt for their playerbase.

Dude I understand your bitterness about this whole flag-raid-gear thing, but honestly, is buying Gates rewarding SOE more than the 13 bucks you pay every month? You have already paid them more than Gates costs in monthly fees since its release (2 months, 26 bucks, think I paid 24 for my Gates?) <br />
<br />
Its back to the whole nose-face-spite thing Iz, it really is. Gates is right up your alley. Challanging content with decent rewards. That 25 bucks your &quot;holding back in protest&quot; doesnt mean squat to SOE as long as you keep those accounts rolling.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, but I'm still enjoying what little content is left to me in EQ that we haven't beaten and I'm still willing to pay for access to that content.  When that content is exhausted (or WoW is released, whichever comes first), I refuse to pay for additional content that I will never see.  Once again, Gates isn't a 1 or 2 flagged/keyed zones deal like everything up through Luclin, it's over half the expansion flagged again.  <br />
<br />
And like I've said, they've aded insult to injury by making my two favorite classes (sk/shaman) mostly useless.  I can't subsidize this and look myself in the mirror- I feel like too much of a whore already paying SOE, a company I despise.  Damn addiction!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u98"><b>Predicus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p98">To answer some questions about the FV economy, let me say it sucks, and here's why.  Most of the items in game are droppable except for epics and some epic components.  The stickler in all of this is that you can only have one character on the FV server per account.  From what I have seen from other servers, new droppable items follow a pretty distinct pattern when hitting the populous.  At the beginning they are at their highest until people figure out where they drop and how to farm them.  The item's value slowly drops as the populous upgrades to it or better, but eventually it plateaus.  The reason for this is due to a &quot;still exisiting&quot; demand of player's mains, but also as a possible &quot;twink&quot; item.  On FV, you don't see this happening- there is no plateau.  An item's value plummets about about eight times the speed of a normal server (8 characters per normal server account.)  While it may sound good for those who hate paying high prices for upgrades, it is actually bad because farming old gear doesn't generate any buying power.  If you are high up on the power curve, then it will not effect you because the gear you farm is still valuable.  For the &quot;casual&quot; player, its pretty killer.  More and more players turn to pure platinum camps to offset the problem, but if you have noticed with farming a pure-platinum camp- its pretty slow.  I finally left the server after I realized that I was buying new gear at almost a premium (10k for example), and when it came time to sell it I could barely get 1k.</div></div><hr />

I'm rather shocked that more small guilds are not pharming the hell out of Umbiki, sludge fly, and Tipt. 160hp shield with FT5, 160hp earring with 5 regen, FT2/regen2 aug from first boss in Tipt (check my profile for that one, it's on the cloak), and many many other nice things come from the &quot;easiest&quot; trials.  <br />

        They don't drop from smith rondo ? i doubt small guild can kill hi m(but honestly i never try him). But if they don't farm umbiki it's because he drop crap . But right if small guild want good loot ,they have better to single group in god them kill first god in pop.....</div></div><hr />

There problem solved. And it solves beastlord's as they now corrently inherit abilities from a parent class.<br />
<br />
PS: I am not serious about this, but it is an idea :)</div></div><hr />
