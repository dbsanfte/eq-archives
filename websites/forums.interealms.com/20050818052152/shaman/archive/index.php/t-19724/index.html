<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bullwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Imagine my surprise today when lazy old me clicked my Wolf Caller's boots (yes i still wear them) and instead of receiving the ultravision buff that was expected (was too lazy to cast Acumen) my blind self received the old 55 agility buff &quot;Deliriously Nimble&quot; instead..<br />
<br />
Thinking i had possibly gone insane, or someone had crossed up the spell data I checked my boots and found out the clicky effect was changed to Deliriously Nimble... Hmm that wasn't in the patch message.<br />
<br />
Yes I know it's close to worthless still, but its a little better than having another item that clicked ultravision, just like the Wolf Caller's Bracer did.<br />
<br />
What do I know anyways, I thought Alchemy was an actual tradeskill.<br />

Atleast it's something different I complained and posted about this when I first noticed the change http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=18562 I'm glad to see they atleast changed it though I wish it was something more useful<br />
