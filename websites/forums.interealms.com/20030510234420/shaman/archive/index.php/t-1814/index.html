I'm currently a 43 barb shaman. I have nothing special and my wis is 178. I was wondering were I could solo at this lvl and what to do until 50. I also need to know how much a JBB costs usually. Would u also give me a guide on how to solo your suggestion. Thanks</div></div><hr />

Lv. 44-46 I spent soloing spiders in Nurga (see other thread on this topic).<br />
<br />
Lv. 47-49, soloing Spirocs in Tim. Deep.<br />
<br />
Lv. 49-50, soloing/grouping on Seafuries in OOT.<br />
<br />
The Seafuries drop some nice gems (fairly rare drop) that sell for nice pp.  Otherwise, these camps better for exp. than cash.<br />
<br />
But the exp. is very nice.  I just dinged 50 with about 23 days played.<br />

There are two solo and the rest are in pairs.  The pair down by the 'future' entrance of veksar spawns the bloodgill marauder.  He will aggro when pulling those two.  He only spawns once every 4-6 hours tho so once he's dead and out of the way its no sweat.  If you and a monk partner have a fishbone earring (or other waterbreathing item) its even better.</div></div><hr />

Pull to a zonewall or the katta zone area.   At 43 keep to a diet of bats and start taking on sonic wolves and such as you get more towards the upper 40's and 50.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Can the Spirocs be soloed before 47? Or would I need to bring a friend or two? I'm only 44 atm, trying to get up to lvl 50 ish so I can try getting a raid together to try for a jb bracer, since I will never in my life have enough to buy one :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>galendar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I would go to the tenebrous mountain by the grimling forest zone line.  I was there yesterday for the first time and got over 2 yellow in 4-5 hours. And you can even take the named.  <br />
FYI: I also have no JBB and am 45th so it should<br />
be the same for you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Just solo killed some spirocs at level 45. No JBB, no fungi, only 190ish wis 730ish ac 1300ish hp :D<br />
<br />
They were pretty easy like those dire sonic wolves in tenebrous. But for some reason I didn't get much exp from the kills =(<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT : OOOOPS. hehe I meant to type &quot;I didn't get much exp from the kills&quot; but I accedently said &quot;I didn't get my exp from the kills&quot;. Just fixed it ;)</div></div><hr />
