<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Koyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings!<br />
<br />
Well after a week or so of selling off all the stuff I had hoarded, keeping a vendor in the Bazaar for 24/7 and begging pp off of my wife I think I've done pretty good. I took much of the advice shared with me here and applied it to my purchases.<br />
<br />
Anyone willing to look over my magelo and telling me what I might look for next? It'll be a while before I do upgrade (that horse set me back with the better half for sure! heh), but what should I look for next?<br />
<br />
Chitinous might be nice for waist?<br />
Elder Wolf Hide for shoulders?<br />
Earring of Solstice would be nice, but beyond my means to quest for at the moment.<br />
Is the Dark Ember looking good for 1hb? Or replace?<br />
My 2HB skill is at 7, some say 2HB is nice, should I go Elder Spiritists?<br />
<br />
Thanks, as always, in advance!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Talamorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well to be honest at level 37 i wish i would have been so nicely equipped :) Looks good. I think for your head you can get a<br />
<br />
Metal Linked Crown<br />
<br />
But over all nice set. Now get on that Medding Machine ( horse ) and level heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">...for your level, your gear is really very very good.<br />
<br />
Regarding 2hb, I would say yes, get a good 2hb weapon and get your skill up. In my opinion, 2hb is more important than 1hb, and it is certainly a hell of a lot more fun! A very good 2hb weapon that is very very cheap is a &quot;tarnished driveshaft&quot; From memory it is 23/29 or something like that, but it also has 8AC and varios stats, hps etc - best of all, they cost 800 - 100plat from Bazaar.<br />
<br />
Just a few gear suggestions for your consideration<br />
Relace:<br />
Sapphire earring with earring of cleansing / purity / twisted leaves. <br />
Tattered Mantle with Elder Wolf Hide<br />
Sentry bracer with Coldain Military bracer<br />
Spider fur belt with Chitinous belt<br />
Spider eyes with Death mask of the Elysians<br />
Replace Velium fire rings with a Shadel Bandit ring and Circled Toe bones</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Never heard of circled toe bones before, where they from?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Um... go level to about 50 on that gear. Mindlessly. Then revisit =)</div></div><hr />
