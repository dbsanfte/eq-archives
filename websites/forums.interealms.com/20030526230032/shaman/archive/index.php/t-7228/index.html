<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've done two fay raids. Both times, Fay died. :)<br />
<br />
Unforunately, I have yet to get my slow to land. It's beginning to irk me. The first time, I was 60, Fay was Mala'd (I lack Malo), malaised, and I was so close, I could taste her breath. 8 casts of Turgur's. Eight resists.<br />
<br />
The second time, for which I was 61, we lacked a mage. So she got malaised, and this time I tried insidious decay. 4 casts of Turgur's. Four resists. Four casts of plague of insects. Four resists. Again, so close my body was going into hers.<br />
<br />
So is it possible to slow this beast? Or is it just really rare and requires both mala and malo and malaisement?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hyacinth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Insidious Decay is a disease debuffer &amp; Turgur's is checked against MR, correct? Or am I thinking of another slow?<br />
<br />
I've never Slowed Fay either. Don't know the secret.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Harv used Insideous Decay for Plague of Insects and Malosini for Turgurs i believe.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yep, the fish for the druid epic. Or the chinese style dragon if you prefer to look at her that way. :)<br />
<br />
And yes, I used Insidious decay to help Plague of Insects, and malosini for Tugur's. (Actually Malosini was cast by another).<br />
<br />
I've heard that she is slowable, I've just never seen it done nor been able to do it myself. Which is kind of irritating:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If malosini is actually landing, turgur's should too, I'd think, unless it says she's immune.  They both have very similar magic resist checks.  Seems like for most mobs, malosini is pointless after malo/mala, 'cause if it would land, slow would land too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">mala and malo don't stack.<br />
<br />
Try Malo + Tash and see if that'll do anything or malosini + tash preferably.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">8 Feydedars now, 4 slowed with Turg after Malosini, 1 with Plague of Insects after Insidious.<br />
<br />
I alternate Malosini and Slow until one sticks, then I concentrate on the other, possibly trying a cripple, too.  5 malosini'd, 6 crippled, but only 4 slowed with Turg.<br />
<br />
No clue about which brain buffs were still active when Fey finally finally gave in to my efforts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Didn't say malo/mala stacked - just said that after one of them is on a mob (ideally with tash and oos too), in my experience you might as well go for slow, since if malosini lands, slow would land too.</div></div><hr />
