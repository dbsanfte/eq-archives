<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>eq_newb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I recently moved on to soloing the hg's in rathe, but even with kei, they can be pretty tough. nice cha ching when you loot one for 40 plat or so, but downtime medding, and getting a new pet just about every kill, make it kinda boring (don't get me wrong, exciting in the sense ive had some close calls that had me debating on whether to zone, doing quick math on the most mana efficient spell to cast cause i got almost none left, and praying my health dont go too low for low hp aggro lol - but then i sit for like 10 minutes with my thumb up me arse religiously watching bars). I am looking for xp and loot (recently was &quot;lent&quot; a bridle and decided i MUST have a horse-before you ask im on FV so bridles are tradeable). I've searched this board, but i'd like some opinions on the best place for me. I like to come on really late, so my guess is most popular farm spots are not camped as much (like 1-2 am), i like to solo, and almost always buffed with kei, sometimes temperance and other buffs. with that in mind, which of the places suggested would be the best for loot and xp? i just came from everfrost, which i almost always have to myself at that time and can make about 2-300pp an hour in tusks, but no xp, so now im looking for both. i guess what i want to know is, what is the best place, a lot of people say such and such is awesome, but overcrowded, so go here instead. thank you anyone for your help.</div></div><hr />
