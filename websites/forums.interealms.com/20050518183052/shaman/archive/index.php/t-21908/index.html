<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Assuming Sony balances shamans, and shaman is a playable and competitive class in OoW, has anyone though of what will happen to all those slaved-after focus effects our gear now contains?  Will any focus effects be upgraded?  Or will we be required to find all new items with all new FocusV effects?  I know this was brought up when lvl 65 was introduced, and the solution then was to make the focus effects in the highest tier of the game at that time (Vex Thall) reach to lvl 65.  <br />
So what can we expect?  Will PoTime loot focuses be upgraded to affect up to lvl 70 spells?  Will only GoD loot be upgraded?  Will only GoD loot from the highest tier of that expansion be upgraded?  Wow that would sure be masochistic.  Any way you look at it, things are gonna happen and people will be upset that the focus effects they slaved over are now worthless (cause once lvl 70 goes live, you will need to be lvl 70 to raid or find top groups).  And that's assuming you'll have your 66+ spells.  How hard will those be to obtain?  Will Sony follow its awful trend and make them as hard or more hard than GoD spells to get?  GoD spells have been beyond crazy hard to get btw, especially for classes that aren't wanted for groups in that expansion. <br />
<br />
Anyway, thoughts?  Opinions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hey Lan, I asked about this at the summit. They are considering having the focus effects &quot;scale&quot;. If the focus was worth 30% mana savings for level 65 spells (for example) the focus item would save 20% on level 70 spells.<br />
<br />
Personally, I would prefer level 4 focus items to scale to 70, but that sounds like a decent compromise. At least the focus items would still have some utility instead of being completely worthless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">While they're at it, make them scale lower level spells upwards. Discordant Fire should make burst of Flame do 50 damage!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The best solution would to just have IV effect up to LVL 70 spells.  I don't know why they would gimp it down 10%, because that would justify Foci V items in the future which would be a severe pain in the arse.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>gummox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Focus I = 20 levels<br />
Focus II = 24 levels<br />
Focus III = 16 levels<br />
Anything less than Focus IV = 10 levels isn't &quot;a compromise&quot;, it's &quot;a shaft&quot;.<br />
<br />
For it to be a compromise, they would have to add something along the lines of what Grizlor posted, otherwise they're doing nothing but taking away and not giving anything back.<br />
<br />
What Gloriana describes sounds more along the lines of &quot;half a shaft&quot; which a lot of people lately are taking gladly lately for some reason.<br />
<br />
Edit: fixed some extremely simple math errors. /blush</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Glori, were they thinking of lumping &quot;named&quot; foci into the same lame-ass situation as the IV foci?<br />
<br />
Level IV foci can be made by players after all and it just seems goofy to apply the same rules to dropped focus items.  Precedent set by VT &quot;named&quot; foci during the PoP level hike should logically hold true for PoP foci going into a new expansion with another level increase.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">For my own personal satisfaction I would love it if they made existing focus effects work to level 70, but there really is no reason to do that.  The old &quot;focus 4 was only good for 5 levels&quot; argument is a bit lame.  Tons of people spent more time in those 5 levels than all other levels combined.  Unless you are just now turning level 65, you have have been getting benifits from focus 4 items for plenty of time, they have served their purpose.<br />
<br />
If they were to emulate what they did with VT, then I doubt that they would consider GoD the highest tier of the old effects.  GoD is more like plane of sky, in the sense that even though its technically an old world zone, it was designed with Kunark gear/levels in mind.  So i would assume they would consider poTime the end of the old.<br />
<br />
The problem is there is no clear line between poTime focus and pre time focus.  With the focus 3 situation, there was a near perfect line you could draw between VT focus effects and non VT focus effects.  In PoP its harder to draw that line as several effects overlap between multiple tiers of progression.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>gummox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">How many people complain regularly about the power gap between casual players and hardcore raiders?<br />
<br />
These &quot;casual&quot; players, especially the ones that are complaining about this power gap, will be level 70 quickly.  I guarantee it.  It's one of the major selling points of OoW.<br />
<br />
One of the features of the next patch is the addition of a quest for some (my best guess is the two that can drop pre Kod Taz) GoD spells.  This change implies to me that some (and hopefully all) of the level 65-70 spells will be attainable by the &quot;casual&quot; level 70 player that's willing to put forth enough effort.<br />
<br />
Here's something that I'm sure some people still haven't realized yet:  Spells are designed and balanced with the focus effects factored in.  Do you think that maybe the focus effect on these arms (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68886) had something to do with shaman only getting a 1550 hp heal instead of what was requested?<br />
<br />
The stats on ornate gear and other Focus IV items are already pitiful compared to the items dropping in higher end PoP, let alone GoD or OoW.  Nobody wears ornate any longer than they absolutely have to, and thanks to LDoN there are actually a few options to replace ornate with.  But not all the focii on ornate armor exist in LDoN, which means that there are people that are stuck wearing ornate armor that has horrible stats because they need the focus effect on it.<br />
<br />
Yes, I said they need the focus effect, just like they need spells, and just like melees need weapons.  They can get by without, but they're being penalized in effectiveness for not having the proper gear to use thier spells in the capacity they were balanced around.<br />
<br />
What's going to happen to the gap between the casual player and the hardcore raider when the named focus effects that raiders have available to them work on the lvl 70 spells but the generic IV level effects don't?<br />
<br />
On a somewhat related subject: I personally think the way focus effects are implemented in EQ is very close to ideal, but far enough away to be frustrating when choosing upgrades.  I would be much happier if focus effects were smaller, say 2-5% per item, but the smaller effects on multiple items stacked.<br />
<br />
You wouldn't be tied to any one item because it's focus was irreplacable, and you wouldn't have any one item that instantly makes a caster 20-45% more effective.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Wow, a +45 % healing mod, thats quite a jump.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I can see some sort of compromise being worked out. Foci 4 will work to 70, but Velious and Luclin will be scaled back, if thats possible to code (I am sure it is just a matter of some if-then code, if &lt;65 then 100%, if &gt;65 then 50%)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ulver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Whats going to happen with focus items and lvl 70 is still actively a debate item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">OMG I want that belt! http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68951</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>mspeedie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Face it, it wont work on level 70 and here is why:<br />
SOE want you to get back in the hamster cage and grind, grind, grind.  They want you to buy the next expansion and go raid till your fingers bleed.  If you existing gear did not get out of date, then you would not be driven to raid.  It would be like expecting gear from Kael to have Focus 4... it would not make sense.<br />
<br />
There is no sense to complaining, suck it up and get what you need for now.  If you focus on what gear is going to drop in the next expansion you will never spend your points as there is always something better in the next release.<br />
<br />
For example folks who got time tier one loot now in high in GoD raid going, man I wasted points on this crap.... It was not crap when you got it, and it help you progress to the next level to get new toys.<br />
<br />
Welcome to the hamster wheel, the pellets are very tasty today</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">level 4 should work all the way to 70. To pay some of the ridiculous prices some of us have paid for focus items and to have them work for 5 levels is a huge slap in the face.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">That's the catch.  While it looks like the focus effects are working for 5 levels, really they are working old 3 expansions.  They are due for an upgrade.  If memory serves me correctly Focus I,II and III lasts what, 1 expansion (came out after SoL, right?).  I don't like it, but if they aren't removed there isn't near as much 'wiggle' room for non uber raid loots in OoW.  If they were to make focus V effects or the equlivent drop in a new BoT type zone with just below GoD stats on it people would be happy, even the raider, I think.  This would be due to having a needed focus effect w decent stats.  <br />
<br />
Yea you would suck to not have any focus effects when you hit 70.  But you have the whole trip to get to level 70 to pick these up.  And remember, you WILL use older spells, how many people still have a level 51 spell memorized all time time?  I know i do.  Also when you hit level 70 you aren't instantly given all your spells, you will need to work to get them.</div></div><hr />
