1) sounds like you are either allways raiding or dont know how good our pet is ... there is no point in taking away our best dot and if you would take the time to solo abit ( while taking the mobs ) you would notice what a big diff it is to have a pet around using 2 weps . hasted and FAed <br />
<br />
2) ... so basicly what you are saying is that shamans should not have any direct heal until around 60+ ... sure great idea ... would really help us in the lower lvls</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Please don't say our pet is the best DoT we have.<br />
<br />
Say it's the most efficient if it lives long enough, please. Efficiency hardly matters, though.</div></div><hr />

Quite the contrary...I raid little, and solo a lot.  I find it more effective to solo in this manner:<br />
<br />
(I have the BA3 bracer and Crit Affliction 1 atm)<br />
Blood of Saryrn - 320/tick (base)<br />
Bane of Nife     - 214/tick (base)<br />
Anathema        - 278/tick (base)<br />
Pox of Bertoxx  - 111/tick (base)<br />
<br />
All this equals to ~154dps....above and beyond the fact that I am a melee shaman.  Never actually parsed my melee dmg, but it's not too shabby...I actually see myself crit occasionally  :p <br />
<br />
Add the epic DoT for...refresh my memory, 1124dmg total, is it?<br />
<br />
And I did not state at what level a shaman should get that 1500 fast heal.  IF what I suggested was actually implemented...it would most likely be reasonable to put it in the Lv.30's range.</div></div><hr />

Elaborate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes...I find this spell pointless as well with its 10sec cast time.<br />
<br />
And just so everyone knows before they get overheated about anything,  this is simply one of those 'if I had it my way posts'. :D<br />
<br />
Also, on my first post...I am simply implying the idea to :<br />
<br />
trade some healing power for an unmitigable slow<br />
and<br />
trade the pet in for increased DoT damage equal to or higher than our pet</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I like healing. I wouldn't want to trade power for an unmitigatable slow, because it would break certain encounters. I'd like to see mitigation lessened in general, but  overall I'm not so doom and gloom about what I contribute anymore. It boils down to the following though: If you don't have yoppa's mending and pained memory, you forfeit the right complain about shaman balance and group contribution. Anyone can get these spells. I traded any minors and lessers I got for 68s and have both, and am currently pleased with what I'm capable of doing.</div></div><hr />

Let's say just for &quot;reasonable&quot; sake, level 39.<br />
<br />
OUCH.<br />
<br />
That screaming you heard is from the Cleric community.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I wanted to add that in that post, I'm not saying we don't have issues. Hell, bards have issues (fizzle rate) and everyone says they're 'overpowered'<br />
<br />
Currently, things that are bugged or flat out broken are as follows:<br />
<br />
1) 67 Pet<br />
2) Pure Spirit is crap<br />
3) Champion and Might aren't cumulative<br />
4) SCS doesn't affect DoTs.<br />
5) Talisman of Alacrity, Still.<br />
6) While Spiritual Channeling is up, you still need the mana to cast the spell, even though it won't use it.<br />
<br />
They fixed Spiritual Serenity on test already or that would be on the list too.<br />
<br />
That's IT. Really, stuff like bigger heals and lowering AA costs on critical affliction are niceities and not flagrantly and flat out not working.</div></div><hr />

There is something to be said about flexibility...this was a &quot;for example&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Rtugok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Most of our new buffs and spells are **** atm because they either dont work right or don't stack with something ignorant. I bet sense doesn't even do anything but waste buff slots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>haruuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">sense works nicely, our new stam (while not huge) is a functional/slight upgrade, etc. our spells aren't really broken atm.<br />
<br />
and i agree with Grizlor entirely on everything he said. thank you very much, Griz.<br />
<br />
Pained Memory owns. Yoppa's owns. our epic and HoTs are awesome. IMO, this last expansion brought us right in line with everyone else.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
as for stackability--i'm in a guild that's through the EP gods and working into Time, GoD, and OoW raids--on a typical raid day, we run with 5-7 of us in the raid at once, and we are all always very busy and contribute heavily. with the new buffs out, and the epic right click effect, we are more stackable and desirable than ever. <br />
<br />
<br />
it's a great time to be a shammy :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The only way to truly balance us is to remove slow from the game entirely.  Give us more of everything else we have.  (Of course, that would require retuning every single mob, and all heal lines, so SOE won't do it.  They'd rather nerf three classes than do that much work).  <br />
<br />
Its precisely because slow couldn't be tuned to work with game mechanics at the higher levels, that they mitigated it to rebalance the game (tank dead unslowed, tank easily kept alive fully slowed).  <br />
<br />
And we have been balanced around our ability to slow.  Adding more slow is exactly the WRONG way to go if you want us balanced.  <br />
<br />
Anyone that doesn't understand that is blind.  Run the numbers at extreme dps:  its easily proven that slow can't be tuned at upper end encounters.  Thats precisely the reason that most boss mobs are immune to it now.  If they wanted the encounter to be challenging after slow, the pre-slow dps would eat any tank instantly before slow.  Can't be tuned.  So, immunity and low enough dps that its challenging, but possible, is SOE's answer.</div></div><hr />
