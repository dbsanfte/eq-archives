<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zazk Buffurbootay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am becoming more and more comfortable with being a healer ( secondary or prim ) Question: does the idol of the underking-- healing focus 3-- work with Kragg's and Chloro ? More importantly, does it work with torpor? The additional 25% would be most excellent.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I believe it would only work with chloro, kraggs shares the same restrictions as CH as far as focus items go and torpor is considered a buff rather than a heal.<br />
<br />
I havent a heal3 item so thats just from my understanding of the mechanics. Its probably cheaper and less frustrating to get healing/extended AAs to improve that side of your character unless you get to loot an idol - they seem to be way overpriced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have a healing IV item and it only affects direct heals such as Tnargs.  It does not affect Kragg's Mending which is flagged (although I think this is idiotic) as a &quot;complete heal&quot; and is under the same restrictions as a cleric's 7500 point heal.   I am happy with my improved healing IV item, tnarg's now heals for over 1400 (sorry, can't remember the exact amount).<br />
<br />
Torpor is considered a buff and is affected by focus items such as spell haste (as well as haste of mithaniel) and mana preservation.  It is also affected by AA skills such as spell casting mastery (10% reduction in mana cost), Quickbuff (up to 3.0 second cast with QB3) and Spell Casting Reinforcement (up to 1800 hitpoints with SCRM).<br />
<br />
For torpor, focus effects can stack with AA skills.  My Quickbuff 1 AA stacks with Spell Haste III for a 4.5 sec cast torpor.  Add in that newfangled cleric spell haste spell and my torpor cast time goes down to 3.9 seconds.</div></div><hr />
