<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know its a dot but thats about it.<br />
<br />
How much damage does it do over what amount of time?<br />
<br />
I really can't find any info on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I believe it's 1260 damage over 14 ticks, splurt-type.<br />
<br />
Here's the damage per tick:<br />
12<br />
24<br />
36<br />
48<br />
60<br />
72<br />
84<br />
96<br />
108<br />
120<br />
132<br />
144<br />
156<br />
170<br />
<br />
As you can see it does about half the damage in the last 4 ticks, so it's most useful if it can run for the entire 14 ticks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">After 7 ticks its done more damage than a JBB click, so I plan to use it on any fights lasting around a minute or more - the low initial aggro means you can cast it before you'd be wanting to use rains or poison DoTs.<br />
<br />
Most useful for boss mobs and solo/duos though, as many xp mobs won't last a minute, let alone the full 14 ticks. Still a sweet weapon though with some pretty decent stats for most of us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Nice for soloing, does about the same damage as Ebolt, it takes about 4 ebolts and a plague to kill a exp giving mob at 54, this is going to save me ALOT of mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It's a good addition in PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">what resist does it go against?  How is the dot removed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">LUCY (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=1932&amp;source=Live) says it's magic based.<br />
<br />
I guess you could remove it with anull magic etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Chikarsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeah, it's magic-based.. and therefore dispellable. Some mobs will take it off with Annull if they can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Yatta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Have a necro and splurt is definitely one of my favorite dots - low low resist, good damage, low mana cost (still use it at 61).<br />
<br />
When I got my epic I already knew I'd love the rightclick, a little less damage but still great. In pop groups I almost always go Malosi (if no chanter), Slow, sic dogdog, cann3 once or twice, and lay down CutS. Rarely lasts full duration when grinding, but it's some nice mana free extra damage on every pull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ridik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I love the clicky, I love All clickys.<br />
<br />
Personally, I slap Epic dot on everymob that looks at me funny, or looks funny, which is pretty much everything one way or another.  In groups its Malo, slow, Epic, Cana back to 98% or so, JBB...<br />
<br />
I really think I'm the unsung damage dealer in alot of my groups.   Between hasted alpha dog, epic, constant JBB, and occasionally Bane when mana permits, I've gotta be cranking out some pretty respectable DPS right?  Anyone have a log or comparison of shaman average or total dps with dots and pets included, or is that kind of parseing even possible?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Aridor1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">hey thats a good idea, i wonder what normal shaman dps is with epic, alpha pet with celerity and constant casting JBB is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well it's easy to work two of those out.<br />
<br />
The epic is 1260 over 94 seconds (including cast time) = 13.5 dps<br />
<br />
The JBB is 263 over 8 seconds = 33dps<br />
<br />
Of course to maintain 33dps with JBB you can't do anything else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Smokejaguar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Magelo says Curse of Spirits is 65 damage for 14 ticks at lv 65.  That is 910 damage in 84 seconds<br />
<br />
 http://www.magelo.com/eq_spell_info.html?num=1932</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Smoke, the epic damage is described above - it increases per tick :)<br />
<br />
I parsed alpha 61 dog with celerity and mask doing 30-35dps on the golems in PoI Factory - which are fairly high AC mobs. That's excluding any procs.<br />
BoN - ~30DPS<br />
Epic - ~10 DPS<br />
JBB - ~30 DPS<br />
<br />
Total: 105 dps.<br />
<br />
Given that you start the fight with debuffs, and the cast times of spells/clickies, I think a total of about 75 DPS is a reasonable conservative estimate. Once you get canni V you may find you stop the JBB casting so much and start to use rains instead, or at least one rain and then back to JBB. <br />
<br />
Any healing and such is obviously going to cut into the JBB damage, but the nice thing is that the pet, epic and BoN just keep on dishing the damage while you can do other stuff.<br />
<br />
Of course this is all hypothetical for a number of reasons:<br />
1) Aggro - you'll need one hell of a good tank to slow and BoN right off the bat and follow that up with a rain spell. <br />
2) Healing, buffing etc all cuts into time spent dishing damage.<br />
3) Mobs killed before epic reaches efficiency<br />
<br />
Don't kid yourself, we're not really a great DPS class (the equivalent mage pet does 60dps or so, beastlord probably more with the procs, necro I dunno), even warriors are making 100dps now, but we can make a decent contribution particularly on the tougher PoP mobs with lots of hp, and when we have a good taunter for MT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Xlitherina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">A little off subject, but my new favorite tank is a pally...because they stun.<br />
<br />
In PoP, my regular group is monk, pally, cleric, me, chanter, and one other random person (usally a tank class)<br />
<br />
The monk pulls, and before the mob is in our range, the Pally stuns. If it lands, great, if it doesn't no big deal...the pally now has all the aggro. <br />
<br />
I can malo/slow when the mob is at 100% and it will STILL run at the pally. If fact, it seems that resisted stuns generate more aggro...which makes sense.<br />
<br />
Our pally uses his lowest lvl stun, which has really fast cast time, so he can chain-cast 2-3 before the mob gets in our range...he then has generated so much aggro I have to work hard to get the mob mad at me...and by then it's usually almost dead anyways.<br />
<br />
Just to keep on topic, I malo/slow/epic without a pause. then canny a bit and if needed, BoN.<br />
