<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Yhakfiend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Haha... thats kinda' funny, because we had a Naggy raid like that back in July where we went in with 23 people, everyone died except for a rogue, and he solo-killed Nag from 3%.  <br />

No one ninja'd anything though, so it was a little different.</div></div><hr />

Sometimes you see an opportunity to do something cool, and you just gotta go for it.  In a few weeks, people won't think back and say &quot;damn our vox loot got ninja'd =(&quot;, they'll say &quot;that rogue was a badass.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have read the post (well, first pages) and I am wondering how he could get the kill. According to the post he did 2% of the damage to Vox.<br />
In a normal Vox fight caster bind at the rock, and all there had to be one caster/healer whose group has done more damage than 2% to Vox. If they all &quot;forgot&quot; to bind at that rock they really deserve to lose the loot.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">that is the guy that every public raid leader hates.<br />
<br />
He shows up LATE, demands to be included, tells you how good his gear is.  God I hated those people when we were doing public dragon raids long ago.  <br />
<br />
What he did was not heroic in any way.  He took no risk, all he would have had to do is say he was trying to help and then he would have got CR'd and rezzed with the rest of the raid.<br />
<br />
The best move of his career would have been to solo it off, then loot the items and hand them to the raid leader.  Tell him sorry I was late man, here are her drops.  Then everyone cheers him and he gets a shining reputation for being a good guy.  More than likely gets the eternal gratitude and an apology from the raid leader, rolls on the items and the &quot;prestige&quot; of saying he got a solo kill on vox.<br />
<br />
Instead he gets a bad rep, a flame war, and some items.  I hope all Vox dropped him was a bracer, that crappy piercer and words of healing.  grats you.<br />
<br />
What a sad story of an annoying greedy person getting lucky.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe it's just me, but there are no reputations for being a &quot;good guy.&quot;  It's just like retail...10 people can walk out of your doors happy, but it only takes 1 guy to hose your reputation.<br />
<br />
When I look around in EQ, I see 2 kinds of people.  People that have screwed me over before, and people i'm indifferent to.  I don't think &quot;oh, that guy was nice, he once soloed vox and then let us all roll on the loot even tho we really didn't deserve it.&quot;  People don't remember that crap as easily as they remember someone training them or KS'ing them.  Striving for a good reputation is meaningless in EQ.  You can be Prince Noble and at the end of the day, it doesn't mean a damned thing.<br />
<br />
Bravo.  I wouldda done it too.  If that raid wiped, then they're done.  I've had people do the exact same thing to me, and the only thing ya can do is pick up your crap and get out.  You failed, time to let someone else have a crack.  If that someone happens to be a 50 rogue who is in the right place at the right time, then so be it.  They didn't want to include him on their raid, so as soon as their raid died, they had no claims to the mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I would have looted the pally book then /auct &quot;Willing to Multiquest the pally book&quot;  :p not really :D<br />
<br />
I think it was his choice what to do with the loot, if he would have handed it over he would have been an awesome guy for doing so.<br />
<br />
If he chose to keep it the raid should have said, damn that sucks, better luck next time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The best move of his career would have been to solo it off, then loot the items and hand them to the raid leader.<br />
<br />
Before the raid leader even got to him, he was probably receiving TONS of flame tells.  If they had anyone bound in the safehall, then he never would've gotten the kill, so they had to come back in from outside.<br />
<br />
And if he HAD given up the loot, then people would've accused him of Ninja'ing every item they wanted to see that he didn't hand over (whether Vox dropped the item or not).  The only thing that would've made this raid happy is if he didn't kill Vox in the first place.<br />
<br />
FFA - When two or more raids confront a mob, the first one that gets there gets ONE shot at the mob.  If they wipe, then the second gets one shot at the mob, etc...<br />
<br />
The first was a raid of 36 people, the second was a raid of one person.  Vox's health is not an issue.  The only other item of issue was that if the raid wasn't incompetently lead, this never would've happened</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Good lord. <br />
<br />
Of course the mobs health was an issue. An individual cannot be described as a sufficent force to call itself a raid and cannot kill Vox whilst numbering one. They had no business claiming any sort of looting rights, it was killstealing, pure and simple.<br />
<br />
You may think it was a ballsy thing to do and congratulate him on the tenacity but don't try and dress up what was done as being anything other than of dubious morals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jagara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">reputation is the only stat you cant fix....<br />
<br />
im sure everyone can think of certain people on their server known for doing something bad, and it followed them around for months.<br />
<br />
anything he could have looted isnt worth a serverwide reputation, whether you agree with him or not.  in my opinion, what kind of person you are when youre playing really does make a difference - people definitely remeber when they grouped with that really cool shaman who joked around and never went oom, and people remeber the jerk who ninja'd every corpse, got a rare drop and /q out.  this becomes more and more evident as you hit the end game, since the zones you can go to for exp get smaller and smaller, and i usually remeber the people i talked to and grouped with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Sorry, but that was NOT kill stealing.<br />
<br />
Should he have given up the loot afterwards?  Not sure on that one.  I probably would have, but that's me.<br />
<br />
The raid wiped.  They held no claims to Vox the instant the last person in their raid fell.  Just so happens a single rogue was there to pick up the pieces.<br />
<br />
Gotta give the guy credit.  Some quick thinking on his part.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kariina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">technically it was not ninja looting.<br />
<br />
The rogue got the kill and the corpse was available to him on the onset.<br />
<br />
The question is about the loot and who gets it. Why should the raid party get the loot when they failed to take down vox?<br />
<br />
These issues are better left to the GMs to deal with. It was definately a strange set of circumstances that makes for a Very interesting read for sure. Almost as good as what is happening on Xev and the gm spawning 5 rages.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Togh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The guy was able to finish the fight because he a some charges on a 400pt clicky heal item. He is OBVIOUSLY an alt. Do you think he cares about the reputation of his level 50 rogue alt? Heck, he could probably re-roll and get another level 50 rogue alt. in a few days.<br />
<br />
What he did was NOT wrong. There is only two set of rules that apply to this game in my book and that's the ones set by Verant and by the community as a whole. Any other rules that people perceive are bogus, because not everyone agrees with them. &quot;You should have done this&quot;...&quot;You should have done that&quot;....why? because you and a few people say so? There are others that obviously disagree and are speaking up about it. That should give them a clue that they got a tough break and need to move on.<br />
<br />
Tough breaks happen all the time in EQ...need to pick up and move on. I'm sympathetic to what happened to them, but I'm not sympathetic to the way a few of them are dealing with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tryg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">shrug raid wiped, he took on a mob after the raid wiped. Standard guild rules with GMs say that if you wipe someone else gets a chance, just he did it solo and before Vox could go into ultra regen mode.<br />
<br />
Maybe not the best way to make friends but legit tactics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">sweet.  That guy gambled and it paid off.  I think the other pppl complaining he ks'd them and ninja'd their loot are off their rockers.  Personally I believe there is more information then what was told in that thread.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are forgetting that he's a rogue. It comes naturally to them ;)<br />
<br />
Like Wildaar, I think there is a lot more to this story than has been posted. All the vox raids that I went on had a requirement that casters bind themselves by the rock so that you could mem you spells and re-join the fun. So why wasn't that done here? poor leadership if that was not the case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Amanita</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I find this story quite humorous, and the thread where all the other raiders are flaming the rogue is even funnier.  If they had used a little smarter strategy they would have gotten the kill.  If they had allowed the rogue to join they would have won.  Sounds to me like they were WIPED and the rogue saw a mob he could maybe take, went for it, and pulled it off.  Nice work, I'd say.  Why would the raid party that WIPED deserve the loot of the mob?<br />
<br />
THIS IS AMERICA MAN, LEARN THE RULES!<br />
<br />
Love,<br />
Amanita</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">re: casters binding at the rock<br />
Unless they changed something drastically recently... when you die, your dmg-credit on the mob is wiped.  Once the last person on that raid fell (as I'm sure the rogue was 100% aware), they'd all zoned and lost any dmg-rights to the dragon corpse.  Doesn't matter where they bound.  There probably WERE a lot of casters bound there, since otherwise, nobody would've seen him, and I'm assuming the rogue would've just slunk off with his pilfered goods.  Or maybe he stuck around to gloat.  heh.<br />
<br />
2nd note - I feel really horrible for the person who posted above that they only remember the rotten bastards they encounter in EQ.  I have a very long memory for the nice folks.  I still try to go out of my way to help that enchanter who stuck C2 on my little port ho' druid back when she was lvl 15, and gave her an ubah skull of jhen'tra.  I can't believe how tedious this game would be to play if I paid more attention to the morons than the good ones.<br />
<br />
That rogue proved to everybody who hears the story that he couldn't care less about the people in the game.  It's 100% about the loot for him.  To each his own, I suppose, but I can't imagine anybody on that server would ever give a rip about him, in return.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Three thoughts:<br />
<br />
1.  As a roleplaying rogue, this would be the coolest thing in the world.  Not saying he was or anything, but think about it.  :)<br />
<br />
2.  It's amusing to me that people are getting this worked up over basically crap loot.  A 13/30 spear?  4 AC, +7 agi/dex bracer?  The bag is nice, and he left the pally books.  If an RBB dropped, I could see a little more cause for frustration.<br />
<br />
3.  If it would have been me, I probably would have got myself killed trying to set up the perfect screenshot.  Me and Vox, all alone in a room, corpses piled up everywhere, then I get the kill shot.  Now THAT is a sig pic !!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">What he did was legal, but unethical.  Do not confuse the situation with fluff.  Getting the kill and engaging after everyone died makes the kill legal, but taking the loot and bailing was unethical.  He'd be on my ignore list fast.<br />
<br />
He got 2 blues of exp which are worth, what, about 2 hours of soloing at that level.  That alone would be worth it.  I'm sure he could have kept one item and redeemed his rep to some extent by handing the rest back, but his rep isn't trashed because he was wrong, but because he wasn't ethical.  It was not a ninja job, but it was lame.<br />
<br />
If that guy has other chars, they just got a serious twink job and no one can track the rep of his alts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">As Tarthug says, legal but not ethical - he took more than he was entitled to for finishing her off.  However, I think he WAS entitled to SOMETHING - if he hadn't been there, there would have been no kill.  <br />
<br />
I think it would have been totally fair (and ethical) for him to pick one item and give the rest to the raid.  Keeping all the usable loot was pretty selfish.   He wouldn't be getting any SoW from me any time soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Krodah Dirtnappah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I find it hilarious.  He reacted quickly and pulled a neat trick off.  Bravo for him and gratz on the lootz.<br />
<br />
I too think there is more to the story.<br />
<br />
I'm betting some casters were bound at the rock and knew he killed Vox.   Would only take me a few angry tells to loot everything and /auc WTS multiquest for pally book<br />
<br />
It looks like the GM's have ruled he did nothing wrong too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">That was so in character roguish. <br />
<br />
Gotta love how he 'had to use a couple charges of his Prayers of Life scroll' to pull it off.<br />
<br />
This guy is on the wrong server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I dont think he was right to keep all the loot. But it wasnt KSing or ninja looting.<br />
<br />
edit: laughing woman are you sure that is how the exp works? If you die and are still in the same zone you wont get exp when your group finishes off the kill?<br />
<br />
BTW this sets an unpleasant precedent...Raid Jackals. All it takes is one manaburn wizard to follow a raid around waiting for the raid to fail...and bam! Free loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Folks, he's a rogue.  They're devious, dastardly, backstabbing individuals.  Not to mention Vox dropped the whole raid.  Therefore, they lost.  Not many people get put in a situation where a major mob is taken down to almost no health but still wipes a raid, and there happens to be a non-raid guy standing there with nothing but an almost dead mob in front of him (Vox could have attacked him).  You're trying to tell me you wouldn't try the same?!?!?!  horse-****, anyone in his position would do it.  He actually pulled off some decent strategies to finish the dragon off.  <br />
<br />
They all died, Vox was still barely alive, and the rogue was ready to rock.  It sucks that the raid got wiped, but I don't fault the rogue at all.  If you fail to take down Vox, you fail to get her loot, plain and simple.  The rogue helped that Pally out by leaving the book; otherwise the Pally has to organize a CR and a whole new raid.  He'll be known as the rogue who finished Vox by himself in a very rogue-esque way, which is quite a legend if you ask me.<br />
<br />
This is nothing but standard loot rules here, and those loot rules apply to ALL mobs in Norrath, not just regular mobs.  That includes raid mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I play on Innoruuk, and I've met Etrens a bunch of times with various characters.<br />
<br />
He's an ass. Pure and simple.<br />
<br />
I'm not shocked or surprised he did it. Was it wrong? Maybe a little. Most public Vox raids die out after the first wipe (and there's almost always a first wipe). They would've had a long and uncomfortable corpse run ahead of them. Sure, while getting the corpses out of the lair is easy (I've done it with my monk before too) but the Ice Giants eat you on the way in.<br />
<br />
He's usually the guy that LEADS the Vox/Naggy raids. Soon as the server comes up he's there in /naggy setting it up. Doesn't make him any less a jerk though.<br />
<br />
I'd be a little annoyed if it happened to me... but it's just Vox people! Geez... there's only two reasons to kill her. Epics and RBG. He left the epic piece behind too!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Thorgryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I think the kill was fairly his, as to if he should have given the loot to the raid, if he was a paladin, yes, but he is a rogue...... I don't see much different in this situation than if your group was near zoneline in karnors and train #5030323 comes rolling thru to zone, your group kills one of the nice loot dropping mobs, and the people who trained you come back in the zone and demand the loot.<br />
<br />
they lost... they should get over it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Let's get real here.....  He was standing there watching the raid that just told him he couldn't participate (who would've left at that point?) and Vox made a raid sandwich.  At that point, he sees Vox with a sliver of life left (and probably a DoT shutting down her regen).  He has the equip to finish her off, he has the skillz...   Now, WHO AMONG YOU wouldn't have dropped her ass like Jack and the Beanstalk?  And if not, is that morals talking or nervousness?<br />
<br />
Once he dropped her, I'm sure he received MASSIVE amounts of flames from the raid that was lead so poorly that none of the DD tossers or clerics were bound in the Safehall.  You made a righteous kill and started receiving massive flames, would you meekly turn back in all the items, knowing that they'll say you're keeping all the good stuff for yourself?  PULEAAAASE<br />
<br />
He left the Pally Book, good for him :)  At that point, I'd be heading to the forums to change my signature!<br />
<br />
he may be a jerk, but if you really put yourself in his shoes, how much would you have done differently?<br />
<br />
BTW, Flame threads like the one at the top of the thread only servers to spread his rep as the guy who solo'd Vox (Uber guilds love the skillz and the guts)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Wobbs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Morals and ethics do not apply whatsoever. What he did was within all the rules and guidelines that govern this game, thats all that matters. <br />
<br />
When you play on Sullon zek knowning damn well that corpse camping is legal, do you moan and whine about morals and ethics when your corpse is camped into decay? No, you don't, because you know thats the way things work and by playing on sullon you agree to those rules. <br />
<br />
Exact same logic applies to this situation. You fail a raid? Tough luck, but according to the rules you lost your chance. By playing the game, you agree to the rules of the game, no questions.</div></div><hr />
