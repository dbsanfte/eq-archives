<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KriFos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just stacked these:<br />
<br />
Potion of Greater Heat<br />
Potion of Greater Adroitness<br />
<br />
Gave me: <br />
<br />
50 sta<br />
15 agi<br />
25 svc<br />
<br />
<br />
Looks like all kinds of different potions stack with eachother, as long as they are in the same era (lesser wont stack with greater).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">But will this setup stack with my typical HoS/Sta/Agil buffs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shokar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ever since my Paladin got Jboots*, she has not been buying potions from the Shaman.   My Paladin was a pretty good soloing melee before, NOW she can buy from Catyra once again.<br />
<br />
Darn, I just got to a level where I did not care about money anymore.....LOL<br />
<br />
*Jboots Camp Report:<br />
<br />
Woke up, was in OOT, did a /w and zone was empty.  I never camped AC before, but swam over to island.  Just as I got there, AC popped.  Killed AC.  SO, my camp was about less than 2 minutes.</div></div><hr />

But will this setup stack with my typical HoS/Sta/Agil buffs? <br />
<br />
Yes - it does stack with all shaman spells.<br />
<br />
However, i noticed (and /bugged) a stacking issue with the 25CR potion not stacking with druids Circle of Seasons. <br />
<br />
The 25 MR potion stacked fine with enchanters Guard of Druzzil (GRM).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">KriFos, when you got potions to stack with HoS which did you cast first?  With Greater Vigor on tonight (agi and str) I casted HoS on myself and it overwrote the Vigor.  Deliriously Nimble stacked fine though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>KriFos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I was buffed with Focus of Souls, Endurance of the Boar and Agility of the Wrulan. Havent tried to cast those spells after i drank the potions though.<br />
<br />
Edit: It seems like its the str component that is causing stacking issues. The sta, agi and dex component stacks fine with other buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Daeneil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">another stacking glitch it the Heat potion doesnt stack with Primal Essence.  It flat outs overwrites it.<br />
<br />
So lets see, I can either pay 350 plat to make a couple stacks of these 25 stamina potions OR either use a vp hammer to cast PE for free OR cast the spell on me for 20 stamina outright and also add 20 str dex and agil.<br />
<br />
Alchemy still sucks, even with this bone they tossed the shaman class. =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">So far so good stacking stat potions on top of spells.  Had the same prob with spells overwriting potions.  Don't have Primal Essence, so can't speak to that.<br />
<br />
/eyes the empty slots in her spell book.</div></div><hr />
