<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gaack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I keep hearing about stacking. I have heard of both Gem stacking and Spell stacking. I have no clear understanding of what is meant by this.<br />
<br />
The most common references are as to what spells are stacking &quot;compatable&quot;.<br />
<br />
I have spoken to several people in-game, and not one of them so far knows either. These are not total Noobs either.<br />
<br />
While it is likely that I have totally misunderstood what is meant by &quot;stacking&quot;, hope springs eternal. <br />
<br />
My hope is that &quot;stacking&quot; means: You can stack several spells into one gem slot and cast multiple spells with one click and thus also have more than 8 spells up at any one time.<br />
<br />
Please tell me if this is totally wrong. What is really meant by &quot;stacking&quot;. How do I do it, and why is it a good thing.<br />
<br />
Thankyou for your patience and help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lulian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have only heard stacking used in EQ in one way and that is what spells will stack.  As in which buffs can you have on at the same time or which debuffs/dots can you stack on a mob at the same time.<br />
I do not believe there is anyway to have more than 8 spells mem'd at the same time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gaack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thank you. I was going insane...well that may be forgone. So not all spells may be cast on a mob at once. They must stack.<br />
<br />
Is there a suggested resource which charts what spells may be stacked onto mobs? Or is there a rule that I may apply to determine what will stack?<br />
<br />
Again, thank you so much. No wonder people had no idea what I was talking about.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Beohram</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Aye, you guys got it.  Stacking, when referring to spells, means the spells cast will have a cumulative effect.<br />
<br />
Buffs:<br />
<br />
Skin like wood and Skin like rock do not “stack.”  If you had skin like wood up and then cast skin like rock on yourself, SLW would be overwritten.  Trying to cast SLW while SLR is up and you will get the message that SLW will not take hold.  They do not “stack.”<br />
<br />
Casting Barb coat while you have SLR up and they will both take hold on you.  They “stack.”<br />
<br />
Offensive spells:<br />
<br />
While the majority of the offensive spells cast in game are instantaneous, many have an effect that lasts over time.  (snare for example) Cast snare 10 times on the same mob and it will not become any slower.   Snare does not “stack.”  In most cases, the spell with the higher level effect will take hold over other spells of the same line.  Ensnare overwrites snare (they do not “stack”).  A slow from a level 60 shaman will overwrite the slow cast from a lvl 50 Shaman.<br />
<br />
Damage over time spells are one of the few exceptions.   Once upon a time, many of our DoT spells would not “stack” with our own DoT spells, much less the DoT of a higher level druid.  (Immolate would not stack with flame lick).  In a recent patch, this limitation was removed.  You can now cast each and every DoT you own on a mob and they will all take hold AND they will all do damage.  This is true even if a high level druid were casting their DoTs on a mob.<br />
<br />
Casting the same DoT multiple times will only have the effect of casting it once.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps a bit.</div></div><hr />
