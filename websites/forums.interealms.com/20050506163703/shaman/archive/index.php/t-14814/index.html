<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ShakoBoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I went into trader mode one night with my new beasty alt trying to sell some twink gear I had left.  Anyways, when I woke up the next morning I found myself at the server select screen.  So I logged back into my character and he was naked at his bindpoint.  I ran to the bazaar to find my corpse laying where I went AFK in trader mode lol.  Has this ever happened to anyone?  I always thought the Bazaar was a safe spot type area...with the exception of the arena area.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>icebain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">normaly means you had an invalid item in your inventory or equiped</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>woon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What is an invalid item?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">that is funny....and I have no clue why that would have happened</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">We had a strange thing happen in the Bazaar , all the merchants were being sent to the safe spot.Was crazy to have dozens of people stacked up on top of you.(and hard to get out of)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What is an invalid item?<br />
<br />
Hmm, he may mean a &quot;cheat&quot; item, like one your class/race isn't normally supposed to have, or a duped item.  In that case the GM might kill you to get you out of the game and take the item, perhaps?<br />
<br />
I'd be surprised if you could log back in after they found you selling a duped item, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Asyth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">huh i never heard of a duped item before.. . but yeah that is odd bud lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I highly doubt a &quot;duped&quot; item was the reason he died, lol.  I'm guessing he lagged and maybe &quot;fell&quot; for 10,000 damage...  if ya had logging turned on, you can go back and see exactly what happened.</div></div><hr />
