<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Linuvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi,<br />
   Quick question. I usually Play a ranger so I have the animal soloing idea down pat with fear and snare (really miss that with shammy :) ) But what I would like to know is the most efficient fastest way a Shaman can solo I have solo'd a large part of the way to 39 but I dont think I'm doing it right.<br />
example<br />
      In Dawnshroud I will pull a wolf root it then put Venom and Scourge on it root will break and pet will jump in. root again pull pet off untill Venom wears off so I dot it again. <br />
      At this stage I've used up a large chunk of mana and could probably do this cycle 1 more time before I need to start to canablize.  Wisdom is at 195 or there abouts with bear on. if I go AC its at about 190. I still seem to have a large down time. I have 4k in the bank and was thinking I need a regen item to compliment the chloro/canny dance thing.<br />
<br />
Anyway Question should I change my method?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">whats your AC/HP?<br />
<br />
if you have 195 wis...well im guessng your HP/AC isnt THAT great...<br />
<br />
What most people do is pull w/ slow, dot, tank, sic pet etc...this works best w/ a AC/HP setup.  At level 45 you also click on your JBB&lt; but thats a different story^^</div></div><hr />

You can have high WIS and still maintain decent HP &amp; AC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Linuvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">HP is at 990 self buffed Buffed AC I cant remember my equipment tho is<br />
Hollowed Pixie Rib 3AC/+3Wis Ear<br />
Neck is ac5 +5wis/int/cha (From Twighlight off Elementals)<br />
Face is Platnum Ruby Veil +7wis/str (swap for  AC5 5wis/cha)<br />
Acrylia Studded Cloak and Tunic AC7 and AC11<br />
Totemic Legs/Boots<br />
JB Arms/Guantlets<br />
Rings are the +7wis rings<br />
Book in off Hand Spear in Range and a mace 9/27 in main<br />
So AC is maybe near 600</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well curently my shammy is level 40.  With all buffs up and in AC/HP gear my Wis is 140, AC is about 730 and HP is about 1150.  Currently though my defense skill is not maxed out though I'm working on it.  I've noticed with higher AC (those times I forget to take off Sale gear CHA or WIS gear for tradeskills) I take considerable more damage from the creatures I regularly hunt.  My current operating procedure is to fully buff myself and buff dog-dog up Haste &amp; Str.  Then run out and smack a nice blue mob with a slow and run him back to my puppy parked in nice safe place.   I will then root the mob as it closes with me.   At this point I will hit him with a slow and Venom Bolt only.  The Disease ussually takes longer then the mob will live so I dont bother with it.  I'll let the mob merinate with venom while I'll anni down to 3-4 Bubbles of health and med/regen.  Once Venom runs its coarse I reapply venom and reroot one last time.  I now send in Dog-Dog and watch his health till he is about 3/4 to 1/2 health which at that point I join him on tendorizing the mob.  Once the front side of the mob has been tenderized enough the mob will turn and allow the back side to be tenderized which at that time I sit and allow dog-dog to finish unaided.  With the new pet changes we dont have worry so much about dog-dog doing too good a job on the tenderizing part so that helps alot.  Technicly you could replace the Venom Dot with the Scorge Dot but Scorge just takes so long to work.  And Venom and Root are the exact same duration in time so if you reroot the mob a few seconds after dotting him you'll always have a very good idea when root should be dropping with out haveing to time it.  <br />
<br />
P.S.  Have noticed that the RAGE/FURY spells dont attually have any regen components or mana loss components.  Though the loss of the regen kinda bits the non lose of mana more then makes up for it.  With the Added stats with that spell line and low mana cost it makes for nice buff if you cast it before the fight to avoid the long recast delay it adds.  You just have to not cast the Dex buff as it will not stack with Dex for some silly reason.</div></div><hr />

<br />
unless amazingly well twinked, i never see a 39 shaman w/ 195 wis and good AC/HP.<br />
<br />
What i would be expecting to see are 6wis rings, plat viels etc...<br />
<br />
Like i said, a guess, but based on what ive seen before.<br />
--<br />
Anyway, His next point proved me right, his AC/HP could greatly improve.<br />
<br />
Hate to turn this into an equip thread, but for best soloing, your gonna have to change a few things around.  Get a clay gaurdian sheild, and 6/65 rings if you can.  changes like that, get more HP and more AC.  Also max your defense skill.  <br />
<br />
What this achieves is the ability to take hits w/ minimum damage taken, thus reducing downtime, and giving more mana to canni.  Its more efficient to melee mobs down, and do more damage, then root rot.  You use less mana, but take more damage.  Compensate by regening yourself, and hopefully it should balance out, so you can tank the mobs, and not be dead by the end of the fight =-)<br />
<br />
What chazic said is pretty good, Maybe the roots arent even neccesary either, just dot and pull, and reaply the dot as they come =-)p.s, chaz, the rage line has no mana/regen thing anymore, its just dex now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Linuvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Cool Thanks Guys started with improvng my AC and HP I hate to twink as each char generally earns his own equipment but I may have to loan my shammy my rangers rings for the time being to kick him along I noticed my Defense was 176 so its no where near maxed for  the level I suppose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">176 is no where near maxed. <br />
<br />
I have 134 wis at 41 maxed Defense and Offense. (untwinked)<br />
815 AC 995 HP's unbuffed as an Iksar. Close to 900 AC and 1100+ HP's buffed with mediocre gear.<br />
I can take a helluva beating before I have to heal. My mana pool isn't that large but I don't get hit that much. More HP's equal more mana.<br />
This is how I tackle tough melee mobs like Frost Giants at 41. I pull with Malisement (very important) run out of my pup's assist range. Then I root said Giant and cast Scourge and VoS on him. Allow him to rot while I canni my mana back up, I re-root until VoS fades, then I re-apply it. At this point the Giant is pissed and wants to gnaw on my tail, I run him to my parked pet and let my pet chew on him from behind. I run in a big circle into he's in flee mode then I turn and whack him with Hammer. DEAD Giant with very minimal HP and Mana loss. I'll tank them at 44-45 with better buffs and Alacrity. <br />
<br />
But I didn't start to Root/Rot until my Offense/Defense and melee skills were maxed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Maybe I'm just being a big dumb bonehead shaman, but I don't even root when I solo, except to park adds.  I pull with slow and apply a dot or two, then melee while my pet chews on it.  I generally end up a bubble down in mana and at around 70% hit points.  My wisdom is 135, my ac is 950ish, and I use a rune etched icewurm fang.  I recently got the low end horse, and I highly recommend that.  I am nearly always full of mana at the end of fights now.</div></div><hr />
