<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yesterday while I was in Kael and in EC earlier I noticed that when in my 55 Bear form I look like a Cub compare to other shaman in level 29 bear form. :(<br />
<br />
In other words, I was a black bear and level 29 shaman were a Kodiak.<br />
<br />
WTH! hehe anyone else notice this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kanad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sounds like something that's been going on for a while with druid wolf form and our pets... they'll often appear tiny, and Grow causes them to shrink. Haven't noticed it as much recently as a few months ago. The same thing happens if you Grow an enchanter pet, I believe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Umgrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If someone is already in bearform when you zone in, they will be huge on your screen, but normal on theirs.  Same goes with your bearform, if you are already in bearform and someone logs or zones in where you are, you will appear huge.  If you got the guy to click it off and cast it again, I bet it would be normal size.<br />
