<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Loafy929</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, I'm a level 55 shaman on Druzzil Ro, and i am ready to complete the final step for my epic. I personally do not have a tear, but one of my guild members does, and he is willing to MQ for me.<br />
<br />
I've heard many things about doing this.... some say it works if:<br />
<br />
1) The person handing in the tear to Rak has max Truespirit Faction.<br />
<br />
2) The person looting the scale and then handing in the scale for epic also has max truespirit faction.<br />
<br />
In my case, these conditions are met. However, I've heard that if the shaman handing the tear in already has their spear of fate, it wont work.... is this true? Can anyone validate for me?<br />
<br />
Lastly, any suggestions or helpful tips for defeating Rak are welcome. We plan on using the mage fire pet strategy. Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you have tried any other ways to avoid having to do steps, this phase will fail.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Loafy929</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I did the quest right up to where i was going to have to kill Kirn in the hole. then i just did turn-ins of Woe, Envy, and Marr's Promise until my faction was maxed. Since i did this and will be skipping the Kirn kill and Neh'ashir kill, will it fail?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ok, well im at the same spot, except the guy with it is a ranger, and he has maxxed true spirit faction, ive done it all up to this point and have done woe/marr/envy 2 extra times, will it work?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Molg Thu'Mal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Fendail : personally I would not recommend skipping kirn - I know some who did and some who tried and failed.  I would side with caution unless you have access to two Tears.<br />
<br />
As for Rak - the fire pet method no longers works. The pets get torn apart in seconds due change in how firepets deal with fire damage.  We tried it with fire pets less than two weeks ago - they failed - so we just did it the old fashion way.<br />
<br />
Batalon - personally I wouldn't risk it - but I guess if it only checks the rangers faction that it would work.  Since the ranger already has the tear there's not really anything to be lost by trying hehe.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Molg, I've seen conflicting reports on the fire pet thing - did you use the level 49 fire pet or the higher one?  The level 49 fire pet is the one you need, the higher one resists differently and will die.<br />
<br />
I did my epic immediately after the resistance changes and the level 49 pet did behave appropriately.  That was almost a year ago now though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>sir0die</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">in answer to the &quot;shaman already has his epic&quot; statement, there was a recent patch (can't think of when, but within a few months) that returns your faction to a clean slate when you get your epic. I guess it would depend on wether or not this epified shaman who is going to MQ the tear, got his epic before or after the patch in general.<br />
<br />
If he got his epic before patch, his faction is still maxed, if he got it after patch, his faction was reset and the mq'ing will fail.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">this recent thread (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=9660) is the exact same question, and the answer once again is FALSE. Where are people getting this idea? Please go back to where you saw this information and get it corrected cause whoever posted it is full of crap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ok here is some REAL INFO.<br />
<br />
I got my epic this weekend (WOOT!).  Upon handing in the scale and recieving my epic my Truespirit faction went back down to INDIFFERENT.<br />
<br />
If the shaman that has the tear got thier epic before the PoP expansion you should be fine.  If not then you need to help them get thier faction back to max ally.  <br />
<br />
Easy way to test thier faction is to go get Envy/Woe/Marr's Promise, grab the shaman with the tear and have them do the hand in to the wisp.  If they get that all important message then you know for sure everything will go smoothly.<br />
<br />
Then go kill Rak you lucky bastard ;)</div></div><hr />
