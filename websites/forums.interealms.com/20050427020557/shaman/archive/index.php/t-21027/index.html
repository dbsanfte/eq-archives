<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Drylar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, doing some research, and decided I want to do everything I can to max out my regen. I presently have a spell haste range, thought a Marsinger's Gem might make a nifty upgrade, a slightly less spell haste, for better stats and regen 3.<br />
<br />
PoHate, never been there, curios about it. <br />
<br />
I'm EP flagged, some EP gear, good resists and hp. Full buffed I hit over 6khp, and have all 63 and up spells. I know what mage toys are available, and make good use of them for my puppy, and when solo use afflition effciency 4, and ba4 (THANK YOU TRIBUTE!!!... no more crappy bracelet). FT13, jbb, epic. Ok, now you know what I'm working with.<br />
<br />
PoHate... Marsinger's Gems... How far do you think I can get? I've spent many many hours in Veksar, which I've been told is similar. Reading up, sounds like the golems (which I guess I need to kill for a drop for the quests) are very magic resistant, and to use grummus. How do poison/disease fair? How difficult are Tier1 mini's? 2? 3? Anything that should make me have gate on the ready for? Vials of swirling smoke are your friend... Pointers from those that have been there are most welcome, as are critics.<br />
<br />
I took a trip to Sky to get a taste of it (and see how doable it was... i still want that FD ring)... and took down 2 mobs on island 2 then had several adds... nasty nasty spot, and was stupid not taking an instagate. <br />
<br />
If anyone's attempted what I plan on working on, feel free to toss pointers. If you're on Xev, and it turns out to take more of an effort for the higher end stuff, get ahold of me, I'd be up for helping. <br />
<br />
Solo'd a cliff golem at 59, Barducks at 58, Lodi at 61... in the face.<br />
Veksar and the revamped Charisis are some of my favorite playgrounds.<br />
<br />
Once I get stupid and try to take the zone solo, I'll definately come back here and share, though would like advice on what I'm getting myself into before hand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Marsinger Walkthrough (http://www.guildseofon.com/raidinghate.html)<br />
<br />
The above link is a great guide to the Marsinger Quests.  Unfortunately, if you plan to do this solo it is going to take a very, very, VERY long time at a solo kill rate.  Actually, the first level drop will probably take you the longest to get, the pieces for wis casters are just that rare :(<br />
<br />
On the other hand, take a group with ya and slaughter everything you see, working your way through the tiers as the quest pieces drop.  Solo, with elemental+ gear, a Shaman could probably do it all the mobs associated with the quest if he really had pulling the area down pat.  In tier3-4 you will get a lot of adds without fd, paci, or the like.  However the mobs aren't extremely resistant, the named don't summon, and half the entire zone spends the whole fight casting anyway :)<br />
<br />
Disease slow the golems and the dracoliches require you to be in melee range to land spells.<br />
<br />
Also, if anyone else is in the zone, be kind to shout out any quest pieces that aren't wis you run across as others might be looking for them.  Doing so can really pay off when the higher tier groups happen to get a nice wis drop that is free to loot :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">With the rare exception, tier 1 golems are easy with Poison dots, disease slow, melee away. With your gear/aa's tier 1 will remind of newbie land.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i soloed through the second gem..the clerics i found to be the hardest due to the mobs getting a little tougher where they spaw, the trouble of getting a single pull, and the fact that they heal.  First 2 didn't take me more than maybe 8ish to 10ish hours to compleate...maybe i was lucky...i had a ranger with me for about half of it while we were also farming for him to finish up and bag his epic...the actually mobs you will be soloing are a joke after slow.  compleate and utter joke (for the first 2 range items at least.)  only thing you need to be concerned about is adds.  few adds and things can get out of hand if you don't channel a slow or 2.<br />
<br />
to be honest, this is really a sup par item for someone EP flagged.  once i got flagged i gave up on this quest all together.  some alternatives for someone with your flags would be Radiant Feather (1 groupable in poa), Putrid Chunk of Moss (pow trash named?),  The Orb of the Sun (sol ro), Blackflame Sphere (pyronus pof), Torch of Judgement (if you clear vt on slow days), Bone Sliver Ornament (earth), the incense burner (pof tradeskill made), or Xephyrus Wand of the Flowing Wind (if you want to be a dick with your elp after xegony kills).<br />
<br />
then again, you can't solo any of these (outside the burner).  to be honest my personal favorates are sun orb off sol ro, and the silver bone orn off mud ring (?) in earth.<br />
the time and resources it would take to finish this quest imo isn't worth the item (crappy opportunity cost to do this quest.)  Could farm god spells/xp/regen gems instead of doing this (just an example.)<br />
<br />
if you find that you still want to do hate, i think you will need at least a tank to do the minis (don't quote me because i never bothered to go that far.)  download some good music because hate is boreing easy, so dig in =p<br />
<br />
ps- oh, i do suggest you keep at least 1 instagate with you incase you get to many adds while doing the &quot;tougher&quot; mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Drylar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I was told it has a type 7 slot, and i currently have a ceramic totem of the xegony or some such (spell haste with stats)... anyhow, the final gem is decent stats, type 7 slot, and haste4, regen3... now the extended torment aug works in range, so i can have an item that is good stats, spell haste 4, regen 3, and extended torment 4... and the only thing i could see dumping that for is the stone of flowing time, and then that'd be a toss up. <br />
<br />
Present range:<br />
Dex: +12 Wis: +5 Int: +5 Agi: +12 MR: +15 HP: +65 Mana: +65<br />
Spell Haste 4<br />
<br />
Add the aug and I'd get:<br />
AC: +20 Str: +15 Sta: +20 Cha: +10 Wis: +20 Int: +20 FR: +10 DR: +10 CR: +10 MR: +20 PR: +10 HP: +100 Mana: +100<br />
Spell Haste 4<br />
Regen 3<br />
Extended Torment 4<br />
<br />
And albeit time consuming, can solo most, if not all, and easily single group what I can't solo, based on what I am hearing.<br />
<br />
Radiant feather, good stats, but only so much FT gets applied.<br />
Putrid Chunk of Moss, slightly better hp, less to resists I need, and clicky single target agi...<br />
Orb of the Sun, good stats, Fury of Eci, but I don't nuke that much, I dot alot. <br />
Bone Sliver woulld be nice, but I buff alot in raid, and spell haste 4 works on beneficial as well<br />
Incense burner, again, dot more. <br />
Wand has 50ish more hp, and a 30% all dd's... would pass it up to nukers first. And we dont farm xegony.<br />
<br />
They all have their merits, and i can agree that the aug can be added to all. Seeing as I dot solo and buff raid, then slow raid... spell haste that affects both, coupled with regen, is worth more than 15hp (what most of them come within). Yes, we are about to enter Time (rathe FINALLY died... xeg and ro been done and gone a while, cornaiv next...) but i dont see myself wearing this out any time in the near future the way i am looking at it (until quarm, or possibly somewhere in GoD i havn't looked, still a ways off before we get good at it) and i haven't yet finished my VT key, in which we haven't raided for a while. <br />
<br />
Anyhow, seeing what you all think, going to go to bed, wake up fresh, patch be done, today is off from work, and since we met our goal last night, night off raiding... might hit a grind for an aa or 2, then hit Hate and send some heads whirling. I just hope I get to take raid buffs in. The annoying part is playing alt hockey to get a stone. I went and got myself KoS to paineel and always have been to neriak. Yet I can walk freely in cabalis. Go figure. Still need to reattempt my final cudgel. Now you all have some background on why i would want to do this, perhaps you see the method to my madness. Will post with a nice little what I thought of Hate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ospri</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I can't speak for any of the tier 2+ stuff since I only bother with Tier 1 (I don't know if the ranger quest piece drops off any of the higher bosses, so I've never tried), but the tier 1 stuff is cake.  Non-summoning, low hp, max hits in the 280s or so, and a lot of them waste a majority of their time casting.  Bosses are basically the same, except they hit for a max of 400-ish.  Almost no roamers, and not hard to single-pull *most* spots (there are a few buildings that will get multiples due to mob proximity, odds are you'll know before you try)<br />
<br />
Golems can still resist Grummus after MD, but I don't think I've seen it resisted more than twice.  Golems aren't the hardest hitters around anyway, doggy shouldn't croak unless you're very unlucky.<br />
<br />
I do know that on E'ci at least, control response in Hate is intermittently sluggish.  I'd chalk it up to packet loss, but it doesn't seem to show up that way on the lag-o-meter.  Dunno.  Take it easy at first until you see if you're lagging bad.  You can easily do single-pulls right from zone-in though to give it a test.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">First 2 didn't take me more than maybe 8ish to 10ish hours to compleate...maybe i was lucky...<br />
<br />
When did you collect the items?  A little while ago (6 months maybe?) they seriously nerfed the drop rates for the wis and melee quest pieces.  I farmed tier1 until all my party members had a piece, for at least a good 60-70 hours (levelling war, mag, wiz alts at the time from ~47 or 48 to 55ish) and we saw a few dozen int caster quest 1 pieces, half that many hybrid, two wis, and one melee.<br />
<br />
Not that you couldn't have gotten very lucky though :)  I just wouldn't recommend going after this quest solo because the drops tend to be very rare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kiisekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Doing these quests at the moment myself. I have the first one done and all the stuff to turn in for three and four... just need a crest to finish it all up. Tier 1 will be cake (by the way, I'm pretty certain the ranger quest piece does not drop outside tier 1 nameds) but it may take you a while to get the signet. Tier 2 and 3 are pretty easily soloable, tier 2 golems might give ya a problem or two but nothing major. No trash mob or mini-boss (note: mini-boss does not include mobs like maestro, some quest mobs, hand, etc.) tier 1-4 summons. Therefore, tier 4 is soloable... but it gets interesting. There is no real good spot to pull singles to that doesn't have a wanderer or a spot where you'll get a double pull nearby. The thing about tier 4 mobs is they hit for 600+ and fairly quickly and can nuke or HT pretty hard or Cheal depending on class. So, if you get resists on root/slow or adds or an ill-timed root break, etc. you will probably be in for a quick trip to bind and an annoying CR. Bring a tank partner and it will go much easier, a SK friend and I duo tier 4 all the time and the exp is nothing to sneeze at. At least one of the tier 4 named you can clear to and pull with singles so it is possible to do the final quest solo but I wouldn't reccomend it. In the end, the prohibitive factor is not the zone difficulty, it's the painfully low drop rate. I've been killing tier 2-4 clerics on and off for a month or two now and have seen no crests, the signet for the first one took quite a while as well and the only reason i have the drops for the third and fourth quests is because i got lucky while I was camping tier 4 for a crest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">One quick note, when you kill your first tier4 named, make sure to watch your xp bar very very closely.  You will be in for a big surprise :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Jaidin,<br />
yeah, it was about 6ish months ago. maybe more by now.  didin't relize there was a nerf on those drops.<br />
<br />
Drylar,<br />
sounds like a nice item for you.  GL in seeking it.<br />
<br />
oh btw, spell haste augs are rotting for my god lair farm group, but i still haven't seen a shaman spell drop /snicker =p (if you check my magelo, i have one on a bracer. can't think of the name off hand.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kiisekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Quick note, these quests can be mq'd if you actually find somebody with one of the rare drops. However, the person doing the mq must use the same quest npc as you (i.e. for a priest like yourself the mq'er must be a priest or a melee class).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Dragging up an older post, but it caught my eye since we've made it a guild objective to get everybody their Marsinger's Gem in my smallish guild, and we're all just about done. <br />
<br />
Really if you have a full group that can dedicate time together, it can go by fairly quickly.  It took me about a week with about 3 hours a night to finish up mine.  While you're in hate and killing the tier 3/4 nameds you'll be getting BoT level exp on normal mobs, and when you hit a tier 4 named you'll notice a huge spike (talking like 6%-9% aaxp).  The loot is decent off of named, I walked away with about 25k's worth a night.  You're gonna want to get to the upper tier named's as quickly as you can, cause they can drop lower tier stuff as well.  Just set a cycle, and go from one named spawn to the next (we did about 4-5).  You'll probably end up getting all the books/drops for last gem, and end up getting stuck on the rare for like the 2nd or 3rd gem.  I did the quest a few months ago, and still don't mind hoping up to go with guildies to get there's.  BTW remember old world armor drops can be turned into pop guildmasters for gems (usually a diamond).</div></div><hr />

<br />
That was my surprise :)  Last time I was up there, a few months ago, the tier4 named gave a full 65 group half a yellow AA each.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Get a group to go with you, the xp in tier 4 is really good and a rare nice cash item will drop (ft1 range item etc).  Doing it alone will have you pulling your hair out after the first 60 hours or so.  Even with a full group I would plan on it taking 30-40 hours to finish a gem.</div></div><hr />
