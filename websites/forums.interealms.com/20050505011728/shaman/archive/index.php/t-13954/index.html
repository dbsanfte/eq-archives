<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Durdend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sorry if this is in the wrong forum, but I didn't know where to put it.<br />
<br />
Got two questions.<br />
<br />
1)  Been fighting alot in LoY.  Got lots of racial meats banked up (TONS of Ogre, Troll, DE, Gnome and some Human, Iksar and Erudite).  First of all, I give these freely to shaman that happen to /ooc of meats in zone.  Most will kindly buff me for my trouble, which is nice.  But I've still ended up with stacks of this stuff.  How much is reasonable to charge for it (in my opinion if anything I have makes it to my Bazaar mule, I charge - I need new equipment and stuff just like the next guy)?<br />
<br />
2)  In my time fighting in LoY I've looted some blood too (Elven Blood, Human Blood, I think some Gnome and some Iksar too).  This stuff used for anything?<br />
<br />
Sorry if I'm rubbing some the wrong way for charging on the meats, one shaman was going to offer me 5pp per stack, I'm pretty sure that I could get better at a vendor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The meats usually sell pretty well in the bazaar.  So do the bloods.  I think the last blood I sold was Froglok and it went for 150pp.<br />
<br />
The bloods are usually used in tempers for smithing and maybe some other stuff.</div></div><hr />

Meat - Depends on type. I would suggest that you just look at you competition, let that be your guide.<br />
<br />
Blood - You can actually get quite a pretty penny with blood as it is used quite a bit in Smithing. Here again the prices vary quite a bit and you should look at what others are charging.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Durdend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ok, that makes sense, but the other night I saw someone selling an Iksar blood for 1.5kpp - they had only one so I thought they were on the EXTREME high end of the scale.  I can't acutally believe soem of this stuff would sell for that much (or I could be lucky - I got 7 Iksar Bloods).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I try to sell that kind of stuff cheap. The more you charge for the components the more you are going to pay for the end product.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">OK.  Firstly, the meat is to make illusion potions with alchemy.  Secondly, a recent change gives you the base factions of the race while yer in that illusion.  Therefore, people want those potions to complete quests without the need for a chanter, as well to have just plain fun.  They sell pretty good in the Bazaar.<br />
<br />
For instance, the Iksar illusion is good if you're doing the VP key quest, otherwise you need a chanter....  The one meat that I NEVER see sold in the bazaar is Vah Shir.  I usually get mine from Shadow Thicket, off the beeg leezards there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Genine Goosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The reason that the Iksar blood was so expensive is because it is used, and seems to be the rarest of the bloods needed, in the smithing of Tae Ew gear. Iksar usually sells for around 1,500pp on Karana server as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Iksar blood is woth 800-2kpp on my server, nice little earner.</div></div><hr />

I thought that was Tae Ew blood ...<br />

Tae Ew Chain Armor only require Tae Ew Blood.<br />
<br />
However, the shield and weapons require a temper.  This temper is made from Tae Ew Blood, Iksar Blood and Froglok Blood, IIRC.<br />
<br />
Tae Ew Plate Armor and Lae Ew Leather armor also require additional bloods beyond Tae Ew, but I haven't looked into them recently and don't remember the recipe.<br />

<br />
...soooooo, you're saying I should stop destroying the iksar and froglok blood that I get in Sebilis?<br />
<br />
@%&amp;#!<br />
<br />
It's so hard to keep track of all the items in the game and know which are valuable for quests/tradeskills, which are good vendor fodder, and which should meet the destroy button.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Quinner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Froglok blood is as common as dirt if you know which vendors to mine. I wouldn't price it at much more than 50pp. Iksar blood, on the other had, seems to be harder to come by so it will go for much more. <br />
<br />
The important thing to remember is to not get ticked off at the Tradeskiller who wants 5K for a item when you charged him 4.5k for all of the components to make it.<br />
<br />
(I had someone who regularly sells superb rockhopper hides for 150pp and Small Pieces of Acrylia for 50pp each balk at my price of 1k for an Acrylia Studded Cloak. He said it was only worth 300pp at the most and he was doing me a favor even paying that much. If I bought my materials from him the cloak would have cost 750 to make....)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Dasgood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">omg .. i normally throw this stuff away ... is there a list of stuff that I should keep?  I remember one somewhere .. hrmm</div></div><hr />

no wonder the 2 I sold for 10p each got taken so quick  :D</div></div><hr />
