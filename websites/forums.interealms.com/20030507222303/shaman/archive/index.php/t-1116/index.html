<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>JukaTZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've always lurked around these boards but need help now.  I follow Iksar.org's quest deal for the Cudgel.  Here's the question:<br />
On the 5th cudgel, youre supposed to combine the ton totem pieces ... with what?  8(  Crusader Quarg had given a chest to combine the Tiny G Skulls, which i did, which became C.O.R.N, &amp; i handed it in to Mystic Dovan.  Well he didnt give me a new chest.   Iksar.org says to just combine the totem pieces ...  but even in their text, which i saw too from the quest npc's, there's nothing about any new chest given after Cudgel 4 for 5.<br />
I've tried saying a bunch of stuff to Dovan, ie Skulls of this or that, etc, but no chest given.  Where'd I mess up &amp; what in the world am I gonna combine my totem pieces with?  Thanks much!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jilariz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You combine them with Mendglow Clay in a Pottery wheel.  I'd recommend taking 30 minutes to work your pottery skill to master+ level (took me 25 minutes to get to 122skill..crazy easy).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Heelah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Jilariz has got it nailed...3 pieces of totem and mendglow clay forraged from BW in a pottery wheel will make the 2nd key.<br />
then turn in the 2 keys and the caponic to the guy in the outpost for the skull...easy as pie</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>JukaTZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ahh, thanks much. I've arldy got all the stuff, I'm off to hit the ol pottery wheel again, appreciate it! Jukasaza</div></div><hr />
