AGI adds to AC, while they are still squishy it can't hurt.<br />
<br />
Dex... well some casters thinks it increases their chances to get a crit spell cast.  Personally I've never tested it, but wizards in my guild swear by it (well did at one time, either they have max dex now or don't bother asking me anymore).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wontonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">INT casters ask STR/DEX/AGI/STA/CHA from me sometimes.<br />
<br />
Cleric ask me for STR/DEX/AGI/STA all the time. The don't want focus thou.<br />
<br />
Reason for INT caster ask for Dex buff is higher Dex give them a better chance to channel thur during hit. Some people say it's still ture, some say this had been changed. I don't care, if this might give the chanter an extra edge to get it's stun off when the golem hitting on her. Why not?<br />
<br />
INT caster ask for STA/AGI sometimes too. AGI increase their chance to dodge a hit, which can mean live or dead to them. STA isn't that important to them. But rather than waste my breath argue with them, I usually just cast.<br />
<br />
Cleric don't want focus cause it won't stack with their self mana regen buff, but they do want Str/Dex if they want to melee. Especially when Dex help their hammer to proc more often, I mean the one they wielding, not the summoned hammer pet.<br />
<br />
Now, we're shaman. We're famous because of our buffs(some say it's the slow, some say it's the dot, some say people love us cause we're the cute little coke bear. Ok let's just say it's a little of all.  :cool: ). If buffing other people bother you that much maybe you shall change your profession.  ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well that's another story. Tell them to read the raid rule or guideline. If your raiding body don't have one, I'm sure there're at least a hundred other guideline out there to tell people when to ask buff and when NOT to ask for them.<br />
<br />
Unless it's the buffs on MT failing, I usually don't buff anymore when the puller is at work. We'll need all the mana for healing and debuffing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Alyss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Stamina, Focus (missed if cleric), Spirit of Billy if outdoors.  The value of agility is debatable, and it's pretty minimal if it's helpful at all (which I doubt).  The rest is worthless.  Clerics tend to shut up after I Ferine Avatar them, which is nice.  I'm sick of idiots who lack basic game knowlege asking for buffs which won't benefit them at all and waste time we could be making things dead in.<br />
<br />
Edit:  How to say no?  Easy &quot;No, it's a waste of time buffing dex/agi/cha.  If you can prove it's not a waste of time then please show me the parse and analysis.&quot;  If they don't like it they can find another group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">As far as Clerics wanting STR/DEX, I give Fo7 and Daiku.  If they want to click off Fo7 because it screws up their mana regen, then they shouldn't be melee'ing.  We all have jobs to do in group, and if you want to try something more, you'd either better be able to do your regular job too or be able to add something SIGNIFICANT.  Cleric DPS during melee isn't significant.  Therefore, they better not expect me to go searching far into my spellbook so they can do something that's fun but slows the EXP  down.<br />
<br />
what's next, the wizzies want to melee?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Enkebesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Agi gets increasingly important with avoidance AAs (CA/LR), which more and more casters have nowadays. And dont get me started on the &quot;If agi pushes somebody over a 50ac mark&quot; issue. Do you ask everybody in your groups exactly what AC they have? Easier to cast group agi then.<br />
<br />
I know I would kick a Shaman who tells me he is to lazy to buff with my warrior, better get a Bst to slow then, they at least do some damage!<br />
Next time a Cleric who doesnt want to heal wants to leech xp, I guess...</div></div><hr />

Sta for all Agi for all<br />

<br />
I find it doesn't cost memuch mana or time to do all sta and agi.  But if we're interested in moving in fast or I come in LoM it waits as its more important to me to have the HoS done and be able to back up heal and slow.  More often than not I'm the only healer eheh in which case your gonna get the the extra buffs when my mana is in the safe zone. :)<br />
<br />
As far as dex for other than tankish types. . eheh. . . Only if I'm in a single group never in a raid situation.  And wmp , better known as when I get around to it lol<br />

Yup, got those type of INT caster too (mage if I remember correctly). Give them a procing weeapon with some nuke on it and they go melee all over (even if it's a 150 DD proc).<br />
<br />
So long<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I don't cast agi simply because 1 nuke would have more of an effect than that agi buff, so I cast the nuke instead =)<br />
<br />
Seriously though, on raids my standard buff lineup leaves me with 2 buff slots open, theres a lot of good buffs out there, and many of them do FAR more than agi/str/dex ever will.  As far as XP groups go, its simply more wasted time and mana when I need to rebuff the group, if clerics want stats to go with Baotr/AoZ thats fine, they get IoS.<br />
<br />
I'm hardly lazy, my group is pretty much guaranteed to have Ferine Avatar up constantly, its just that I don't cast buffs that are not actually worth casting.</div></div><hr />

Its not lazy, its called &quot;Mana efficancy&quot;.<br />
<br />
What is better, keep pulling a mobs, or pulling a Raid mob 60 seconds sooner when racing for it, or making sure that the wizard and cleric that arrived late to the raid/group has agi and str and dex ( and the cleric refuses FoS).</div></div><hr />

DEX never helped channeling, here (http://eq.crgaming.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=607)  is some information from GZ in 1999.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Jenina Icemyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">As someone mentioned, clerics refuse focus because it doesn't stack with our self buff.  Not sure if some people realize what the cleric self buff does... would you expect your cleric to take off a FT item?  Clerics can't regen mana like a shaman can we need any mana regen we can get.  For those who don't know (I realize a lot here do know), here is what the self buff clerics refuse focus for is:<br />
<br />
Blessed Armor of the Risen - level 58  <br />
Slot Description <br />
1:  Increase Max Hitpoints by 294 (L58) to 300 (L60) <br />
2:  Increase AC by 30 <br />
3:  Increase HP when cast by 294 (L58) to 300 (L60) <br />
4:  Increase Mana by 6 per tick  <br />
<br />
or <br />
<br />
Armor of the Zealot - level 65  <br />
Slot Description <br />
1:  Increase Max Hitpoints by 450 <br />
2:  Increase AC by 36 <br />
3:  Increase HP when cast by 450 <br />
4:  Increase Mana by 8 per tick  <br />
 <br />
As to dex being a waste in an experience group, I disagree.  I can do more damage with my hammer than I can nuking (cleric nukes are a joke) and when I'm doing it with the hammer I'm staying full mana so that I'm ready to deal with any emergencies that come up.  I've spent 15aa so far on making sure that I can do as much dps as possible because I don't like being an xp leech and with the 63 hammer and dex buff (and IoS when I'm lucky) and the crit aa (makes hammer procs crit as well as nukes) I can make a difference.  I'm certainly not going to do more damage than other class but I can at least do more than sit on my butt casting CH once or twice a fight.  <br />
<br />
I realize single buffs are a pain and dex doesn't last as long as focus.  But as a cleric I deal with that every time someone wants symbol instead of virtue.  I have to cast it twice as often because of duration so that they can use the druid buff and get the mana regen.  Druids will always use thier own buff and usually any int caster in the group will as well.  Since dex doesn't cost a regent, I really don't have a lot of sympathy as long as the cleric realizes that the dex buff comes after you catch up on mana from the rest of the buffs.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Not sure everyone realizes, when I say damage with hammer I'm talking about procs.  I do about 90% of the damage I do with procs which is why dex is so important.  I can't hit the broad side of a dragon half the time (you all know what priest melee is like and shaman caps are higher than cleric) but can proc on a miss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">If someone asks for a buff when we are not pulling and I can spare the time/mana they get it. I have a good idea what each person in my guild wants for buffs now so I usually just dish it all out without them having to ask for it. I always sta the casters. More HPs never hurt anyone, especially against aoe mobs. I get everyone from druids to warriors asking for a primal essence, and they get it but I would kill for a group PE that I could /tgb. I have wizards that will sometimes ask for a dex buff saying that is SEEMS to make them crit more but they won't ask if I am busy or we are in a hurry. I don't cast group agi anymore but will cast it on an individual if they ask but they usually don't. I don't mind a cleric asking for a dex buff in an exp group as long as they keep healing. If we are in a nice steady exp group and the cleric whips that hammer out and asks for a dex buff, I usually just Avatar them.<br />
<br />
On raids I always do a /rsay Last Call For Shaman Buffs then after a bit /rsay Shaman Buff Shop Closed. They know better (or quickly learn) to not ask after that.<br />
<br />
If we are in a hurry and need to move fast then all anyone gets is MGB focus and group sta.<br />
<br />
I have a raid buffing guide post on my guild's forums, what each buff does, how I do my buffs, when to ask, when not to ask etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Wordan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Stamina helps casters a lot more than it does melees. Why? Because melees generally have higher base stamina so they get diminishing returns the higher it gets. Granted, they may actually use the benefits more, but it helps them less.<br />
<br />
How much time and mana are you losing by casting AGI and DEX? 4 or 5 mobs worth? More like 1/8th of one mob worth. One nuke worth really isn't gonna make the mob die any faster. And here I thought shaman were a mana regen class. I hear people brag 'oh we were chain pulling and I never went below 80 mana' - and in the next breath complain about having to throw a potentially frivolous buff on someone. Meanwhile nobody complains about you going afk to pee because THINK OF ALL THE TIME WE'RE LOSING. Monk has to split a mob? HURRY BECAUSE I DIDN'T CAST AGI TO SAVE THESE PRECIOUS SECONDS. Get real.<br />
<br />
If you dislike buffing, why on earth are you playing a buff class?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I usually treat clerics as a &quot;special&quot; case. I love virtue, so if they want me to dig in the book and find a dex/str buff, I'll do it, as long as they are a bit patient. hehe.. I usually just warn them it'll take a second to find it, as I haven't used a pure str/dex buff in ages. ;) My biggest problem with buff requests is people being pushy. All I ask for is someone to ask ONCE. If I'm busy, I inform them I'm currently busy and will get them asap. Getting follow-up requests every 20-30 seconds after that really irks me. I guess I'm becoming a grumpy old shaman. :)<br />
<br />
Oh yeah! Back to the topic. Once you start getting the group buffs, life becomes easier. Group sta/agi and focus are sooooooo nice. The temporary reversion to single target buffs post-60 was the hardest thing so far for me to deal with in PoP. All that levelling to get group buffs and then back to single target boar/fosouls. Arrrggg.. Well, at least it was motivation to level to 65. Now I just need MGB (not far now). Passing fo7 around to 7+ groups is painful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Passing fo7 around to 7+ groups is painful.<br />
<br />
You think THAT'S painful?  How about having MGB,FoA and FoS, but not Fo7?  I'd MGB FoA, get bitched out by the clerics in /gu for focusing them and then 20 tells for FoS because it's better than FoA.  I finally had to publish guild buffing guidelines saying exactly WHO I was going to say yes to, and make sure the other bears abided by the policy.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Kraegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">OK - The situation I am complaining about is when I am exp grouping - (mid 50's teir 1 planes) - the pulls are coming in fairly steady - the int caster has not been TOUCHED by a mob hardly all night - and I am not close to full mana.  If I am not close to full mana I have to Canni (not being lazy here) - How can I cast canni if I have to cast useless stat buffs that I don't even cast on my monk most of the time when I 2 box duo?  I am constanly casting when I am grouped.  With me its more about casting time effeciency than mana effeciency it seems.  When I constantly have a more necessary spell I need to be casting - how do i justify giving melee buffs to INT casters?  If I am not slowing / malosi ing / doting / nuking / jbbing / hasting / buffing melee's / etc I am canning ... when do i toss useless buffs to casters?  Its not laziness ... trust me ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">ATTENTION WHINEY SHAMAN: <br />
<br />
You're shaman.  No more whining about mana unless YOU are the only  healer, only haster, AND only crowd control in your group.  Yes, even you guys without Torpor and/or the Cann AA can just suck it up a little and cast those single-target low-mana spells to make your group that much better.  <br />
<br />
To a one of you, if you had to juggle your buffs a little in order to use a buff like Blessed Armor, you'd do it.  So no more &quot;I dooonn't have maaannaaa.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />
<br />
The rest of you guys -- the ones just going along merrily -- please continue.<br />
<br />
The only &quot;I don't wanna&quot; posts that hold true merit are the mid-raid-and-I'm-busy and the we're-non-stop-pulling posts.  Both are valid -- because they're about time, not mana pool.  Even hard pressed I've always been able to swap in a buff or two.  It may be a few minutes down the road, but I'll do it.  The mob won't kill anybody because you've spent 3 ticks memming and casting spells instead of JBBing.  If it takes your JBB to turn the tide of battle in a full group... /shudder<br />
<br />
I generally warn my group 'fore I do Khura's Focusing.  I also as a matter of habit put single-target Str and Dex on the cleric.  Now that I finally have Infusion, they get that as well.  Our buffs are often worth more for their perceived value than their actual value -- but let's just keep that perception rolling, shall we? If we don't or the guys whining will be (and have been) whining that &quot;nobody wants a shaman.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>zolexa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I may be missing something here, but why not just throw a IoS on the casters/cleric.  It stacks with their self buffs, and has sta/str/dex in it so gives them a nice happy feeling of buffage.  You can do this when you are doing the group's buffage for HoS/Focus/etc...thus not cutting into mid-pull buffs.  <br />
<br />
While I myself would refuse to stop and buff mid-raid/pull ect, during the general concensus downtime or before beginning doesn't seem like much an issue.  To me what's an extra push of the canny button or 2 as opposed to the time you would spend argueing with said caster?  If it gets to be too much of a burden on your mana, just inform the group/raid that they can't pull yet because you had to spend that extra few points of mana giving said buff to the cleric/caster.  Would be interesting to see their reactions...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Eriadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Well, I play a 64 wiz as my main, and I never even have to ask for those buffs.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Quinner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">They ask for the buffs because the file that describes the effect that stats have on gameplay is classified so secret that nobody currently employed at SOE has the clearance to view the file. Apparently those that did were &quot;liquidated&quot; for having such knowledge.<br />
<br />
If it keeps em happy, buff em up with what they want if the mana is there. If it's not........then use the same rules you use for anybody on a raid when a buff fails, usually order of importance.<br />
<br />
Also, the code is so screwy at this point one never knows what effect a stat may have on gameplay. There are some who will argue that Dex affects fizzle rates and others who vehemently deny it. The kicker is that both sides might be right based on the data gathered in that specific instance.<br />
<br />
I have a Vah Shir Beastlord that fizzled all the time, base dex only. I raised it 20 points with items and his fizzle rate went down. I don't care if the 2 are connected or it is all just in my mind. I got the end result that I desired.</div></div><hr />

if you really want to be all scientific like a lot of shaman try to be ( and eq players in general).. then hey let me show you a ss of efflicition efficiency working ok my turgurs!!! 1999 is 4 years ago.. if it's not since the last patch I don't believe it.. and if it is since the last patch I want to see some hard data!! until then I fos everyone.. if the cleric is sitting on HER butt :) then she gets fos too.. ft8?? you sitting on your ass and you don't have enough mana? <br />
<br />
and is it just me or do most shaman burn their mana nuking mobs that are not resistant to poision and ice? and the melee is soo sorry that the shaman dps is showing significant effects? in guild bot groups that I join the puller is getting #2 while mob is at 8% and I can barely keep FA and haste on everyone with VOQ on me.. canniing + ft3.. maybe I'm doing something wrong, but the xp sure is good =]</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">EDIT: Not sure everyone realizes, when I say damage with hammer I'm talking about procs.  I do about 90% of the damage I do with procs which is why dex is so important.  I can't hit the broad side of a dragon half the time (you all know what priest melee is like and shaman caps are higher than cleric) but can proc on a miss.<br />
<br />
YOU ARE A LIAR!!! shaman caps are not higher than a priest.. I hit for 1 or 12, sometimes I SMASH crush? for 40s.. I want to see some data!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">My standard buff procedure is <br />
1. get virtue<br />
2. cast fo7, can5, quint, boar, wrulan, diaku, acumen<br />
3. /g gtg<br />
<br />
then I take special requests ;)<br />
<br />
(I found the order of steps does matter, sometimes when I do 2 a) before 1 ) virtue turns out to be center)</div></div><hr />

Shamanic weapon skill caps are at 200.<br />
Clerical weapon skill caps are 175, bash is somewhere 165ish from some sources, 180ish from others.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Zanithar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Thank god I play my own shaman now ... people often ask me why ... I suppose it would be easier to link them to this thread than to explain it to them.<br />
<br />
1. I am an enchanter and the shaman charisma buff is 5 more than mine.  Yes ... enchanters use charisma.  Oddly other classes do as well, ever hear of a spell called Divine Intervention?<br />
2. If you think that stamina is not useful to an int caster or that most int casters have their stamina maxed then see my initial statement.<br />
<br />
It is painful to see shaman complaining about buffing and tossing out lack of mana as an excuse.  It is REALLY painful to find there are shaman out there that do not believe Stamina is useful to an int caster.<br />
<br />
Now I do not generally bother casting Dex/Agi/Str on myself ... I might actually do it if I had the buff slots available :)  I cast Primal Essense on anyone that I am not casting Ferine Avatar on.<br />
<br />
Hell I even haste clerics when they ask because quite frankly they have a BORING unfun job, if they want to melee with their hammer I am more than happy to make their lives a little more tolerable with Haste and Ferine Avatar.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Personally I cast 2 buffs usually. Group focus and group sta. Occationally I'll throw in group acumen. I don't think i've ever cast group daku or group agility tho. An occational single target daku or agility but never the group ones.<br />
<br />
Agility IMO is a waste of a buff slot and 99% of the time i'll tell anyone who asks for it i'm busy what ever and then just forget they asked for it.<br />
<br />
As far as clerics go if they want dex they can keep the group focus with everyone else. If things are going well enough that they can melee the mana regen loss from thier self buff shouldn't be an issue. If it's a raid we mgb 7, 9 and symbol as a standard anyway so clerics don't even use their self buff.<br />
<br />
Nice thing is my guild is educated enough to understand that agility doesn't do much and accept that shaman are typically very busy and don't bug our shaman with these types of requests. We also had GUILD rules stating that the raid would be buffed with Group buffs only, usually mgbed. Better single target buffs would be reserved for a select few, pullers, mt's etc. We would not single target buff the entire raid. Luckily we've got pleanty of the new group buffs now so it isn't really an issue anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyhow, the key point is...most of the raid didn't know they'd be short on buff slots till someone said something.  An enchanter didn't know until rune wouldn't hold (course he was running the show so he was busy).  They trust that the boys and myself will only take 2 slots, 3 if resists are needed just as I trust the cleric isn't throwing ac buffs on me and so forth.<br />
<br />
Of course...I might be just slightly more growly than your average bear :p</div></div><hr />

But, I hope the Shaman saying No, I wil not buff you remember it when the Chanter says no Crack, you can just canni, or the Cleric says no HP buff for you, your not a tank you don't need it. Maybe the Warrior will say, I do not need to taunt, Manage your own aggro. You have buffs, and refusing to cast them on your group means that you may not be doing the best you can for them. Maybe they help, maybe they do not, but refusing makes us all look bad.</div></div><hr />

On clerics and int casters using their own shield IoS is awesome. It give the str and dex that focus would + more sta that stacks with normal boar.<br />
<br />
As far as AGI I hate to cast it and I'm slowly getting people in my guild to understand how useless it is as a buff, but as long as people ask for it I'll cast it. Easier to mem a spell and cast it then argue. <br />

<br />
With scrm and 8th shawl the only real buffs to keep up are sltw and FA.  I can keep 5 people in the grp with FA on all the time ( I keep votb on myself).<br />

<br />
I know I would kick a Shaman who tells me he is to lazy to buff with my warrior, better get a Bst to slow then, they at least do some damage!<br />
Next time a Cleric who doesnt want to heal wants to leech xp, I guess...<br />

It's almost never a mana issue, it's a time issue that we are in a hurry and don't have time to wait on me to dig around in my spellbook so I can give caster_02 dex or the like. And trust me when you get in large raids, not only does giving all those random people primal essence not make or break the raid, some of those people could leave entirely and it wouldn't matter. And if you think that Shamans should just shut up and buff because that's their job, you are really defining yourself too narrowly and missing out on what a Shaman can really do.</div></div><hr />

We are shaman our job is to cast slow on mobs, and to give out buffs. If somone wants a buff give it to them. If it's a buff you havn't given out in a long time just let them know it will take a minute to find it and blow the dust off the spell.  If your in the middle of buffing the raid, inform them it will be a few mins but you will get them as soon as possible.<br />

You are missing your own point.<br />
<br />
You are telling ME how to play my character.<br />
<br />
I say no to buffing all the time.  I know what my spells do, and I decide when to cast them and on whom.  I have been casting them many times a day for several years now.  If I would rather be casting something else instead of buffing you, I will.  Dont like it? Leave.<br />
<br />
I'm not inflexable, I just dont like being told what to do.  If I can do something for someone, I will probably do it when I have the time.  But if it isnt critical to our survival, its not a priority.  Being pushy or whiney wont change anything.<br />
<br />
Buffing is not my job.  I dont get asked to join groups based on my ability to cast agility buffs....  Its not my massive agility score that allows me to solo dangerous mobs.  Buffing is something that I can do, but its not what I am.</div></div><hr />

Funny you say telling people how to play their char is the biggest complaint then you go on to tell us how we should play our Shaman. Give out whatever buffs you want, and I will give out the buffs I know are needed and let's just say we have a different style of play.

All I ask for is someone to ask ONCE. If I'm busy, I inform them I'm currently busy and will get them asap. Getting follow-up requests every 20-30 seconds after that really irks me.

If you think being a cleric is fun, make one and try and see how far you get! Don't PL it, work your way up and see how fun it is to have every mob in the game attack you when you heal the tank or casters, get killed when you can't run from one zone to the next without pulling trains and can't even kill greens without the add's of more greens killing you. Yes we get plate and good loot, but we die alot. Go ask any raiding cleric how many times they die a night! The only thing that makes being a cleric fun is seeing the crit heals I cast take a caster from 10% life to full in one fast heal or the tank pulling 3 mobs and live to see the xp from them! That is the life of a cleric, try it, lots of clerics stop playing by the time they hit 40's to 50's. How many of you have twink clerics that never got out of the 30's? To hard to play, no, cleric is eazy if you don't mind the boarding life!<br />
I don't think I have ever asked for agi but I did and have asked for dex, it makes me proc more, and you want to hear request for bad buffs when there is a chanter in the group and I get asked for RM when he can do GoD!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">Delete agi from your spell book, if you are low lvl dont even purchase the ****ing spells.<br />
<br />
if your agi&gt;75 you are gtg<br />
if your agi&gt;100 you are already getting 95% of the ac your agi is going to give you.<br />
agi has NO ****ING EFFECT ON DODGE, PARRY, BLOCK, OR CHANNELING. NONE nadda, zero, zipp. the agi score is pure 100% ac bonus and its truly a LAME bonus. agi and dex should have been one and the same stat on release.<br />
go ahead, try it out, crippple yourself while naked and buffless, note your ac and agi. now notice what happens when you hit 75 agi, there is a pretty large leap in ac, and up to 100 (or very close to it) you gain ac at a rate that is almost decent. between 100 and 305 your ac will go up less than 30 points. and for a CASTER that ac wont do the slightest littlest tiniest bit to save their ass. <br />
the only reason I even have the group agi is cause it came with a turn in and since I play on a zek I have a need to filll all 15 buff slots and I had a charm that had better resists based on my dex and agi...now that I got rid of that charm I use spirit sight as the junk buff in that slot.<br />
<br />
dex is a slight increase in procc rate for a huge increase in dex. <br />
<br />
since everyone gets Focus/Sta I will usually toss Diaku in there as well if the group has melees. <br />
haste...get your ornate Bp and you will never cry about haste again.<br />
<br />
sorry few things make me crazy like melees asking me for buffs that have a .00000000001% on the game. I used to play a rogue main. I have seen the parses, the warrior board (steelwarriors?) is probably the place to find this info. <br />
<br />
now the only time I bust out agi is when some poor lowbie needs buffs and I have the time. its funny how exited people get when they have 255 as the first 4 stats. of course now that this thread has got me all riled up I will probably hunt it down and delete it.<br />
<br />
<br />
its kinda like the paly I was grouped with that kept asking for tribunal, we were in an exp grind, nothing we were fighting was casting spells at all, let alone pr/dr based. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>tunes77</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">I always do group focus first.  I announce to group that anyone that doesn't want ti step back.  The group sta.  Then canni5/Q and then I do gorup Diaku.  Why Diaku?  I'm not in a raiding guild so many of the melee's aren't totally capped str/dex from focus all the time and often the main looter in groups ends up being a necro so the extra str helps them there.  I don't do group agi unless requested as usually half will have to click it off to leave room for heal over time (either Q or from a cleric) and necro group lifetap over time (Zvefeer's... sp?).  I then IoS the cleric and any casters that didn't want Focus.  For spending a peridot on me (even tho I always have a stack to supply the dot if they would like) for virtue I'll be happy to give clerics whatever buff they want.  On LDoN runs with a cleric, often times the cleric melee's with their proc'ing hammer because after I slow healing isn't much needed.  Especially if there's a necro using Zvefeer's.  And yes they do more dmg that we could do nuking ;)  Often I heal so the cleric can have some fun melee'ing on single pulls.  But then in guild groups we do odd things for fun all the time.  Guild groups rule afterall.</div></div><hr />

the biggest question is Dex...generally...depends on who I am playing with...but if its a cleric sure buff the dex...improves their proc rate.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Gnofr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">I am quite impressed.  This thread demonstrates a lot about the relationships between Shaman and other classes.<br />
<br />
I've been thinking about why there's such strong animosity toward the suggestions that our class need improvement.  While there are clearly lots of different reasons, one is that we are our own worst enemy.<br />
<br />
I too value good mana management.  I appreciate the benefits brought by efficiency.  I appreciate folks not wanting to waste resources and time on things that serve no purpose.  Clearly, buffing people with no real effect for years would be frustrating and boring.  I respect and applaud those people who achieve a superior knowledge of exactly what makes a significant quantitative difference in the outcome of each encounter.  I recognize that EQ is fundamentally a social game. I suspect that people's relationships are primarily based upon perceptions rather than cold calculations.  <br />
<br />
Perhaps camaraderie, compassion and companionship are counter-productive in conducting a smoothly efficient raid.  Perhaps demonstrating one's certain understanding of the (unpublished) underlaying mathematical model has greater beneficial consequences than polite and civil cooperation with a cleric.  Perhaps laying down the law about who we will buff with what and when fosters respect and builds teamwork.  Perhaps our perceptions of our fellow players' ignorance and stupidity regarding what really matters are reflected in our speech and behavior.  Perhaps we are likewise perceived accordingly.<br />
<br />
What about that Cleric who we decided the raid could do without since he was bored and wanted to max out his dex and mele/proc a bit?  Perhaps he consequently decided that the raid would be better off without our attitude and so was just a tad late with that heal...  Or never quite had time to answer our request for a rez...  Or suggested that maybe the group should try a Beastlord instead this time, or at least a different Shaman...  Or objected to SOE when we asked for class improvements.  Stupid Cleric!  If you don't play my class, at my level, my way ****!<br />
<br />
Personally, I got IoS first chance I could.<br />
<br />
There were lots of other good reasons, but with attitudes like ours it's no wonder Beastlords got slow.<br />

Anyway, back to the subject at hand, when I play a shaman (or any other buffing class), I don't mind buffing whatever the person wants.  One thing that bothers me is when someone asks for a buff, I try to buff them, and it doesn't stick because (a) they have something better or (b) they are out of buff slots.<br />
<br />
Another thing that bothers me:  when I buff someone and then right after I buff them, they ask me for that buff.  I usually recast, but I have to wonder if (a) I ran into the bug where a buff will wear off when you recast it just as it fades or (b) they're too ignorant to realize I refreshed their buff before they asked.  I think 90% of the time it's (b), but the 10% of the time that it's (a) makes me recast it anyway.</div></div><hr />

I always CHR buff charmers (BRD, ENC, and occasionally a MAG) and cast IoS on Clerics unless we're using Bot9/Pot9.  Everyone else gets Fo7.  WIth SCRM and Shawl 8 I have to do that maybe once every hour or so and with our natural regen abilities dowtime is MAYBE a minute before I've got enough mana to keep going.<br />
<br />
I could maybe see someone who didn't have the group versions of our buffs complaining that it's a lot of casts to do a whole group, but once you get the group versions why not?</div></div><hr />

Then I sit down, load a TOK-IOS spellset, and buff the cleric (my guild cleric I do without her asking, because I know she likes her mana buff. Other clerics, I'll gladly do it if they ask politely.) The tank (and the beastlord I'm usually with) get Strength of the Diaku unless he specifically says his strength is already maxxed. If someone wants a bit of extra charisma, hell sure, it costs hardly any mana. Haste? Sure. Regen? No problem, let me load it. Resists? Yeap, let me find them. <br />
<br />
All I ask, LDON or otherwise, is a moment to cast puppy, buff him and give him his toys. That's it. I don't care if you're an INT caster, a WIS caster, a beastlord, or someone with horribly dyed armor. I will buff you because I want the group to succeed, and to me our buffs are a BIG part of helping the group. <br />

STA for INT Casters who are near 255 STA unbuffed is worthless.<br />

I rather cast one single extra nuke and get far better return for my mana spent than having stat buffed a caster who gets ZERO benefit from those stat buffs. And no, that extra 4 AC gained from the best AGI buff means jack when a mob is tripling for 900+ (aka Elemental Planes yardtrash).<br />

- Yes, let me AGI buff your sorry arse for a huge increase of defensive efficency of 0.00000001%. On the other hand if we are a buffing class, what is a cleric? God Jr? Or how about an enchanter? God Jr II? Shaman buffs SUCK compared to other classes. Virtue, Protection of the Nine, Vallon's Quickening, Voice of Quellious, Ferocity, Spiritual Dominion, Armor of the Zealot, Arcane Rune, Rune of Zeboxusomething, that druid self mana regen buff, Kazaad, own every single buff a shaman has. We have two useful buffs: Focus line and Ferine Avatar and to a certain extent STA line. But even these three shaman buffs are eclipsed by far superior buffs other classes have. Stop calling shaman a buff class, it's like calling a ranger a tank class.</div></div><hr />

We have several pages of buffs in our book for a reason. I figure it's to help folks. I cast them. We're not the best buffing class by far, I suppose.

It still doesn't change the fact that most stat buffs are utter crap, not to mention at a certain level of gear, they are simply useless. If you want to help folks, educate them so that they know how crap our stat buffs are, and maybe they'll realize that if you throw one extra nuke it's far better than giving a caster a stat buff. <br />
<br />
Everyone with his own playstyle I guess. First tell for a useless stat buff gets from me a simple short explanation that they suck and waste of mana. Second tell, you are guaranteed to have a spot on my ignore list.</div></div><hr />

I might say no if I have like really low mana or just tell them its coming when I have the mana to spare.<br />
I rarely turn people down for buffs, people are more likely to return the favor in one way or another.<br />
I joined a group in PoK the other day to get KEI and the chanter said he knew me, not from his current char but from his old rogue from like 3 years ago. Said I had helped him out in Cazic Thule by finishing off the Templar when someone was trying to KS it from him. When I killed it, it dropped Rubicite Greeves, said he never forgot that I did that. So he proceeded to buff me for free with his chanter, then logged his cleric in, ran it to PoK, and buffed me up with the cleric.<br />
That one time alone made every single buff or good deed I had done since release totally worth it.<br />
