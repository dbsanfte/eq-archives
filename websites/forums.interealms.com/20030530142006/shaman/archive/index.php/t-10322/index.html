<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>eq_newb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I really enjoy the roleplaying aspect of EQ. However, it seems I can not find any site that has some decent information, that has been updated since qt least 2001.  I've went to guild sites, sites such as this, and others, and it seems just about all of them need an update bad. The only thing that seems to work are the message boards. still odd though to have a site, and maintain only the message board, so the site looks crappy. For example, I went to a guild site, and in the message board was a note from the raid leader thanking everyone for their help in a raid a few nights ago. Yet the main page and most of the links from the main page contained info that hasnt been updated since March 2001.....makes no sense to me. So, basically, I'm looking for a good page that is updated somewhat frequently. thanks.</div></div><hr />
