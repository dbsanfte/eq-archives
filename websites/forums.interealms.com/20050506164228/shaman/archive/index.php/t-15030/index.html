<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>shamy60</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">hello,ornate chain gloves has a saryrn s venom effect,and can be up to 20 percent lower mana cost.<br />
<br />

Limit: Spell(Spear of Torment allowed)<br />
<br />
Decrease mana cost by 20 percent on Spear of Torment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">pretty frickin stupid no?<br />
<br />
Put a focus effect on an ornate piece that only applies to one spell, and a nuke at that?<br />
<br />
Geniuses on the dev team I tell ya...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thats the standard for all caster gloves. Even clerics, enchanters and necros get it on thier gloves too. It's a great focus for nukers like wizzy's and mages or even druids but really is kinda pointless for some of the other classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Spear of Torment, mana cost: 275.  275-275(.2) =220<br />
<br />
Max damage: 675<br />
Damage/mana = 3.068 damage per mana<br />
<br />
Velium Strike, mana cost: 300<br />
Max damage 925<br />
Damage/mana = 3.083 damage per mana<br />
<br />
So even with these gloves, and no mana preservation on velium strike, you get better damage for your mana on velium strike.  Thanks a lot SOE<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, with the 10% mana pres on ornate boots, which you can probably get if you've got the gloves take velium strike to 3.426 damage per mana, makes spear of torment absolutely completely useless unless ice won't land</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">plus, the cold-based improved damage item (Anger of E'ci), which is better percentage wise than Improved Damage 4 for velium strike is very easy/cheap to get.  For a final nail in the coffin for spear of torment.  <br />
<br />
I don't understand why the effect isn't for velium strike.<br />
The other classes get it for their best nuke.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hichar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Saryrn is the most ultimate crappiest god.  PoTorment blows, it crashes.  Therefore, any effect with her name will ultimatly blow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">alot of mobs are immune to cold, its helpfull</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">They should change it to Affliction Effenciency IV at the very least.  I rarely ever cast that spell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sure, some mobs are very cold resistant.. It's why they gave us those poison nuke in Velious. But this one is really sux. <br />
It costs less mana than the 54 poison nuke but it also does less damage. <br />
Dunno for ya Ceno, but I rarely go oom in a fight, even in Tier4 in time (not get to tier5 yet so I don't know hehe) against those #@@!!#@#! mana sucker god.<br />
I m maybe stupid, but when I need to do dmg, I don't care of the mana. <br />
All that matter for me is the damage. And the 54 poison nuke is fater and more damage.. For me there is no choice, my dps is better with the 54 nuke if I can't use Velium strike or rains.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Its not just about mana to damage efficiency, check out the cast time on spear of torment versus velium strike.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I wouldn't wear these gloves anyway.  Not good enuf statzorz over what I've already got.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Change the effect on the Scaled Avatar Gauntlets to Burning Affliction 4, and I would wear them. Its going to take something like that to get me to take off what I am wearing now. The current effect is useless to most shaman. We rarely, very rarely nuke. We do use our DoTs though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Pumyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Same effect on the Elemental gloves too and yes it's bog useless.<br />
Burning affliction would be appreciably less junk and would be more in line with the effect Wizards get (not that we are DPS based, but a completely pointless focus is a waste)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Wow, you guys are harsh...  :)<br />
<br />
My opinion is that these gloves are quite useful.  I wear them for the ac, sta, wis, hp, mana, and saves.  I happen to like the focus effect, since I prefer spear of torment to velium strike when I'm in fast groups (becasue it casts faster).<br />
<br />
Is it the most useful focus effect ever?  No.  It certainly adds something to my repetoire that wasn't there before, though, and I'm pretty happy about that.  <br />
<br />
I like having options.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sinjuneq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I have the elemental version of the gloves and IMO they rock. With SCM3 and SCF3, I can chain nuke Spear of Torment and crits are awesome for me. I do love Velium of Strike (I have the cloak of combustion (30%dmg to cold nukes), but it is resisted on some mobs and longer cast time.</div></div><hr />

Not sure how i became the target here, but ok ma'am whatever.  This thread is about how some people dont like the current foci effect on our gloves, not wich posion nuke to use.  Its a usefull foci, brings spear of torment down to almost the same mana/damage ratio as velium strike.  Our posion DDs have always been mana hogs.  Its inline with every other classes ornate/elemental gloves.  Should it be Burning affliction, No.  Should it be mana pres for Velium strike, Maybe.  Am i gonna miss this foci when i get new gloves, No.<br />
<br />
The lvl 54 nuke is great for that extra 5dps, using 30% more mana, and even has a higher fizzel rate.  To each his own.  Dps for a shaman really isnt an issue, yer NOT a waizzard Harry.  See how many casts you get from a full bar of mana from each nuke.  The mana savings is quiet noticeable.  For someone wanting faster nukes it strange to see you have no detrmental haste.  My spear of torment is 3.0 with foci and BoR, your blast of posion with bor is still 3.5.  Go for that belt when you can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Let me put it this way. Ornate Chain Glove Patterns are for sale in the Bazaar on my server. Serveral of them are up. I have more than enough plat to buy them. But as long as they have the focus effect they currently have, they are utterly useless to me.  The Gloves of Stability, that I got over 2 years ago in West ToV, are better for me than these would be.<br />
<br />
In groups, if I have the mana to nuke, I dot instead. On raids, I rarely have mana for much besides debuffing and rebuffing. On boss mobs, once its debuffed, if I am not involved in other things, I have found that in most cases, DoTs land better than nukes do. There are exceptions to that, but I wouldnt spend the kind of plat these gloves go for, just to use them 1% of the time.<br />
<br />
We are not wizards. The effect on our gloves should not be a nuke based effect.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Even stupider that an upgrade of the same effect is on elemental armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Clerics are not wizards either.  Neither are necromancers, enchanter, or druids.  They all have the same effect on their ornate gloves.  Not everything needs to be aimed at the primary ability of the class to be useful, and there is no way to please everyone at the same time.  There are some that are happy with this focus effect, some that are indifferent to it, and some that actively dislike it.  None of that is surprising. <br />
<br />
The bottom line is that we're not being persecuted here. It's not a universally hated effect that has been inflicted on us and noone else.  Its a standard cookie-cutter effect that they gave to all casting classes.  Could they have done a better job at choosing the effect?  Maybe.  Could they have done a worse job, or no job at all?  Sure.  The ornate gloves could have had *no* effect just as easily as having this effect.  I look at it as a nice bonus and leave it at that.</div></div><hr />
