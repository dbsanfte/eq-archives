<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sunash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was just wondering if it is worth it to dump cash into this skill or if I will just lose out in the end after its maxed? Im trying to figure out if there is a great need for some of the potions end game or if I should save my cash and not bother.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The viability of alchemy (which would be the subject of your post rather than &quot;quick question&quot;) is discussed about every other thread in this alchemy forum.<br />
<br />
There are many complaints because it's expensive to skill up alchemy to the high end, but there is little profit to be made there. If all you want is profit, skill up to 40 or 50 and make Blood of the Wolf (Sow) potions. If you want practicallity, skill up to 103 to be able to make Shrink (Ant's) and Invis to Undead (Unlife) potions. If you want to make gate potions for guildies, skill up to 180.</div></div><hr />
