<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>LifebaneSoulshadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm making a new shaman and am wondering which might be a better choice.  I want to be able to use the JBB later on in levels.  Troll regen is a big deal, but I'm torn with the ogre's no frontal stun race ability (seems like it would be a big deal when fighting later in levels).<br />
<br />
Weighing the other factors out and considering these two factors, advice please...<br />

Regen is nice and certainly wouldve helped early in the game but after reaching 60 I'm glad I chose to be a sexy OGUR. And grats on not choosing to be an ugly tiny cookie cutter barb :P</div></div><hr />

Pick ogres if you are the type that likes to laugh in the face of your opponents. I can't help but chuckle whenever they land a blow that shoulda stunned me and I just keep whacking away. for the Up Close and Personal touch be an Ogre. If you wanna be the long distance root n rot type be a troll only cause you can use the regeant symbol of innoruk. Once you start getting the regen line natural regen benefit is minimal. Nice to have but not needed. Plus Oggok is a party town!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Anomalos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Ogre baby.  Ogre is the ONLY race I know of that hasn't ever said &quot;I wish I could re-roll as.....&quot;.  That's proof enough.  You won't understand til you play an ogre into the 50's.</div></div><hr />

trollys get regen, kinda nice but at high levels even without torpor the 15 extra a tick is pretty measly.<br />
<br />
big sexy OGERS get more stamina which means MORE HP. and HP is YUMMY. the no-stun thing is kinda nice, although by level 45 i really haven't noticed the difference. But people say it helps a lot in the end game.<br />
<br />
the downside is that you will level a bit slower because of the hefty xp penalty (though this is not really a huge thing, imo -- i play about as much as most of my friends and tend to stay about the same level as they are). and you cannot snare (but there's a good thread on this board about how to deal with runners).<br />
<br />
but the most important thing: OGERS RULE! everyone else wishes they could be as cool as an OGER!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Can't say too much about the high levels but so far I've loved going Ogre. Meled up close and personal through every level and had a blast doing it. Shure, I might have leveled a bit faster as a Troll, but no way would I have had more fun along the way. :)</div></div><hr />
