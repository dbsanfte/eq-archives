<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I gotta say that the best group(s) that I have ever been in, are ones where pets do all the damage.<br />
<br />
Last night I was in a group in PoN, that consisted of me, two beastlords and three mages.<br />
<br />
It was amazing. Every character was below level 60, yet the amount of DPS that we were putting out was phenomenal. I got about 20 percent normal XP, in about an hour and a half. Which I think is amazing.<br />
<br />
Ok, so for most of it, I was tanking. But I love tanking:) To me it's a sport. And with Stoicisim I can easily keep my health topped up as well, as long as slow lands.<br />
<br />
Theres now also, a Pet group channel on Quellious, and I'm in it all the time.<br />
<br />
Pet groups are the best groups that I've ever been in:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Pet groups have inherent problems.  Firstly, the only CC they have is root.  Second, since nobody has FD or can invis themselves with their pets up, you WILL get adds.  Thirdly, there's no heavy healing/rezzing in the group.<br />
<br />
That being said, a full set of pets with Shammy HP and AC buffs and full Mage summoned weapons can do some SERIOUS DPS.  Plus, it's just plain fun!<br />
<br />
Note:  With pets, the closer you are, the more you aggro, so if you stop tanking, your puppy (since he attacks with snout and front paws) will gain the aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Note: With pets, the closer you are, the more you aggro, <br />
<br />
Not entirely.  You don't actually gain agro, the mobs are coded to 1)  Check the highest person on hate list.  If it's a pc, chase them down or summon.  If it's a pet:  a)  Look for any pc's in melee range.  If there is one, whack on them first (highest on agro list if multiple).  If no pc's in melee range, b)  go for highest pet on agro list.<br />
<br />
Beastlord pets make great tanks for this, because their procs are a ton of agro.  So you could stand in there and tank, even though the pet has 10x more agro then you.  As soon as you back out of melee range, the pet will take over tanking, because he has the most agro.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, enchanters get pets. Their summons suck, but charmed pets (or dire charmed) are usually awesome.  There's mez for you in a pet group.  And I believe necros can FD for a certain time period and the pet will remain.  Once they've stayed down for x time, then the pet poofs.  Don't quote me on that though, been a while since I remember seeing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Within my guild there is a regular group of a ranger and 3-4 magicians/necromancers who go to some place like OC in Valor and have the ranger pull, snare, and aggro kite while the pets chomp on the MOBs. They kill things surprisingly fast and don't need to worry about finding a tank, healer, or slower.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">was in loio with my necro way back and went fd afk while i had my pet up.  took about 5 min before the pet poofed.  you're correct jar</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is incorrect.<br />
<br />
The logic involved with (summoned) Pets and hate lists is even simpler than that.<br />
<br />
If #1 on the Hate list is a Summoned Pet, beat on #2 instead of #1. Even if #2 is also a Summoned Pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Guntar Ghostdancer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Root the mob and it will hit the closest regardless of pet or PC.  I can keep aggro from another tank if they are at max melle im in close and mob is rooted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It's not just the pets.  He was grouped with 3 mages.<br />
<br />
Mages are the most underappreciated class in EQ, bar none.  They can just slam out sick damage between their bolts and their pets and all the focus gimmicks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Hamenu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Very underappreciated. :) <br />
<br />
Pet centric groups work well with just about any class that doesn't need to tank. If you get stuck with a warrior, a mage can summon them some arrows and tell them to stay the heck out of melee range. They just slow things down.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It would probably work even better if you got a necro. Let the necro snare the mob and use the insane agro on poison DoT's (yours or the necro) to take the mob for a little run. Multiple pets and DoT's and these mobs drop very, very quickly. Done that in PoD and HoH and it's fun and efficient.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Hamenu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If you're going to go with aggro kiting, a mage is still the better bet. The 62 pet gets great DPS with its backstab ability. 2 bolts is usually enough to gain big aggro, just make sure your pets all have taunt turned off.<br />
<br />
As shown above, a mix of pet classes is a very solid way to go though. :)<br />

There have been a few other adventures like this one since then. Mainly because no other classes ever seem to want to go past Isle 5 in PoS. :/</div></div><hr />

<br />
Necros can mezz &quot;normal&quot; mobs up to lvl 55 and undead up to lvl 65. They can FD and it will take two minutes till pet poof while necro is still FD. With AA Skill Suspend Minion you can invis without destroy your pet. Pet Casters got good petheals in the last expansion and Necros have a 93% rezz.<br />
Stay out of melee range and the pets can hold agro very good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Fumeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">everything Zaral said and more. If youre tanking stop using Bane of Nife til late in the fight.  Stack those diseases.  I used to play with a mage (til he switched servers) and a necro.  We would rake in exp in PoS.  Its all about the aggro control.</div></div><hr />

This confused me, because from what I seen a mob will ALWAYS attack a PC, if one is in range, over a pet. Now, I haven't been in the situation too often where there are 2 pets and myself right there, but I did think that was the case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Nubok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Actually I have tried that my pet got agro, even though I was in melee range of the mob. This was due to low hp on the pet, I simply couldn't make the mop hit me untill the poor dog was dead :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Really? I usually hop in and take aggro when my pet is low on health and use that time in between the mobs attacks to get a heal off on him. The mob always attacks me regardless of how low my pets health is.<br />
<br />
As for full pet groups... ton of fun! I wanted to grind last week and get 60 so I called on a bunch of friends and we were all pet classes. (Minus the chanter who's gimp pet didn't do anything)<br />
<br />
We had two mages, two necros, the chanter and myself. It was really funny watching all these pets with chanter haste, swords and muzzles just whacking on the mobs. Looked like a blender.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>shamy60</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">when my pet(or any other pet) goes on enrage (very low hp) i jump at the mob and get the agro usually,even if the  pet are nearly dead and usually mobs goes at the one whit few hp to try to kill/finish them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>shorney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">When multiple pets are beating on a mob, its possible for a PC to go in aggro range WITHOUT getting aggro. Not sure why.<br />
<br />
I used to duo with my beastlord and another beastlord - sometimes one of us could melee while a pet tanks. If both of us went in aggro range, one of use would get aggro. Although sometimes this doesnt work /shrug.<br />
<br />
I havent tried getting a pet at low hp aggro with 2 PC's in range though to see what happens, but with 1 PC - the pet will still have aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Genine Goosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I always try to get pet groups going in my guild. Our average group is Me, Mage, Necro x2, BL, and Wizard. I just tell the BL to not go near the mobs and we're good to go. This way I have nobody to haste but my pet! Did I mention that I hate hasting? :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>glydor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I was in a pet group last night in HoH, doing agrro pet kiting. Three mages a necro me and a druid pulling. Mages made kits for all the pets and I buffed em all. Druid had no problem keeping aggro on himself. Constant pulls, barley used any mana, and some of the best exp ive gotten in a long time. I highly highly recomend them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Soulcraver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">First I'm a 65 mage and thank you for saying we're underappreciated.  I think so too at times. :) <br />
<br />
Try 5 mages all with the new air pet and a shammy.  First thing you'll notice is that with all pet groups, pets will take aggro at times from PCs even when they are within range.  Weird coding that way.  Doesn't happen alot but it does happen.<br />
<br />
Second, the amount of stunning combined with 75% slow means little damage overall.<br />
<br />
Third, once every mage has suspend minion 2 they can use the ability as a mana free heal for their pets.  I love that!  So even when pets do get beat on a bit it is no big deal, and really if the pet dies who cares cast another and you're on your way--unlike a PC.<br />
<br />
Fourth, it is insane DPS.  Five pets averaging say 65 dps plus each mage casting FBoT or Sun Vortex once per mob means dead mob in 30 sec or less depending on crits.  If they all used one rain spell then it is sainara sucka!<br />
<br />
Five mages can pet canni quickly for unlimited mana.  So there is little downtime in that kind of group.<br />
<br />
Six, given that even 3 mobs can't kill 6 pets fast (including the shammy pet) mages can pump out pets (chain pets) or chain heal against slowed mobs and kill over pulls--if they don't panic and know what they are doing.  I've healed and nuked 2 bot giants to death when they were slowed.  Got to 10m and then pet canni'ed to FM in 90 sec.<br />
<br />
I wish more would contemplate these type of groups because they kick ass and they are fun.  Frankly I'm tired of conventional killing and have been trying to put together a trio of: Me, Pally, Druid and stomping everything in BoT with a charmed pet.  High risk but different and fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>glydor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">And to think that somone on RN said that not using a tank and a cleric and using pet tactics was an exploit..  :cool:</div></div><hr />

There was a thread on the mage's compendium the other day where I think 11 mages and 1 monk (puller) killed the 425 Dain IV.<br />
<br />
Monk brought Dain out front solo and the 11 mages promptly slaughtered him.</div></div><hr />

That's from Stromm where the BL was probably using crappy weapons compared to old servers.  Interesting thread there too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I've been in some great pet groups and some bad ones. When you have a good group, they rock.<br />
<br />
Last night I was in an agro kiting group and didn't really like it. When I joined, it was shaman, mage, wizard, wizard, necro, ranger, and one wizard was replaced by another necro. All 59-62 at the outer caves camp in PoV.<br />
<br />
The problem for me was, I'd get agro from slow, and the necro or ranger who were supposed to be kiting didn't bother getting agro back off me. Once I start moving to kite, my mana regen goes way down - no canni/torpor, no mount.<br />
<br />
Necros and rangers are usually the classes who get agro way too easily if they're not careful, so I'm not sure quite why these two couldn't seem to. At times, even the pets were getting agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I’m just discovering the joys of pet groups.  With my shaman, my pet has been a really nice DOT, but he’s never stood up well tanking mobs.  But I recently started a beastlord, along with a few others in my guild.  Two of us have been grouping regularly and the difference our pets make is incredible.  And now that we both have our level 15 pets, which can proc, the difference is even more astounding.  We’ll pull anything from a DB to a low red mob and with both our pets procing they go down much faster than I would have ever expected.  I’d love to get a full group of beastlords and watch the mobs melt beneath our pets’ onslaught.  It’ll be interesting to see if this continues to hold true as we gain levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Hamenu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">The problem for me was, I'd get agro from slow, and the necro or ranger who were supposed to be kiting didn't bother getting agro back off me.

<br />
The catch is, you weren't in a pet group. You were in a non-tank group, with what appears to be decent DPS. The problem is, you don't have anything to really shield you in case something does go wrong with aggro. <br />
<br />
 In a true pet group you should have 4-5 &quot;power&quot; pets (mage, necro, bl) available to pound on the mob and take the aggo quickly. In a true pet group, slow is actually optional because nobody cares if a couple of pets get shredded on a mob. <br />
<br />
That's what some folks have a hard time getting the idea of. We're all so used to keeping the tank alive, we need slow, we need CH, we need Mez. None are required (but they are appreciated), because a dead pet doesn't hold a grudge. :)</div></div><hr />
