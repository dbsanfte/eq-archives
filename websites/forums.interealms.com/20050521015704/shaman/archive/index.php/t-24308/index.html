PBAE heal 10k hitpoints and mana.  I'm trying to figure out what purpose this could have.  Would it heal all players for that?  If so, I want to have the NPC that casts that spell around all the time, haha.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Wow.. that's insane...  I'd be pretty surprised if this spell goes live...Give it to the clerics they could really use a spell like this.. they just don't have enough healing power yet(that's sacasm btw everyone)  although if it were to be a mob spell DOH!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Boom ready for next wave and The fight can be tuned accordingly.<br />
<br />
Keep constant pressure and stress ona party while not making it only applicable to the Superduber ubers. plus levels the multiple waves with the incoming waves.<br />
<br />
Sounds like an interesting premise. but it is prolly sometihng for a GM for a 1 time event or something. That only people who play part time in timbuktu will get a chance to see<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think thats sorta related to the &quot;rejuvination&quot; traps in LDONs...there are several versions, one which heals the party, the other restores mana..perhaps thisis a higher end version IE raid version.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Something like this already exists. Try to do the Trial of Torture in PoJ some day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There are some AE's in the game that can be resisted if you have certain dropped items/do certain things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you do Ring of Fear in Cazic Thule, you can loot glyph things that you can turn in to get an AE heal.</div></div><hr />

HP AND mana? Pfft, no, they would never give mana to clerics.<br />
<br />
This is a beastlord spell, foo.</div></div><hr />
