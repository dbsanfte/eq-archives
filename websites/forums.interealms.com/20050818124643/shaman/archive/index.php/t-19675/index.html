Return of the Casino <br />
------------------------ <br />
<br />
** Play King's Court in Shadowhaven! ** <br />
<br />
Shandeling's Roost in Shadowhaven again houses a game of chance. To play you will need to buy a King's Court Token. You then take this token and turn it in to any of the dealers. Based on what your hand turns out to be, you will be awarded a prize. The highest hands will return a gold ticket as the prize. This Ticket can be turned in to win prizes such as a Guise of the Deceiver, Fungus Covered Great Staff, or Holgresh Elder Beads. Good luck to all that play! <br />
<br />
Tradeskill UI now live <br />
------------------------ <br />
<br />
Opening a tradeskill container will now open a new user interface. In the window you will find an area that has all recipes that are currently available to you. This includes recipes that are at your skill level as well as some above it. Clicking on a recipe will display what items are necessary for its completion. Clicking the &quot;combine&quot; button will extract those required items from the player's inventory, and perform the recipe combine, placing the results on the player's cursor. The new system is nice and neat, with no dragging and dropping unless you want to try a combine that is way out of your league, which uses the old style of combination. <br />
<br />
Item Changes <br />
------------------------ <br />
- The name of Berserker armor has been changed to Bladesmans armor. <br />
- The beastlord epic weapon will no longer &quot;proc&quot; for wielders below the 46th level. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">wohoo! I still got tokens from old casino!!1!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The Tradeskill UI looks intresting. Ive always wanted to finush up old ones like baking and alchemy and start new ones like blacksmithing and such.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm very much looking forward to the new Trade Skill feature.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">woot, I can't wait to spend the next two days answering the same questions 200x cause people don't listen the first time, or refuse to download the maps and get lost eveyr 2 min.<br />
<br />
Actually, i'm only slightly kidding, but it will be fun cause you know that everytime a guildee logs on, the first question they will ask is &quot;where do I have to go&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hi Val, that is why you have forseen that and made a guide about GoD as I have and posted for the guild as soon as NDA got lifted :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Val - where should I go for some nice solo loot farming? :) Tell Tell! (and remember you're much more uber than I am now!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>kowalsky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">no pet shrink fix?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I always turn off my /ooc channel when new expansions come out so I can just go explore on my own. I never have /shouts or /auction on, turned those off for good a couple years ago. If I overhear people talking in says, that's one thing - you'd hear people talking in crowded places, but I dont like to listen to people relaying every particle of information to the other people who are unwilling to find anything out for themself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">- Corrected some spell sound effects. <br />
<br />
Woot, I always thought that Acumen sounding like you're drinking a potion was one of the major problems with the shaman class.  Well, at least I'm hoping that's one they fixed. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Discordja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Everquest has sound?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">In the newer version of EQNews.txt the following items were removed.<br />
<br />
Combat Abilities <br />
------------------------ <br />
- Assassins Strike should now work correctly. <br />
- Sneak Attack should now work correctly. <br />
- Thief's Vengeance is now working correctly. <br />
- Indirection should now work as intended. <br />
<br />
So I guess these are still broken.</div></div><hr />
