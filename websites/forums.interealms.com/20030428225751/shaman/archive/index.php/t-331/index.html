<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Who didn't see that coming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">&quot;The manufacturer of EverQuest purposely made it in such a way that it is more intriguing to the addict,&quot; <br />
<br />
That kills me.  Work harder, spend more time- get more stuff, advance.  Sheesh, I guess my job is addictive, too.  If I work harder and longer, my chances of advancing are greater.  I see a class action lawsuit against the Fortune 500 - if only they hadn't made work so &quot;appealing to the addict&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;We're trying to whack them with a verdict significantly large so that they, out of fiscal self-interest, will put warning labels on,&quot; he said. &quot;We're trying to get them to act responsibly. They know this is an addictive game.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gooood- equate real dangers with non-dangers.  Yeah, that's good for everyone.  'Why can't I smoke, mom- it's got the same warning label EQ does- and that's just a game!'<br />
<br />
&quot;The graphics are absolutely thrilling. They just haul you in,&quot;   LOL !!!  I'm guessing this guy hasn't played any modern computer game since 1995.  Don't get me wrong- Punch-Out (http://www.klov.com/P/Punch-Out!!.html)  is still the greatest game ever made, but graphics have evolved.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sounds to me like this kid and anyone else like him has much deeper rooted problems than just EQ. Anyone that would play 18 hours a day, and had no social interaction, or suffer from sleep deprivation because of a game has much bigger problems. <br />
I play maybe 3 times a week, maybe a couple hours at a time, I'd like to play more because I enjoy it. But if I don't get to play for a while...so what ? It's just a game, I do have this thing called a &quot;life&quot;. Sure EQ has been made to be addicting, that's why people play it...its fun and it draws you in as you get more in depth into the game. But that's all it is....&quot;a game&quot; It's made to entertain you but not overtake your life....it's only an addiction if you allow it to be. No one is forcing you to play EQ, your life doesn't depend on it....so in the end who is responsible......YOU are ! <br />
<br />
It's a tragedy what happened to this kid but he had more problems than just being addicted to EQ. And blaming a computer game for someone's shortcomings is just a cop out. <br />
He needed help, serious help...I'm guessing he needed it way before he even started palying EQ. Anyone that would allow a game or any recreation like it to takeover their life has serious problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Warning label?  Sheesh, something like...<br />
<br />
WARNING:  If you are off your rocker this product will make you forget to climb back on it.<br />
<br />
...maybe? Or...<br />
<br />
WARNING:  Extended use of this product is incompatible with Having A Social Life.  Verant Inc is not responsible for loss of Social Life or costs incurred in Getting A Social Life in the event that your previous Social Life is lost as a result of use.  <br />
<br />
It's not funny that the poor guy used EQ as a hideaway that prevented him from getting help in time, but come on now...if it wasn't EQ it would have been something else.  Besides which, when someone is already unstable enough that suicide would be a remotely serious consideration, no warning label is going to make a dent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sargurin Dammim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">&quot;After playing the game for 36 hours straight, he had a psychotic break because of sleep deprivation, Parker said&quot;<br />
Wow, I feel like that after 4 hours of playing.<br />
<br />
What ever happened to personal responsibility??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tarnil MacDuff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If I could be sure to snap out of it, I would love to think I was actuall yin EQ, running from all the froggies.  <br />

Better than drugs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ogrym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Sad thing in the US these days.  It's never YOUR fault, it's always someone else that made you do it.  The list of crap like this goes on and on and on.<br />
<br />
Ozzy osbourne and the song suicide solution and the kid that blew his brains out.  Stupid prosecution swears he said &quot;shoot shoot shoot&quot; in the lyrics and of course now it's ozzy's fault.  Did the prosecution bother to try and figure out that the song was about ozzy and his drinking problem? nope.<br />
<br />
Columbine.  Kids go nuts and shoot other kids.  It's doom's fault.  Doom made them insane.  It of course wasn't the parents who obviously didn't take the time to raise their kids correctly and perhaps check in on them and notice they had guns in their rooms.  Nope instead the victims parents try and sue multiple game companies, this was thankfully thrown right the hell out of court.<br />
<br />
The list goes on and on.  According to these folks's theory, I should be going ape **** here soon and going postal on someone/somewhere because i've watched violent movies, play video games, and listen to ozzy.</div></div><hr />

LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL, thanks Dandi. Your'e a funny guy/gal :)<br />

Computer games are the new rock and roll, society blames its problems on things they barely understand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If computer games are the new rock and roll - where are all the groupies?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zabi Bbuzzin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">/agree Ogrym<br />
Why dont the parents ever take blame?!  Its always societies fault, gaming industry's fault, music industry's fault, NRA's fault, pick any large company or group of people and its all their fault.  <br />
<br />
Instead of handing out ridilin like candy to any kid that does kid things by acting wierd once in a while, how about doing some parenting.  Get to know your kid instead of passing the parenting responsibility onto societies shoulders then saying society sucks at it.  <br />
Its too bad you need a license to drive a car but ANYONE can have a baby.<br />
Sorry to hear that someone took their life in any case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Meschit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I can just see how this court case is going to go...<br />
<br />
Pretrial Jury Selection<br />
<br />
Lawyer: Mrs. Robinson, have you ever played or heard of a computer game called Everquest?<br />
<br />
Bluehair: Eh?<br />
<br />
Judge: OK, you're in.<br />
<br />
Trial<br />
<br />
Plaintiff: My son killed himself because the designers of this game are satanist hippies who wanted to keep him addicted and put money in their pockets.<br />
<br />
Bluehair (remembering all the sensationalist Oprah Winfrey and Oral Roberts shows she watched): Guilty!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">how bout the dood was 21.. old enough to elect a president but not mature enough to control playing a video game.  Talk about being a llama.<br />
<br />
WE've been down this road before so I ain't gonna get all long winderd (southern accent) about my feelins for this situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Riokhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hmmm.<br />
<br />
In the 80's it was heavy metal music being blamed on young suicides. Now it's video games. Next it will be something else silly. The real problem is that it is a social problem. Far bigger than any one thing. Oh, and parents (or the lack of) play a big role in it also.<br />
<br />
It's easier and it sells more papers if the media can point at one thing and say that's the problem.<br />
<br />
And for those who are addicted to video games. It is most likely you're gonna be addicted to something in life. I'd rather it be a video game instead of something else like drugs. Basicaly what I am saying here is that out of all the addictions video game addiction is way down on the list of harmful addictions. Have not heard of anyone knocking over the local store so they can pay their EQ bill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Munkee Bizness</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">/sigh people like that kids mom make a strong argument for birth control. oh no it wasnt his fault that hes dead i mean after all sure he did own the gun he did point it at himself and he was the one to pull the trigger but its not his fault, it was those bad bad men making those addictive computer games that killed him. So her kid killed himself, young people in their teens and twentys have been killing themselves for years its nothing new, the only new thing is people pulling retarded **** like this and actually pulling it off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tailen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">What amazes me is that he figured out how to use a gun.  I mean a trigger is nothing like a mouse!<br />
