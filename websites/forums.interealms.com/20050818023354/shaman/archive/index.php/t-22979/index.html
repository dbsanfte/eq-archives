<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tormic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I saw the posts here on pet weapons procing and the like and how our pets will dual wield with weapons and an odd thought came to mind...<br />
<br />
Bazaar and buying weapons for pet.<br />
<br />
So, I checked.  Velium weapons proc at level 25 (the drop ones -- the ones from thurg proc at 1 but cost a mint) and sell for ~8pp each.<br />
<br />
When I read that equipping a pet with weapons would allow it to dual wield, I tried it (was playing with Ice Giants in EF at 48th level) and pet DPS went up noticably so I'm wondering...  Giving pet a couple of 12hp proc weapons -- won't even cost me enough to worry about (especially being as pets zone with you now)...  (not much but hey!  I'm 51st level...  friggn best DOT I use is 146hp per tic and only lasts 4 tics so...   :p )<br />
<br />
Any thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Fist of ixblat proc at a low level, pretty sure the 55 pet can proc them but not sure about higher. They can usually be bought off a mage for a few plat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The fists start proccing at level one, but the damage of the proc is scaled according to level.  Well worth the 10 plat or so they cost in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">the fist says it procs at lvl 10 and the sword lvl 40</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Serrated bone dirks are excellent if you're soloing dungeons.<br />
<br />
That 1h blunt from SolB that procs chaotic feedback is great with its stun, always lands, especially funny in pvp. Gnoll lariats do ok pve.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tarru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">one thing to remember if you are going to root rot it is better to give dog a few rusty daggers because the mage toys and any other procing weapons will break root alot.<br />
<br />
if im soloing older content or in a group i allways try to give the mut mage toys to add a few extra dps but if im soloing in GoD areas the dog gets rustys and most of the time sits next to me and watches the mob rot so he dont get one rounded.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">serrated bone dirk for snare,<br />
Gnoll hide lariat for stun, very nice if you are fighting caster mobs and all around a great weapon for dog dog, the stun isnt long but reduced dps is reduced dps.<br />
those and mage weapons are really all I ever give dog dog.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wareldara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Had this idea the other day while heading into a dungeon.  What about giving the pet the summoned cleric hammers?  Yes they are no drop but dogdog is an NPC and can take them, they are lore too and he will take them one at a time.  Now I am not sure if he can proc them (already had dumped the FS/rusty weapons from oasis on him) but if he could???  Anyone else ever tried?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Maitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Dogdog can't use summoned hammers ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Pet wont use no drop weapons.<br />
<br />
Shame too...I'd LOVE to see my pet rocking out with a few cleric hammers....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I was standing in PoK the other day, /auctioning for pet toys, and a mage sent me a tell &quot;Trade you toys for buffs on my pet&quot;. When he got there, I noticed his pet was carrying what looked to be a Splintered Club. I asked about it and he said &quot;I buy my pet an Admantite club in teh bazaar every morning, heh&quot;. <br />
<br />
Pet zoning abilities have opened up a whole new level of commerce in the bazaar. &quot;Great pet weapons, 1K!! Your pick, snares, dd's, stuns!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hmm...I wouldnt do it, but to each his/her own I suppose.  Maybe Im just tight fisted, but I cant see spending 1K on a weapon even if I could keep it for 8 hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Wareldara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Even for 8 hours 1k seems like a lot.  I guess if the weapon really made a difference to your pet to where it would make you 1k more in 8 hours than if you didn't have it (or whatever ratio) but still seems like a lot to the poor shammy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">One time I soloed in HS, I bought this cleric only weapon and it did 600 ish damage to undead, was only like 400pp. Think it was called Dawnstar or something. A few times I used to buy PGT's for the pet, and serrated bone dirks when soloing. A J-Stick sometimes for certain encounters. Mainly though for groups it was just cheap weapons, usually ones I got from loy.</div></div><hr />

I was playing around in Howling Stones, and my beast and sham already had one in inventory when a 3rd one droped. I gave it to my shaman pet and .. the stun on that is very nice to have :). <br />
<br />
Some players also have so much pp that 1k a day for a fun proc is nothing. I am not one of them though :) I only give dog dog rot and rustys.</div></div><hr />
