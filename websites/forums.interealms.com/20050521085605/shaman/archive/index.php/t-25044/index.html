<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hagle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering how hard it would be to two box BoT mini named with a Sk/Shm combo and if anyone has some tips on a strat to use. SK at lvl 65 with smithed armor from bazaar equiped. Shaman (lvl 66)with FT8 Quiessence and average equipment for non raider.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well you could do it I guess but your problem would be dps. It takes a few minutes to chop those things down even with a few dps classes in group. With just an sk and shaman, better bring a book to read during the fight. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I got Laef Windfall to 13% duoing with a cleric, both of us basically meleed and owned him with DS damage. then he gated and the guys normally flanking him owned our asses &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>NereasAequitas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have two boxed all four bot wing bosses with my cleric bot out of bordom, and solo'd Hreidar (had to have cleric pull mind you).  I think you may find it rough trying to duo them with a bazaar level SK, as I've seen more than one bazaar level geared group wipe to a wing boss.  WIth only quiesence and and his low AC you will likely not be able to keep up with the DPS.  But the only way to find out is to try it, worst case you get a rez, so for the tips you wanted:<br />
<br />
Hreidar Lynhilig (west wing): Disease slow, lands easily after MD.  Magic is technically possible  but very resistant.  Poison dots land well.  You have two options for fighting him, you can either clear his room and fight him in there, or you can clear the  room adjacent his and pull him out, then tank  him in the SW corner of the room, if you keep him up against the wall he won't gate.   I would say Hreidar is the easiest of the four.<br />
<br />
Laef Windfall (north): Immune to slow.  Get your SK's DS up as much as possible for this one, you won't be contributing much of any DPS at all.  The wing is highly resistant to poison disease and cold, magic lands on trash but Laef himself has high MR. Epic dot is about all you can reliably land. Despite being immune to slow his DPS is not that bad, as long as you can sustain your mana healing the DS will wear him down eventually.  All wing bosses are clerics so be sure to tank him in his room near his spawn to avoid gating.<br />
<br />
Oreen Wavecrasher (east): Disease slow, easy after MD.  Again magic  possible but unlikely.  No poison or cold here either, and no magic on Oreen himself.   Disease dots will land though, as will epic.  Similar to Laef it will be a long fight, as long as you can sustain your mana just let the SK kill it and refresh the disease dots now and then.<br />
<br />
Gaukr Sandstorm (north): far and away the hardest of the four, very high MR and the wing is naturally immune to disease based spells.  I would not even bother attempting this guy if you don't have a tash stick, and hope it procs early, Balance of the Nihil is a big plus as well.  He has a 1000 DD proc, and will drop a bazaar SK very quickly if you don't get lucky with the slow.  If you do get slow on load on the poison dots and rains if you have the mana for it, you'll want to try and get him dead before you need to try and reslow.<br />
<br />
Anyway good luck with it and have fun, always enjoyed BoT despite it being low xp and train central, was kinda sad to see it die with OoW.  Now if I could just solo a tower boss!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>m970456</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I haven't 2boxed the north guy yet, but I have done him duo.  There was a level 70 BL did it with.  Was a little hairy at first until I got it slowed.  After that, not bad at all.  I think he used his BL defensive that lasts 18 seconds or 12 seconds at first while we both tried to slow it.  Mine stuck on the 3rd cast.</div></div><hr />
