<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Seanus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Wish me luck.  My guild is helping me with the Epic in CoM tonight.  If all goes well, I'll be wielding that glowing spear on my log out tonight :D :D <br />
<br />
I want to thank the collective minds of the Crucible for their assistance and advice.  My mind is much easier knowing what to expect... now just need Neh'Ashiir's reaver to cooperate and follow the monk to our loving embrace...<br />
<br />
If any of you Rathe types are bored, come on out =)  9pm EST starting time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dagor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Good Luck,<br />
<br />
Try to stay alive when Rak agros on you....if the mage pets  can acquire agro you can just step back out of AoE range.  It really doesn't hurt anything if you do die...I tried to survive as a matter of principle, but a black reaver popped in and ended me pretty quickly.  <br />
<br />
The Black Reaver was a repop...I was err a little late for my own epic raid..and the reavers started to repop while the mage pets whacked on Rak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you pull Rak's reaver to the safe spot, you don't have to worry about any repops, nothing spawns there and no water for him to fall into.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Aww, cmon.  You miss out on some quality pandemonium if you don't let Rak fall into the water.  I was nekkid at the entrance when he went into the drink for my epic fight.  Some brave clerics  rezzing mages back in and jumping into the drink to try to keep the pets alive.  Somehow they won, thanks to a few who thought fast on their feet :).  It was not pretty though.  Get a monk to move him into the corner of the zone :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Seanus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Gloriana's post gave me enough hints.  I have done this before for others in my Ranger guise, and one of the first attempts ended up in the water... somehow we survived, but it was definitely &quot;action-packed-action&quot; for a spell.  Either the SW corner or the south-side archway for me please... then again, the Reaver may have a different plan in mind.<br />
<br />
I think I'm the first Shaman in guild to do this quest the right way (only turned Envy and Woe once thank you very much).  Call me silly, but I like questing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Epic at 46 eh? wow...didnt get mine till 58. Best of luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Seanus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Need to update that... 47.9.  Its still early, but I play much more time than my gaming friend, so I quest instead of experience.  Plus I had good luck in CoM with the books and scrolls.  1 night for all those parts.<br />
<br />
Thanks though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Good luck ....epic at 46 is quite an accomplishment...go for it. And smash Rak's dead a$$ for all of us you may never see their toon with an epic. :(</div></div><hr />
