<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dredak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I dunno.<br />
<br />
We solo differently.  I played an enchanter for a long time, and though charm-soloing was powerful, it was also somewhat situational.  I would imagine that it is even more so for druids, with the limitations on what they can charm.  That said, charm soloing can be more convenient for druids in the right situation.  Snaring, healing, and the lack of insane aggro when charm wears off (at higher levels) all serve the druid well.  Watching them solo in PoN with pets that hit for 200+ constantly can make me a little jealous...but...<br />
<br />
The beauty of the shaman is that he/she can solo almost anywhere, from what I have seen.  I wish I could stun casters somehow, but if I am soloing low blues, this doesnt seem to be much of an issue.  We also regain mana at an insane rate with canni and torpor.  The funny thing is that with the Epic, the dogdog, the JBB, and torpor, i can keep several dark blue froggies in sebilis dying at once indefinitely, and never ever med.<br />
<br />
I tried playing my magician the other day.  I can't do it anymore.  I can't med.  I won't med.   I'm like *** is this sitting down crap.  I'm ruined for other classes.<br />
<br />
Can druids solo better than shaman?  I dunno.  It's apples and oranges.  Never cared for apples, meself.<br />

<br />
I was partnered with my 63 druid friend several times and we could keep all the nitestalkers in PoN clear plus the 3 strahilugs below them too, all this with a single blood raven pet.<br />
<br />
My shaman was doing 5 hour levels in 54-57 (yes I said 5 hours total for level 54) when grouped with him.<br />
<br />
I leveled so fast I'm practically a gimp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>1kamfool</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Having actually played both a 65 druid and shaman, overall shaman are better.<br />
<br />
A druid needs special circumstances to solo better than a shaman, like a place where mobs are charmable, don't summon, and are snarable. If those conditions are met, then they're great. Playing a druid with 5300 mana, I can quad and get an aa every 45 minutes. If I'm just root rotting something though, I only have one dot, and it isn't any better than ancient bane. If dotting, an aa takes around 2 hours.<br />
<br />
A shaman solos anywhere that mobs don't have insane slow mitigation. Doesn't matter if the mob is unrootable, but it helps greatly. Root dot damage shaman &gt; root dot druid. Where it takes my druid 4 minutes to kill something, my shaman does it in 2. Average aa is in about 1h 15m. <br />
<br />
but the more important part is, which class can be played by someone else to plvl their melee faster while you work and go to school...</div></div><hr />

 <br />
  Enchanters easily outsolo druids (and everyone else) and they don't have snare.  Magicians solo quite well with charm and not only do they not have snare, they don't even have root, but there are even fewer summoned mobs than animal mobs.  Druid snare is normally 14 minutes BTW.  You'd think healing would help druids but gating and zoning back and and voila pet goes from 10% all the way back up to it's happy 32k hps for the cost of recharming it.<br />

  Charm currently is broken, pets do WAY too much damage in PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Callir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think by healing he meant the druid's ability to heal themselves..I play a 61 enchanter, and unless I'm outside, getting hit by a hasted ex-pet (even with 2.2k in Runes) sucks ass, heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kaneras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Druid snare is normally 14 minutes BTW <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>corlathist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Druid charm is capped at 60.  This does dramatically limit the effectiveness of this.  POV((with difficulty)), POS.   Despite snare, <br />
Enchanters are far far better equipped for this.  Slow, and Crowd Control, and memblur, runes, and better casting times/resist rates.  Most of the truly insane Charm Xping is done by Chanters in places that a druid can't, or cant do half as well.<br />
<br />
A lot of this question is based on gear and AA xp.   Take Quadding.  in the mid 50's.   A Shaman could root/rot/pet  wyverns in CS for about the XP per hour than a quadder.  Add in JBB and shaman could surpass.  Add in JBB &amp; Fungi and shaman could surpass the druid by as much as 50%.<br />
<br />
Fast forward, depends heavily on AA.   Who has SCM3.  Does the Quadder have SCf3 &amp; Planar Fury3?  Does shaman have affliction focus items especially duration and efficiency?  How much FT?<br />
Cann5?  <br />
<br />
When all is said and done, Root/Rot is accessable in more zones than quadding.  and simply by nature of Shaman Dots, shamans are better at it.  ((More DPS))<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tyric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well, I've watched my 65th level druid and 65th level chanter friends duo the named mini-bosses in PoS before, using charmed frogs. Between snare having a fixed duration and charmed pets dishing out massive amounts of dmg, both classes (but especially druids) are far better at soloing once they have their charm spells than a shaman is. Root-rotting doesnt even come close, in terms of xp acquired per hour. The only downside is that when things go wrong for a chanter or druid, they generally go *really* wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>corlathist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">You sure this wasn't before Mini-bosses got made unslowable?<br />
<br />
Its still doable, but not DUOABLE now a days.  <br />
Unslowed Minibosses do so much damage to a frog, that the frog needs heavy healing to survive.  A druid alone wouldnt be able to keep a frog alive during this.  Now you could let pet one die, and charm a new pet.   Problem with this is that POS frogs are hard as hell to find.  lots of people Root/Rot them for xp.  I seriously doubt they'd get the supply.  2nd problem, is that while the giant turns on frog 2, rampage is now open.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I highly doubt it was duoed post MiniBoss Change.  Last time we tried this with 2 frogs, it took 1 Cleric, + 2 KR Druids to keep them healed enough.<br />
<br />
Storms ((and maybe Valor)) are the only zones where a 59/60 animal mob is.  HOH for example cant charm as a druid.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
  Charm currently is broken, pets do WAY too much damage in PoP. <br />
<br />
The mage thing has to be joke? There are only what, 2 PoP zones that a mage can charm a pet? The mage has to be level 65 and have the 65 charm. The mage also, literally, and I'm not making this up, cannot last 1 round of melee when the charmed pet breaks. It's not perma charm, they break alot.<br />
<br />
My mage isnt 65 yet, but from talking to other mages, the average consesnses is you die 1/4 to 1/2 the time charm breaks. Eitehr you are too close and dont have time to re-charm and get smacked, charm breaks in the middle of the fight, or charm doesnt stick on cast and you dont have time to recharm. Mages have the worst HP's in teh game, and simply cant take the beating when charm breaks. You cant reapply charm until it breaks so it not like you cna cast charm every 5 mins to lessen the chance of break.<br />
<br />
That said, many 65 mages DO solo charmed because it is the ONLY way a mage can solo 61+. Mages get no root, so they cant root rot. They cant use the earth pet to root because no slow mitigation and the earth pet gets eaten faster than you can chain summon them. Mages eat thier deaths because overall its still  a net exp gain (assuming they can get somone in to rez the stack of corpses).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kaneras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">There is no comparison, the Druid can charm more effectively than a chanter, I know this because I've partnered with both.  Druid has snare, great heals, great regen, superior roots, also doesn't need to rely on sow potions.  Know what happens when a chanter gets hit and is low on health?  He either zones or dies, because he can't heal himself.  It's not a matter of who can charm the highest level mob, it's a matter of who can crank out the exp the fastest without neeeding 20 minutes to get a rezz and med up again.<br />
<br />
The main thing the chanter has going for him is that he can slow, but from what I've seen having good heals outweighs this.  Chanter also doesn't need to rely on animals but who cares when so many animals are available. <br />
<br />
The proof is in the pudding folks.  Just head over to the nightstalkers and see who's charming them, it will be a druid every time, in fact I don't know if I've ever seen a chanter holding that camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Kan, you're talking a teir one zone.  Teir 2 is generally more rewarding and can likely net a better return.  Maybe your chanter can't hold nightstalkers, but they can do a better camp in PoV/PoS for more exp.  This sort of flushes your &quot;proof is in the pudding&quot; argument down the toilet.  Several of the other posters are refering to higher teir camps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Its completely situational.  Solo better means what?<br />
<br />
Yes charm is a powerful tool.  The fact that it is only animals limits it somewhat.<br />
<br />
Do druids solo better in Plane of Nightmare than shaman?  I would say yes, but still situational and depends still on definition of better.<br />
<br />
Can druids get more experience faster than a shaman in the Plane of Nightmare while solo?  yes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Torlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Well, I saw a Druid in WW the other night. They were quading 3 IB's and 1 Velium Hound. Not sure I could do that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Gagner67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Thou somehow we still don't see Druids taking Guardians Wurms.<br />
<br />
Verant is currently aware of the state of charm.  Just give it some time before charm is changed and once again shamans will be top of the food chain when it comes to huge mobs that summon.<br />
<br />
Just for the record I too, think charm should be change even as a druid.<br />
<br />
One thing about druids by the way that the author of this thread totally forgot about.  Druids are not ideally sought after for groups.  Nor are they ideal for guilds.  A common 65 shaman has a better chance of seeing end game material more often than a common 65 druid.  People argue that shamans don't stack for raids that it maybe, but druid do stack yet are even needed less.<br />
<br />
Basically, and I am proof of this, you have a common level 60 flagged shaman without even the best gear and he can be told, by a very impressive guild, in a tell want to help us take Terris Thule.  While a level 65 flagged Druid of my guild; I ask if she can come, and they pass her up.<br />
<br />
Druids are powerful soloers but that is it.  They will never amount to anything more.  And I knew that when I made mine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Tyric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Gagner67, afraid I'm going to have to take exception to you saying druids arent needed. 65th level druids with a decent number of AAs are both excellent damage dealers via their nukes and very good healers. As long as you're fighting a mob that doesnt mitigate slow, a shaman/druid combo in a group can keep everyone healed as well as a cleric/enchanter or even a cleric/shaman. With slow mitigating mobs like the giants in PoS, I'd say a druid might be able to perform almost as well as a cleric, but the downside is that if your puller gets nuked for 1700 after already taking a few hits, the druid cant rez. :p<br />
<br />
<br />
edit- Corlathist, you're right, now that I think about it. Lately, I havent seen them duo the mini-bosses. I think now they use 2 druids and 1 enchanter, so that they can keep a steady 2 frogs on the giants while the 3rd is being recharmed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Two things: <br />
<br />
1.  You, yourself mention two different downsides to having a druid in group.  Why have any downside when you can avoid it all together with a cleric.  That is how most think.  Plus Tyric I think your aiming more at a perfect duo team more than the discussion of a full group.  Which I was talking about.<br />
<br />
2.  I was also talking about guilds and raids in my above post in terms of druids.  (mind you I am totally fine with the fact that, to a raid the pure class abilities, are sought after simple because they do it the best.)  Remember I started a druid for soloing purposes  and money only.  <br />
<br />
Otherwise my character lives up to its labels so many other classes give it.  Like kewl drood.  Or newbie class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">It's a whole new world out there boys, and only one thing makes for good soloing - charm. Mobs hit too hard, too fast and mitigate slow. You can't just torpor and tank<br />
<br />
Atop the heap is the chanter. Charm + tash + slow is deadly. Add mez, runes, lull, tranq and stun/root and you have a good situation. Haste doesn't matter since you never haste a pet. Their only issue is surviving charm breaks, which is where mez/runes help tons.<br />
<br />
Next is the druid. With charm, snare, sow, some healing, dots, and stuns, they do well. Very hard to kill them even with charm breaks thanks to snare.<br />
<br />
Necro is third. Let them charm a mob a PoV and watch out. I was trio-ing with a cleric and necro in PoV where the only real DPS was that skele and I killed stuff FASTER than a full group. Other than charm tho, necros have few general tools, just FD, HS and maybe ST if it even works. That said, if that necro takes on more undead and slows em, they do amazingly well.<br />
<br />
DISTANT third, mages and shaman. Maybe wizzies. I know mages that do well in PoS. Me personally, I just can't find good areas. It took me 3.5m to solo one planar larvae in PoV. PoD was possible but slow and prone to adds. PoI is train central. PoS I had some success in the forest but was annhiliated other areas. PoN I never tired. BoT killed me. Inner factory in PoI I couldn't get singles, death. PoJ I could solo near the jail, but not inside it. In all cases tho, IT WAS SLOW. OMG, so slow. Not worth it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Corlathist: <br />
<br />
&gt; 1) Enchanter<br />
&gt; 2) Wizard <br />
&gt; 3) Neco, Shaman, Druid <br />
&gt; 4) Mage((No Charm)), BST <br />
&gt; Big Drop <br />
&gt; 5) Paladin <br />
&gt; 6) Cleric<br />
<br />
So I find this list WAY off. Tho now that I think about it, maybe wizzies do solo better than us since at least they can kill a planar larvae easier :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>corlathist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I put the wizard up there because with innate crits and better quad spells there are inherently better at quadding than the druid.<br />
<br />
Charm Xping is the single most efficient way to gain XP.  However, I lowered the necro, mage, druid charm a bit because of the very very limited use of where you can use it.  and its rarity in the necro/mage case.  Enchanters and druids get thier charms with spectrals which are infinitaely easier to get than runes.<br />
Druid charm also caps too low to be effective in tier3+.  With a 60 cap, you cant even charm in HOH which is full of Wrulon animals.<br />
<br />
At level 63 or less, a druid might be higher on the list with thier charm because they have more hunting grounds like PON to use it.  By the time they are 65 Tier 1 is not acceptable XP even with Charm.<br />
<br />
The list does vary by level and hunting ground, AA XP, and items.<br />
There's no one list.<br />
<br />
I did forget the AA Mastery Bow Kiting Rangers.  A small subset but a good point.<br />
<br />
Enchanters charm so much better than druids ((or anyone)) its not even funny.  The ability to slow means that thier pet wins the fights far easier than any other classes.  The runes, the spell casting time, the level cap, the MR adjustments, etc.  Its not funny.<br />
<br />
1) Enchanter by a large margin.<br />
<br />
--- Drop ---<br />
<br />
2) Quadding Wizard <br />
3) Charm Classes in very limited area  ((Mage, Necro,Druid))<br />
4) Necro ((Dots, &amp; Agro Kite))<br />
5) Shaman ((Dots &amp; Agro Kite))<br />
6) Quadding Druid <br />
7) Druid ((Dotting))<br />
<br />
--- Drop ---<br />
<br />
8) Wizards solo kiting<br />
9) Mage ((Agro Kiting which is ironically impossible for a raiding mage with Spell Casting Subtlty.  So they sacrifice thiere solo tool))<br />
10) Rangers bow kiting<br />
11) BST Agro Kiting<br />
<br />
--- Drop -----<br />
<br />
11) Paladin with Slay undead<br />
12) Clerics</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Bozarkia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">necros belong on the top of the soloing chart, especially when they get the lvl 65 charm, OMG they rock.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Tyric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Gagner67- I mention 2 downsides (no rez and less healing power than a cleric), but I also mentioned that druids have good damage output. Druids also can help single pull, have nice dmg shields for slow mitigators, and can snare (i.e. help with crowd control when you have no mezzer). If someone dies and you dont have a cleric, drag the corpse to another group that does.<br />
<br />
Clerics are, without a doubt, the best healers in the game. But unless you're regularly fighting mobs that hit for more than 700 or so per hit and that mitigate, or are immune to, slow, a druid/shaman team can keep up with the healing quite nicely. And I was referring to a shaman/druid in a group, not duoing. In a duo, I'd say ideally you'd want a chanter/druid pair.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">To sum it up, all boils down to apples and peaches like someone else earlier stated. Charm is pretty situational, but then again our solo capabilities have somewhat been rendered situational too, but prolly to a lesser degree.<br />
<br />
Still remember the time I took on Gantru Dralkenr in Umbral's, 50k hp no horse like 10 AA no clarity, and for a charming class nowadays maybe it could be accomplished, but with much less ease. <br />
<br />
Don't think druids can even charm mobs in UP for starters (I could be wrong), and as for chanters, they have luck to rely upon when their charms break etc. When I took Dral down, 10 minutes in, I knew it was a sure thing, just needed &lt;b&gt;tons&lt;/b&gt; of patience cause the fight took about 45 minutes. <br />
<br />
So when we pick the mobs to solo, I'd say our methods are more fullproof, and from what I've seen in the Alice Area in Mischief, yes a chanter can tear mobs to shred, but then again, I've seen this one 64 chanter's corpses scattered throughout the camp. I died once in PoM since summer, and it was to White Stallion, so I'm still pretty satisfied with the shaman's current state of affairs.<br />
<br />
Of course, in some zones druid/chanter &gt; shaman by far, but all that matters is that you're having fun at what you're doing and not getting too preoccupied by envy for other classes.</div></div><hr />

Ensnare is a 9 minute spell, not 14. <br />

Actually it is 14 min (at level 65), my level 51 ranger casts it and it lasts 12min, just go check Lucy or have someone cast it on you if you dont believe me :D</div></div><hr />

2 weeks ago i started to play my level 54 druid (to try the charm  animal) capacity............ WOW:eek: <br />
<br />
playing  my shaman for raids and druid (mostly solo when there were no raids) and gained 4 levels so far  whit the druid and one aa level (running at  10% aa only).<br />
<br />
even at level 54 i was able to kill rats in POD, and sometime i pulled 3 or 4 at same time.<br />
<br />
when one near dead i inv ed myself and charmed another one to finish the low HP one. on bile or other mobs i cast damage shield on my pet .<br />
<br />
rats sure has 10K + hp but i was able to kill all 4 in less than 10 min and  using fear animals, is just awsome (last all fight usually and we can haste our pet whit druid pet speed buff).<br />
<br />
mobs dying very fast . i was gaining near  half blue regular xp per kill.<br />
<br />
at high level on some mobs, druid can kill some mobs well faster than shaman.</div></div><hr />
