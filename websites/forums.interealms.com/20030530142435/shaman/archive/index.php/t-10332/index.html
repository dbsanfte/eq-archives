<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been thinking of which melee (sk, war, ranger) I want to pair my shammy with.  I'm getting some upgrades to my junkheap which will allow me to 2box on it, and suddenly it hit me, why not a shammy + enchanter 2box combo?  Before the enc's higher level, more reliable pets, my shammy should be able to tank reasonably well, and shm / enc are two of the most powerful classes in the game.  Furthermore, when I get higher level I'll be AA'ing with a friend who runs a cleric / pally / rogue 3box setup (he's nuts eh? ;)).  Both shm and enc could bring alot to this group setup.<br />
<br />
Your thoughts?  I have a feeling it might be a pain to manage spells for 2 full-blown casters (as opposed to one caster and a hybrid), but the way I set up my spellbooks on all of my characters should make it somewhat easier (2nd page of hotkeys access different book pages, making any spell 2 button presses away - shift+2 to get to 2nd page, then the key of the page I want).  Also I wouldn't have to worry about duoing the low levels, as my shaman is currently 44 and will be higher yet before I can afford to start an enchanter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I two boxed my second shammy with my 57 chanter Pl'n till he was 54,  at that level, it was not that great a combo. Chanty is more or less just support for the shaman. Pet hits hard, but fragile and unweildy.<br />
<br />
Shammy pet would get eaten all the time, not enough raw offense it seemed, and yes, tons of spells to juggle. This was quite a while ago I must add.<br />
<br />
Just my opinion.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Charm kiting is where it is at.  We make a great combo becuase are debuff will make charm much less likely to break.  We can keep them alive while they are charming and slow pulls because ours are better cast faster and use less mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Enchanters are alot of work .. much like the shaman.  You gotta be on top of your game to control an enchanter AND a shaman at the same time.  IMO its not worth it if all you're going to do is use the enchanter pet and nukes.  The best way to play enchanter is to use charm, and good luck controlling two characters at once when your doing this.  You don't want to be worrying about cannibalizing or casting buffs when your hasted pet is doubling for 400+.<br />
<br />
This isnt to say that at the lower level game it isn't viable, but at the high end I would say get a melee partner for your shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Humbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've got a 48 enchanter on another account. I had thought about pairing my shaman and enchanter before, but now I just don't have the time to play 2 chars. <br />
<br />
From my experience it's a really fun combo. For kicks I took the enchanter to dreadlands and sat Humbert near him, buffed him up and let the enchanter charm a mob, then go out and pull mobs to the pet. It's a real blast. I don't know what changes are coming to charm, but for now it seems fun. <br />
<br />
There were a few other fun things I liked: project illusion and dire charm, extra mana regen, mez, tash and rune. <br />
<br />
The only problem with 2 boxing I didn't like was the enchanter doesn't bring alot of damage to the group unless you charm, and in that case you'll be controlling him most of the time. <br />
<br />
Overall I like it, especially the thought taking risks like charming dragons or getting fast exp from charming. Just wish I had the time to play him :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">if you grab a dire-charm pet with the chanter and just abuse him for haste and KEI and a few nukes it would probably work, but it's probably way too much to try to run both full time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have a level 62 shaman with 120 AA. And a 63 Chanter Hot box. With 53 AA.<br />
<br />
For xp. It is incredible. Charm. Sick on something. Mutt. Also side tanks when charm breaks. <br />
<br />
Can dot freely. Nuke or whatever.<br />
<br />
When you know charm is gonna break. Torpor it. Invis and recharm.  That takes care of the Haste for breaking. And no need to rehaste.<br />
<br />
Sure it is a lot of work. Tons of buffs.<br />
<br />
But it is fun.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Draw1more</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have had a 58 ench PL my Shaman up to 45 and it has been loads of fun.  I must admit that it takes a lot of switching back and forth with a ton of casting especially if you start charming stuff but you will get used to it.</div></div><hr />
