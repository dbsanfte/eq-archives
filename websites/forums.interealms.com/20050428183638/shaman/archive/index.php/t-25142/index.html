<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Kodo Roundup in Desolace.  Only works part of the time. Bugged it, then logged.  Too many other quests in that zone to worry about that one. <br />
<br />
Frankly I was shocked to find something &quot;buggy&quot; in a Blizzard quest.  As opposed to the crap shoot that was EQ quests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I bugged another situation during beta that I thought was odd.  If you swim out in the ocean to &quot;deep sea&quot; area, your charcter gets fatigued in addition to losing breath.  Assumedly, so you can swim across the ocean and all around the world.  Makes sense.<br />
<br />
But, if you happened to die way out there because, you were just being silly or whatever and trying to explore, your ghost also becomes fatigued.  This created a major problem for me, because I didn't want a spirit healer res.  (I think at the time I was doing the Horde version of the aquatic form quest near Silverpine.)  <br />
<br />
Ghosts shouldn't get fatigued, should they?  I can understand that you don't want ghosts running across the ocean as well, either, but there should be some extended timer on them or something so that if you do foolishly try to explore the 20,000 leagues under the sea, you can get your corpse back without a spirit healer res.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>drib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The Besseleth quest in Sishir Valley(?) is also broken.  The queen spider doesn't drop the quest piece when you kill her.<br />
<br />
Also, their entire PvP system is a lie.  Supposedly there were dishonor points for killing someone too far below your level, but there's actually not.  A level 60 can kill a level 25 without any drawbacks.  The reward system is not quite implemented yet anyway.  So if you're on a PvP server, you might want to rethink your plans.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You can run over water as a ghost, but will probably have to gate after getting your corpse.  I have run over water many times while in ghost form.<br />
<br />
I have heard that the 'Counterattack' quest in Barrens may be broken too.  There were some talking about it in general chat.  I haven't done that quest myself so I do not know for sure.  My friend also complained about another quest being broken.  I haven't seen any broken quests yet myself, but I do not doubt there may be some that were not caught and fixed in beta.  There are literally thousands of quests for each side that range from level 1 thru level 60 elites.  It's not very surprising.  Or I'm just still used to EQ's way of doing things.  I dunno</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I found a broken quest myself.  It was an escort quest where the guy you escort is not kos to the little demons that spawn.  So you just run out of range and they despawn and the quest continues as if you killed them and the guy survived.  I did it when I was way too low, or else I might not have noticed.  I was going to bug it, but the reward is utter crap (statless secondary slot item with a 135-168 heal click WITH a cast time with a 30 minute refresh...who could make use of that???).<br />
<br />
The most amusing part was I died in the last stage where 3 named spawned that were all 3 levels over me, but I still got credit for finishing the quest.<br />
<br />
Anyway, there are bound to be bugs and mistakes in the game, but I'm hoping blizzard corrects both the bad and the good ones.</div></div><hr />

It was taken out cos higher level people were being ganked by groups of lower level people as the higher level wouldn't fight back.</div></div><hr />

if a person gets &quot;ganked&quot;, 99% of the time it is their own stupidity. The honor system is still coming, and pvp is not nearly as silly as you seem to think. Do you play on a pvp server?<br />

Yeah, that was one of the ones they added during the open beta patch and probably didn't get tested.  Only closed beta folks would have made high enough level to test it out, since the beta really wasn't long enough for others to make it that high.  I suspect the closed beta folks did what I was doing - restarted on an open beta server to play with friends.  :cool: <br />

Working as intended.  It seems odd, but at higher levels you will see quests you can only perform while dead - the swimming fatigue restriction includes ghosts to preclude exploits to these quests (Hint: you can also fall to your death as a ghost).  Often in situations like you've described, you end up resorting to the dreaded Graveyard Spirit rez!  :eek:</div></div><hr />

Yeah, so instead of thinking of a real solution, they just throw out what could be a good system for one that's broken but tired.  I wish I could solve all my problems by taking the easy way out!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ranlron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Oh please, leave out the drama. The rest of the PvP system isn't even in game yet so stop relying on beta info to form an opinion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
what makes you think they would throw it out ? ... they just removed it until they have come up with a way to prevent the problems it had ... it will be added again at some point when it is ready ... <br />
<br />
if they wanted to take the easy way out they could have just said ... deal with it ... and then ignored it totaly ... basicly what happenes in EQ most of the time</div></div><hr />

<br />
ghosts become fatigued for the same reason that live toons do... the oceans are unimplemented and the areas are meant to be inaccessible<br />
<br />
there are a lot of buggy quests.  however 95% work.  pretty good percentage since most buggy quests got fixed within a push or 2</div></div><hr />
