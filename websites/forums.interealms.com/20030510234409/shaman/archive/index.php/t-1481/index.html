I needed some advice on slowing Vox.  I went on my first Vox raid last week and all did not go well.  MT was using a tash stick, he anounced proc.  I ran up underneath Vox as close as I could get and Turgured.  That did not work so I malisied.  Again no go so I just kept repeating till OOM then stepped back and Canni'ed till I could try again.  I was never able to get a slow to stick.  Anyways if there is a secret to it please let me know.  I'm to high a lvl now to do Vox anyways but I would like to know just in case I get in a similar situation later.  Thanks.<br />
<br />
BTW I was lvl 52 at the time.</div></div><hr />

Vox isn't immune as such, but you have almost no chance of slow. No, there isn't anything you can really do about it.</div></div><hr />
