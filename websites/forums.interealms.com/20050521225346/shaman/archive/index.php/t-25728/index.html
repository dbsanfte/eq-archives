<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What is your favorite raiding zone?<br />
<br />
I was just curious.. we posted this on our guild forums and it surprised me how many people actually really liked some of the newer zones compared to the older ones.  Me, personally I really started geting into raiding around PoP, so most of my experience prior to that was minimal twink fests where the fights were pretty trivial.  However, from my experience right now, I would say that I really enjoy raiding Inktu'tu whenever.  Just an extremely well thought out zone that is fun.  The cursecaller event is one of the best designed events in my opinion.  It doesn't require any clerics to do, just all out passionate kicking ass and running.  <br />
<br />
PoTime personally would be my second favorite.  We spent a lot of time in the zone, and although it wasn't always helpful to my guild in terms of loot (hello, Mr Rallos Zek, please drop a DBoTW for us since we've killed you 40 times and only given up one), it was always extremely fun for me especially once phase 4 started.<br />
<br />
Just so you know.. you are limited on only bein able to put 10 different choices.  My guild one had 26, so I had to cut it down from there.  I initially had things like Ikkinz/Uqua/Qvic/Inktu'tu all in the same block, but took it out mostly caus Inktu'tu by itself is just awesome, and I don't know many if at all any one person that really liked the Ikkinz raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I chose PoTime. The loots are plentiful, theres no unecessary clearing and the gods are fun (though rather easy other than Inny) to kill. My guild will hopefully be starting Inktu`tu raids soon so I may change my mind!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I voted Time also, but there are a few on the list I havent been too, yet. <br />
<br />
The problem is, Time, actully PoP in general, spoiled the EQ population horribly. Now, we have raids we have to run too, raids where you can DIE getting there. Raids like Uqua, through 2 nasty zones. PoP spoiled us with its &quot;One Click away from any raid, come early, come late, whatever, only a click away&quot;. <br />
<br />
And while PoP spoiled us, Gates went WAY back the other direction too far. The whole progression of Gates is totally unnecessarily prohibitive. Its nearly impossile to join an Ikky raid late. If you die in KT on the way, oh well, guess you try to get your corpse look for a summon. <br />
<br />
OoW did a much better job. The instances are deepish, but not horribly so. Most of the raid mobs are fairly easy to access, at least the NC, RCoD, and WoS ones. Ports drop you pretty close to all of them. Gates thuogh, ugh, what a royal PITA. Its REALLY hard to get people to come to Gates raids. Closest port is natimbi, which you have to run across to get to KT, then you have to avoid the see-invis in KT to get to the Ikkys or Yxxta or Qvic, etc etc etc. Brutal. They should at LEAST have little mini-transport stones to pop you to Qvic ZI, Yxxta East ZI, Yxxta West ZI, etc etc. <br />
<br />
Anyway, PoP = too easy, Gates = too hard, OoW = darn close to just right (although I havent pushed for CoA yet, so I dont know how thats gonna go)<br />
<br />
/rant off<br />
<br />
<br />
EDITED NOTE: There probably should be one more choice there, &quot;&lt; MPG OoW zones like NC, RCoD, and WoS&quot;. All 3 of those zones have legitimate raid level encounters in them, many geared toward the &quot;middle of the road&quot; guilds, EPish, early Time, maybe, etc. They are nice raids too, gather quick, hit em, fun strats, good loots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There is a porter outside KT stone in natimbi which ports you directly to Qvic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Pecannius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">time gets old fast, sure the loots are great and plentiful, but nothing is fun as good ol ToV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I voted for the elemental planes - I really liked seeing all the Gods (Xegony, Rathe Council, Corinav, Terris Thule, Rallos Zek, Mith Marr, Bertox, Solusek Ro...)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">ssra. I hated lots of things about it, but it also was very good in a lot of other ways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Boondowk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">eh I said old world as ive never had the chance to raid anything else. done grummus twice and ISP has shut me off both times right outside his room so still have not gotten that flag. I think my ISP works for SOE!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Temple of Veeshan. Dragons, and awesome architecture. Nothing beat that feeling of dread, like you really are not supposed to be there, and there was stuff just waiting around to rape you.<br />
<br />
And those flurry drakes!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I voted for VT because it gave me an excuse to load up on cigars, coffee, and bourbon.  All of which there was so little left of after Aten HaHa finally keeled over.  The people were what made those raids for me really, and I had a blast despite the long hours of endlessly rebuffing the pull team. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>GrishMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">No unnecessary clearing in Time?  It gets old really fast and P1-3 all seem unnecessary after the first 5-6 clearings, especially 1.  <br />
<br />
Inktu'ta seems pretty fun so far if a pain in the ass to add latecomers and I used to really enjoy Kael.  VP was a lot of fun way back when but I haven't been since the revamp.  Luclin raids never did much for me.  PoP is entirely a pain in the ass but it was fun for a while.  The endless backflagging ruined it for me though. <br />
<br />
ToV was the best, killing dragons &gt; all.  Maybe DoN will bring back that feeling but I somehow doubt it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zillanex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Not all heavy on raiding myself, but the time we spen't in temple of veeshan was awsome, one mistake and we where doomed, big nasty dragons with less then nice aoe spells.<br />
<br />
Was the most fun i had during any raids i have been to, sure kael is nice but not the same feel of imminent danger as in ToV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">ToV was/is/will always be my favorate raiding zone.<br />
I was in the only guild clearing tov at the time and it was a blast...one night i had damn near 20 deaths, it was a ****ing blast!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Balkamp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I chose ToV too, but I really enjoy the mini-raid targets in WoS. Pyrique, Tarn, Murk-Mommy, Hulc, Velitorin.... They are &quot;new&quot; &amp; at least a couple of them require a little bit of stimulating strategy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>ladikennoch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">.....Where's the &quot;I don't raid but still have fun&quot; option?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I chose Time.  My guild just got our first set of Uqua flags on Monday and even though some of the GoD raids are well organized, Im sick of them ATM.  Time, even the monotonous clearings of p1 and p2, is always fun for me.<br />
I despise Ikkinz of late, even though we still have about 2 or three more runs thourgh Ikk4 to get the rest of the guild flagged (only had 37 flags drop the first time)  Its sad to see all the Darkglints and Bloodlink rotting; even alts of alts have that stuff now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I chose Time because Ikkinz wasnt up there, and I either havn't raided the other places or didnt like them much (that or can't vote for 2 and I kinda like EPs too).  <br />
<br />
PoTime isnt bad, while you have to do p1 everytime p2/3 are down for 5.5 days so you can go kill the Gods at your own pace without having to do those 2 reptative phases again for a while.  EPs were fun because of the diversity of raiding in the cool zones.  PoAir was one of my favorite, dunno why exactly.  But as we've been farming time now since Oct and I'm getting pretty tired of it...Ikkinz would have to honestly be my first choice if it was up there (only cause we havn't passes the last one yet..working on it still).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">ikk was fun.. for about five minutes.  Then it just became the same raid, mostly cause you are in the same zone, just different mobs.  That's my only complaint about it, well, that and the loot for the third one sucked ass (endurance augments for all).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>cosikfin-eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">tacvi hands dowm only 1 trash mob per named and the named are still a challage</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>GeddarRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Hmmm... I loved the NToV days and even the farming of the gear in ToV was a lot of fun, but I had to go with VT purely due to the fact that the zone was much better looking to me.  Sleepers Tomb was also a great looking zone(Love the misty looking stuff) and waking the Sleeper was good stuff, but I liked the way VT worked a lot better just wish they would have played out that dark/light story line a lot better than they did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>darkark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I've only gone as far as the elemental planes so my choice was Ssra/VT. Hopefully that will change when we get to Time though :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">ToV - to me epic fantasy games are about killing dragons and nothing compares to ToV for that :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Kryscha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Can't beat ToV imo. PoP had some great raids, and I enjoyed flagging events like Baraguj Szzal (or whatever that monster in Torment(?) that ate you was) but frankly my first raids that I just LOVED were ToV, so that zone has always carried my special feeling.  Admittedly, Ssra was surprisingly fun as well, but Luclin wasn't out until after my guild was dying horribly to AoW over and over.  Yeah, I look back on those &quot;Good old days&quot; fondly :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">hmm pop was more the time when the masses raided I think, so plane of time as the highest is probably logical. In terms of true evaluation of the raiding areas, it looks like ToV is the winner. I myself voted ssra for being a self contained raiding zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I've always been a fan of the oldies.  Ssra/Vt for me )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Joril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Temple of Veeshan for me.   I always liked the events that required a shaman to actually be active.  like trying to get aary slowed asap, while trying to dodge the freaking mana drain ae.  if we slowed aary fast we won, if we didnt we usually wiped (least until we got better equiped from ToV ,-) ).  i usually gave up and planted myself underneath until she was slowed.  The flurry drakes were ALWAYS a lot of fun i thought, though everyone else hated them.  <br />
<br />
I cant remember the name of the dragon (and to lazy to look it up at work), but was near the end for us, but it required casters only.  melee sat on their butts the entire fight.  shaman were tasked with slowing of course, but also curing the MT and any casters that didnt time the ae properly.<br />
<br />
only thing i hated was when they change Vulak into a ring event.  We had just killed her the first time and were getting set to farm the devil out of ToV and they changed her.  that still pissses me off when i think about it.<br />
<br />
other zones had individual events i liked, but ToV stands out as my favorite over all for the feel of the zone, the fights, and overall fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Crushbone forever !!!!<br />
<br />
Seriously tho I have only done 1 MPG raid and we lost but I like the idea of having to break out of the mold and think about how to beat an encounter and not just smash and kill the named.  <br />
<br />
and as much and everyone else hates it I loved Uqua.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">and as much and everyone else hates it I loved Uqua.<br />
Your sicko !!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Jeis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">For me it was Inktu'tu cause the zone contained some the most fun events i have done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Ryam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">and as much and everyone else hates it I loved Uqua.<br />
<br />
Have to admit, I kinda liked it too. :p I heard so many bad things about it before I got there myself, but actually it was nice to see such concentrated effort from the raid, and each time we went in there we proggressed a little. Buffing was more of a pain than usual (I thought I would never have to mem Diaku again), but all in all it wasn't nearly as bad as I thought, and it felt like a challenge. :)<br />
<br />
2 successes so far (didn't count how many times we tried before succeeding), so can't say how long it takes before I'll start to hate it, doing it over and over again for reflags will probably get real boring pretty quick though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I agree. After the clusterf*ck zerg-o-rama dpsfest that every single Ikkinz mob was, Uqua was an awesome change of pace, where it focused on precision and strategy. You couldn't just fling bodies at something and have it fall over dead, then res people and move on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>BubbaQuell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I am fond of Riftseekers, which, of course, is not among the choices.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Time, simply because it still is the best time/effort  raidzone to quickly gear up people.  5h for 25+ usufull pieces can't be beat anywhere (unless you count qvic goats with 1 h for 6).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Tohlagos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Temple of Veeshan. Dragons, and awesome architecture. Nothing beat that feeling of dread, like you really are not supposed to be there, and there was stuff just waiting around to rape you.<br />

<br />
My thoughts exactly!   I felt like an intruder into a realm not meant for me.  A pesky little barbarian trying to toy with the might and glory of an ancient and powerful race.<br />
<br />
Toh</div></div><hr />
