<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I go kill stuff at Akheva zone area and watch and watch - finally after about 2 nights of doing this I see a worm wander by (his placeholder I am guessing) and kill him and keep watching and watching - no big worm.  Anyone know the secret to finding this brute?  Also spent a nite at chief camp in ME - 4.5 hours and not a single chief spawn - but great exp for my pl sk baby.  4arms don't seem to be dropping much loot anymore at the fort.  /Whine off.<br />

&lt;a href=&quot;http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=7560&quot;&gt;A Thought Stealer&lt;/a&gt;, and it's PH (the wandering worm 'a mind burrower' that isn't a trap) are on about a 5 hour, 40 minute timer +/- 20 minutes. According to info, the 60 thought stealer spawns about 1 in 4 PH, and if you are after the &lt;a href=&quot;http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=7158&quot;&gt;Ethereal Earring&lt;/a&gt;, seems like a less than 5% chance for it to drop.<br />
<br />
On the chief, it seems that VI's modified the PH for that. Formely I've seen that if you are in the corner (between the hill and ruins) then the closest mob to the little valley along the hill and corner of the ruins, if spawned a goranga Tribeseer, that would be the main PH for the Chief. Rumor had it that any mob around the tree could be a potential PH. Lately, I've seen first hand that the PH for the Chief is still a goranga tribeseer, but if the tribeseer pops next to the Chief spawn location (the mob location closest to the ruins, same back row as chief, just one mob to the left if you are on the hill with the ruins to your left.) then Chief has a good chance to spawn on the next repop.<br />

Good luck Grickk!!<br />

Nope.<br />
<br />
Chief can be any of the spawn points.  Ultra Rare and I've killed the Chief about 10 times w/o seeing the DI drop.  My brother uses my shaman to PL his SK there and he's seen about 15 chief spawns and finally got Gorgos his DI.<br />
<br />
Best of luck but you have better chances just waiting for Charissa and going for the Talisman of Benevolance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Duurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the feedback Gorgos, I've only posted what I've seen first hand while camping the Chief for days. And since Grickk is on the same server as me, just thought I'd tell him what I've seen, and what he can expect. Either way, Karana is messed up.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Latter on.....got 3 range items from chief (DI) last weekend as posted elsewhere.  2 of them within 30-40 minutes.   Pretty graphic!!  I was all smiley.  Still want to kill that worm - he has a variety of nice items I would want - gloves, ring, earring - would all tickle me pink.  OMG pink troll.  I always see chief in same spot - back left as you stand in corner, if that makes any sense to you.   Hiya Duurg!!!<br />
<br />
:)&gt;&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Duurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Congrats Grickk, I saw the other post!! Very impressive to get 3 DI's so quickly!<br />
<br />
As for the Thought Stealer... I wouldn't complain if I could get that earring of his but I won't set up camp for a mob every ~6 hours just yet. So if you do go for that, Good luck!!<br />
<br />
Good to see you again too!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Dumb luck on the 3 DI - wish I could take credit somehow.<br />
<br />
If I get big worm it will be an accident - I hang out near where he spawns sometimes just in case, but will never be able to time him.<br />
<br />
Too bad he so infrequent.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>leoice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I used to drool over that earring about a year ago for the high AC and wis, but these days its worthless because it has no sta or HP's, plus theres so many other good earrings out there too.</div></div><hr />
