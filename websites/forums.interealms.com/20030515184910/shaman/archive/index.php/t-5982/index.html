<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kraeger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Lvl 61-62, H I G H MR, use cold based DD. does NOT summon. Has a ****load of HPS. Meaning... sure, you can kite em. You can have a C3, you can run him. You can spend 3 hours doing it, but I think you can. Rangers can bowkite them easy, but we get resisted alot. You would need afflictionhaste 3 or something since Root would get resisted 99/100. So, malo run run run, Dot, run run run, Dot, run run run, try root and land an epic dot maybe...run run.  If you want to have some fun, you could always try tantor. He is in WW, lvl 63 and no summon. High MR but hits like a gimp.<br />
Always fun to solo nameds =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tallerlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">these are soloable, as I know a druid that does them.  Snare doesn't work on them, but he uses dots that cast in 5 seconds or less and kills them in about 45 minutes.  At level 60 he was getting a blue+ in AAxp per kill.<br />
<br />
We have several high damage dots that cast in 5 seconds, but one thing he said was, if you get hit you might as well bend over and die.  <br />
<br />
The one time I tried, I got one down past half and had to zone due to wolf adds, so make sure that you are watching for the wolves if you try.</div></div><hr />
