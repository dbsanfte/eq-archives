<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I just installed Mandrake Linux 10.1 on my computer, and my original plan was to save a partition for Windows, which I would only use for EQ.  The problem is that during the installation process I messed up my partitions, and now Windows is inaccesible.  I could reinstall it, but then I'd have to reformat that partition, which also happens to have all of my mp3s and photos and such, and which Linux can access just fine.<br />
<br />
So I considered doing something crazy like quiting EQ, until I discovered that WINE actually supports EQ now (it didn't when I did Linux a few years ago).  Supposedly it has some bugs, but I'm used to that, because this is EQ we are talking about.  I figure that I'll just pretend that every week is post-major-patch-SoE-forgot-to-test week, and I won't notice a thing.<br />
<br />
The only issue is that WINE development is paid for by this private company, and they want to make money by selling WINE to you.  I'm rather broke though, so I plan to download the source code for WINE, compile it, and use it to run EQ.  But since I've never compiled any program for Linux with downloaded source code, and certainly not anything as massive as WINE, I'm kind of lost.<br />
<br />
Therefore, I was wondering if A) anyone here uses Linux, and can give me some pointers on how I do this whole compile my own WINE executable from scratch thing, and B) if anyone here plays EQ on Linux through WINE, and can let me know what to expect in terms of bugs.<br />
<br />
Oh, I also heard you could run Windows through a virtual machine, but I know next to nothing about that, so if anyone does this I'd love to hear about it too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Qhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I haven't made EQ work on my linux machine, but mostly only because I don't play enough EQ to bother anymore (I keep a windows machine for gaming anyway).   However, I have made several things work with wine (Internet Explorer, MS Office, etc).<br />
<br />
Compiling wine shouldn't be too hard I wouldn't think.  In fact, there are likely some Mandrake RPMs floating around out there, or you could set up one of the package management systems (urpmi or apt?) under mandrake and try to install it that way.  If I recall, there are pretty detailed walkthroughs on getting wine installed, and they do require a good bit of config file editing, but its not anything too hard.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't bother with the virtual machines.  The best I know of is VMWare, and I don't think they have 3d support.  Besides that, its not free and runs noticeably slower being inside the VM unless you really have a top end machine.<br />
<br />
Check out http://www.pclinuxonline.com.  Its just basically a blog/news site of a guy that does alot with Mandrake, and on the left hand side near the bottom he has some nice links to RPMS and such.   <br />
<br />
Also, you mentioned that money was an issue, but I would highly suggest looking at Cedega (packaged version of wine with an installer for games).  I don't remember the cost, but I've seen it in action and it is very, very nice.  Makes installing games in Linux incredibly easy.  I think they are subscription based, and if so, you could subscribe, install as much as possible, and cancel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Phive</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Try this page (http://gentoo-wiki.com/HOWTO_WineX_CVS)<br />
<br />
Give this page a shot, it may or may not help. It is for the Gentoo dist, but can't hurt to read it.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Wow, once again Crucible=awesome. With all the suggestions provided here and in the tech forum thread, I got way more infor than I'd expected, and lots of ideas to work with tonight while listening to the candidates flame each other. My current plan is to try Angryor's fix for my Windows drive, then try the Gentoo Howto (I swear, the more I learn about Gentoo the more I wish I'd gone with it instead of Mandrake), and if none of that works I may just have to break down and pay for this Cedega thing everyone recommends. Thanks so much everyone for helping, I'll be sure to report back on how it goes.</div></div><hr />
