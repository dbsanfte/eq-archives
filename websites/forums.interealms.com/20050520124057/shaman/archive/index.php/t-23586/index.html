<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wallorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have not been on this site in a long while. I scanned a few posts and realized why. All you people do is come here and cry. It get old. Sure we have no one certain ability but we have ALWAYS been a jack of all trades. I personally think the aa's they are giving us are for the most part very nice. Whine...cry...moan gets old ya know. I am just disgusted with this webpage anymore. Enjoy what you have made it LOL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i don't mind being insulted.<br />
<br />
especially when it is by someone lvl 65, a crap load of AA, been thru Time, working thru GoD, has the TA, has all the spells; ect.<br />
<br />
what i do not care for is being insulted by the anonymous.<br />
<br />
for all i know, you are lvl 50, a buff bot,  not a main character, have no flags, no AA, ect.<br />
<br />
and untill you decide to expand on your qualifications to insult me, or anyone else on this board; shut the F* up</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Not everyone here whine and complain. Though they are the loudest, so heard the most often. There are many shaman here who work to better the shamans as a whole, and give tips to the individuals.<br />
<br />
Me? I mostly troll the boards, reading all the posts in this section. I get a big kick out of the people posting complaints about complainers. =P</div></div><hr />
