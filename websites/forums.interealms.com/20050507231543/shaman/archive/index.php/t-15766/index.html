<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I use tears of saryrn and velium strike alternating on VT bosses for DPS, and I noticed tonight tears was often only hitting for 2 waves, (the 3rd never happened, not resisted or anything, just no message about the 3rd wave at all).  anyone else have this problem? and a possible solution?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">if mob is pushed oor rains dont track , they stay where they are cast, i assume ya know this though, but no i have not had this problem =/ no clue what could be causing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gorg Grimm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Unless its changed pets suck up one wave of our rain spells.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">They changed rains quite some time ago. Pets don't eat a wave.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I noticed this in VT as well.  Especially on a walled or cornered mob, rains only hit twice.  Zone specific I think as I've never seen this in other zones.  <br />
<br />
Just switch to Velium strike.  With Fury3 and a little planar fury, you can really drop a bomb!  Specially with spell haste and cleric haste and a dmg focus item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ranger can nuke better than us<br />
<br />
if in long fight, I just chain cast between tear of saryn and torent of poison, that is ubber fast dps; velium strike take really long to cast :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I actually saw a rain follow the targetted mob once.  Probabl just a fluke or lag.  But I swear that the raid followed the mob I had targetted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>KaerzanMM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have always had a problem with my rains, sometimes they don't hit at all, like i'll be in the middle of some mobs and cast it on one of them, and it either hit a few and the rest get resisted, or it just doesn't take at all, so i just quit using them</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Rains only do a maximum of 3 waves of damage to a single target, or 4 hits if there are multiple targets. For example, if you cast it on a cluster of 4 mobs, you will get only 1 wave of damage against each one. If you cast on a single mob, you only get 3 waves of damage. If you cast on a pair of mobs, you'll get 2 waves against each one (this assuming the mobs always stay under the rain area). <br />
<br />
The waves do take time so it is possible that a moving mob could get hit, move away, and come back and be hit again - but usually if they move out from under the rain area you'll lose the rest of the damage. If you get caught under the rain area, you will take damage as well - and I believe that damage is not counted against the number of waves/hits. Pets and other pc's (on blue servers) do not take any damage or subtract from the number of waves/hits. <br />
<br />
Rains also do not generate as much aggro as our dots or slow, so they are very good spells to use in a group once the melees have a mob occupied. Though, resistances vary and often some or all the waves get resisted entirely.<br />
<br />
I was in a pickup group in HoH once recently and this group had no tanks. It was a wizard, a couple druids, a bard, and me. The druids were pulling and kiting while everyone else sent in pets/charmed pets or dotted or blasted. I started casting rain on the pull if they had an add, and that got the wizard and druids started doing the same. Pretty soon they were pulling 2-4 mobs at a time and the druid would run them in tight circles while we rained them to death. Worked pretty nicely, and it was the first group I was in in a long time where I didnt even have to bother slowing. Yeah, I know it's just quad-kiting - dont ask me why the druids and wizard werent doing it before I got there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Im totally assuming but since it was a boss mob i think it would be single and it would still register hitting multiple targets<br />

on a seperate subject i noticed u edited your sig steelbear was it illegal?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kraglar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have another question about rains for all those of you who play on red servers.  A while ago there was a &quot;fix&quot; to AEs hitting member of your raid if you're on a teams PvP server.  For some odd reason a good number of my rains won't effect PCs, but then other times they will get hit by a least one or two of my rains ... was just curious if anybody else is noticing this or what.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It was cornered, I guess that's it, kinda wish rains would be useful, as they're our safest DPS on big fights like that, trying to break 100DPS with dots always gets me killed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">on a seperate subject i noticed u edited your sig steelbear was it illegal?<br />
<br />
Yeah, they can only be 250X100 which is pretty dinky.  :p I'm making mine sideways now cause it looks better that way if it's gotta be so small.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Also, if you lose line of sight off your target, the rain stops. Was told by a wizard in HoT, didnt believe him, so I tested it for 15 minutes and its true, once you lose LoS your rains stop. This may be related to issues with the walls</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">With the ornate glove focus you can chain Spear of Troment for 100 DPS at the same mana as velium strike.  110 DPS with BoR.  I doubt you get much more DPS out of the rains with the usual resist/miss rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">You can get much more out of the rains, you just have to be fighting the right kind of mobs. In BoT for example, I found that the south wing is great for poison rains because the sand giants rarely resist it and you can dish out full damage on most of them. In north however, just about every type of damage spell we have (poison, disease, cold) is resisted 9 out of 10 times. East I think I found disease dot was the only thing that worked reliably.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I parsed about 120DPS on them once with rain and velium strike, I was going to try 2 rains but I was only getting 2 waves on most so I had to stop.<br />
<br />
The other important thing is with canni5, raid mana regen, and my horse I was able to maintain that DPS for nearly 15 mins before OOMing, I'm not sure I could keep up that long with just spear of torment, <br />
<br />
as a side note: my DPS with just rabid bear on the same mob with a 25/25 weapon was about 15</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Nod, mob is moving.<br />
<br />
I use rains all the time these days, and nukes(btw the long cast times are nice..in a way..you can chain cast them and not use hardly any mana)...dots are just too f'd up with the aggro to use in groups(unless I want aggro).<br />
<br />
Not only that, but with mana preservation velium strike also only casts 255 mana, with damage focus you're looking at crits for 2164, which makes velium strike more attractive.</div></div><hr />
