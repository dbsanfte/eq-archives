Words of Revenant dropped in CT last night, not sure off of what though.<br />
<br />
Also Staff shard of Luclin seems to be dropping pretty regularly, as at least 5 have been found by my guild members, though I am not sure where.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">We get a lot of the research items in VT.<br />
<br />
I have heard of some dropping in ssra as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>hillaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I hope thats not all the places they drop because if it is we are just as screwed as we used to be. I love Sony they give you some hope then screw you. Oh well I really did not expect anymore then we got witch from what I can tell so far is nothing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">merged the two threads on this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Staff shard of luclin, seen it off mobs in the 52-56 level range in a few different zones in LoY.<br />
<br />
Someone mentioned seeing some Yaeth pages dropping in PoJ off Sentry mobs and in PoD off oozes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>ShakoBoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">From the looks of it so far, the components only drop off of creatures equal in lvl to the lowest lvl spell that component can make.  So to get lvl 60 spell components, you have to kill lvl 60 mobs, unless that spell component is also able to make lower lvl spells, which in that case it will drop on mobs equal to the lower lvl spell it can make.  That sounded confusing just typing it, hope you guys can understand me heh :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Walgurorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">PoJ basement seems to be quite good with words.  I picked up one of the ones needed for Malo there.  CT also seems to be good.  While there hunting for blood we got one of the words needed for Torpor.</div></div><hr />

Yaeth 73 R - Dulak Harbor, in the Luggald Caves, but waaaay deep (the very further room we could find)<br />
<br />
Numerous other words/ runes/ bolts of tallon, etc off the yard trash (mostly goo) in PoD too, but they arent shaman related, so I didnt write down the names :)<br />
<br />
Anyone seen/ know where Dew Clover drops yet? =/<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">And the point is, is that even if the components for Topor/Malo drop in nasty zones, we will see *more* copies on sale. And as we know, this means that the price of the actual spells themself will eventually start to drop. Which has got to be a good thing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Here is how to make a complete list for a given component : <br />
<br />
1)Find the lowest level spell the component is used for. <br />
2)Make a list of all mobs of that level. <br />
3)Delete any mobs that are flagged as never dropping any loot of any sort. <br />
4)You are done.</div></div><hr />

I agree it doesn't need to stay in the general section, but at least until the EQ trader's list is complete, and then we could just provide a link at the top of the spell section.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Orgak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">What does dew clover look like?<br />
<br />
Ironically, it looks like a 3-leaf green clover.  I'm surprised it didn't have a box or bone chips icon.   :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
I'd post a pic, but I used mine.   :D</div></div><hr />

You just have to look at the icon.  If it looks like the left half of the page, with a jagged right edge, then it's the Left side.  If it looks like the right half of a page, with a jagged left edge, then it's the Right side.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Skitzoid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I personally got Sliver of Moonstone off Phinny in kk. I was helping a friend farm him for the robe and one of the kills he dropped sliver of moonstone(it looks like valor crystal). I bought the other components and researched everlasting breath, which I've still yet to use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Pumyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Well since this system of making spells has come out spells are no more common on Abayle and are just as stupidly priced. <br />
Pretty hopeless as a way to get more spells in circulation which for Shamen is still a massive problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">From Santero:<br />
&quot;Is the emp room in Sebilis a good place to farm research components for high-lvl spells?&quot;<br />
<br />
No, it is not.  I have killed the Emp 8 times since the research change.  Neither he nor the Blood, or their placeholders, have dropped any research components.  Emp has driopped one shaman spell so far - Tigir's Insects   8(<br />
<br />
I suspect that the advice above for listing mobs (all mobs of level less those that never drop any loot) is too simplistic.  Also, I did not see any component drops in Nadox, although many mobs were 51 or higher, and would therefore be potential droppers.<br />
<br />
I do suspect that the drops are coming from a large variety of mobs in zones hunted by the &quot;Ubers&quot; - just because the bubbub seems to have died down so quickly.</div></div><hr />
