I came out of Echo Caverns getting 1% per kill so... was wondering if there are any good places for alvl 50 shaman to get about the same xp as echo</div></div><hr />

The Gnoll Cave in JPF was nice to level in.  I spent a good deal of time there and made nice solo exp.</div></div><hr />

I was just hunting in Dulak and found exp to be average so i decided to adventure into nadox, boom!<br />
<br />
Theres 3 elementals as you get in. abhorrent one beng easiest and scorned slightly more HP's. They all single pull so ou basically pull with slow (sometimes resisted but never malosied, just try again and it will land). You then apply Ebolt and melee in the face with a hastened dogdog and reapply Ebolt. After this its up to you but i usually back off when the elemental has 1red hp and canni while dogdog tanks and finishes it off. In total with canning etc for next fight each mob takes around 6 mins. This totals to 18 mins and the respawn on everything in nadox is 23 mins so it gives you a chance to chill ;). <br />
<br />
But this is the unbelievable part, each kill gives 2.5%-3% exp each!<br />
<br />
Enjoy<br />
<br />
PS. (keep it hush, atm no ones ever camping it on my server but if it gets outs........;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I stayed in echo caverns. The TM room killing the skeletons and the task master gives you roughly 1% per kill. <br />
<br />
You can also kill anything in the room before the taskpmaster and pick up small xp hits which will add up to 1-5% eventually =p<br />
<br />
My tactics consisted of...<br />
<br />
Alacrity and HoS my dog.<br />
Alacrity, HoS, and Cholorplast Myself. <br />
<br />
Mem: Those 3, Togors insects, and instill, and fury<br />
<br />
Those 6 are all you really need.<br />
<br />
Pull with slow, make your pet attack the mob before it gets to you. By doing this your dog will take the first hit which is normally the highest hit that you will take in this zone. After this move in and start melee. <br />
<br />
With cholor, KEI, fury, and HoS. I never went below 80% hp. Neither did dog. <br />
<br />
I got 49-51 here in 1 day of about...... 6 hours total.</div></div><hr />

I've been at that spot since 46 and was getting about 3-4 % per kill then.  At 50, I get about 2.5% per kill.  It's a great spot, wish there were about 5 of them instead of three.  BTW, if you have time, zone out, kill the PH on the right side if it isn't the named guard.  He drops a nice neck or ring.</div></div><hr />

There are 4 of them - if you go out into the lava, there's anther one a little way out under on the bottom. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ya know, when I'd bring my druid in here I could see four on track but couldn't find the fourth with my shaman.  When I go all the way out to the edge of the rocks and hit F8 I still don't get a target either.  Swimming in lava to find targets isn't my idea of a good time either. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shaben</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Not a lot of fun, no...but with a flame resistant buff it doesn't hurt that much! Plus, it's just tooooo slow without doing that one too<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Absurdum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">There are 5 of them and pulling from the lava isn't too bad. If you want to know more check out my posts in the 40-50 forums.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>papiraul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Accually there is 7 of them.. there is 2 more at the very and of the lava river.. With some fire resist and some running along the wall they are easy to pull aswell..</div></div><hr />
