Have already copy/pasted the link to the slowabilty chart, and will also do the Omens spell turn ins soon. I have and will give full credit plus links to the Crucible. <br />
<br />
CR died on the old boards and will at UGO too eventually, except for the off topic folks. I am trying my best, and it looks singlehandedly to gather some information. Any who would like to help please feel free to PM on the UGO forums I am KB there. <br />
<br />
Thank you, and I will refrain from further cannibalization until given permission from an admin or mod. <br />

<br />
The other compilations, however, are usually the work of the compiler. I don't know if a mod here will give you permission to reproduce a poster's work; you might be better off asking the posters themselves, either through PM, or as a reply to the post you want to duplicate.<br />
<br />
It might be more easier all around to just have a reference post on those boards linking to what you feel are the most informative works over here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KB1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">A link is pretty much all I am giving other than a description of said link in my own words.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KB1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Also, I have enjoyed your work here and on TNZ feel free to post any thing you wish in the shaman section on the new CR forums.</div></div><hr />
