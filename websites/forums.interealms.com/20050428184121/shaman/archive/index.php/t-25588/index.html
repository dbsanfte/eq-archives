Anyway, i need a nice place to level. :)</div></div><hr />

I agree STV is horrible, I stayed maybe one level there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Desolace, Shimmering Flats, Alterac, Swamp of Sorrows etc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Desolace, Arathi, and Shimmering Flats in 1k needles took me to 38, then I did STV for a bit before I got sick of it and moved on to feralas, tanaris, and swamp of sorrows..  And yes, the alliance population there is high on every server.  It it probably the most active ganking zone in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Arathi Highlands... go to Hammerfall, get your flight path and do some quests from there.  There are some quests to kill raptors etc.<br />
<br />
STV actually wasn't too bad on Silver Hand, and from what I've heard, we're one of the higher pop servers too.  I did every quest out of Grom'gol and Nesingwary's Camp and most of them out of Booty Bay as well.  Obviously this isn't a PvP server :).  It seems that STV is one of the areas we're alliance/horde quests start to overlap and there can be some competition for mobs, but overall, it was ok for me.<br />
<br />
Personally, I avoided Desolace like the plague at mid-30's.  Some friends did the faction quests there and reported killing like 400 hundred mobs and still being neutral or whatever.  Didn't sound like fun.  I did run through to grab my Maraudon quests though ;).<br />
<br />
Depending on your class, Shimmering Flats seems a bit high... Thousand needles is probably excellent still though.  I'm sensitive to this as a warrior since my miss rate on mobs more than a level above me is horrid. [EDIT: Sorry, I take that back... 1k Needles is probably gray at 37 for the most part, even Steelsnap is like 31 only?]</div></div><hr />

No.<br />

I have seen the same places you have. This is only the second area i have been in that is in high contest. Infact its not that its in high contest, it just seems that alliance population is high there, must be a lot of quests or near a outpost or something. Hillsbrad was highly contested but it was more even. Attacks would come and counter attacks would be mounted, areas would be battled for and held while quests went on. In SVT the alliance just flat out own it on my server, the only place you can even think about quests is right by grom gul or whatever its called. Anyplace else expect to die and run a good distance back.<br />
<br />
In otherwords, stop with the care bear preaching :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seriously Lit. As much of a proponent of PVP as you are, the last thing you should do is complain about &quot;ganking&quot;. Especially considering how you berated me for my stance against unrestricted PVP.<br />
<br />
Don't sweat it though. If you ever decide you've had enough of PVP, there's always a place for ya in my &quot;carebear&quot; guild on Garona (where we can hunt/exp wherever the hell we want to).</div></div><hr />

<br />
What started the &quot;uncool&quot; was your calling me condescending in another thread where I posted my opinions about unrestricted PVP, then you started you own thread whining about not being able to do what you want on an open PVP server for the very reasons I stated I didn't like the current PVP rulesets.<br />
<br />
Don't tout the virtues of something when someone else is expressing their (less than favorable) opinions of it, then do the same thing yourself and get upset when you're called out for it. That's called being a &quot;hypocrite&quot; (quotes added to emphasize and call attention to it in the same manner as your calling me condescending).<br />
<br />
I'd call it karma. You can call it whatever you'd like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Its not karma, its called spitefullness. Fact is you WERE condencending in that thread. You had this &quot; pve is so much better then pvp &quot; attitude, i called the kettle black cause it was. If you wanna harbor that and keep it in the back of your mind then strike at me with it when you think the time is right thats your deal brother. I hold no ill will against you, im just suprised.<br />

I thought friends could tell each other when they were acting goofy. Apprently your not my friend your some dude on the shaman forum. Its clear now sir, ill be more sensitive to your feelings in the future sir.<br />

Yikes! The high-pitched whine in this part nearly broke my monitor's screen.  :eek:   Maybe the negative rep ding was just &quot;in jest dude.&quot;  After all, this is just a simple forum about a silly game with no links to the real world.  Your &quot;real-life&quot; reputation is still perfectly safe.  :rolleyes:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yet another stupid thread about PVP vs PVE.<br />
<br />
It seems this is the single most hotly debated topic about the game. Nothing else drives wedges between old gaming associates than which server type to play on, then which faction. I know several former guildmates are playing either on a different server (for different rules) or are playing on my server, but are playing the opposite faction.<br />
<br />
WoW, while a helluva lot of fun in most aspects gets a huge &quot;F&quot; for it's design that splits up friends.<br />
<br />
I'll promise you this Litgruv, this will be my last post ever regarding PVP vs PVE. It's a dead horse with me at this point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Damn.  Can't neg rep him this soon.Appears we have an admission of anon neg rep bumping. I've never seen your name signed to any of my hits, pos or neg.<br />
<br />
My my Juujuu, how nutless of you.<br />
<br />
At least I had the brass to sign mine (both Lit's and the one you just got).<br />
<br />
What a jackass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Lit you'll have to explain something to me.  * IF * on a PvP server your 'tag' is on 24/7, isn't or rather shouldn't you expect to be ganked?<br />
<br />
To me it's like some g&amp;y guy walking into a brothel and complaining about the selection.  Or better yet, walking into said brothel and getting hit on by women (just doing their job FYI - not that I would know about that) then griping.<br />
<br />
Or a vegetarian going to Outback and asking the waiter why there isn't a &quot;veggie special.&quot;<br />
<br />
FWIW I couldn't play on a PvP server for that exact reason.  Like Val said, when I PvP I want it to be at a time and place of my choosing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">STV is AWESOME.<br />
I know people that stayed there from 29 to 45 easily. There is so much to do between grom gol and booty bay the only reason why u may want to leave is if the jungle settign gets to you after so many levels of being  there. As for the PVP jesus u made a choice man live with it. Horde is outnumbered on virtually every server pvp or no. You picked the &quot;losing&quot; side pvp wise so really you shoul dnot complain. Come play on a pve server we get enough pvp here as it is.<br />
<br />
<br />
Good luck lit</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Uthgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Once you come to terms with dying then getting ganked does not mean much. To me its like that hill giants in west commons that would wander up and kills you. People have the EQ mentalilty where dying is painfull. In WoW dying to a player is meaningless. If you treat it that way then its not a big deal.<br />
<br />
For me PvP has added a few elements too the game I did not anticipate. You get allot more player interaction with each other. I spend time with my lower level guild mates being bodygaurd. In some zones like STV you NEED to group with your friends or guildmates just to survive. There has been many times I have met friends just because i happened by when they are getting ganked. I will stop and assist even if I die. My friends list is filling up pretty fast. I like the Cavalry charging over the hill feeling.  <br />
<br />
Personally i think a solo player on a PvP server is going to have a rough road to 60. Solo players are prime target for gankers. When I want to just focus on soloing and seeing some new zones I play a paladin on a PvE server (Lothar). There are no rules that says you have to focus on one style of play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">You know whats funny. Everyone saying that im whining. I look back at my posts and all they ask is if there is another place to level. I dont recall complaining about pvp at all. Interesting<br />
<br />
On that note I pass the drama off to you guys as i step back into MY path.  All i wanted to know is if there was a better place to solo. I love PvP, im not complaining at all, i dont feel care bears are benieth me, we each offer something to people that need it and its my personal choice to live a lil more on the edge. I love it.<br />
<br />
<br />
So there ya have it, it is what it is. Enjoy the game brothers.<br />
<br />
I guess im heading back to STV, just have to be on my toes. Too many quests there to miss. Plus its fun messing with alliance. Thnx for the input all, positive and negitive, cause even if its negitive it can open a door to a perspective that is useful. Which it has.<br />

<br />
<br />
Just a quick reply...<br />
<br />
<br />
I do expect it, infact i love it. But sometimes that area is a lil heavy on the alliance side. Its hard to explain unless you play PvP perhaps. All i know is, its one thing to battle for your exp or area, its another to rez, die rez die rez die rez die rez die, i think you got the point. Hence my inquiry to another area.<br />

If signing your name to anonymous reputation bumps on an anonymous messageboard is your sign of bravery, then you sir are a guinine hero among the people.   :rolleyes: <br />

<br />
What chafed me the wrong way was when someone berated me for my opinion (in another post), then later came back and posted an argument (whine, if you will) based on the same side of that very argument they previously called me &quot;condescending&quot; for supporting. Then they get upset when questioned about it and the irony of their latest grievance/post in relation to the previous thread is put in the spotlight.<br />
<br />
Here Juujuu, let me clear that up for you.<br />
<br />
My previous argument for not liking unrestricted/open PVP:<br />
<br />
Paraphrased: &quot;I don't like having to watch over my shoulder so I don't get ganked while out hunting for exp.&quot;<br />
<br />
Litgruv's current argument for not liking unrestricted/open PVP in STV:<br />
<br />
Paraphrased: &quot;I'm looking for another zone to exp in because I don't like having to watch over my shoulder so I don't get ganked while out hunting for exp.&quot;<br />
<br />
Did that clear it up for ya? I know I might have typed that too fast for ya. If so, go back and read it again a few times. I'm sure even you will be able to find the similarities in the two arguments.<br />
<br />
The hypocracy and irony in this thread is astounding.<br />
<br />
Bottom line? Don't complain about something you've previously been a staunch supporter of. If you do, you should expect those you opposed previously to remind you of your former position. Stings sometimes. I've been on both sides of these types of situations myself and ate my share of crow over it. The difference is, I owned up to mine and even publicly asked for someone to &quot;pass the salt, cuz this crow is kinda bland&quot; (a post on the official CoH forums a while back).<br />
<br />
Glad you found some sort of &quot;enlightenment&quot; out of this Litgruv. Offer still stands if you ever come to PVE on Garona. EoA or SoA would gladly take ya.</div></div><hr />

Your words mean about as much to me as calling me a cowardly anon voter, not having the balls to come out and say who I vote for in elections.  It's set to anon.  It's my own damn business to say who I am if I feel like it.  If I don't, well, too ****ing bad for you.

Paraphrased:  &quot;I'm looking for another zone to exp in because the population of alliance to horde in STV is about 5:1 and no matter how much I'm watching over my shoulder, being vastly outnumbered isn't the type of pvp environment I wish to hunt in and want to find other hunting grounds where the Alliance:Horde population is more balanced.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Well, I've never signed any of them I've left for you.  I said flat out I leave them for you.  You seem to have pretty good detective skillz there Sherlock.  BUSTED.   :rolleyes: <br />
ANON neg rep bumping which is about as cowardly as it gets. I might put forth the notion that fleeing out of a burning building, pushing senior citizens out of the way to save yourself might be more cowardly.  I'd tend to think that walking up to a drunk person passed out in an alleyway and kicking him in the stomach just for laughs would be more cowardly.  I'd think that driving past someone at 30 miles per hour yelling that people are pussies out the window might be more cowardly.  Then again, my using the rep system exactly how it's designed might also be the most cowardly thing anyone has ever done.  Ya.  That's definately it.<br />
<br />
And NOT signing them is the childish act.<br />
I know you are but what am I?  Damn man.  What's childish is when people specificly like you neg rep someone solely because they just neg repped you.  Ya.  Good going there.  It's because of your childish type of behavior why I don't sign negative ones.  But just for you, since you are so set on thinking I'm being childish, I guess I'll have to send you a negative rep every chance I can, just to let you know I care.  :)<br />
<br />
*YOU* are part of the problem with the rep system here.<br />
No.  I use it as it's designed.  If anyone is part of the problem, it's Sunmoon who owns the messageboard and leaves the rep system as it is.  Yell at him.  Your holier than though attitude is really tiring.<br />
<br />
Good lord Juujuu. The point of your long drawn out version is exactly the same as my shorter version. You merely elaborated on the reason why. It amazes me that you can't see the similarity, and the identical nature of the reasoning and logic.<br />
The reason why is the entire meaning of it.  There's a difference between single person fights, or group vs group fights, or raids vs other raids, and having an entire raid hunting a single or group of people.  One of them is why he plays pvp.  One of them is just rape.  He's dealing with the unbalanced number of alliance out there, and finding different hunting grounds where he can once again get back to the reason he's actually playing on a pvp server.  The &quot;why&quot; is the most important part, and in your statement that amounts to &quot;i'm tired of pvp and want to run away from it&quot; which is undeniably false.<br />
<br />
Welcome to ignore. You're not worth my time.<br />
Well, apparently I am worth your time since you so took the time to reply to what I said, and left me a bunch of stuff to rip up once again.  You are a retard (now THAT was childish!).  I give logical reasons for things.  You throw a tantrum when somewhat disagrees with the gospel that is Valgoth.  Guess what.  You aren't right.  I've shown why you aren't right.  Now you are running home to mommy because you can't handle being shown that you are wrong, and exactly why you are wrong.<br />
<br />
Dumping me on ignore.  I think we have a new candidate for the most cowardly thing ever.</div></div><hr />

Ok, not really, but damn. This entire thread is getting silly.<br />

Time to move on to bigger and better things.<br />

I'm glad you two have gotten over it, even if some other *cough* people are still trying to inflame the thread.  I guess some people really DO only come here for the Jerry Springer BS.  Disappointing, because it makes it harder to find the game-related goodness.<br />

I don't have anyone here on my forum ignore list. I may not care for what Juujuu and a few select others have to say in some cases, but I know how to skip to the next post if I don't want to read something.<br />
<br />
Mill, I certainly hope you were agreeing with Cappi on the &quot;rep system vs PVE/PVP&quot; discussions and not being about being an ass with quoting Juujuu just to try and irritate. Please say it ain't so!? :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">On topic, good idea.<br />
<br />
I can't remember the name of the zone, maybe someone can help me out.  We were only there briefly, but there seemed to be a good half dozen quest guys there (that we had to skip because our log was already full), and the area seemed to be lvl 35+.<br />
<br />
To get there, you fly to Thousand Needles, then head NW, pass a tiny NE outpost, and keep heading north-ish NW-ish.  I think it's primarily a troll villiage, but the name escapes me.<br />
<br />
No idea if it's got a lot of traffic on a PVP server, but we didn't pass a single alliance soul on the way there.  Saw a couple of taurans, and that was it.<br />
<br />
I THINK Neeru (the guy in Orgrimmar you dealt with for a Ragefire quest) has a &quot;go talk to this guy&quot; quest for the place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Camp majo-something, in Feralas? Little high for 37, the bears and wolves start at 40-42 and everrything goes up from there, but a great place in the 40's, depending on gank factor. It tends to be primarity horde controlled on our server, for now. Windrider there.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Sounds more like desolace ~ troll village and all. Neeru sends you there to finish the next set of burning blade quests in thunder axe fortress.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Oh and duskwallow marsh is nice for low 30's, and scales up to 40's further in.</div></div><hr />

Actually, better to say starting at lvl 34.  Was there last night at 31 with my 39 hunter friend and he was pretty much soloing.  Couldn't hit anything with maxxed axe and staff skills and only landed about 35-40% of my spells.  At 31 I had a noticably higher aggro radius than my friend and we got loads of adds, not that it was a problem for him, but still.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Dustwallow was our place for sure in the mid 30's to low 40's. Desolace is gank central. Not sure about alliance, but horde has a small town right in the middle of everything, lower stuff to the north, higher as you go south.<br />
The beach in Dustwallow is particularly appealing, if not ganked, turtles and murlocs will take you far.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Saw TONS of alliance in Desolace.  That was where my pvp flag got bugged to permanent-on status for half the night, and we had an absolute blast decimating people who figured they'd gank the vulnerable shaman in a couple rounds, and then clean up the rest of the group.  How were they to know +stamina is 3x any other of my stats?  *grin* <br />
<br />
Thanks, Mill, I think it IS Camp somethingorother, and you're likely right about the level range.  We found it at 40 and it was a bit low for our preference, so I was guessing.<br />
<br />
And MMMMMM, turtle scale armor = heaven.  Even if the tunic does resemble a little scaled half shirt.  :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">At 37-41 there is a cove (Faldir's) to the South of Arathi Highlands.  I have done all five quests there on two different toons and have NEVER seen another person there - Horde or Alliance.<br />
<br />
To get there travel near Stromgarde then follow the outer wall to the left. You will enter a small valley, at the end of the valley look up and to your left for a small cave.<br />
<br />
Travel through the cave and head NNE.  Will be an Ogre (Talk to him first to activate first quest) a ship and a slew of random characters.<br />
<br />
The quests here can be done in one night's playtime.</div></div><hr />
