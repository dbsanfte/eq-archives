<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Retron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Apologies if this is already known by you all, but reading a thread on the SOE boards has made me reconsider AGI buffs.<br />
<br />
I know AGI won't make you run faster (although it's amazing how many think it does), and even Wrulan only adds a few AC, making it not seem worthwhile. I still cast it out of courtesy, and usually I click it off straight after to save a buff slot.<br />
<br />
However, this thread:<br />
<br />
http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum4/HTML/050738.html<br />
<br />
has made me think twice. I didn't realise that AC is a composite of mitigation/avoidance until now, and it seems that AGI adds to the Avoidance part of your AC. If you can get +10 to avoidance for a simple AGI buff, that seems worthwhile to me (and that works out at around a 2.5% boost in the avoidance AC). <br />
<br />
The other thing I didn't realise (from that thread); adding &amp;debug=true to a Magelo URL gives a chart showing how the AC is derived. So, in my case, the 11 AGI I get from my gear gives +3 avoidance - not much, but every little helps, I say! :)<br />

<br />
That said, It's the first one I click off when I need space.  It's nice to have and is outstanding for helping people raise neglected defensive skill, but once thats done it goes to the bottom of the buff pile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I buff agi because every meathead err...melee that I group with wants me to. I usually click if off if I need the buf room, but unless Im raiding there is very rarely a need to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Perhaps in situations with mid-range melee where Agi is not close to maxxed this has an application, but I can usually only throw on 1-3 AC with Wrulans etc on my tanks.<br />
<br />
I would never deny anyone the buff, but I don't get requests for Agi because, outside of a simulator, you simply can't remove enough variables to prove it has any worthwhile effect on mitigation/avoidance.</div></div><hr />

what i did was add extra agility to my magelo by deleting some other stats; since i dont list having planar power AA i of course cant go above 280 agi.  Assuming this shows us some secret thing..you'll notice buffing agility 136 points adds a whopping 20 avoidance AC and increases overall AC 14 points.  In conclusion, just say no to AGI buffs as they arent doing anything but giving you a placebo.<br />

I think 7~ AC for every 30 agi or something.<br />

But if your Agi is under 75, you take fairly significant AC drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I buff agi when asked, even the one tank in my guild who's at 276 agi (without planar power) and always asks for it!<br />
<br />
However, I have wondered how much difference it really makes. I have heard vague things about it helping particularly in conjunction with LR5.<br />
<br />
I have read up about it a fair bit - including the various tank message boards. I came across a vague reference to the shaman board having parsed the effects of agility some time ago and come to the conclusion that it was minimal.<br />
<br />
Can anyone remember this? I couldn't find it on search at all.<br />
<br />
Also, has anyone actually done any solid parsing on the effects of agility combined with LR5? It seems to me that this would be a valuable test which should prove for once and all whether agility has an effect.<br />
<br />
If no-one has seen any parses, well... I don't parse, but I may well grab a LR5 tank (only at LR1 myself) and go and do it myself. Can anyone suggest a suitable mob to parse on?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">You can parse till the cows come home, but first you need to:<br />
<br />
1.  Get a LR5 tank to max Agi with no gear to remove possible avoidance/mitigation variables coming from AC and armor.<br />
2.  Send in the mobs!  Ideally a sample size of 30+ per mob type per zone, but a smaller sampling could be ok.  You will also want to keep the level range of the mobs consistent to avoid that becoming a factor. <br />
3.  Buff the max Agi gearless tank with Agi buffX.<br />
4.  Repeat step 2<br />
5.  Get a max Agi gearless tank with identical stats to the 1st subject, but without LR5 and repeat steps 1-4.<br />
6.  Independently analyze data from groups and then compare data between your subjects and between mobs in all conditions.<br />
7.  Hunt for a way to remove any other variables I missed and run new tests! :p<br />
<br />
You will prolly see a difference between mobs due to varying attack etc and this data could be averaged to provide a more general picture of the effect of Agi on a character with/without LR5.<br />
<br />
Trying to use EQ as a testbed for the effects of individual stats and their relationship to mobs is pretty frikkin hellish IMO and I have yet to see any &quot;tests&quot; that did not have some massive flaw.  You really need a simulator or too much time on your hands. =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Well, I agree that parsing can have flaws.<br />
<br />
What I was intending to do was much simpler:<br />
<br />
Get a LR5 tank, remove some of his gear if necessary to get his agi down to around 150ish.<br />
<br />
Parse him tanking a single mob for a long time while I keep him healed for the duration.<br />
<br />
Buff his agi only (maybe add some +agi only items if we can), and parse him tanking the same mob for a similar length of time.<br />
<br />
This simple experiment should be sufficient to determine the answer to the simple question: Does agi have a noticeable effect on tanking with an LR5 tank?<br />
<br />
If agi has no noticeable effect with LR5, I think it would be safe to say it has no noticeable effect without CA and LR AA too, but that's a different set of parses anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hehe, what makes you think we don't?<br />
<br />
My typical raid buff line up:<br />
<br />
All the time:<br />
Voice of Quellious (C5)<br />
Focus of the Seventh/Focus of Soul<br />
Spiritual Dominion<br />
Protection/Blessing of the Nine<br />
Symbol/Mark of Kazad<br />
Brell's Stalwart Shield<br />
Endurance of the Boar<br />
Blessing/Aura of Reverence<br />
Guard of Druzzil (most of the time)<br />
One slot for heal over time<br />
<br />
That's 10 slots right there always filled up (well 9 and one spare).<br />
<br />
Situationally:<br />
Talisman of the Tribunal<br />
Protection of Seasons<br />
Dead Men Floating (resist or lev)<br />
Bulwark of Vie<br />
Mount<br />
One slot for detrimental (so it doesn't overwrite something valuable)<br />
SoE if we're moving<br />
<br />
On top of that, I often have to click off haste, agi, Spirit of the predator, and anything else that I don't need.<br />
<br />
So yes, I usually click off SoE/SoW. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Kianor, there are two basic flaws with your proposed design to test Agi and LR5 relationships.  First, you are going to need identical tanks with and without LR5 tested before the Agi buff to create a basline for comparison.  Second, you need to separate Agi form the visible AC it introduces, so both tanks will need to be at max Agi before you introduce the buffs.  Otherwise you just end up testing Agi and AC together and make it impossible to have any valid conclusions.  <br />
<br />
You will be left asking &quot;was it the added Agi or was it the added AC or, for that matter, was it just some other unseen variable from all that equipment that created my results&quot;???<br />
<br />
I wish there was an easy way to test this sort of thing in-game and get valid results, but there isn't. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">actually its VERY easy to do this test..you have a naked char buffed the same except in one test you have agility buffed as high as possible and in other test you have it unbuffed.  Its in fact the ONLY way to do it to remove all the variables.<br />
<br />
The only variable this has is mob variable..so you either find a mob that is always the same level or you average your results together and hope no substantial error shows up.<br />
<br />
What you will find is its doing very little, and it wont matter because the sheep who always ask for agi wont read the parses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I think what you are missing Ruatonim is the fact that Agi will add AC to the naked unbuffed char UNLESS that char is at max Agi already.  Any added AC just invalidated your test results.<br />
<br />
You need to separate the Agi from the AC...this is the basic flaw that has consistently screwed Agi based tests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">will need to be at max Agi before you introduce the buffs<br />
<br />
<br />
Call me stupid, but *** good will it do to buff someone who is already capped in that stat? <br />
<br />
Wow, my parsings show no difference, either when he was unbuffed at 305 agi or buffed..at 305 agi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">/sigh<br />
<br />
Because if you add Agility, you add AC Jhar.  Then you can't say with any validity whether it was the AC or the Agi that made any/no difference.  Ideally, you would want to max AC, but that is even less possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Jhar's comepletely right though. Maxing agility will mean the buff does nothing, so both parses will come out the same. As you say, ideally you'd max AC so the agi buff can't affect AC but that won't happen either.<br />
<br />
The only way I can see around the AC issue is to run the test without the agi buff using whatever armour is necessary to boost their AC to the same level it'd be with the agi buff. Then they have the same ac in both tests, but different agilities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Agility adds very little AC though, I would think the extra AC minimal. However, the gear could be adjusted to add a pure AC item to balance - there are a few out there.<br />
<br />
I don't see the need for a pre-LR and post-LR tank with the same gear and other AAs though to prove anything. All my experiment will prove (if I ever get the time) is whether agi makes a difference in a particular set of circumstances.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Actually, what you will prove is that Agi or added AC from Agi had some effect on your test.  By not using 2 similar subjects with and without LR5, you are unable to examine if LR5 was part of the eqation.<br />
<br />
In any kind of basic statistical based research you absolutely MUST isolate variables or you can't draw any meaningful conclusions.<br />
<br />
I'm done! :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Well, it will prove that agi does or doesn't have any affect on a tank with LR5.<br />
<br />
The only reason I mentioned LR5 at all is because I read somewhere (possibly warrior boards) where someone suggested that Agi didn't have any affect before AA, but does now.<br />
<br />
Doing the test on a tank without LR AA will only prove that it does or doesn't have any affect on a tank without LR.<br />
<br />
My hypothesis is that agi doesn't have any affect on a tank *with* LR5, and that is what the experiment is designed to prove or disprove, nothing more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">LR1 or LR5 or LR0 have no bearing on the test whatsoever if you use the same person..this isnt a variable. period.  You make a point about agi adding AC and i see how this could flaw it somewhat, but you know we get AC buffs so you could buff agi on the naked person and do the similar ac buff that gives a shown ac pretty similar and do the test.  Its not going to be perfect, and there will be some error, but its completely impossible to perfectly parse this.  The other thing is agi supposedly only adds avoidance ac which is what we are trying to test....so my opinion is the ac added means nothing, but we could debate that for hours so... :)<br />
<br />
I've never seen a good parse for agi though..there are always many variables that are quite significant and lead to errors (and usually show the without agi buff parse as being more avoidant).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">there are 2 mobs in OT(the arcut's I think) that always pop the same level. One of these days I will do some parsing with my friend's warrior(65 LR5 ID5) and I'll let you guys know the results.. Probably won't be any time soon though, as I barely have enough time to play when I get home from work as it is.<br />
<br />
As for the Agi affecting parses because of an AC increase.. all you will do by parsing it with the difference is prove that the AGI had an effect. You can't change out a piece of armor to affect the change in AGI. It would screw the whole thing up(changing mitigation AC for avoidance AC).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">So many people focus on the AC gained from agility.  For some reason lately, I've been revisiting agility for avoidance reasons.  Most folks expect instant gratification -- in other words, a gain they can see and quantify.  They see adding a 60 agility buff only gives like 10 AC, and deem it worthless.<br />
<br />
But I got to thinking... what if adding agility adds slightly to your AC, but increases your avoidance defense to a large degree?  In other words, you get hit less often.  You still get hit really hard when you get hit.. but you get hit less often.<br />
<br />
I have no proof that this happens; I haven't done any tests, 'cause frankly I got better things to do, but I make sure to buff my monk's agility when he's tanking.  I was kinda surprised when I saw this thread and people revisiting the benefits of agility after recently having thoughts about it.<br />
<br />
It wouldn't surprise me at all for someone to find out that agility does in fact increase avoidance defense and that perhaps it benefits light-weight classes who are built for avoidance defense like monks, rogues, rangers, etc...</div></div><hr />

this is the parse i remember debating before :P you've lowered your agility below the penalty line of 75 which probably causes more variables than it solves...<br />
<br />
Although my thinking on it (especially since you were hit less with less agi) is its probably valid and agility has basically no determination on whether or not you dodge or get hit.  I bet if you did both tests out to the same number of hits you'd be even closer...<br />
<br />
and i bet if you did a test with agility unbuffed (cant recall if you buffed agi or not) or if you buffed agility you'd get basically the same number with some chance error thrown in for good measure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nice useful contribution to the discussion.<br />
<br />
It *may* be a dead horse, but until someone points me at some credible parses, I will still have a little doubt about the value of agi. And I will still have tanks telling me, &quot;agi helps avoidance&quot;.<br />
<br />
So, while it's been discussed again and again, I don't think satisfactory conclusions (with proof) have been reached.</div></div><hr />
