Hmm could be that as youve just switched and AoL is connected through its iown interface.<br />
Basically on your PC it could be that the default internet connection is your old one so all you need to do is bring up IE and that will probably say offline too so just choose to connect and next time you load EQ that will realise that your connection is now AoL and will therefore connect.<br />
I know i had this exact same prob when i went over to AoL.<br />

Ok just reread my reply and it doesnt make a lot of sense:)<br />
When you call up IE dont click work off line click on connect (not sure exactly what it says as my winxp is German) then go to EQ and it should hopefully connect ok<br />

  O.k so now i sorta get what you were saying, when i brought up IE it had me Connect, or Stay Offline and i clicked connect and it still didnt connect on eq , just had that same connection failure window.<br />
   <br />
   Is there maybe any other way ???<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aekhold</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">When you installed AOL, did it ask you if you wanted to make it the default internet browser ? I clicked &quot;yes&quot; the 1st time I installed it and it wouldn't make anything work except the crappy AOL interface.<br />
But then I reinstalled it and when it asked me I said &quot;no&quot;, and then Internet Explorer and EQ are working fine.<br />
Also I hope you have AOL 8, the 7 is crap (EQ not playable, constant huge lag) and the 6 made EQ crash sometimes for me.</div></div><hr />

It might depend on whether you use aol dialup, or if you have a separate connection and aol that runs on top of it (aka comcast cable).<br />
<br />
You will probably have to muck with installing/reinstalling aol, possibly calling them for some tech-support (scary) with help getting your tcp/ip stack setup right so that eq can find it.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that if you use aol dialup that you dont really connect directly to the internet, ever. Everything goes throug proxy servers, ugh.<br />
