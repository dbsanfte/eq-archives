Glor, is there any LEGAL action that can be taken against people who pull that kind of crap? I wish there was a way to just line them against the wall without infringing on everyone elses right to privacy, honestly. NOT trying to start a debate on freedoms here, please, take it to the Grey if you want too discuss it, I just wish we could REALLY punish people who do that type of thing . . . I have kids. I would probably be &quot;temporarily insane&quot; if anything ever happened, cause they would need the yellow tape.</div></div><hr />
