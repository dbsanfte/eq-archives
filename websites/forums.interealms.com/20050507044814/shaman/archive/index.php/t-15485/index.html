<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Arku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
Recently, dinged 55 and acquired Chloroblast.  My question is, which healing spell is most efficient to use after i cani, Stoicism, Superior Healing, or Chloroblast?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not hard, 440ish for 175 or 580ish for 250.<br />
<br />
Chloro</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Eriadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Stoicism.  640 for 160 mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Stoicism  always use it till you get torpor :) and quisec</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tuuk Basdeoghail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">stoicism</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">/agree.. Stoicism will be your best bet until you get torpor or quiescence if torpor isn't gonna be an option. KM at 58 is somewhat nice for canni recovery, but can be dangerous to use during combat as you have to canni really low to make KM efficient enough to be worth using in that fashion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Definately stoicism. However, at 58, Kragg's is a good option, especially if you have Virtue or some other big HP buff on - Stoicism will barely scratch that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Stoicism rocks, if ya hit it just right you get an extra tick and I think I've even seen 2 extra ticks out of it. I get 5 ticks more than i do 4, and occasionally get 6. Its to tricky to figure out exactly how to time it to get the extra ticks but it happens enough so that its more like 800 hps for 136 mana with a mana pres item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tuuk Basdeoghail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">kragg's is a good option, but with Stoicism you get more mana in the long run, although it takes a bit long. I used to wonder if I should even bother with Stoicism or Canny4... turns out... i'm L61 now and *still* don't have Torpor. So it's well worth it. Far as can4 goes, not only does it take a while to get can5, but those that have can5 still use can4... <br />
<br />
i think someone worked out that with stoicism you get Ft24 when used with canny, torpor you get ft64? something like that... was on this board somewhere if you wanna look for it</div></div><hr />
