<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After playing for nearly 3 years, after soloing Mobs thats struck fear in the hearts of other players (well, some..heheh), I have finally done what all (so I have heard) true Shaman have accomplished!!!  Thats right folks, my very first CANN V DEATH!!! :D <br />
<br />
I was soloing in Dulak on one of the boats (that's right , the shame of it all, I died while farming Lt. Blues), I noticed that my manna bar was getting low.  I say to myself &quot;Hey!  I get to use that great new Cann V aa I got last night!!&quot; Well, I check my health, and I have 2k hp at that time. I cast Topor on myself first, then activate the cann V. Well, I didn't kill my self directly...heheh, but, next thing I know, I have a Dandy Cannoneer beating me up!  Now, I thought I had taken the proper steps, my doggy had plenty of aggro on the Mob that killed me, I had rooted it, and step far away from it, but I guess that the low health agro radius is larger than normal radius.  Is that true??  Anyhow, I went concious and unconcious a few times as the Topor did its thing, but in the end I died (I couldn't seem to get a spell off ).  I was so embarassed, I turned down a rezz and said to myself ... &quot;self.. you have just learned a very valuable lesson&quot;, and then it dawned on me .... I am now a TRUE SHAMAN!!!!  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That first death is always fun.  After that you smack yourself.  :)<br />

What's really fun is knocking yourself unconscious with C5.  LOL</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have done it once clicking naked.<br />
<br />
Make sure you have 2200+ hp for at least one full tick before you canni, is my rule to avoid low health.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've done it twice... once totally by mistake, and once on purpose.<br />
<br />
The mistake was while I was soloing VP... just killed the wandering Guardian Wurm near the entrance... getting some mana back... LOADING PLEASE WAIT... &quot;***?  Oh ****... lol&quot;... couldn't help by laugh at it.<br />
<br />
The on purpose one.. we were camping in Droga trying to get a copper hammer... and the dude just wouldn't spawn... so I said &quot;If the next spawn is the king with the hammer, I will Cann 5 myself to death&quot;.<br />
<br />
I was a frog of my word.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've never died from the actual Canni itself, but from low health aggro a few times :(</div></div><hr />

I was waiting for someone to come forward.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">My first time was shortly after LDoN went live. We were running back on a CR. I zoned in and hadn't rebuffed myself yet. I hit the Can 5 key, and BAMN! LOADING PLEASE WAIT...<br />
<br />
It wouldn't have been so bad had a couple of my guildmates hadn't been behind me watching the whole thing.<br />
<br />
They still won't let me forget it. :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I must admit I did it too, mine was related to lag though, my hp said I had 2k+, still I should have known better.<br />
Anyways... grats? :-D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">i've done it 3 times.  Once chaining canni 4 w/o watching my hps.  Another when i got sick of a dual, i was losing to another sham so i just hit canni 5, forgetting the xp loss /doh.  And the other when i was rebuffing w/o my corpse, and was lom, so i hit canni5 before realizing i didn't have enough hps for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I have yet to die to canni v, but about a week ago I was completely naked (forgot to loot body) and around 1400 hps, I hit the canni v button when I saw someone cast elixir on me. It all happened very quick but end result was I was 1% for a few seconds :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Ive never killed myself with Canni V yet; Ive knocked myself down with it before, but never killed myself yet.<br />
<br />
I have, however, killed myself with Canni I, III, and IV though.  THOSE are the embarrasing ones, because you tink away at yourself in tiny hits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">but I guess that the low health agro radius is larger than normal radius.  Is that true?? <br />
<br />
<br />
low health agro is impossible to top, there is no way to take agro from some one near death short of healing them or them dying. my guess is your root broke in there some place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">low health agro is impossible to top, there is no way to take agro from <br />
<br />
Actually this is not true, There were some tests done on the steel warriors to test this, and it just takes a lot of agro to do it because taunt/AOE taunt don't work for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Low health aggro can be topped. I remember soloing with my little sk twink and a wiz was trying to run from a puma in EC. Wiz was so low speed was reduced to a crawl.<br />
<br />
I hit it with HT and it came straight for me :) I think HT took about 50% of its health though :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Tidykat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">First C5 death:<br />
<br />
Was soloing the entrances mob in Barindu (ont he barindu/qinimi zoneline), someone trained without calling, I took a few hits, but managed to zone. noticed my mana bar was kind of low, and decided, &quot;Hey, lets pop cani5 while I wait for the reset!&quot;.  Pop cani5, halfway through I se my 1700hp... Oh sh**... Try to duck.. and croaked.  Some cleric &quot;tripped&quot; over myy body at the zoneline and rezzed me within a couple minutes. I told her I was dotted heavily :) (No one saw it, ,so it never happened, right  :D  )<br />
<br />
Second C5 Death:<br />
<br />
Group wiped in Vxed. Rezzed me back, looted myself.. started going to town with C4... decide to hit c5 since i had at least 70% health(i was healed after looting) and... Loading Please Wait.... Apparently I wsn't healed like I thought I was, so they had to re-rez me  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Have c5'd purposely many times while duelling a chanter friend. He gets that ginsu pet out and roots me and goes to town on me(i used to be rootable). Once i got oom, or close it and/or very low hp and couldnt save myself, I'd just cheap himof his kill, just to save his head from getting bigger. Damn ego's chanters have anyway.. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">It is hard to resist the impulse to click naked.  I have no idea the number of times I've caught myself with finger on the key while doing a cr.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Groovdog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Died in LDoN. Picked up just enough equipment to canni myself (or so I thought) safely. Little did I realize (doh) that my max hp were more than sufficient but my actual hp at the time were a little too low :)<br />
<br />
GD</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Percent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">First (and only so far) cannicide was when guild was fighting the keeper in ToV.  Evil dragon AE hit me and dispelled my virtue mid canni cast, couldn't duck in time and bit the dust 5 seconds before the dragon was downed.  I blamed the AE and nobody questioned so it never really happened.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Shamad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">One time in BoT, I instructed my group members that Can5 takes alot of my HP away in one hit, so don't freak when you see my hp suddenly drop.<br />
<br />
<br />
I THOUGHT I was at full health, but wasnt, boom knocked myself unconsious, and the trash mob instantly turned on me and finished me off.<br />
<br />
So basicly it looked like this.<br />
<br />
Me: Don't freak when my HP falls rapidly, i'm ok.<br />
Click Can5 ...My hp falls rapidly...to 0<br />
Group: .....'<br />
<br />
<br />
I thougth it was funny in an ironic sort of way. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Spikehammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I was with low level group in Dulak chain pulling the mobs round the Soulstealer showing off how fast I could pull. Running low on mana a quick canni5 will keep me chain pulling and looking uber a few secs later I was rather embarrased.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Sometimes if I'm really bored I'll do it for laughs and then click myself back with my cleric. Also done it as a quick way to go back for some peridots and get right back to where I was. <br />
<br />
Have done it naked unintentially several times though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I canni2ed myself to death in the middle of Shar Vahl.<br />
<br />
I was working on Bind Wounds skill by canniing down and then binding back the HP.  Everything was going well and I was nearing the 200 mark.  Pretty boring stuff so I wasn't paying attention.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">catt heh never thought of that..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I've done the trifecta.  I've intentionally Can V killed myself, done it by accident, and purpled myself.  :D<br />
<br />
The intentional was to corpse bank a child's tear (we got THREE that night, first drop off every golem I've seen).  Accidental was a click after a rez, and the purple was me seeing how close I could shave it one night in PoK when I was bored, lol.<br />
<br />
Guess now I just need that rare and elusive &quot;accidental purple&quot; to gain my prestigious Heyokah title, lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Shambler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">bah you pulled me out of lurking and I had to register<br />
<br />
I never thought I would die from Cani V.. but then I didn't factor idiot group mates into the equation.<br />
<br />
On a normal ldon, I look at my HP's and I was way over 2200 HP's thanks to many nice buffs. I click my CaniV /cleric don't waste your mana Im in torpor/Q warning message, then click the CaniV hotkey. During the brief moment the caniV skill is &quot;casting&quot;, some bonehead hits a massive dispell trap, stripping me of all my HP buffs. So then i ended up with very very low HP's and all mobs raced to smack me to death.<br />
<br />
At least it makes a good story right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Kiebler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">My last Can 5 death was in Uqua past the first oven (before they changed it) in the middle of a CR.  For those that havent been there yet, imagine the part of the Carprin cycle where each death spawns skeletons.  Now give those skeletons hand grenades and PMS and set them loose in the middle of an entire raid full of half health and buffless people.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Was grinding in BoT ages back when we got an unexpected add. I Malo'd it and backed myself into a corner to try to land a slow. Kept getting interrupted and beat on. My hps drop in large, unpleasant chunks and I'm waiting on the cleric to help me out.<br />
<br />
Anyway, after I wake up at my bind point, I get a /tell from the cleric, saying 'Sorry - I thought you were using Canni!'. Didn't even see the big angry fella turning me into a tentpeg!</div></div><hr />

We were pulling to head down towards herbie or bridge.  Had 3 good friends with me and saw my HP hit 2200, cast torpor ... loading please wait ... frigging health refresh bug ... It took 2 weeks to wipe the smiles off my friends faces.<br />
<br />
I caught low health aggro a few times, but my cleric (who I had played with for years) kicked ass and between him and my SK friend I didn't die.</div></div><hr />

<br />
at any rate, obviously that means no canni5 deaths, and i haven't killed myself with canni4 yet either. that said...i had my closest call just last night.<br />
<br />
was in BoT helping a friend (63 sk) chase level 65, with another rl budy of ours (65 chant) in group. after we had to rotate some ppl out, i refreshed sham buffs, and started to canni back up.<br />
<br />
not paying attention.<br />
<br />
rl friend calls me on the phone--so i pick up:<br />
<br />
&quot;hey...either pay attention to your damn tells or cannibalize again.&quot;<br />

was at 1%.<br />

woooops.</div></div><hr />

Saryrn didn't show any Shaman love again.  I think we are 0-19 now on the TA.<br />
<br />
I think the best canni death I had was with canni iv.  I thought I could squeeze one more canni, and oops, I died.  :P</div></div><hr />
