<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, so one of my guildmates posted on our board that a TON of juicy mobs were up: Seru, HP with the potential for Cursed and Blood any time.<br />
<br />
Everyone was getting ready to hit a target when they repopped all the zones, NOTHING UP!<br />
<br />
GRRRRR.<br />
<br />
*pouts and goes to watch American Idol*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It will be nice for someone other than the resident euro guild to get some of ssra tonight on terris at least</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah we were clearing to burrower when they repopped servers.  However, cursed emp AL and HP are all up now and the euros are asleep :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just as well, sounds like things are still unstable.<br />
<br />
We did grieg's end during the worm attack and while it was funny, it was also a bit nerve wracking, with half the guild going ld and suffering huge packet loss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">omg I'm watching American Idol too....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just had half the raid force LD just now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Genine Goosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">On Karana the guilds inside PoF were all sent to bind and had over 1 million pp on them :p Then the raid was disbanded and all the pp was gone :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Inqubus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">sounds like it was a good day to be at work for once :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Anjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You might want to be thankful that the zones depopped.  We were engaging the Keeper of Sorrows trigger when the zone repopped.  Nothing up but HoH trial mobs, so we headed over there.  Along the way, people were randomly getting ported to their bind points.  Odd, but we figured we could probably deal with it.  Engaged one of the trial mobs and immediately lost half the raid because they were ported to random locations about the zone or even outside the zone.  Within 15 seconds, we'd lost 45 people and it was over.  At that point, we gave up raiding for the night.<br />
<br />
We were hearing reports of fairly massive character info corruption last night as well.  Another guild got booted from a zone last night because of it.  A druid was tanking for em because he had 12000 hps, 9000 AC, and some unreal number of AAs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Damn.  I didnt get to have any fun.  I kept crashing everytime I zoned.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I was on my trader buying up some underpriced jewelry from clueless traders when all of a sudden I was ported to the arena along with the person I was doing business with.  Was the strangest things.   Oh the possibilities</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">fook, I want the 12k hp or the 1 mil plat o_o...<br />
<br />
<br />
All I got was alot of LD's and TL to bind :\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Cantiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">PoAir, this place really, really, really sucks. This zone is like VT save the mobs die a bit faster. Mobs split, roamers all over, to much yard trash to clear and to many unmezzable crap. Did I mention this zone really sucks?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Skadi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Zone repop half way to Protector of Dresslok in SRT.. ok thats annoying.<br />
<br />
More annoying?  How about half the raid 20king through the floor with some Z axis bug.. not once... not twice..how about three? nope.. I think it was FIVE for some people.  The GM came to summon them back to us and they were falling back as fast as he could bring them to us.  It was funny after a while, kinda :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">With 3 crashes and the repop the managed to put all the mobs back into euro guilds on the tribunal.  Man that sucked ... the worse crash was after ad with people stuck in the ad room and some in the valley but needing to get to the zoneout for flagging.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Julean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I dunno, I had fun!<br />
<br />
Got the scout for Tali of Benevolence.<br />
<br />
Hubby got idol from Shadow Overlord in ME. Went back hour or 2 later, and got the visor from him.<br />
<br />
Killed Tawro in UP.<br />
<br />
Started out it was going to be trial grinding night, but ran off to kill things when servers were repopped!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">We had jsut started the PoI dragon quest when 3/4 of the guild crashed to desktop.  At the same time the remainder got ported randomly all throughout the zone.  And since noone knew that the raid was a wipe they all came back in to findthemselves somewhere with a half dozen angry mobs.  Good that at least the GY fuction was still working, so one guy got rezzed and immediately ported into the factory (setting him up for another rez).  What a mess.<br />
Oh ya, and the &quot;cursor in the middle of the screen&quot; bug from early luclin days is back. Al teast now all it takes is a quick alt-enter double to get rid of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">atleast your guild tried. i suggested a myriad of targets and all my guild wanted to do was sit around and grind in tier 2 (which i don't have a flag for yet anyways). i swear it takes an act of congress to get a raid together sometimes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>ludgurorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">had vindi to 1% life when repop came.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">A friend was camping Tormax yesterday to do a simple turn-in after days and days of not being up, so they respawn the zones and Tormax is now on Prime Time Asian time, so it'll be another month about before he sees him up</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">We were organizing for Lord Bob when they repoped, Boo!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">AE mobs were doing unresistable mass AE TLs to zone last night on my server.  Also the crash to desktop bug was around and rampant.  Was an awful day for raiding to be sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Our guild and most guilds on the server seemed to cancle all raiding for the night last night. I was stuck at work but from what I heard it sounded pretty messy. Falling threw the floor, getting ported to zone or bind randomly. All in all a total waste of a night for most people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Hail,<br />
<br />
I was in PoI factory with a low50's rnager probie leeching off of me.  We killed the last mob in our little camp 10 seconds before the repop.  Made the exp go by a little faster.  :D<br />
<br />
<br />
We were raiding HoT on the first pull (set-up took quite awhile because of LD zoning bugs) when the massive TL-to-bind went off.  One person (a different rnager) was left in HoT.  Our only bard and yet another rnager (jeez, they multiply like snow bunnies!) were put in some freaky locked box room for well over an hour before  a GM could get them out.<br />
<br />
GM service overall was good.<br />
<br />
Theft of Thought bug sucked.  Sole enchanter goes full mana to OOM in one cast.  :( :mad: :confused:  /sigh  (Wandering Mind &amp; Mana Sieve still work btw)<br />
<br />
Drops were okay (except for chain of course), and I'm glad we pressed on instead of giving up on the raid.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Twice we had half our raid all crash to desktop at the same time. A few people were teleported to bind as well. We were preparing for Emperor Ssra when this was going on. I had a bad feeling about the fight, but it was smooth and no one was sent to bind or crashed to desk during fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">We had an &quot;interesting&quot; experience during the Cursed cycle.  The healers kept getting a bug where they could not heal themselves and their healthbars appeared full to anyone else that targetted them.  Camping out seemed to fix the problem, but that fight was WILD.<br />
<br />
Ha, Jing! I clicked that link, I had totally forgotten about that.</div></div><hr />
