<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, it was a pickup raid, and basically a zerg raid (36 people i think)<br />
<br />
I was the only shaman there, and felt needed :) People kept askin' me for str and dex and haste (don't know why they didn't want chanter haste, but whatever) I got put in g1, so we were the 1st to charge, and have our tanks try and get the agro (52pally 52 war, 52war - highest and best equiped tanks)<br />
<br />
She dropped pretty fast, our group had no deaths, with CR at 198 I was still getting killed fast by the ae nukes she has :(<br />
<br />
She dropped, 2 face things, 2 hides, and a rez stick.. though people think the raid leader ninja'd something (most think bard epic peice, others think haste belt) I don't really care either way.<br />
<br />
Was over all a fun experiance, except when I tried to pull an IG with slow and failed miserably haha, almost died tanking him while everyone beat on him :) Think I'll try it again when I'm higher than lvl 44 :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sounds fun :)<br />
<br />
(Need to be in melee range to land spells on ice giants. Same for a few dragon/giant types.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I was in range :P it was just one of the ones near king area, while we were still waiting on people to arrive before moving :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you can hit it with your melee weap, you can land a spell, other than that you can't land a spell on it from range regardless of your level.  Goes for Vox and the giants.  As for her, she owned me the first 5 raids I was on.  Cold didn't land, poisen and slows were not hitting.  Best you can hope to do is land malosi and heal.  I never tried landing plague, but with a debuff, I imagine you could.  Aside from the buffs, we're pretty much useless on Vox.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Braxton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My main is a 60 Shaman and for some reason I never did Vox or Naggy in all those levels.<br />
<br />
Awhile back I created a Monk and in the past 2 months I have been asked to join 2 Vox raids and 1 Naggy raid. Talk about luck:<br />
<br />
First Vox raid- Won Voxs' Dragon bag<br />
First Naggy raid - Won Naggy's Dragon bag<br />
Second Vox raid - Won RBB<br />
<br />
So, I am 3 for 3 :) not too bad, however, my monk just hit 53 so no more Vox/Naggy for me.<br />
<br />
As a side note, I may be mistaken, but I believe Naggy and Vox always drop the bag, so this is at least one item that was ninja'd on your raid.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hyllus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Bag isnt always droped.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyways Brax gimmie vox bag or  i keel Jehti or Braxton =0</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Bag doesn't always drop but that is STILL very good loot.  2 patches and 2 hides is an impressive haul. Sorry your raid leader wasn't trustworthy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>WM231NIKE</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My first and only old world dragon raid was at Vox.  I was the first to be summoned and first to die.  Not sure why I was, because I didn't attack or cast on her yet.  It was a wipeout and we didn't have enough people to try again. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">First Vox raid I ever went on I went in at 46 and came out at 45.<br />
<br />
Note to Self : Don't just up and go on a pick up raid without bringing ANY resist gear. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Not sure why you think something was ninja looted.  5 loots is the most I recall seeing come from Vox.  Normally its like 3-4</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">What Jaradis said.  /ru to you for saying what I was gonna say a few moments before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">hehe funny I read that and I was like wow, they lucked out and got the good loot.<br />
<br />
I was once on a Vox raid where the only loot that dropped was 2 Dragon Bone Bracelets, 1 crystalline spear (went to a ranger, lol) and ice comet and 1 of those &quot;word of healing&quot; items.  <br />
<br />
saddest loot ever.<br />
of course, like any good vox raid, about 50% of the raiders were either bards or paladins and neither scale nor book dropped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I wasn't really one to care if something was ninja'd... It was just going through the chat, and through tells that people thought she ninja'd crap.. I didn't really care I was just there to have a good time :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Straif</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Every vox/naggy raid I have been on someone always says something was ninja'd.  Never fails, this is the reason most ppl dont do pickup raids :)<br />
<br />
You got good loot off that leezard, she always drops 4 things, so I dont think anything was ninja'd.  Been on 6 vox raids and 5 naggy raids in the past few months and no scales or books have dropped during any raid.  Been in the exp group for 90% of those also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Banthar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">well there is that lil text that says xxxxx has looted a yyyyyyyyyyy. in a pick-up-raid or a guild sponsored raid with invites keep someone trustworthy / a guildie in each group. whichever group gets the kill, trustworthy person_01 checks/ locks corpse. when no-loot timer is off then Leader / officer loots corpse or locks it out.<br />
<br />
keep everyone well away from the corpse, except for the leader / officer looting then you have 50 pairs of eyes available to see anyone hanging out looking suspicious near the corpse.<br />
<br />
your chances of being ninjaed are then very low without someone knowing about it.<br />
