<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Considering DoN comes very shortly after OoW there seems to be an awful lot of drooling over it.<br />
<br />
Anyone remember all the anticipation over LDoN ?.<br />
<br />
New gfx well woot is all i can say to that.If gfx made a game i dont think many of us would still be playing EQ.<br />
<br />
I just wonder if its going to be another LDoN ie highly anticipated then played constantly for a month or so after release then just left to rot.<br />
<br />
Or is it actually going to be a return to the good old days of EQ ie decent atmospheric zones.<br />
<br />
Remember the last time they rushed out an expansion we ended up with the ****ty Gates (see Blazz i called it Gates not God just for you :)).<br />
<br />
Yes OoW was a good expansion for Shaman but urgh the mob models arent exactly varied (love Bazu model personally though) and the zones well they aint no oil paintings.<br />
<br />
Yes it will be nice to see Dragons in EQ again but not if theyre all based on just the usual 2 or 3 models the design team seem to use per expansion.<br />
<br />
I personally think if they screw up this expansion ie you can see it was rushed then this could be the beginning of the end for EQ.<br />

I'm not expecting to be disappointed. <br />
<br />
If you are... don't buy it, and you won't be disappointed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Honestly , I wasn't let down by LDoN.  But I didn't think it was going to be all that great to begin :p I thought if you read the promos it told you exactly what to expect.  I think that the game makers have make super advances in self awareness, where their designing is concerned, in the last couple years.  OoW is pretty good evidence.  I think Dragons is going to be great :)<br />
<br />
But, I liked Gates, so feel free to ignore me based on that, if you want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What I like best is the fact that the mission are supposed to be well thought out and the rewards a bit e3asier to get other then the rediculous ldon ones where you have to win so many missions to get decent stuff.<br />
<br />
Everybody who has been in beta has nothing but good to say about it. Not large in terms of pure upgrades such as spells and no aa but still a nice well rounded expansion with some good content to be added.<br />
<br />
Have to say I Love the fact that DoN has made it so when LFG is on it shows aa. Makes it betetr for all the people who didnt just rush to 70 and do no aa along the way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have to agree that they are kinda pushing this one out too fast. I can understand a 6 month schedule when there isnt a whole SLEW of levels, AAs and spells to get, but with the &quot;huge&quot; expansions they should put another couple months in between. I honestly hope they postpone DoN some, and make SURE its nice and cleaned up before rushing it out. I really dont see a lot of people clamoring for new content right now. A coulpe more months wouldnt hurt one bit. Still having a blast in OoW myself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agree that we could wait but honestly they aren't adding anything that requires to much balance two new spells each class. Mission a few zones thats really it besides some more features. This isn't the type of expansion that requires a lot of time to build.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>KB1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">LoY was a wonderful expansion in my opinion. Heck my Necro soloed 30-65 there. made a ton of cash, got some uogrades with out buying in bazaar, and made friends I still play and talk with every day. I'm glad it isn't a hotspot anymore because I still take all my new alts to LoY to level up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shamylamy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">They rushed DoN out probably because they are losing so much of their player base. If they bring back dragon content, it might entice people to come back and play some more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">OoW wouldn't last another two seasons.  You're going strong now, but six months is a LONG time in game time.  Most especially, OoW wouldn't last another six months for those who are beating it.  Obviously this expansion did tons better than Planes of Power, but still people would beat it five months ahead of the next release, if they gave it a full year.  If you follow my thoughts here, you'll get to why Velious was the best expansion they ever made (with the understood snafu of Primal weapons)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I dont think there is any reason to delay the release of DoN, unless it wasn't finished, and apparently thats not the case. I know that I personally basically had done most of the single group content in OoW about 2-3 months ago. Most of my online time these days is spent raiding, and there is still a lot of stuff to do there. I expect a fair number of other people are in the same boat, and DoN should provide them with something to do outside of raids, particularly for those folk who dont raid (who also get the incentive of a new round of potential gear upgrades). Delaying the release of the expansion by 6 months would be extremely unhealthy for the game IMO.<br />
<br />
In some ways DoN has been likened to LDoN, which is not necessarily a bad thing, if it has been implemented right. The problem with LDoN was that the content itself was very sparse. There were a lot of dungeons, but they all looked the same, and the missions were all the same, so that after a few weeks or less you had essentially done pretty much all of the content, even without trying very hard. The only reason people kept on doing them was to earn points to get gear. Once people could readily get better gear else where with the release of OoW, the number of people actually doing LDoN instantly dropped to allmost zero. There was little other reason to do them, besides the charm aug, and the rate at which you can upgrade the aug is prohibitive in terms of reward v effort. They could have put content in LDoN, by having complex storyline driven shawl type quests running through a series of dungeons, or by having real bosses or minis of differing degrees of difficulty to match the state of development of different toons, and have real rewards matching the degree of difficulty. But, they didnt do that. Of all the expansion releases, I would rate LDoN at the bottom because of the lack of content. Hopefully they have learned from LDoNs mistakes, and that the content is present in the DoN system, or it is going to suffer the same fate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i don't see a lot of dissappointment in the lifted NDA thread. i don't have any reason to suspect this will be a dissappointing expansion. plus, it's what the people in the EQ community wanted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I haven't been dissapointed with any overall releases except Ykesha (only went for Blood of Nadox, then for 1.5) and Gates. What's that, one out of four, on average? <br />

<br />
If you are... don't buy it, and you won't be disappointed.<br />
<br />
<br />
So you were happy with Gates on its release ?.<br />
<br />
Im not saying the expansion was terrible but on release it was screwed basically.<br />
What im worried about is will this happen again with DoN ?.<br />

<br />
Not to hijack the thread but I had to question this.  Although I don't plan on pushing straight through to 70 without doing any AA; every person I know, that is intelligent enough to ask, in high end guilds has told me to push to 70 without stopping for AA and then go strickly AA.  Has this idea changed?  I mean I plan on stopping along the way and doing some key AA's that I want/need but I was curious about this statement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>herkybevo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">From what I read in another thread the AA's being shown is not for the LFG tool, but a guild tool.  I believe it can be found in the NDA lifted thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Slowd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I love the orient, so, I can't wait for this expansion.<br />
I am also looking forward to the guild opinions offered in this expansion.  <br />
<br />
For example, I will really be happy when don't have to depend on the guild necro to get my corpse.<br />
<br />
I will finally feel free to explore deeply into a zones without worries.  I never got to enjoy soloing through DN for this reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I, for one, am excited for the DoN expansion, BUT I do think they are pushing it out a bit fast, shouldn't be held back for 6 months, it will lose playerbase, but I think 1 or 2 months would be justified.<br />
<br />
we all know the tragedy of GoDiscord, no sense in continually bringing it up, and I understand the concerns of the people who are afraid that DoN will be another GoDiscord.<br />
<br />
but I think they are headed in a more appropriate direction. OoW was a good step in the right direction. it closed some of the gap between raiders and non-raiders. we can hope and wish and pray that things continue in the track that was laid by OoW, and not fall in favor GoDiscord.<br />
<br />
graphics don't make the game...no...but I do enjoy it. &quot;cutting edge&quot; content is what the majority wants. I just play where ever I find it to be fun. old abandoned dungeons are awesome to just go through....<br />
<br />
when was the last time you went through the entire keyquest for HS? crap EXP, but fun to just go in, kill mobs that are green, but still hit 200ish. 5-6 at a time and things get a little iffy, but I'm having a blast. and there are drops there that still go for 12k in the bazaar (i.e. BRD ROG  Erudite illusion mask) or how about Sebilis? just the little places that people forget because of &quot;cutting edge&quot; content.<br />
<br />
but enough of my side tracking, the real question is, will you enjoy where you play?</div></div><hr />
