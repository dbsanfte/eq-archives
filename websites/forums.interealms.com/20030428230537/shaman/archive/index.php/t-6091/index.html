<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nubok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have read many threads about giving weapons to our pets. Some say it helps, others that it doesn't. i tried to test it while camping in HHK (endless supply of FS), and gave my pet a single FS short sword. Didn't notice any difference. Tried to give doggy two weapons, and threw him againts some guards. Suddenly I noticed a difference, he began to tripple! The poor guard was trippled for 51, before the bash landed. Now i constantly have a supply of weapons for my pet.</div></div><hr />

Time to lock this thread and throw away the key.<br />
<br />
If  you *really* insist on discussing this waste of time any further, please /join serverwide.crucible:crucible and take it up there. I'm sure they'll back me up on these. We want no more false threads!</div></div><hr />

Soloing in the HOle for 3 weeks. Grabbed Slashing, piercing, crushing weps from the Warrens. Give my 49 pet a 1hb and a 1hs. He DOUBLE hits with the slash, and every few attacks there is a CRUSH or a DOUBLE crush. MAking 4 attacks a round max, ignoring bash.<br />
<br />
Its not flipping lies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nubok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Believe me, it works. Might be some sort of min. level for the pets to get extra attacks?<br />
<br />
I will post some screenshots as proof.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We all know this is happening but people are trying to keep it off the boards in case it is an accident/bug (probably) and it gets nerfed because of too much attention drawn to it (definitely).<br />
<br />
Personally i think its too late now anyway.<br />
 <br />
Oh, and BTW, he won't be tripling - that will be 2 main hand and 1 offhand attack :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>muuss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Since necro specter pets have been updated to use weapons, all the pets can now use em. This was one of the main threads on the beastlord forums cause the bst warder suddenly won 15 dps using weapons.<br />
<br />
shaman pet has also been affected. Since last patch tho, the bst pet has been turned from war to bst and uses weapons poorly, meaning u shouldnt equipy it with it anymore, dunno what happened to the our lil doggy.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">bah, stop believing its a bug and repeat it again and again on the threads. Your only reinforcing Verants belief in nerfing it.<br />

Snare and bow-kite him around the first room out from the SD zone, and nuke him til he glows.  Multiple manaburn wizzies or lots of nukers with pile-o-mod rods more or less a neccessity, his regen is sick.  Stacking tons of dots to slow down his regen gives you a little breathing room.</div></div><hr />
