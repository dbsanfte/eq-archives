There's no other zone where you can go to get 20-25 high quality loot items in a single night.</div></div><hr />

Feel free to email me at my listed address for more information.  I haven't lead anything that way in about a year, but I still remember most of the tactics.<br />
<br />
Good luck in your endeavors.</div></div><hr />
