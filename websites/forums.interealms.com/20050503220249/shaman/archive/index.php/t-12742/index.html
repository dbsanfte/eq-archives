Here are some of mine:<br />

Having to look at The Book constantly while medding<br />
<br />
The Bazaar, making the horrorshow that was EC turn into an empty zone (&quot;I have little PP, do you do trades?&quot;)<br />
<br />
Ragefire, changing a very crappy camp (depending on a raid that the cleric couldn't participate in anyway) into a very gankable camp into a well balanced camp<br />
<br />
Boat zone crashes (or any real need to get on a boat anymore)<br />
<br />
wrong item combines</div></div><hr />

- new dog models, the floating pooch was kinda silly<br />
- the &quot;good&quot; planar armor we had to look forward to all had high int and no hps<br />
- they finally added lots of OTHER places to farm cash with zero risk other than HG's and ogres.<br />
- remember before they put in ctrl and alt to pick up from a stack, and you had to use the slider bar to pick up one thing to do tradeskill combines?<br />
<br />
This stuff has made a lot more of the game more accessible to the common player.  Which will piss off the top tier folks to no end (oh, the trivialization of content to the masses - it's only supposed to be trivial to ME!), and make the other 95% of folks REALLY happy, because they've got something to do.</div></div><hr />

My statement was on topic,  reread it and apply. Also, you off topic, this is about things we glad are GONE not ADDED.<br />
<br />
<br />
The above IS off topic though. omg, how horrible.<br />
<br />
<br />
ON topic:<br />
<br />
first week or so EQ was out, if you died by any NPC or PC on Rallos Zek your corpse was open to be fully looted by anyone.<br />
<br />
no rent items dissapearing if you went LD rather then staying for 30mins as they do now<br />

<br />
For those with a twink addiction, the not loosing your corpse till lvl 10 is a godsend, also giving them more than 5 newbie biscuits.  My first character I think I lost his corpse bout 5 times.  My GF would make a character die, not remember where she died, get pissed, delete character and start a new one........she went though just bout every class in the game in first few weeks.<br />
<br />
The addition of many many zones to lvl up in, I remember when the avaiks and the gnolls in SK had a life expantancy of 3 minutes, and that was when I was playing off hours, I can just imagine how bad that was during prime time.</div></div><hr />

New UI. old school (pre SoV) &quot;full screen&quot; mode was awful. SOV helped a bit but still lacked customization.<br />
<br />
Windowed mode pirceless imo. I never play w/o it<br />
<br />
Bazaar is nice, but makes haggeling a lost art.<br />
<br />
trade skills are worth something again<br />
<br />
back in the days of dialup, I remember patching file after file wondering how many I had left, new patcher makes that  a thing of the past.<br />
<br />
There are a ton of little things that they have added. but some of them have really made the game too easy IMO.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This &quot;I hate EQ so I hate Sony&quot; attitude strikes me as rather silly.<br />
Heh what strikes me as being silly is simple people trying to tell me that its that simple.  It isn't.  4 years ago Verant made a great game, but they couldn't afford to finish it.  Sony bought them out, and since then has made countless changes for the game's worse.  Every other title by SOE will be the same, they care nothing about customer satisfaction, only profit.  Already they've delayed the release of SWG because they took stuff out of the original release and made it into expansion pack material - more money in pocket for them.<br />
<br />
Sorry but I really hate &quot;If you don't like it, don't play it&quot;.  It tells me you are completely unable to give any real thought to the issue, and answer with a cliche to save face.  If you can't think, don't write.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I love Everquest, but it's a different game now than it was back then.  I remeber Verant always being reluctant to make changes, because they had a very specific Vision of what Everquest should be.  Today that Vision has been dumped upon more times than I can count, and basically thrown out the window by SOE.  Some people are happy about this, and would use The Vision(tm) as a punch line, but to me this is what kept me playing this game longer than all the other games I have ever played combined.<br />
<br />
I like some of the changes:<br />
<br />
-New guild management feature<br />
-10 hotkeys instead of 6<br />
-movable buff window<br />
-no more book (i did my time with the book, and in a way I want others to have to walk in snow, but in a game of graphics, having to stare at a book for 35 levels and miss the game is ridicilous)<br />
-items stacking changes (holding ctrl etc)<br />
-being able to type exact number of coins<br />
-soulbinders<br />
-latest ragefire change.  <br />
<br />
Things I don't like:<br />
-Port stones -- travel was fun, and it forced you to learn to navigate<br />
-Map feature -- see above<br />
-Graveyards<br />
-cleric epics<br />
-no corpse loss 1-10<br />
-increased exp 1-10<br />
<br />
Everquest was fun for me because it was immersive.  I was walking blindly through a world that I knew nothing about, and the world was abosultly unforgiving.  If I got to close to the wrong skeleton, I was dead.  If I walked into a hollowed out tree, I lost a corpse.  If I didn't pay attention to where I was, I was lost for hours, and often lost a corpse.  If I wanted to hunt in commons or oasis,  I faced a days worth of traveling and sneaking around, praying I didn't get lost or killed by a ranodm hill giant.  I felt genuine fear of zones like east karana, gorge of king xorb, kithcor etc.  <br />
<br />
Todays version of EQ is suited more for the masses, it still provides its entertainment, and I play more heavily now than I did 4 years ago.  However I play for different reasons.  Now I enjoy the challegne of doing new things with my guild and experience new raid content.  Back then I simply enjoyed being in the world.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Kianor,<br />
You summed up some of my top removals for sure bro...those were some of the most annoying ones imo....and to add one.....having to drag and drop your gear instead of right clicking it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, concerning the &quot;hijacking&quot; earlier in the thread...I have a question for Schpleef....I've always been fascinated with the psychology of people and what motivates them in any given situation. So I have to ask, since just about every thread I've read recently has a reply from you and this seemingly Anti-Sony campaign you have going on, if you so despise Sony, their incompetence, their 'buggy' game, and Everquest in general...what keeps you playing? Im asking this genuinely as Im interested in knowing your honest answer....you can PM if you'd like or if you even feeling like answering...so as not to hijack the thread an father :)</div></div><hr />

Lol, the Beta is what people like you will pay to test for them.  I'm so sick of people kissing Sony's ass, they're just your crack dealer - recognize them as such.  I'm sure they will list features on the box that won't be in the game - remember the new UI and bazaar features promised with Luclin?  Those were eight months late.  Its not out yet because they're trying to figure out just how much they can milk us for.  If they've gotten it working enough to get some screenshots out, its bug-free enough to bear the SOE label, in their greedily deranged minds.  Why on earth would you hold back the release for beta testing when people like YOU will gladly pay to do it for them?  You make me sick.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How was anything I said even remotely ass-kissing?  I'm sure there'll be things on the box that won't get into the initial release, and nowhere have I ever said that &quot;they're gonna put out a complete game, that will not need patching or upgrades, or expansions or anything of the sort.  Sony's the best company on the planet and I wish I could be them when I grow up.&quot;  I'm just sick as hell of people like you that think that everything that happens that you don't like is a carefully calculated step to oppress you.  Of course they're gonna try to get you to keep paying for the game...they are a business, after all.  But for a business to keep its customers, they have to have a product worth buying.  That's what we're testing for FREE right now...to make sure it works.  But, I'm sure you'll hate it when it comes out anyway, no matter how good it is, simply because it bears Sony's name...any less, and you might be accused of ass kissing.  /gasp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Cateye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Things I don't like:<br />
-Port stones -- travel was fun, and it forced you to learn to navigate<br />
-Map feature -- see above<br />
-Graveyards<br />
-cleric epics<br />
-no corpse loss 1-10<br />
-increased exp 1-10<br />
<br />
Everquest was fun for me because it was immersive.  I was walking blindly through a world that I knew nothing about, and the world was abosultly unforgiving.  If I got to close to the wrong skeleton, I was dead.  If I walked into a hollowed out tree, I lost a corpse.  If I didn't pay attention to where I was, I was lost for hours, and often lost a corpse.  If I wanted to hunt in commons or oasis,  I faced a days worth of traveling and sneaking around, praying I didn't get lost or killed by a ranodm hill giant.  I felt genuine fear of zones like east karana, gorge of king xorb, kithcor etc.  <br />
<br />
<br />
You exactly express what i feel, it was just a different game!<br />
I still remember the excitement when my noob lizzy (long long ago) had to travel from kunark to the old world, it was really an adventure!<br />
Nowadays there is nothing like that left. I don't wanna say the game has gotten worse but i also play for different reasons now. It became more a strategic game, where i take the fun out of dealing with friends (guild) to take a big mob out with good coordination. Not that the game is not fun anymore, but i remember the good old times with a tear in my eye :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
changing the way XP is awarded to people for killing a mob.<br />
<br />
used to it was distributed to the last person (or group) who hit the mob.<br />
<br />
also, that they changed it so the people who actually got the experience get a chance to loot before others get a chance.<br />
<br />
those are some of the most significant, IMO.</div></div><hr />

Bazaar crashes every 3 hours, tradeskills will make you LD or crash the zone, and it's a crapshoot if you get disconnected on whether your character will stay in the world for minutes or days while you get the dreaded 1018 error.<br />

I love them as a level 61 that doesn't want to have to run from Halas to Freeport anymore.<br />
<br />
But, I loved what having to run from Halas to Freeport did for me as a lvl 14 shaman, and all the trips back that I had to make in order to train (since I could not train anywhere BUT Halas).<br />
<br />
I remember praying that I didn't die until I got to HH and could bind.  I remember dreading the WK run because the zone is ENDLESS, even with sow.  <br />
<br />
I did the run with my sowless, barb warrior for old times sake last week.  It is amazing how much of those zones I still remember.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Insta travel has really made the game so much better for me.  I never had any druid or wizard friends so I spent my time running everywhere and sitting waiting for those boats that never shows up.  End result was that I hardly ever moved and stayed for 5 levels at a time in a few zones close by eachother.<br />
<br />
Just started a new pally now that I am playing up.  I am wipping from one end of the game to the other all the time testing new zones, giving it 30 minutes and if it doesnt work out, heck - lets move on.<br />
<br />
Yes - there was something exciting about that first lvl 8 run from Halas to Freeport with my first char (warrior), but that novelity soon wore off after a few cross-continent runs.<br />

<br />
I remember having a full suit of Patchwork armor with my Polar Bear Skin hat. My Barbarian Warrior friend was decked out in a full suit of Bronze armor. And at one point we were both in full suit of Banded Armor. We thought we were so cool looking hehe until we saw a Barbarian Shaman in full Totemic and a Barbarian Warrior in Full Crafted.  :D <br />
<br />
I remember waiting on the boats which gave you a reason to work on Fishing or Swimming skills :p <br />
<br />
I remember collecting stacks of Gnoll Fangs to turn in for awesome Exp!<br />
And then turn in the Moonstones you get to for more exp! and getting stacks of Blackburrow Stout to sell or get drunk off of. :p<br />
<br />
I remember thinking the boat ride from Freeport to Butcherblock was sooo long seeing SeaFury Cyclopses in the distance on an island...thinking 'Thats were the big boys kill stuff at'<br />
<br />
I remember my first Train ever....Venegful Soloist along with a whole bunch of other skeletons to the Halas Guards.<br />
<br />
I remember making 100p in one days time just SoWing and Binding at the gate in Qeynos, I was sooo rich.  :p <br />
<br />
I remember spending that 100pp on a Screaming Mace and I was sooo uber. :p<br />
<br />
I remember camping some Dylin guy in Highpass for part of Testament of Vanear quest, 10 Wis OMG! <br />
<br />
I remember looking at the EQ Map that came with the game and it not making sense on how the zones interconnected in the game vs. what the map showed.<br />
<br />
I remember being at the docks in Oasis, and seeing shouts of 'Specs to Docks!' or 'SG to docks'<br />
<br />
I remember seeing a lvl 50 Female Gnome Necromancer named Yolanda...that took down an Sand Giant solo. I was only lvl 12 at the time and she was soo cute and little and that Sand Giant was so huge and it just layed dead before her.<br />
<br />
I remember you had to actually to click the Meditate button to med when you opened the book.<br />
<br />
I remember when the platform in Northen Ro was a cool place to hang out.<br />
<br />
I remember my first encounter with a Hill Giant in East Karana and running into a tower with those 2 guards on the hill thinking there is no way the HG can hit me while I'm in this tower because he is too big to fit through the doorway. :P <br />
<br />
I remember waiting what seemed like hours for morning to come in Kithicor Woods. <br />
<br />
I remember doing the 'deliver mail quests' when running from Qeynos to Highpass, then from Highpass to Freeport.<br />
<br />
I remember sitting with a full group in Crushbone in the Tower where Ambassador Dvinn spawned. He was tough to kill.<br />
<br />
I remember camping the Gnoll High Shaman in Lake Rathe at SK zone and collecting a Runed Totem Staff and then selling the RTS for 20pp!...I was banking! :p<br />
<br />
I remember my first guild meeting in East Commons in the Tunnel in that open area with the camp fires. I was lvl 5 and remember getting awarded a 10 Slot Backpack full of Fish Rolls which would last me forever! :p<br />

Those were the days back before Kunark. :)</div></div><hr />

Best thing removed - Hell levels. 35, 40, 45... Made you wonder how hellish they would be if they weren't the levels right after you got new spells<br />
<br />
Book comes in a close second. I slaved to reach 35, so I could med without the thing. Anyone here remember cannidancing pre-35? Japanese children had seizures from that, I heard.<br />
<br />
What I miss most? Lost Temple of Cazic Thule. Pickup groups in Ill Omen and OT,,, Yes, now that DSP is sucking them all away, I can get nostalgic! Most of all, I miss the &quot;fantasy&quot; feel. Velious was kinda sci-fi, and Luclin and PoP definately were... LoY was rather dystopian, but LDoN is shaping up rather nicely for fantasy settings. Almost Conanesque in parts.</div></div><hr />

One biggie for me - getting my Totemic armor. IIRC wasn't a Dufrenite like 162 pp? I had a fellow Shaman helping me out, and her CHA buff was better than mine (We were both Barbs). Saved me 4 pp or so (Which was huge back then).<br />
<br />
People actually donating for Spirit of the Wolf. Not that they would pay (which was always nice), but they were POLITE about asking.  Nowadays it's &quot;s0w d\/d3 plz k thx la ~~&quot; or just &quot;s0w&quot;.  Normally I tell those 1337 types I deleted the spell.<br />
<br />
Waiting for the boat to Kunark. Getting off on the wrong shuttle. Ending up back in Butcher.  Finally getting to Kunark and marvelling at FV. Getting killed by spiders that were : a) aggressive as RL wasps and b) Social, c) red to me. That run to LoIO was always an adventure.  Getting on boat again.  <br />
<br />
Back in the day, simply looting corpse and moving on with the game. These days I hear horror stories from Clerics who relate how level 20's send them tells and who &quot;HAVE TO HAVE A 96% REZ OMG PLZ HELP.&quot;<br />
<br />
IMO what has changed more than anything are the people. And tbh not for the better. Even on ol Tarew Marr (the ghettoest of all the ghetto servers) there were always people who would stop what they were doing and lend a hand if in the same zone. Heck, sometimes they would come from far away.<br />
<br />
* I * was that way too. I had more than one <br />
previously-unknown-Shaman send my Monk a tell asking for help with the Black Dire in MM. Dragging people in Sebilis, CR's elsewhere, all par for the course.<br />
<br />
Nowadays I don't even bother to ask people for help. No response is better than a rude one. Someone much wiser than me once posted:<br />

And I have the some feeling about the port stones: I like to use them now: wnat to farm some PP in sebilis? Click to FoB and run 2 zones. I need spider silks? Click to Misty and run 2 zones... But I still remember when I had to go from Cabilis to EC at level 15 or 20: I had to pass several zones with deep red mobs. In OT I just missed the boat. Time to train some spellcasting and get fishing / swimming up. Ok, next boat here. Now I have to get on the boat without getting killed. OMG and then ogre island!

Possibly because they'd rather not suck up more bandwidth making a new post on the same subject?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Severine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">This is a subject that has been coming up more and more lately.  Some of my friends are like me, old school.  We really resent having people along on raids and even XP grinds who have no idea what they are doing.  They don't know their class, don't know the game and are sad they missed out on Naggy and Vox raids and learning raid tactics because during the two minutes they were in between 46 and 52 the dragons weren't up.<br />
<br />
I was on a raid tonight in SolC where a 55+ Mage complained #1 that there should be a spell that protects you from fire while swimming in lave and #2 BTW did CotH require a reagent because it wasn't working with Malachite.  If I'd been on my rogue I would have stabbed her in her useless unused head.  This is a mage I met when she was trying to quad kite birdies in TD while I was PLing my cleric.  Then asked me for a TL out because she didn't understand why she couldn't quad.  I was torn between getting as much distance between me and her stupidity and keeping her around to make fun of.<br />
<br />
Some folks say that we don't cut the new people slack, but the fact remains, we learned so much about the game because we did take the time to learn what our spells did, what we could and could not do.  We learned zones by having to find our corpses.  We didnt sniff at a 90% rez at level 20.  We learned each other as well.  We grouped, we talked during down time and got to know each other and forged some good friendships.  No it's all just constant pulling and the only thing you see in group chat anymore is INC messages and PULL!<br />
<br />
Welcome to the Dumbing Down of what used to be a pretty fun game to play.  Now we're all too busy dodging idiots with 3 minutes played at level 62.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">Besides a barb shammie, I have an iksar monk, and an iksar necro, but I miss that faction has pretty much ceased to be an issue.  Faction always struck me as something they could have done a lot more with.  I still remember how my hands were shaking while I lurked around Qeynos using sneak on the monk in order to complete the sash quests, and hoping that the guards wouldn't path close enough to aggro.<br />
<br />
And, of course, dieties have never really mattered much, although I think they should.  Wouldn't you think that someone who had helped kill his own diety would become a persona non grata?  You can kind of understand it with CT and Inny, but even MM and RZ don't seem to care.<br />
