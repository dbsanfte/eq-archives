<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Blart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I remember when it was a common myth that AGI/DEX effected how often you dodge/block, STR made you hit for insane amounts of damage, STA was useless, etc.  <br />
<br />
The Shaman's Crucible was the first community to run empirical tests on stats.  We figured out that AGI had minimal affects on AC, DEX was largely useless, and STR didn't affect damage output as much as everyone assumed.  It was pretty cool watching the arguments, people would site authority as proof (brad mcquaid said DEX was important!  Why would verant put in a useless stat?) and many other fallacies.  It made me realize how myths were developed and how crucial logic was in debunking them, kind of changed my philosophy.<br />
<br />
Also, I remember somebody ran a test on +ATK buffs like wolf form, and found that they increased overall damage by huge amounts - even if they only buffed ATK by 20 or so.  <br />
<br />
The conclusion was that the ATK stat was meaningless, since you could buff ATK 100 points with STR and notice no difference, yet 20 points with wolf form and have a big difference.  The only mystery left was what did ATK only buffs (avatar, firefist, etc.) actually buff?<br />
<br />
Anyone still have tests on stats lying around?  My guild on Sullon needs some proof before they believe me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Maybe I'm crazy ... no scratch that, I am crazy, but it actually sounds like it might be fun to redo some of these tests.  Should the motivation hit me I just might do some :-)  As for the old tests, I have no clue where they are, but I imagine so much has changed that any study older than year would have a serious chance of being invalid.  For instance, any tests done comparing how much mana wis is worth would now be invalid past 200, because the cap was lifted with luclin.  Similiar things might have been done to other stats, but in a less public fashion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Tudamorf did the ATK tests. STR was tested by several people. I remember at the time, this lead to people dismissing str as a useful stat because they couldn't find much evidence of average damage increase. I think they were expecting a greater effect from smaller changes. <br />
<br />
Gikk and a few others did some tests later showing that str did have a significant effect on average damge, from memory anything between 7% and 12%.<br />
<br />
The Crucible posts discussing all this stuff were lost in the couple of moves we have had. They may be long gone, or tucked away on an old Thantu hardrive.<br />
<br />
As far as i'm aware, the ATK stat is a composite, not sure what.<br />
A post i saw on the Rangers Glade a while ago seemed to indicate the ATK component of avatar increased damage by about 12%. Can't find it now though.<br />
<br />
Shame all those great debate threds weren't preserved somewhere.<br />
<br />
*Edit* Found an old post, not the original but a repost of an oriinal:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jorgurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I know Arkand did many tests on this subject.   A lot of his results were also looked at and re-tested by a delightful gnome warrior named Ruatha.<br />
<br />
Maybe if either of em still have some of that info around.<br />
<br />
Maybe a whole new round of tests might be in order!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Results would be good to see again.  I too liked those old debates.<br />
