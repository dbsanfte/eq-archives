<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ixaryon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello, I am new to being a shaman. So far I really love the class!<br />
<br />
I have a question though and I am not sure if this has been addressed in a previous post or not. If it has, if someone will just point me in the right direction, I would greatly appreciate it.<br />
<br />
My Shaman is now 7th lvl and I would like to start working on the skull quests.<br />
<br />
Reading up on the first one, I noticed it requires you to turn in the cudgel of the petitioners. Can I say I made a major goof about lvl 4. A friend has given me a much better weapon and so I destroyed the original cudgel. Is there a way to get another one? If not, will I be able to do the other skull quests?<br />
<br />
Any help you can give me on this will be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
By the way, all my characters are on the Bertox Server so if anyone is there, send me a tell sometime.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>SneakyB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you can get a friend to start a new Iksar Shaman, then you can MQ it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Or you could start over yourself...  Only 7th level and it is easy to move items around.  Or you could talk to your Guildmaster.  I think he might give you another, or point you in the right direction for obtaining a new one.<br />
<br />
Whif!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Eaither have soneone MQ it for you or start over. I tried to do the quest where you recieve a new starting cudgel, and it is a total pain in the ass. I finally gave up and just had my friend MQ for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah just start your character over.  It would take you less time to ding 7 again than doing the tedious quest for the starting cudgel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Linanae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There I an NPC that will give you the hammer of shattering to help you redem your self. Not worth the hassle to be honest though. You have to get a certain amount of shattered bones and some other items. Easy way out is to have a friend hold your armor (if worth anything.) bags and plat. Then delete and start over. Use the pincer and scaled wolf pup quests to get you to level 5</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You can actually MQ yourself.  All you need to do is make a new iksar shammy, turn its guild note in, and have it turn in the cudgel to Oxyn.  Then just log yourself on and turn in the skulls.  I have used this method a couple times to get the 1st cudgel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ya I remember one of the gm's asking if I had lost my cudgel.. I think it was either the one on the right or the middle.. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Youichi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Naagruz is entirely correct, MQ it your self.<br />
<br />
I had to do the first cudgel quest this way, as I am a cat and never had a cudgel of my own to hand in. :)</div></div><hr />
