<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nadonius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I havent been able to log in for the past 2 weeks, my broadband internet was disconnected, and just now have gotten a dialup service.  Im having some money problems, so it may take some time to get the cable reconnected.<br />
Because this ties up the phone line I wont be able to be on during the prime play hours often.<br />
<br />
Being away from you all for just 2 weeks made me realize how much I enjoy the company and friendship of my KoE family. The first few days were hell, almost like I had quit smoking cold turkey. Yes, I am an addict.  Addicted to seeing my friends everyday, and working as a team to accomplish our goals.<br />
<br />
See you all in game again, although a lot more limited now.</div></div><hr />
