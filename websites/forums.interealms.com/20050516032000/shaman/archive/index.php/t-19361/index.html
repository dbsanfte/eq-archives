Had partial wipe in NToV at chicken hallway just before Aaryonar. Clerics were battle-rezzing, and I bounce slow on this chicken, so it comes at me. I'm on the phone with three RL friends in the same guild on the raid. I start VP and spin around to position the mob, and BAM, I stick it on our guildleader cleric, who was just battle rezzed in. I'm like &quot;OMG, check out Marise, I JUST KILLED HER!&quot; on the phone. Everyone cracks up as she gets pummeled into oblivion.<br />
<br />
Well, we thought it was funny.</div></div><hr />
