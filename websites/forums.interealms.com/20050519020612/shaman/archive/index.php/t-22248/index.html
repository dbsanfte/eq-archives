<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kellenial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The other day, my wife (56 rogue) was logged in before me resupplying. She had on her LFG flag hoping that by the time I finished what I was doing in RL and logged in (about 20 minutes top), she'd have found us a group. As it turned out, she received a request for an Everfrost LDoN. She was ecstatic that she actually received a tell for a group! However, when asked if they had room for me (55 shaman), they said no--that they were looking for DPS. She was a little dejected, but I told her to go anyway...that I'd find something to do once I got on. (I ended up helping a guildmate with camping an epic piece.) Turn out that the group was a paladin, 2 rangers, a cleric and 2 rogues.<br />
<br />
But it got me to thinking about how I felt. At first I was a little angry and upset. How could they NOT want a shaman. We can slow, buff and, for a mid-50s LDoN, heal adequately. Then I thought that, what I was missing here is the plight my wife deals with daily as a rogue. There are an overabundance of DPS classes for groups. Most groups for mid-50s prefer someone who can slow (which ended up to be my function in Hate that night). Add to that the tank and healing class, that leaves 3 spots for everyone else. No wonder there are nights I'm at work and she calls me frustrated that she can't get a group. <br />
<br />
While this is most likely not new info to everyone else, or to me, it made me realize this all over again. And while many see the elemental+ game as being particularly hard for a shaman, to me this incident helps me to see a little of the other side of the coin--when I have things a little better than my wife's rogue. <br />
<br />
Funny how that appreciation of things comes from getting rejected by a group? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, I think what Rogues suffer from in getting groups has been mentioned around here before . . . &quot;WOW factor&quot;.<br />
<br />
Rogues don't have a lot of &quot;WOW&quot; to the class.  They show up, contribute their DPS and go home.  Nothing flashy like a Wizard.<br />
<br />
However, as you get closer to high end, Rogues become more appreciated.  People begin to realize that melee DPS isn't resisted.  It's constant and unresistable.<br />
<br />
Now, as to why you weren't chosen, I can see it.  With the DPS that group had they didn't need you.  They had a pally to be sure that only one mob came at a time.  Pally pullers rule LDoN until upper 50's when their Pacify no longer works.  That Cleric was smart.  That group probably finished in record time.<br />
<br />
Certainly, having a Shaman around would have increased the safety of the group.  But remember, Clerics have the ultimate get out of jail free card.  Rez.  So what if they wipe?  &quot;Rez INC !&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Don't worry, a time will come when you will be the only slower, healer, and maybe even the puller for your normal LDoN's.  The beauty of ldon is you can have the absolute worst group makeup and still come out smelling like daisies.  Now when you start raiding and realize that a Pally can keep your group alive better than you can when you're getting hit by aoe's and aoe rampages, then you can get a little upset.<br />
<br />
But good on you for seeing the good in your situation.  Be happy you're a shaman when your melee DPS buddy blows his last charge of gate potion with a gate collapse, or when your cleric buddy needs someone to hold their hand through a GoD run for invis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kraaga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I can see something of the other side of the coin here. When I form a group for a normal LDoN, I don't get clerics or druids (unless I tell them to do nothing but nuke) anymore. <br />
<br />
I usually have tank, puller, me and 3 DPS. The best group yet was bard, paladin, me, roguex2 and Ranger. All 65. 53 slaughter mission in mistmoore done in 16 minutes. I never slowed and only healed 2 times. The mobs died in about 10-12 seconds each.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Peroxide</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have gone on many ldon adventures.  I have so far won 173 of them.  Using a combination of Shaman, Main Healer (Cleric or Druid), Tank (War, SK, or Pal) Ranger and a Rogue it doesnt matter what the last slot is.  It is pretty much a gauranteed win.  Normal of course.  Several times I have had the pleasure of grouping with 2 rogues on a ldon and the dps was very nice.  On my server though it is hard to find tanks for ldons a lot of times.  Wish there were some people who just used tanks for ldon only.<br />
<br />
P.S.  As a shaman I love to pull for the Ruj ldon.  The big open space of the zone is just perfect for shaman pulling.  Most everybody who has grouped with me in EC prefers that I pull.  I often apologize for a bad pull when I get 3 mobs and people laught at me.  At least its never boring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Beafly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well, I've been thinking of posting on this same problem but as more related to raiding. Tunare has a fairly successful open raiding organization called Bowraid. Bowraid has it's problems but all in all it is a great way for the unguilded/family guild player to participate in planar flagging.<br />
<br />
I tried getting into a couple bowraids while I was in my late 50's but found my levels to be lacking (note: There is no level requirement for Bowraid, if you can get into the zone or work out a push with the raid leader you can attend). Not only was I not feeling like I could contribute positivly but I was problably more of a detriment. I went on a AD raid at level 58 with Bow and spent the entire fight feared until I was summoned and killed (no flag). I decided that I would hold back my participation in Bow until I'd gotten some levels.<br />
<br />
I've been raiding regularly with Bow since I hit 65. I now have cannV, SCR3 (really need MGB for raiding but it's on the way) and a dang near full spell book (minus malos and all the GoD spells). I can go on a raid and I truely feel useful. I'm resisting many of the AE's, sticking most of my debuffs and can buff and heal my group effectively. I went on a couple BoT tower mini boss raids the other night and as one of two shaman on the raid, not only was I useful, but my time and manna was in demand. I went on a Saryrn raid and was the only 65 shaman on the raid. I have never been so busy. Yet, in the last week twice I have not been able to get an invite before the raid filled to 72 person. In each case there was already 3 shaman in the raid. I was not useful. I was not desirable. I was not needed. I was rejected. Sadly, the raid leader found a 58 rogue more desirable than a fourth 65 shaman. I understand that this is a open raid organization and that I'm always competing for a spot, but never should a competent 65 be passed up for a sub 60 of any class when fighting level 70 mobs. In the case of shaman we often are. My fear is that this trend will continue, and based on the state of our boards it only gets worse.<br />
<br />
Sony has an opportunity with Omens and the level increases to re-enchant me with myself. I hope they take it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">At lvl 55, I doubt you were rejected because of class balance or anything.  The group they put together was pretty good.  Shaman balance issues don't really show till you hit tougher content at 65.  That said, it's likely you could have replaced that cleric, if he wasn't the one putting together the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Raid roles for more than 2 or 3 Shaman is definitely a problem.  I am not sure if there is a viable solution to it to be honest.  I hope there is, but frankly, I think that if DPS is needed, a Rogue (even a lower level one) should certainly get that spot over a Shaman.  We cannot be all things, nor should we be.  The problem is finding out exactly what we should be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Sounds like a case of the group leader not understanding how to put a good group together.  That group was lacking haste in a big way.  They wanted DPS?  You could have doubled their DPS by simply adding your 50% haste buff.  O wait, that comes at 56 . . . well I'm right in another level anyway.<br />
Not to mention they will lack your buffs of other sorts and a backup healer.  You could have made that group into a real powerhouse, but the leader was an idiot.  Honestly I think the real problem is that few people are playing a new shaman these days, and people &quot;grow up&quot; without the benefit of shamanic company.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Dont let that kind of crap get you down man. Honestly, people basically have no concept of this game sometimes. They just added a rogue, now they wanted DPS. Why? So they could finish a few minutes faster, thats why. How stupidly pathetic, yet extremely typical of the attitude of many players these days. <br />
<br />
Its so sad that folks wont let a Shaman (or even an SK, Paladin, etc) into a group because they need DPS. Shaman have DPS at that level, hell at any level we have SOME. But as I said its typical. People wont XP in Field 2 Fire, which is actually kind of fun, when they can get 14.762% more AA per hour at the tables, where the boredom makes me look for the toaster to toss in the bathtub with me. <br />
<br />
You and your wife are a solid start of a group for anything. Add a tank, and another healer of any kind, including another shaman, and you can do anything at your level easily. Dont let the poor attitudes of others ruid YOUR day. Thats their problem, not yours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I would go so far as to say that for normal LDoN, you don't need another healer if you have a Shaman.<br />
<br />
I don't find it stupid to add a Rogue over a Shaman when DPS is needed.  That's smart.  Rogues, without a doubt, provide a lot more DPS than a Shaman.  Frankly, if a group needed DPS and took me over a Rogue I'd drop the group.<br />
<br />
Now, whether that group needed DPS or not, that is certainly open to debate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Now, whether that group needed DPS or not, that is certainly open to debate.<br />
The impression I got was that after the rogue was invited, there was still a spot open, so she offered her husband, 55 shaman, as the 6th member of the group. Thats when he was rejected. If they had no DPS, then sure. But they already had the rogue. <br />
<br />
As for a 55 shaman being sole healer in a 55-58 LDoN group, that would be kinda rough, but with Stoisism, its doable.</div></div><hr />

I used to solo LDoNs for cash back in december last year till they released GoD. Shamans are the undisputed king of trivial content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">There is no better class than a Shaman for normal LDoNs.<br />
While I agree that a half-way decent geared-AAed lvl 65 Shaman is the king of LDoN normals, I have not played a lvl 55 one in that content. I have a 56 Paladin though, and they seem easy enough, but he is pretty well twinked. I was trying to make it sound like I didnt &quot;know&quot; if a 55 shaman was as big a king in that content as I am heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I sit around for hours sometimes looking for LDON's.

Anyway, nowadays, if i really want an LDON i put it together myself.  Lately it's been 3-person LDON's (65 regular adventures).  We go to BB with me, my wife (65 necro), and my other 65 necro friend.  We haven't lost yet with that combo :).<br />

Believe it or not, almost every class in this game can have this same problem. Sitting there LFG isnt going to draw any sympathy from me, not for any class. <br />

This is more like it. Shaman are the perfect &quot;Core&quot; starter for an LDoN Normal group, because you already cover 2 important group abilities, healing and de-buffs. Add a tank, add some DPS, hell add 5 more Shamans, and away you go. <br />
<br />
Trust me when I tell you that Clerics have a hard time getting LDoN groups. Even Chanters, except for Hard, since Chanter strengths like Mezz and Charm are made failry trivial by the ease of LDoN Normal. And who would take a Warrior over a Pally or SK in LDoN Normal? <br />
<br />
People who sit there LFG and then complain about it really start to annoy me. Be pro-active, especially when we are dealing with trivial content. Now, I understand the complaints if a Shaman is looking for a Trials group and constantly being casted aside in favor of a BL and/or Chanter, but thats completely differnt. For all their deficiencies at the higher end, Shaman are STILL a powerful force to be reckoned with in the lower and midle portions of the games content scale.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Ok, pretty sure you weren't calling just me out on that.  I wasn't posting that to complain.  <br />
<br />
If I sit LFG it's by choice because I'm in a lazy mood to make my own group :).  I don't complain about it.  Many many many times you can do a /who lfg or use the lfg tool and find a couple of groups worth of folks that would rock in an adv, but just are too lazy to start it up.<br />
<br />
So again, I assume you meant the collective &quot;you&quot; and not just me :).<br />

Mach<br />
Yes, I did, sorry man, I should have said tht up front. It was obvious to me from the 2nd half of your post you arent one of those &quot;WHAAAA I cant find a group!&quot; people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">For the OP, make sure your wife has a good haste item and a couple good weapons and thats all she needs as a  nonraiding rogue to contribute to a group. I always like to have a rogue along, the dps+disarmtraps+scouting abilities when needed make rogues a very very solid class in ldon. <br />
<br />
also have her check out http://www.thesafehouse.org/index.php<br />
if she hasnt already, the training lounge/library has a ton of good info. for your shaman, with Stoi and chloroblast you should be ok to heal in ldons at 55, I dont know why you woulndt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Heh, with that group I would have taken another plate tank rather than your wife, since they didnt have a slower or haster. That would have allowed them to proximity pull everything and tank their way through. The small reduction in dps would have be more than offset by the reduction in pulling down time and the increased security from have an additional tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Monday night I was in a guild group doing EC ldon, and we had 3 Shaman, 1 Rogue, 1 Ranger, and 1 Wizard.  OMG!  We were on record pace to finish in 20 minutes!  The last 5 drops took more time than what would have liked.  Our CC composed of the shaman VPing adds.  It was insane.  Just pull a room, VP any adds, slow, and tank away!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Just a thought on the lack of haste in the original post...if the group was hasted by a chanter with buff extensions, the chanter haste could have probably lasted the whole adventure.  I have no idea if that was the situation....just throwing out ideas.<br />
<br />
As for me...when I'm playing my warrior I usually rather emphasize dps instead of slow.  For example, although shaman are the kings of slow, I'll look for a Bard, BL, generic dps class or chanter first.  This isn't meant to bash shaman, but in a normal 65 ldon I can take 2 or 3 unslowed mobs as long as they are dropping fast, not having the best slow isn't that big a deal.  In hard missions that's a different story...however, even there I'll look for a bard or chanter because I'll need both slow and CC - and those classes can fill both roles much better than any other class - which leaves more room for dps classes.  <br />
<br />
Hmm...after thinking about it some more, I really don't look for a shaman to fill a spot in an ldon group anymore...I always looked for them when I was in my 50's...but they aren't that important in my 65 groups anymore. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">No offense Abby, but what are you using in your &quot;healer&quot; slot? I would have to say that slot is where you want a Shaman, rather than a cleric or druid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Good question and I realized I left out an important note - I almost always group with the same chanter so he usually covers slows...so, for the healing spot I look for clerics first, then druids, then shaman.  Although I have done plenty of normal adventures with no haste/slow and in those cases I look for a cleric for heals - then 4 good dps classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I think I've said this before, but I can grab any five toons and win normal LDoNs in any theme. Did some yesterday with 65 pal, 64 dru, 63 rng, 59 rng, 58 dru. It took a while, since we were light on dps, but I had the druids nuking and I was healing, slowing, pulling, hasting. And I'll keep doing this until I'm all tricked out in the best gear I can get, being in a family guild. In fact, I finally got a Vindi BP this week, and it already has the 40hp aug on it. ;)</div></div><hr />

OK, that's a different story.  With a chanter already in the group most folks, me included, would not look for a shammy.  Although I believe you are still better served with a druid that can take care of the healing and do respectable burst dps.  If you just have to have rez (personally I don't worry about the rez much, die, run back, loot all except one item, and keep going), then get a Pally to tank.<br />
<br />
Honestly, a cleric is my third choice for a healer in LDoN normal, I go shammy (me), and 5 dps classes (I especially like pet classes).  Slow, canni, heal, canni, buff as needed.  If we get adds, root, off-tank, pet tank, kite, whatever, with 5 dps the mobs drop so quick that the adds only need to be distracted for a short time.<br />

Tank is 1 of 3.<br />
Healer is 1 of 2.(Maybe 3 in some circumstances.)<br />
Dps is 3 of 8 is it? It kinda evens out for rogue, and surely the not finding a group part must be the same significance as everyone else who cannot find a group.<br />
Shaman I am sure have a different issue, because to be honest, take a Ldon Hard there is less desire for a shaman compared to say Beastlord or Enchanter.</div></div><hr />

You dont need puller if u can handle charging rooms. You don't need mez if u can offtank. You don't need healers if high regen/gear (necro or bard can be main healer np).<br />
<br />
The point is that LDoN normals are now so easy, often you don't need anything (depends on group). Yet you want DPS since it allows you to finish earlier. As needs diminish, classes that provide a need aren't as desirable as classes that provide a want.</div></div><hr />
