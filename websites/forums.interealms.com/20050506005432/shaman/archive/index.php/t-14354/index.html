<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Raketh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all, i was wondering if anyone has had the same problem as me. I set up a trader last night and saw someone buy my JBB for 15k. I went to sleep leaving trader mode on all night only to wake up with the message at the server select screen that comes on when you go LD. I loged back on and saw the money that i got from selling the JBB was missing and the JBB was missing too. I have petitioned and e-mailed the station but you all know how long that takes now... im wondering if this bug is like the one when you would lose everything if ya went LD during a trade. just warning everyone to watch out and are there any suggestions on what i should do?</div></div><hr />
