<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have read a lot of posts saying that 20 - 34 are the hardest levels for a shaman and that things get easier after that.<br />
<br />
Is this still true or is this from the &quot;olden&quot; days when Kunark and Luclin didn't exist. Add to that the Bazaar. I'm a no twink (except for a 100pp loan) and I'm fully dressed in Ry'Gorr and similar. This would not have been possible without the Bazaar.<br />
<br />
I played through lvl 30 in about 4 hours (maybe 4.5) in three solo sessions. There is no way I can believe that things get any easier than that.<br />
<br />
For reference this is my third char. I played a ranger to lvl 14 in 99. I played a mage to 24 in early 2001 and I started playing this shaman (currently 31) about a month ago.<br />
<br />
So, what can I expect at 34? Will things get harder, easier or stay the same?<br />
<br />
Personaly I would have to guess that Paludal and Echo Caverns have made 15 - 30 something (depending on how long the Needlites give xp) have made 20-34 the easiest lvls to obtain.<br />

<br />
When I was 20, most of my armor was tattered leather that I tailored myself.  I crossed the world from Halas to Kaladim bearing the head of that villian Trumpy Irontoe.  I travelled through dangerous moutains zones, haunted forests, seedy towns, and sailed a great ocean.  I'll never forget seeing the wooden bridge to East Karana for the first time.   I saw my first hill giant and was terrified he'd spot me from half the zone away.  <br />
<br />
When I finally arrived, I had to spend days fighting evil goblins (they had GREEN skin) to earn the respect of the dwarves, but it was all worth it.  Byzar Bloodforge awarded me with the mighty Bloodforge Hammer.  It was a 13/50 two hander, gave me +10 versus magic, and it cast light!  I felt invulnerable.  I also bought my first piece of banded armor on that journey, spending all my savings for a helm.<br />
<br />
Yes, the game has changed a lot.<br />
