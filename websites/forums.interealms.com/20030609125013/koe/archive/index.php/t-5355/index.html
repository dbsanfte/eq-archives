<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After talking to a lot of people, we have decided to bump our normal Tuesday night gathering to Wed nights from now on and we will see what happens. <br />
<br />
Along with the change in nights, we will also have a change in venue. <br />
<br />
The place this week is the Tower of Frozen Shadow. Meeting place is near the camp that is next to the tower. The area around the outside of the Tower is very dangerous with many wandering mobs. Alternate location is the zone in inside the tower. You can safely invis past the wandering mobs around the tower. <br />
<br />
We plan on getting multiple keys for these characters. Kly and Bearan will be logged in the immediate area and have their keys with them in case of an emergency. <br />
<br />
We have historically been short of healers and especially porting types.  <br />
<br />
Objective is at least the library on the second floor and if we have a strong enough force, we will attempt the third floor. <br />
<br />
Level ranges for this will go from say 29 to 39 or so.. Most of us are in the 32 to 35 range. <br />
<br />
In game contacts are Griss/Bearan and Calon/Klydon<br />
<br />
Looking forward to seeing everyone there.. :)</div></div><hr />

I have a 28 cleric logged at the gnoll camp, with a second floor key. <br />
<br />

<br />
Barring something else getting in the way, I think I will join you this week.</div></div><hr />
