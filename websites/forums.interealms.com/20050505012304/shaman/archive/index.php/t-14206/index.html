<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">...and bought LOY, well I charged it to a mates CC who use my acct more than me these days.<br />
<br />
So where is the entry to this new land? How does one get there? www.eqatlas.com has no maps nor link maps so any clues would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
NB. I dont play alot so live on spoilers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Port to stonebrunt.  Follow the water to the big boat, click on the door.  That'll drop you off on the boat in gunthak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">unfortunatly noone uses the LoY zones, just the features that came with it. It's just too out of the way with no easy way to get there (other than porting to stonebrunt) and no major rewards once you are there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gildanni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I go there to get the meats needed for the Illusion potions.  In the lighthouse is also just about the only place you can buy wormwood, that I've found.  My alt did 44 thru 49 there.  I myself went there to get my Stoicism spell.  *shrugs* Everyone has different wants, and LoY is different.  and Fun :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">LoY zones are great (maybe not for the 60+ crowd, but I ain't one of them.... YET!! heheheh).  Dulak gives good exp, and loot, and stocism rocks.  As far as no one going there, well thats just plain wrong!!  It is always 25+ peeps on my server.  I think that alot of people dont like the run from PoK....but thats just lazy.  I hear people always asking about ports to stonebrunt, but DANG, its only 3 zones away!!  Just get a map of the warrens, after 2 trips you'll have it down pat.  Easy as Cake, Piece of Pie...heheheheheh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Skeeter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you dismiss LOY as 'not worth it' you're really missing out.  I loved hunting in Dulak and Crypt of Nadox.  And the Mines are well done IMO, I love the 'mine' feel -- and the feeling you get when you 'free' a resistance miner!  Start the '20' countdown!  heh. :)<br />
<br />
Plus Blood of Nadox *rocks* if you ever hunt in zones where you are fighting NPC shaman mobs (like Cazic) -- can get rid of slows and poison on the whole group with one casting.  And I love stoicism -- it's great until you hit 60.<br />
<br />
The best part is the money.  While it's not quite as profitable as Seb bugs, you do get lots of gems, planar gems, and a lot of toys.  I went from 40 to 44 there and banked a few thousand pp in the process, got several equipment upgrades and a ton of twink items, and 5-6 backpacks filled with racial meats and blood.<br />
<br />
While doing the Blood of Nadox quest in the Crypt, you have chances at a nice int caster belt (with Brilliance, nice twink item especially once KEI no longer works on under 46's tomorrow) and a rare drop with FT at one camp; 8 wis shoulders, a 5 wis off-hand item, and an axe that proc's a rune-type spell (think upgraded PGT) at another camp; and the luggald flesh that you need for the nice ring quest(s) at the third camp (and a chance at the 7 wis ring if you grab the trolls for some variety).<br />
<br />
Granted, if you're in the Elemental planes, LOY has little to attract you.  But for the rest of us -- particularly those between 40 and 60 -- there are a lot of fun camps and a fair number of nice items.  Plus lots of charm quests, odds are you'll grab everything required for at least one or two of the quests just regular hunting.  You can start soloing in Gunthak at 40, easily -- though it's more fun with a group.  And even the 'beach trash' are worth a bit of coin. ;)<br />
<br />
The walkthrough on this site is awesome if you decide to do the Blood of Nadox quest (also called Pureblood).  Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">aye .. blood of nadox is nice .. i still have to go get it. The zones are in general very well built and the mines are very nice looking. My level 45 SK is having alot of fun there :)<br />
<br />
Oh and another thing about LoY .. notice that unlike SoL and PoP. . LoY mobs actually drop the ocasional PP</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Its easy to get to LoY, it just takes people a while to learn the route through the Warrens (too much outdoors action methinks).<br />
<br />
Just get the Paineel book -&gt; Paineel -&gt; Warrens -&gt; Stonebrunt <br />
<br />
Takes about 5 mins tops with sow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I enjoy having Torgiran Mines all to myself. There are dark blue mobs there at level 62.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The run to LoY is indeed trivial once you do it a few times. However, once you get there, the frame rate is pretty bad on lower end systems. I liked the zones, but now that I am done with Stoicism, I won't be going back until I build my next PC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ran into an NPC there that casts some nasty AOE.<br />
Makes you fizzle EVERY cast. That just sucked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kamorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Since Loy came out I have probably farmed and sold at least 100k worth of stuff from there.<br />
<br />
Best thing is most of the zones are underpopulated and the camps are uncontested. I don't like the crap in a lot of the pop zones someone always accusing someone else of something, if you know what I mean.<br />
<br />
I can promise that after patch tomorrow and probably for the next week or so the zones opening up and the new zone in loio will be overpopulated and pretty much insane.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't go near those areas for at least a week, gonna try to get my guild into LoY :)  We will probably have the place mostly to ourselves.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I like the zones, they kinda restored my faith in SOEs ability to do dungeons. Dulak, Nadox and Hate's Fury are all nice crawl zones in my opinion. We crawled Hates Fury from end to end on Sunday and actually got 3 items that a group of low 60s considered an upgrade and used. Talking non-raid people here though, HoT caliber stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sarania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">&quot;unfortunatly noone uses the LoY zones, just the features that came with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
LOL you are so funny. I spend a 100x more time in LoY than I do in PooP. LoY is great leveling for aaxp. Not to mention a fast way to make cash since the mob actually drop decent cash and gems unlike in PooP. Not to mention I dont have to find a group to go there either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">My record for running from PoK to Gunthak is 4 mins including zoning! :)<br />
<br />
Yes, once you know the route through Warrens it's a piece of cake.<br />
<br />
As mentioned above, there are lots of nice &quot;treasures&quot; in LoY :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'm thinking that would be a great GM event &quot;the PoK to Guthak 500&quot;... too bad the deciding factor would be your comp/connection speed )for the zoneing).</div></div><hr />
