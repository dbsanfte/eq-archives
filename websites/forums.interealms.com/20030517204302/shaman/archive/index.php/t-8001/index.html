<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cobryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just acquired a barbed rubicite bracer, yet I can not equip it because I get the message &quot;Your race, class or diety does not allow you to equip this item&quot;.  I am a level 50 Vah Shir, the class is rng,rog,shm and the race is ALL, any idea why I cant equip it? Is it a bug?  I know it has a recommended level of 51, but I have plenty of other items with a recommended level equipped and never saw this message.  Thanks for your help:) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kelgrael Snowstar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There are varying types of &quot;recommended level equipped&quot; items - some of which allow you to equip at lower levels and then lower the stats - then others which you just cannot equip till the level listed.<br />
<br />
Most - if not ALL of the items I've seen come out of the new Cazic Thule - including the barbed rubicite bracer you have - are the later type - which means you need to be 51 before you can equip it.<br />
<br />
I ran into the same problem with the FT3 Boots when I tried to put em on my Wizard before he hit 51.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Talsondar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yep, did the same thing myself, could not equip at 46.  My understanding is that anything out of Cazic Thule is not equippable until 51.<br />
<br />
Received the same message you did when trying to equip as a 46 Barb Shammy.  They should really change that description to REQUIRED level, as most of the higher level items out of PoP now have attached, in addition to the recommended level.</div></div><hr />
