<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mysticbash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am very much a casual player. I have been playing my shaman for about 5 years. I just recently made 65. I play 2-4 hours 2 or 3 times a week. My question is is this new addition doable like this?  Can a group of friends hunt and aquire the spell runes needed? Or is my lack or raidability now going to halt my advancement.  I would like some advice on this before I go and buy this expansion.  Thanks, Mysticbash (cazicthule).</div></div><hr />

It's incredibly playable, ignoring Shaman Class concerns its the best expansion since PoP, in fact maybe seven better than that (in the 'playable' stakes)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">After being used to watching that AA XP bar fill up so fast these past months, recverting back to full time regular XP is a semi-rude awakening. But its doable if you ignore the XP bar and focus on fun and adventure.<br />

To answer your question directly, yes, you can get a group of casual friends and get some spells. WoS offers a DL style zone with lots of nooks along the walls to pull to, and named spawns in the yard-trash areas that drop runes for 66, 67 and even 68 spells, as well as solid, VT quality gear. Deeper WoS offers more spells, and near-EP quality gear, and excellent XP.</div></div><hr />
