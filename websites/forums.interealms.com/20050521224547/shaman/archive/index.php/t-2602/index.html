<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bloodpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi there fellow shamans.<br />
<br />
Well it just happened, my first bad experience with the game. I been playing for around three months now and I've meet some really nice people along the way so this was a bit of a sock. Ok here it goes (sorry if I sound like a little girl :) ) I was camping the hermit in SK for about 2 hrs when a little dark elf by the name of Zerixia KS me, alright so I been here for 2hrs so I guess I should move along for the next person so did but as I was leaving I get a tell from this little one saying are u blind and how ogres are an ignorant bunch. Ok so I just zoned and was amazed by the message I got. So I was wondering if anything like this happen to u and want would u do as well. Thanks for any info<br />

Don't worry, people are like that, they probably won't make it far in the game, and you will probably never see them again.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">One stupid thing like that can get a persons server-wide rep destroyed.  <br />
<br />
Stealing camps and insulting theperson they jus KS'd can make them have to start up an new char prettyfast =\<br />
<br />
On saryrn some guy was selling something.  He had the other guy come up to the nexus, but when that guy got there, he learned person1 had gotten a better offer(about 100pp more =\) and had already sold it.<br />
<br />
Needless to say, noone trades w/ him anymore, ever... evrrr!!!1</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Is it possible that Zerixia wasn't aware you were camping the hermit and thought that you were KSing her?<br />
<br />
Get used to disputes like this.  I've had a few: mostly with kiters who seem to take a delight in fooling me into wasting my mana on their pulls.  <br />
<br />
Does anyone know how to spot the difference between a mob pulled with snare and one just moving along of its own free will?<br />
<br />
Or the root and rot at the mobs spawn spot tactic.  Just how long do I have to wait for its HP bar to drop before I can safely pull?</div></div><hr />

- Come to Tarew Marr, you'll be suprised how sucessful aholes and jerks are. High end game of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">One of the more useful hotkeys you can make is one that just does &quot;/assist&quot;.<br />
<br />
When I'm about to pull a mob, and I've seen other players in the area, I target the mob and hit my assist button - if the mob has a target, it's already been pulled so I leave it alone.<br />
<br />
That hot key is also great for finding out who needs healing in raids etc, if they are not in your group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Using /assist to detect already engaged mobs ...yes thats an excellent idea.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the input Grippa.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bloodpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks for the feed back guys and thanks to Grippa for the cool tip about using the /assist hotkey :)<br />

Stick a dot on her and go in bashing her with your hammer and watch her run. If she continues spouting crap show her to her bindspot, repeatedly.</div></div><hr />

I've encountered the rude many times.  If they are just annoying I'll just casually privately send them polite tells that annoy the piss out of them.  If they are truly rude, I'll either leave (if it's not worth it and i have other places to be) or I'll publically humiliate them.  If they are downright antisocial and obnoxious and piss me off, i'll make sure they take an exp death.  <br />
<br />
You gotta be polite to people in EQ.  You never know who will save yer ass sometime, or throw it screaming into the fire.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>SurfinShammy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Personally, I have had this problem on more than a few times.<br />
<br />
Everything from some guy &quot;Helping&quot; us kill spiders in velks to someone trying to kite what I have root cooking.  The Hermit is a mob that on my server almost always seems camped so I leave him alone. <br />
<br />
Now usually I am a decent fellow (or attempt to be) and let people have their way... ...until I get a whole buncha lip. At that point they have proven they want to start something. So I either log on to an alt or let them dig their own grave. <br />
<br />
I forsee future potential in these idio... ...individuals. It's called a no heal/no buff/no help list. I have been called on it more than once.<br />
<br />
Had a lvl 40 warrior that took over a camp for LOOT that my 21 monk was doing for exp. I was there 4 hours and he said,&quot;I am not a high enough level I can't do them alone so I don't deserve the camp&quot;. (he didn't see the 51 shammy (wife) with me).  Well about a week later he's running through DL at 3am my time (a whole 15 people in zone atm) and screaming like a 5 year old sissy with more than 10 mobs on him and a drach actually landed a root  he begged me (my lvl 50 shammy) to heal him and help him. I just said sorry I am not high enough level to do the camp by myself and gated. He attempted to sputter something about sorry or something but oh well he screwed himself.<br />
<br />
I know that is harsh but what goes around comes around. <br />
<br />
I have a few names on my list and I usually try to talk it out before I log but if they want to push it then they deserve it. <br />
<br />
Love the druid who asked me for help with kiting 4 mobs. Same guy had 3 days earlier told me to go away from the ulthork area of iceclad because there weren't enough spawns for both of us. Had to call me names and such so I helped him. <br />

Lessee cancel magic X4 = dead dr00d. <br />

He said he was going to petition and I never heard anything of it. But what you do is up to you.</div></div><hr />
