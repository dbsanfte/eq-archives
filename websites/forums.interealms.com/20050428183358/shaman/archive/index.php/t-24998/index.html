<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Salece</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi Folks:<br />
<br />
I need some help in picking a server.  Before that, let me introduce myself.  I played EQ for about a year (1999-mid 2000).  I used to be one of the high level Shamans (Brell) at the time.  Since that I had quit the MMORPG world and concentrated on my career.<br />
<br />
I have decided to give WoW a try.  But I'm not in Beta and don't have a clue on the actual game (beside trolling in the forum).  <br />
<br />
I don't have any friend, RL or OL, whom I'd like to play with (other than whoever I knew in my EQ Guild Skyre Dranith on Brell before I quit).  <br />
<br />
I'll stick with PvE, but I don't want to leave a server once I've made up my mind.  I was wondering if there is a consensus on which server people here is leaning toward.  Out of all the EQ forums I know, this one seems to be the sanest source of information.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Servers were only listed as PvP, normal, and roleplaying during beta and were given numbers like Test 38, Test 6, Beta 1, etc.<br />
<br />
I haven't looked recently, but I haven't seen an official list of server names for when it goes live.  So I'm not sure anyone has had the chance to pick yet.  From other threads here, it sounds like Millman is trying to get folks together on a pvp server at least, though like I said, I don't think anyone can name the server yet.<br />
<br />
Mach</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No server names have been released to the public.<br />
The general expectation is that they will launch servers in clusters and when a cluster is filled up that fresh servers will be added (accourding to the community guys this could happen as soon as hours after launch)<br />
Also every time zone will have servers but the Aussies will connect to the PST servers while the europe guys will take the EST servers (leaving the 2 &quot;middle&quot; time zones relative empty) (for those wondering: the computer chain I work has pre-orders fro europe that go into the 5 digits for the US version of the game)<br />
<br />
I would say just pick a server with a low player count when you start and enjoy  :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah, we're not too happy not knowing server names in advance.  Our friends are pretty much just going to pick something arbitrary like &quot;5th server in alpha order on Eastern realm&quot;.  Basically hope for the best.  I really wouldn't care if I had to restart but I don't wanna lose my names. We got into EQ late so we had to make do with butchered spellings of some of the ones we wanted.<br />
<br />
So to sum up: if you're on my server please refrain from using any Greco-Roman names until after I've announced that I'm all set.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Salece</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the responses.<br />

I'm just curious: what would happen to the folks in Asia? (Japanese and Indian can communicate pretty well in English).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">LOL, Iz :)<br />
<br />
Speaking of names, a name filter seemed to be non-existent in beta.  Hopefully something will be enforced when live, although I always hope that and I'm always disappointed.  Oh well, at least in beta I got to test that /ignore worked on all the battlenet'ers.  It worked well, just hope I don't reach a max ;).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Good question.<br />
<br />
Blizzard refused to state anything on the forced localization until the very last day when Tyren posted that he understood the problems it would bring but that there was nothing he could do about it. Not even post what was being discussed.<br />
<br />
However knowing that gamecards can be used from all over the world to connect to the US servers I expect to see large communities on the east and west coast servers from outside the US (on the other hand, French speaking canadians are planning to move to the french euro server)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">East coast servers got hammered with people and the worst of the lag bugs in beta. If possible I am going to use a different region.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Mill,<br />
<br />
I played on both East Coast and West Coast servers in the open beta - there was no difference.  The lag wasn't due to the numbers of people on the server (we had way more than that on the closed beta server), it was due to some seriously unoptimized code that was checked in as part of the Monday morning patch in the second week of the open.  Luckily they ran it down and fixed it by last weekend.  The weird login queue they instituted on Friday was just a way to closely control the volume of people on a server (which the west coast and closed beta servers experienced too as I would try to switch servers when one was queued up) until they were sure their emergency patch worked . . . which it did.<br />
<br />
Iz - are you really using the 5th server in alpha order?  Let me know!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yeah the lag in OB had nothing to do with server/farm locations... it was server side lag.  I'm not concerned about the geographical location of the server my crew chooses.<br />
<br />
I understand the reasons behind not giving out server names to a degree, but it's fairly silly.<br />
<br />
People are also complaining a bit too much about not having the list.  It's not like it will be that hard to communicate with friends/guildies regarding server selection.  I mean we have all kinds of crazy ways to communicate now... ie:  guild/public message boards, IRC, AIM, ICQ, e-mail, or even the phone!<br />
<br />
I can almost guarantee that within an hour of people being in game if not sooner lists of servers will start showing up on various public forums.<br />
<br />
My EQ guild and server have a decent group of folks heading to play Horde PVP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Lets all join the same server ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Doesn't EQ have about 40 servers? And WoW is anticipating needing more?<br />
<br />
What's the population per WoW server?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Iz - are you really using the 5th server in alpha order?  Let me know!<br />
I got a friend's voicemail to return to finalize it.  I'll post this weekend if and when we've decided.  I'm still crossing my fingers that they'll release servers on Monday or something.<br />
<br />
Krup, aren't you going Horde at release anyways?  There's a 100% chance that I will play Horde at some point, but at least initially I think we're sticking with Alliance.  Of course, that may change when there's a 5:1 ratio of Alliance:Horde and there are no mobs to kill.  :eek:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rough estimates I've seen tossed around are 3000-3500 per server (online at peak time).  They disabled the population counts before Open Beta started (we had them in closed beta, they were over 2000 quite often), then disabled the ability to get more than 50 results from a /who command, so there's not really a way to tell anymore.  Now you just get &quot;Low&quot;, &quot;Medium&quot;, &quot;High&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure the servers are geographically colocated with the time zone they're supporting.  Last I heard, Blizzard had a huge server farm located here in Virginia that supported the entire North American operation.  The time zone feature was just a way for players to synch up with each other time-of-day-wise and to make the in game clock synchonize with &quot;local&quot; time.  They are eventualy going to have servers in countries around the world, but for the US, the servers, so far, reside here in VA.</div></div><hr />

I'm in Europe and want to play tomorrow. What are these gamecards you speak of. What do I do to have to play on a US server from London, England.<br />

all you need to do is get a copy of the game, and have a valid north american address, I believe. I heard, but no idea if true, they may ahvea  way of blocking overseas ip's, but that's rumor.<br />

I can still PVP on the PVE servers, but it's at my discretion, not the whims of some 13 year old ganker or bonged out 38 year old sociopath.</div></div><hr />

The problem with consensual pvp, is how often will somone lower level want to fight? Or not have the numbers, they will not fight, it will be the old stand around and dance crap cause people don't have any balls. I must admit I die too much, I don't care if the person cons ??? or not, I attack.<br />

See but some people don't like to PVP gank or no they preffer to kill dragons and gnolls etc and OCASIONALLY and i mean very very very ocasionally they step in an arena for 5 minutes and they got their pvp fix for the next 3 to 4 months.<br />
<br />
I wish there was an option to autodecline duels. There are morons that sit in outposts like the xroads and they spam duel invites at whoever comes there. I don't care if i can win or lose. I simply don't like pvping. Not my cup of tea.<br />
<br />
<br />
When they get all servers and some stats will be released you will see that the majority of the people will STILL be on the &quot;blue&quot; servers. Most people like PVE period.<br />

I bet you will be surprised, the pvp servers were pretty popular in beta, and a very large amount of people so far have indicated pvp servers. I understand where you are coming from, btu also understand, the horror stories people hear are usually blown out of proportion. You hear people say they were corpse camped at level 10 and stuff and that simply is not true.<br />

<br />
Tauren Shaman - of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Let me just say this.<br />
<br />
I played on a PvP server and didnt even know it. I never once got attacked i was in ally areas. The PvP that  did go on was to me and my little PvP experience, much different then EQ pvp. In EQ my experince with PvP was that some 50 level jerk would kill you at level 5 and camp your corpse for 3 hours laughing at you or something to that effect, there was not repercussions for being a jerk. The PvP is WoW is much different IMHO cause there is a reward and penalty for your actions.<br />
<br />
Let me quote Blizzard here...<br />
<br />
A dishonorable kill is when a player kills another player that is 7 or more levels below them. When this happens, the player will receive the message “Dishonorable Kill” on their screen and they will lose honor points. If they lose enough points, they could potentially not be able to visit their own faction towns. <br />
<br />
This is a example of how blizzard is putting PvP in a more controlable setting. At level 20-30+ most people wont wanna be KoS to the whole server in every zone. A bad rep and bad honor points would make for a very unfun game even for the biggest of jerks.<br />
<br />
Also, the PvP that i saw going on was not really a lot of 1 on 1 or ganking or ambushing, it was group raiding where you and 20 people would go take out a oppsing town or something.  Couple that with the ease of the grouping system and how quickly groups can form as opposed to EQ and i think you will find the the PvP world in WoW is MUCH more tolerable then EQ PvP.  Im strongly considering playing PvP for the first time ever cause i had so much fun the final day of beta participating in the defense of aurbudine ( forget spelling ).<br />
<br />
Maybe its differen higher, but this was what my level 12 hunter experienced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">BTW, im torn between a taruen shaman, a undead warlock or a DE hunter. I had the most fun with those classes.<br />
<br />
Shaman is my first choice, but he wsa healing a lil more then i want to in groups, so i dont know if i wanna run that role again. I really dont like worrying about people dying cause they wont slow down. Its not cause they arent listening or im lazy, its cause im truly concerned and will feel horrible if they die. Which is why i have no desire to be a priest or a cleric ( EQ ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Nope still no.<br />
<br />
I despise playing against players in such games. I am a die hard HL1 fan and played all mods i love FPS games. I love the PVP there. However in a fantasy game i like to play against dragons and undead (not forsaken) etc. /duel invite /chicken etc simply doesn't do it for me.<br />
I hope they implement a auto decline option for all duels. <br />

Playing Feather once again. Human thief. Level 7 so far. Tons of fun really. But not as much charecter customization as I would like. No stat points to spend or anything. and no real choices yet per what to get. just follow up the tree. <br />
<br />
Skinner / Tailor at the moment. <br />
<br />
I got Snoww as a name as well. But made her up as a paladin. Closest thing to how I would play since shaman is horde only. <br />
<br />
I also made a Warrior. Qint. Who was my sk in EQ. I might reroll him as an undead warrior though later. Not sure yet. <br />
<br />
Ill worry about casters later. Right now i am having much fun Eviscerating things. <br />
