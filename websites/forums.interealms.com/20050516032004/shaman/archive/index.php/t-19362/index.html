<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Splitzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It's not exactly an original idea, but something mentioned in another thread got me thinking.  The idea of &quot;Aura&quot; buffs was brought up.  <br />
<br />
Basically, the way I see these is a buff that you cast on yourself that would pulse, rather like a bard song, to give everyone in the area an effect.  Aura of Alacrity for a small overhaste, Aura of Replenishment for a small bit of extra regen, Avatar's Aura for some atk and stats, etc.  Nothing really big, but enough to make it worth while.<br />
<br />
The mechanics to do this are in the game already.  Spells can auto-cast other spells: recourses, proc buffs, etc.  For simplicity, I'll refer to the self-cast buff as &quot;Aura buff&quot; and the pulsing effect as &quot;Aura effect&quot;.  You would cast the Aura buff on yourself and it would take up a buff slot just like focus or haste or any other normal buff.  The Aura buff would then auto-cast a short duration, bard-like ae Aura effect every 3-5 seconds that would reside in the short duration buff window.  <br />
<br />
For balance purposes, none of the Aura buffs would stack.  That way each shaman would be limited to only one Aura buff at a time.  The Aura effects, however, would be somewhat stackable.  Make it so that you could coordinate up to 2-3 active at any given time.  So you could stack an overhaste aura effect with an avoidance aura effect, or shielding/mitigation with avoidance, but not overhaste and shielding/mitigation.<br />
<br />
To keep people from swapping out auras like a bard twisting songs, give the Aura buffs an insanely long cast time and mana cost.  Make it something you would cast once then leave up for a few hours.<br />
<br />
Would this step on some toes and probably piss off a few bards?  Yeah, probably since they've had exclusive reign over this sort of thing for years now.  On the other hand, we've got six slots in the SD buff window.  How often do you consistantly fill all six in a raid?  Unless you're grouped with a bard or two, I'm guessing hardly ever.  And if you are grouped with a bard, the group songs they're playing would be better than the Aura and overwrite it.  Giving us something small to put there isn't going to affect them, as long as it doesn't introduce stacking issues.<br />
<br />
The key thing here is nothing too big.  Adding 10% overhaste, 15hps extra regen, or 5% mitigation won't change the game, but it will give us a nice little something to give to a raid while the one Aura per shaman limit would keep the impact on grouping minimal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">These are wonderful ideas, and I would love to see something like this implemented.  I think it is reasonable and not unbalancing, and it would accomplish exactly what we want it to:  A small but significant increase in our value to a raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sounds just like the &quot;Aura&quot; stuff in Warcraft~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">A good idea is a good idea, whichever the source.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Idea for raid stacking that doesn't need lot of developer time (aka money for SOE):<br />
<br />
- Bigger fast heal.<br />
- Bigger nuke.<br />
- Fix DoT aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">proof that there are too many classes in everquest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you can only have a couple auras up, and you ony need to cast them every few hours, I don't see it as really increasing stackability, since the 2 shammies you have covering everything now can put out the auras.<br />
<br />
Not saying that it is not a worthwhile idea (hell, I am ALL OVER passive, long lasting, area of effect buffs--make them all like that plz), but I am not sure this will increase stacking by a great deal.<br />
<br />
I don't ask for much, just get rid of the hard coded 20% resist on rains =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>TPFKAFaern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You know what &quot;stacks&quot; on raids?<br />
<br />
Exactly what Zorlac alluded to - Damage.<br />
<br />
THAT'S what needs to be looked at.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I kicked an idea out like that several times.  I wouldn't make it a single cast, long duration one though - give it a long cast/recast (short mem, long recast would be best - even an aa style timer).  And I wouldn't make it a travelling one either - drop a ghostly &quot;spirit totem&quot;, that pulses the aura out.  Yeah, like the Wards in Warcraft 3.  Give it a shorter duration (3 min tops, maybe), so that it's still usefull in groups and raids where you're moving.  And make them nonstackable, so that you'd have to have several shaman scatter them around to get everyone in the raid, or use different ones for extre effects.<br />
<br />
I'd also like for them to redo some of our stat buffs, and go with various Avatar style buffs - instead of a single stat buff (Dex, Cha, whatever), make it do several things.  For instance: Spirit of Bear (+12 Sta), Spirit of Ox (+21), Health, Stamina, Riotous Health, Endurance of the Boar (leaving out group spells) - all share a similiar theme.  Health, vitality, critters that would seem to indicate charging - so make it a multi-buff.  Adds Stamina (and hp), add Endurance (for the new melee disc's), and adds a stun dd proc.  Lower level buffs do small stuff, higher level buffs do more.  And then do similiar things with the other stats.  Suddenly, buffs are wanted again - as you get more than maxxing out a stat, you get added endurance and a combat benefit to boot.  Maybe not a lot, but it'd be a reason to keep using buffs.<br />
<br />
But then, I don't see them doing such a drastic revamp to an entire class at this stage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Splitzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Please note that none of this was intended as an alternative to fixing our shoddy DPS or sub-par healing abilities, just as an extra little something that'd be fun and somewhat unique.  Suggesting bigger heals/nukes is a way to bring our class into line with where the other classes have progressed.  The Aura thing, at least how I see it, is an ability to give us a 'wow, look what I can do' feeling on raids.  While playing golf with VP can provide this feeling, it's pretty much agreed that it's not exactly the most productive way to amuse yourself.<br />
<br />
I can think of two possible fixes to keep it from becoming yet another thing that the first two shaman do while everyone else gets left out.  Option one would be to make all the Aura effects stack.  Unfortunately, this would quickly fill the short duration buff window and leave no room for bards, who would probably get rather upset.  So you could either move it to the regular buff window (again, undesirable), or remove the icon all together.  This would allow several of us to get together and create a very real change in the strength of a raid.  Option two is to keep the stacking limit, but reduce the AE range.  Make it slightly larger than our epic's range, for example.  That would allow us to make different 'camps' within a raid and lead to the development of widely different auras that could serve a multitude of purposes.  You could then station 2-3 shaman up at the front with the melee using offensive and/or defensive auras.  To set up a caster or healer camp, you'd have to introduce some new abilities: an agro debuffer, a healing focus, or mana preservation, for example.  We have a few effects in our potion line-up that could work nicely.  Like everything else, make the effects small but noticable.  Say around 5-10% for each. Then you could station 2-3 more with the casters.  On longer raids, rez/rebuff stations could be set up.  A few auras that are intended to help get people back up on their feet could be used here.  And so on.<br />
<br />
I'll readily admit this would take some time to put into effect, but not from a mechanics standpoint.  Like I said before, everything needed to accomplish this is already in the game.  Set up the Aura buff like a long-lasting HoT, only instead of healing every tick, it autocasts the aura effect.  The effect would be set up like a bard song.  Most of the effort would be in creating enough different auras to allow us to be flexable with their use.</div></div><hr />
