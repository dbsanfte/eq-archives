You'll know when the time comes, but it'll be a long time from now on IMO. In pop our melee sucks but old world dungeons I usually melee cause you can't sit down so might as well do something :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I suppose it depends where you are and what level you are.  I never melee, unless I am really, really, really bored.  <br />
<br />
The time is better spent doing the canni-dance (indoors) or sitting on the hourse (outdoors) and hammering away at the nukes.<br />
<br />
That being said, however, there are two thing to keep in mind:<br />
<br />
1) At your level, you might do more damage meleeing than using your nukes/dots.  <br />
<br />
2) Meleeing will allow you to raise your defense.  I strongly recommend that, at the VERY LEAST, you melee enough each level to get your 5 points of defense, offense, and piercing.  It is *incredibly* hard to raise your defense once you enter 55+ range.   You'll save yourself a world of trouble by taking care of it as you level.  It is especially important, regarding defense, because you will be taking a *pounding* alot once you reach higher levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I got my JBB at 52. Thats when I switched from poking with my REIF to using the clicky nuke. If hadn't gotten the JBB, who knows when I would have stoped. Stoicism might make nuking more efficient nowadays? I do think that if one gets the JBB, that is when one stops to melee (except for fun).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">well i tend to melee a lot ( even in pop ) at 63 because i determined that it helps the fun factor for me that and im on tactics with a chanter</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Remember our slow slows time, allowing you to get some extra swings in.<br />
 :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i am 57 with RIEF or Hammer of Spiritcalling, no epic.  i wear the Velks Haste gloves. duo with a pally friend of mine, or solo, i always melee.  Pally is lvl 54 and knows not to bitch.<br />
<br />
raid or guild event, i switch to resist or wis gear, and never melee.  to many rampage mobs, or AE stuff to start swinging the stick.<br />
<br />
till 50 we do not melee to bad, after that we fall miserably behind because we hit our cap and other classes pass us.<br />
<br />
as it was said, you have to melee some to get the defense skill up.<br />
<br />
if there was one thing i would change about shaman, it is our melee skill cap.  (even more than i would spell drops)  i hate it we go from melee for at least 40 lvls, and then they turn us into some necro/druid worthless melee class.</div></div><hr />
