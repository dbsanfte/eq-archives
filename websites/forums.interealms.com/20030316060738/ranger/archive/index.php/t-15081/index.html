..ok, so - i'm a 51 ranger, very mediocre items, my girlfriend is a chanter, 40 - the PLing is stopping and the grouping is starting, we've been looking for suitable zones to fear kite, that is me snare, she fear, no animal only limitations - and we need somewhere to do it.. uhm.. we tried skyfire but those bastard chromadracs seem unfearable! curse them.. anyways, we next went to burning woods and found a *perfect* spot killing apes, wurms.. etc.. the pathing was delicious.. but my ability to kill them is too low, they have too much hp, i made a whopping one yellow in 3 hours - so..<br />
<br />
..can anyone suggest decent zones for a ranger chanter duo suitable for upto level 55, mobs with specifically low ac or low hp would be much appreciated.. if we can't find a decent spot we'll end up camping the highkeep nobles, sigh..<br />
<br />
..thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Celt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would invest some serious time in the chanter , grouped with you slaughtering hordes of mobs in various outdoor zones, dreadlands, emerald jungle, wakening lands, eastern wastes, Trakanon's teeth, or continue your assault in burning woods.  City of Mist might also be a good spot to hit near the zone.  Dawnshroud isn't bad either :)<br />
<br />
Mobs hitpoints go up a LOT as you get out of the old world and into kunark and the rest of the expansions.  Honestly from my standpoint, slaughter hordes of dogs in solb using slows and the berserker series to cushion the loss of hitpoints.  The xp is good and their hitpoints aren't anywhere near what kunark+ mobs have.  Once the enchanter has swift like the wind at 49 your dps might be high enough to go back to burning woods and be a lot more efficcient.  Also shiftless deeds is a huge boon for the enc/ranger duo.  Try a few at the zone and see if you can keep up.<br />
<br />
If you insist on fearkiting though, the above list has fearable mobs in your level range if you want some xp too :)  Be warned tho, until your chanter gets a bit closer to you in level you aren't going to make great xp in your duo, her power needs to be almost as much as yours to be efficcient :)<br />
<br />
Once she's in her 50s, I'd mosey the 2 of you over to scarlet desert and fearkite little aliens and bandit types/bugs etc, anything blue to you guys you can probalby fear out there for decent xps, and at the top of the mesa you can make some darn good xp in your 50s :)  However, they hit somewhat hard, so be prepared to get owned a bit if your gear hasn't improved by then much :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hmm, she might even level faster if she solos via charming mobs and having em wail on each other, you just snare both mobs so if they argo on her she can outrun em. Also you can help her if charm fails or if her pet dies wayyyyy to early.<br />
<br />
BTW if yer gonna group go SolB, LGuk, or City of Mist enternace. Generally go old world for easier mobs then look at dungeons for XP bonuses.<br />
<br />
note: just remembered something, Tower of Frozen Shadows in Velious, can do 30-55 + aa's there so you guys might like it, best part is when feared mobs run to the levels enterance and get stuck in the wall so they are rooted but dont fight back, just go to www.eqatlas.com and search for the Tower or go to http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/zonelist.html and go into the ToFS section for more info and good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Medain Valacirca</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have duo'd with chanters since 31st lvl.Fear kiting is good,Charm kiting is better.Lot tougher more dangerous but the payoff is worth the risk.And its fun.<br />
<br />
Keep PL'ing the chanter till she is closer to your lvl.Pets no longer get any of the xp as long as she does 1 point of dmg to mob.And with you to snare her pet charm breaks wont be too bad and she will make great xp.Any outdoor zone with mobs she can charm will work for this.Better to start learning the ins and outs of charmkiting now.<br />
<br />
Ranger/Enchanter duo is quite lethal.Once you are both in your 50's you can go just about anywhere wih that combo.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah Mages are your friend =). They can summon a nice item Muzzle of Mardu.</div></div><hr />
