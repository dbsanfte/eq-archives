<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Geordi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This morning I thought we would try to duo in Plane of Noghtmare and much to my surprise it worked .......and worked well. Me a 55 shaman and my partner a 52 mage. The pets held agro all the time and slow stuck on the first try. We were not bashed once. I would pull with slow, run back to camp and pets held agro the entire time while mage nuked and I E-Bolted. Fights took some time cause of the huge amount of HP's in the mobs here but it can be done. In 3 hours of play time I made 32 percent exp, which is damn good. The 52 mage fire pet is pretty strong, just watch the pets health and you'll be fine.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>starlite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">for the sake of data collection, go try the same combo in dulak and report back if its easier;   mobs have similar lvl.  Just wondering if lower hps and so if exp would be quicker??</div></div><hr />

I actually suggest Nadox over Dulak at that level.  However, at 50, I had little trouble slowing mobs in PoN.  Healing would be the problem that I would see, though, if we were duoing.  Especially with the fire pet.  The mage I duo with is 58 and has his epic pet, so it's a little different.  Near the end of the fight I just cast Stoicism on the pet and all is good.  I hate having to use Sup heal . . . ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Mage/Shammy duo works great in many places. I usually group up with my brother (60 mage) from time to time in PoN for easy quick XP. We've been doing it since our mid 50's or so.<br />
<br />
Earth pet is good, he used to him but recently he's been going with the air pet a lot. Stuns help a lot and I can root whenever I get aggro. Air pet will need more healing though even with the stuns so it's only a better option at 58+ when you have your gimp CH, IMO. <br />
<br />
Have the mage pull with Mal. Let's you sit back and Cann and slow on the pull rather than pulling with slow and risking a resist which can lead to a very quick death in the planes.</div></div><hr />
