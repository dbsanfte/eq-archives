<br />
I was thinking about this today after getting my EBolts resisted 3 times in a row on 4 different mobs(I ended up OOCing for a partner).<br />
<br />
I believe the theory held currently is that the DD on our DoTs is there to force root to break(maybe as an answer to the DD on druid roots as well). Well if that were true why couldn't they seperate the resist check for the DD and the DoT? That would still force the root to break, but wouldn't make soloing as inefficient as it can be, and lead to alot of shamans dying or zoning. (This is mainly for the pre-50 shamans, as mana isn't that hard to acquire afterwards) Yes, I'm aware shamans are next to gods at 60, but frankly it took alot more pain and suffering than it should of to solo pre-51. (&lt;3 my new regen)<br />
<br />
I think this would be a relatively easy fix, and would help spread our DoTs away from druids a bit, who seem to have much more effective DoTs than us. (Yes, I'm aware our damage is better, but that doesn't help when it's so easily resisted)<br />
<br />
I know druids might get a little angry at this request, but the fact remains that our only means of soloing (reliably) is to Root/rott, kiting does not work very well for us, you have superior DDs for that(Ie, even if you can't get root to stick due to it's DD requirement you can still kite it around snared). Even with our DoTs fixed, it would not make us anywhere near as effective as quadkiting, it would just make for alot less pain and suffering for shamans. ;)<br />
<br />
Anyway, now for the comments.</div></div><hr />

<br />
NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Root rotting is probably our most inefficient method of soloing.  Pull the mob with slow, and then sic your pet on it while you stand there and tank it.  Apply disease and melee, or if you have a JBB (which I heavily recommend you try to get), start clicking.  If you're having trouble tanking it, swap out some of your damn druid wis gear for some AC/HP gear.<br />
<br />
However, you do have a good idea.  It would be very nice to see the resist checks seperated.  I don't think it would be that big of a deal, though.  I almost never get more than one resist in a row while exp hunting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">To be fair there are times when root/rot is the best choice.<br />
<br />
For example, I'm strolling through the Oasis when I see a Sand Giant. I can spend 5 minutes buffing up and making a pet to kill him efficiently, or I can root/root him straight away.<br />
<br />
If there were half a dozen SGs all lined up waiting for me to kill em, I'd go with the slow/pet/melee option, but for a quick opportunistic kill, root/rot is a viable choice. More so if you have your epic and can do the DoT for free.</div></div><hr />

~*I think Druid's would only get mad at you comparing yourself to them, especially in this manner.*~<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;but the fact remains that our only means of soloing (reliably) is to Root/rott,&quot;<br />
<br />
~*As others mentioned, tanking while pet/DoT's/Slow eats away at the mob is very efficient.*~<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;kiting does not work very well for us, you have superior DDs for that(Ie, even if you can't get root to stick due to it's DD requirement you can still kite it around snared).&quot;<br />
<br />
~*For a good portion pre-50 Druid's and Shaman DD's are on par with one another.  Using SoW, you can kite, as well.  Lack of snare makes it slightly harder, but Shaman AC is a cushion for that.*~<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Even with our DoTs fixed, it would not make us anywhere near as effective as quadkiting,&quot;<br />
<br />
~*You're blatently dead wrong.  With Canni alone you can root/rot at nearly twice the pace of a Druid's quadding.  I can't stress this enough:  Quadding is not that good!  It simply appears to be such an efficient manner of exp gain...Maybe it's the 4 faction messages at once?  Honnestly, a Druid quadding decent exp mobs will run down to maybe a bub of mana left after the quad, then they sit for 10 mins, medding.  In that ten mins a Shaman using canni and root/rotting could have killed 6 or 7 mobs.  Common misconception, but quadding F**king sucks.  End of story.*~<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;it would just make for alot less pain and suffering for shamans.&quot;<br />
<br />
~*Is it really that painful at this point?*~<br />
<br />
/shrug I would suggest if you wanted anything seriously looked at by VI to NOT compare yourself to another class.  Comparisons are way too easy to turn around on people, in Eq.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Its also not just opportunistic, its more situational.  Sometimes there are tough mobs that will really reem you in melee, even slowed, but that you can stack a mountain of DoTs on and cann that health down for more mana from a safe distance.  Guardian of Felia in SF for instance, I can solo him consistantly with root/rot, but not with melee and I've dumped most of my wis items for AC (wis down 23 pts, AC up 37)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thalarctos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I read some people advocating getting rid of the dd part of the DoT's all together... I used to think they were crazy till I got my epic.  Damn it's nice to be able to dot without breaking root.  My new method is to pull with slow, root/send in dog (on some stuff dog can get enough agro to hold the off me for the next part), cast epic, jbb away!  The root will break from jbb's, but who cares?  I wear plate armor for a reason  =)<br />
<br />
Root/rot'ing might be silly, border-line too damn easy, if in addition to the epic, I could stack 2-3 mana using DoT's on there without having to reroot every 6 seconds.<br />
<br />
I've played 2 shaman to lvl's 54 and 55.  Sure, there are some tough stretches pre-45, but you don't want life to be too easy.  My favorite eq memories are about  the time I took on the iksar bp dropping SK (lvl 50 or 51, can't remenber) solo at 53 etc., not how many blues I could kill in an hour.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was putting in the druid comparisons to show that seperating the DD/DoT would not make us that much more powerful. Balancing issues HAVE to be compared to the other classes. You have to show how it's going to affect gameplay, so they won't institute something and then see that it has adverse effects on another classes abilities.<br />
<br />
To the AC/Hp shaman:<br />
I am one myself, take a look at my gear, I wear as much ac/hp gear as possible with my small amount of pp. I bought a SBS yesterday, but haven't updated my magelo yet.<br />
<br />
I just find Root/Rotting more mana efficient. Hp = Mana, that's the basis for the Hp/Ac theory, so why stnad in front of hte mob wasting &quot;mana&quot;(hps), when you could spend 30mana and keep the mob from hitting you. I don't do it because I enjoy it, I do it because I'm trying to catch up to my friends, and I try to make my leveling as fast as possible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
~*Aye, he appears to be much more serious about leveling.  I'm guessing while he was quadding his ass off, that you were taking your exp slowly.  I compare the root/rotting to quadding since they're both forms of solo exp, comparing them to group exp as you said, is pretty hard to do, since it's circumstantial.  Given if the two of you were in the same zone, you root/rotting and him quadding you'd be almost doubling his exp.  the problem with just comparing how fast two people leveled is this:  You had 2 methods of exp gain, grouping, and root/rotting.  He just quadded.  Different zones, group quality, time spent specifically exp'ing, buffs from friends/passers by, and roughly 15 other variables all play a significant role in this.*~<br />
<br />
Giac, send me an e-mail, (XicanTempestWolf@hotmail.com) I will try and dig up a parsing of my logs for you that a friend got for me (I have no idea how that **** works).  It basically shows the exact amount of mobs I'm taking down over time, with mana usage etc. and compares quadding to root/rotting specifically.  I believe I made 1 1/2 blues more (in a 4 hour playing period) with root/rot.  That's what I base my entire arguement about quadding sucking on.  I can't wait for my Shammy to get canni, frankly, since I can only *imagine* how fast the exp will be coming in.  Shaman are a lot better off then you guys like to think...As are most classes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hold on for a second, it seems like you're comparing druid root/rotting to druid quad-kiting.<br />
<br />
IF that is the case, then that evidence is useless. The whole argument was that druid dots have become more efficient than shaman dots due to our dots being resisted outright a lot more. I didn't notice it as much til I received my epic, but the DD requirement makes the dot get resisted about 4x as much, if not more. Losing 300mana(about a bubble, because I have mostly hp/ac gear, not wis gear), is a pain in the butt, and if you're not prepared you can get your ass handed to you(ie, keep enough mana for root and/or gate).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>corlathist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">No he appears to be comparing Druid Quad Kiting to Shaman Root/Rotting<br />
<br />
This was in the other thread on Druid Petition.<br />
<br />
This is the 3rd player with direct knowledge on this site<br />
to play both a shaman 50+ and a druid 50+ and say that they <br />
XP faster with the shaman than the druid quadding.<br />
<br />
It is very workload dependant though.  Quadding is &quot;difficult&quot; <br />
for 5 minutes ((more time and more difficult with staff))  out of say 15.  Maybe 1/3 of the time your actually, running timing the kite, circling etc.  The other 2/3 your sitting on your butt regening mana.  <br />
<br />
Shamans must RL work harder.  They have to Cann Dance ((See other threads)) your spending a lot more time working the Dance, the Root/Rot/JBB/Pet/Tank etc.  Your downtime between kills is still work.<br />
<br />
Been talking to a guildy friend.  He just doesn't cann dance when soloing.  He just meds &amp; BSes usually.   He has chosen to XP slower than a druid.  He could XP faster.  But thats a gaming choice he made.<br />
<br />
So a lot of times when Shamans say a Druid gets faster XP quadding, it because the shaman CHOOSES to let that happen.<br />
<br />
Theres also the Gear Issue.  As a Shaman can xp for money, and<br />
dramatically improve themselves with the right gear.  ((JBB/Fungi))<br />
HG, Seafuries, and Ice Giants are all excellent for gathering money<br />
for those pieces.  As is any Fine Steal dropping mob.  10k, 15k, 20k, whatever the JBB is on yourserver is money well spent.<br />
<br />
Personally, when I solo either classes.  I'm XP grinding.<br />
So I work at it.  If I want something more relaxing, I tend to get a group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Linora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Why on earth would you root a mob to solo it, it effectivly makes your JBB useless, unless you care to re-root the mob every cast or so. <br />
<br />
So when you root a mob you loose alot of damage, so he dies slower, and you have to root more.  Root isnt mana free.  Slow Pox Scourge Epic Bane JBB, tank and re-apply bane as needed, kills faster and with less mana (unless your some wussy wanna be druid shaman who can't tank)<br />
<br />
I for one would rather med/canni after he is dead then while hes rooted glaring at me.<br />
<br />
The only time I ever root actually when soloing is if when I get more adds then I can tank, or if canni 5 is up.<br />
<br />
Root-Torpor-canni5-wait for torpor to finish-run back into to battle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I use root/dot all the time when soloing. As an iksar, I cant use a JBB, so that isnt an issue. I dont think tanking is a good use of your hp either, since those are better used as fuel for canni. Usually I pull with slow and then stand and take whatever pounding until I can root and back off. The pet enters the picture at that point. Then I epic dot and finish off with an e-bolt, rerooting if required. If my pet gets low on health I pull him back to regen.<br />
<br />
I usually try to end the fight with my mana/hp as high as possible. Unless you are going against casters, killing the mob as fast as possible usually isn't necessary, and is mana inefficient.<br />
<br />
An interesting observation though, in maidens last night I stayed for a few solo kills after my group dissolved, and in 3 or 4 kills got more xp than I had with the group that evening. Just goes to show that grouping isnt allways the answer.<br />
<br />
The biggest problem when soloing is resists of course, unless you have mana free deamage devices you can get into trouble pretty quickly. The solution though, is to simply find mobs that dont resist. With a bit of trial and error, I've always managed to find solo spots that were right for my level at the time :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I am level 58, maxed defense, and self buffed ac is around 1000 give or take a bit depending on gear I have on at the time.<br />
<br />
There are mobs I can solo that I canNOT tank. How? Root rot. Then again, there are blue mobs that I can solo while tanking the whole time.<br />
<br />
Gorangas (for dexample) in ME I root rot till they are at 25% then I bracer/melee till dead.  <br />
<br />
There is no ONE way to do it. Do what is best for each mob and for you. Toys like epic, fungi, JBB give you more options. If you are 60 and fortunate then torpor gives you even more options.</div></div><hr />

Hmm... maybe because I'm too poor to own a JBB? /sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Carne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Personally, I have been soloing in Dawnshroud for a few lvls now. I had been root rotting and it wasn't too bad, although, even with can I had to med for a couple minutes after taking down 2 MOBS in a row. I decided to try pet/tanking and have been now able to take down about 5 MOBS in a row without medding back to full. I find it a lot more efficient at this point to tank. I will never have a JBB :( but I still like to tank when I can.</div></div><hr />
