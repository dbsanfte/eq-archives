<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ssabre Spiritscale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all,<br />
<br />
Listen I am trying to help a friend play catch up. . .I am 53 shaman and he has a 42 warrior.  Where would you recommend taking him to PL him up?<br />
<br />
Looking for best results. . .I have a fungi and getting a KEI doesn't seem to be a prob. . .<br />
<br />
Quickest advancement, least downtime. . .<br />
<br />
Suggestions?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ssabre Spiritscale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hmm. . .Thanks Urd, never even considered the Hole<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm doing similar with my little SK, impressed with him so far, he's outdamaging dogdog (lvl 55 pet) already at lvl 41 with a 26/35 2HS, and this is before i give him a real nice 2 hander when he hits 45.<br />
<br />
I thought about The Hole but a couple of things put me off....<br />
<br />
1) Entrance hall is perma camped on my server with all the other PL'ers :)<br />
<br />
2) Its a pita to get to only to find its already camped. Although I could log my melee there and log him in to check I guess ?<br />
<br />
I was trying to think of other area's and only really came up with CoM, Guk and SolB.<br />
<br />
Anyone think of any more ? I'm personally leaning towards CoM because unless there is an epic raid going on you can pretty much guarantee you have the zone to yourself :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Baldkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">42-50 is a tough spot. <br />
<br />
CoM worked wonders for my monk at that level.... and there is always spots to hunt. <br />
<br />
LGuk is pretty empty on my server these days (Quellious) too.<br />
<br />
Dawnshroud peaks is good too... and scarlet desert (near TS zone) might be good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Echo caverns was good from 44-51 for me, solo. Probably good for a duo but a bit slower.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cazec</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">/agree echo, stay 42-52 there or 55 if u wanna waste gnome guards and u could prolly get xp there too</div></div><hr />
