<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>DarkPhase</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">For the moment I'm very happy. My shammy just bought Torpor for 18k. And I allready had Malo(plus a spare copy), Fungi, JBB and Epic. Only had to give up FT3 boots to get cash for it.<br />
All I need now is level 60, but how can I get level 60 when there is one important thing missing. I don't have internet(Sitting at a friends place atm)...<br />
<br />
Soon soon I will get that too and I'm going to be one happy oracle :)<br />
<br />
It's a funny story how I got Torpor too. I started a bet with a monk allso looking for torpor. He claimed torpor was more common than malo and I knew it was not so, so I made a bet that if I auctioned to buy torpor for 100k I wouldn't find a seller. So I tried /auction WTB Torpor. paying 100k<br />
<br />
Out of the blue some minutes later a rogue tells me: &quot;How much will you pay for torpor?&quot;<br />
I replied: &quot;How about 20k&quot;<br />
He said: &quot;Sure, seems fair&quot;<br />
<br />
After some waiting for him to get finished in chardok he lowered the price by 2k since he was so late for the trade. Now I will prolly die while waiting for internet...<br />
<br />
BTW! Is there some vital shammy things I have missed? That I really should get? I'm looking to get a horse when I get enough cash.<br />
<br />
PS! if you wonder why I have 2 copies of Malo instead of just one it's because after I bought one for 30k, and I thought that was cheap, I saw another for sale even cheaper and then bought that too :) Gonna pass it to a shammy friend for cheap. Still haven't found out who tho.</div></div><hr />
