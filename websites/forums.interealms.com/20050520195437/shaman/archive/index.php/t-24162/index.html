<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Dunno if anyone has mentioned it, and I don't think I've seen it mentioned...<br />
<br />
The epic effect, which is a 10 min recast, .8-sec cast, group HoT for 400hps/tick... stacks with Quiescence, I've learned.<br />
<br />
Which means when I have epic effect going, and Q going.. I can heal people for 820/tick, not to mention regen.  Btw, the epic effect lasts 1:24 (14 ticks) for me, which means it heals all party members for over 5000 hps... it's great when group is taking heavy AoE damage, etc...  If my xp tank is pulling a tough named mob who is heavy on DPS, a Q + Fateseer's Boon is a great way to keep him on his feet.  It's also a great effect for xp over-pulls, when multiple group members are getting hammered while root/slow is being applied.<br />
<br />
For anyone who has the Q upgrade (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5416&amp;source=Live), well... you are a lucky bastard.<br />
<br />
And if you have Ancestral Aid... I'm not sure if that will stack either, but if it does --- whoowee!  That's some serious HoT ability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dissonant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ancestral Aid DOES stack.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yep! Considering how ugly the epic is and the fact that I have a TA, the right click effect (to be useable via inventory after the next patch) is the reason I want it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Btw, Fateseer's Boon is listed as lasting 1:00, but lasts 1:24-1:30 for me, which indicates that it is effected by extended enhancement type focii.  Not sure if that's been thrown out there.  I have 65% extension, so you'd think it would last longer than that... I only have Extended Enhancement 4 though, and I'm 66, so maybe I'm not getting the benefits of that focus for Fateseer's Boon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Fateseer's Boon, like all other effects that do not pertain to any class(i.e. not included in their spell list), is not affected by any kind of focus. The reason it will last 1:30 is that SCRM affects all buffs beyond the above mentioned restrictions.<br />
<br />
I would have liked to see Spirit Shifting(the AA we proposed for Omens) be the effect on our epic. Considering that Clerics got an upgraded Divine Arbitration with theirs, it should have been no issue to implement it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ah that would explain it.  So just my SCRM is effecting it.  Still cool, though..  5 extra ticks = 2000 extra hps healed.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah Epic clicky, ancestral aid and q/bot/serenity all stack and can be pretty handy in the right situation. I've been doing the instanced stuff of draniks alot lately and been doing the slower/healer thing on those and having my epic and the aa has probably saved my group a number of times. On a multi pull situation being able to throw 1 or both of the group hots out on everyone and then a BoT on the tanks makes things alot more viable than having to spam heals around. Epic + ancestral aid (2) + Bot = 705 a tick on everyone in the group and 1335 a tick on anyone with BoT up.<br />
<br />
Up it to Epic 2 + Aid (3) + Spiritual serenity and you've got 833 a tick on everyone and 1653 on anyone with serenity up. Definitely a nice thing to be able to throw down when needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bartmeista</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeah, I definitely love the stacking!<br />
<br />
Spiritual Serenity (820) + Fateseer's Boon (400) + Ancestral Aid 3 (333) = 1553/tick.  Add in a crit or two here and there if you have Healing Boon and schwing!<br />
<br />
I had a guild group in WoS Sunday morning and that Warfiend fella popped nearby.  Group was shm/shm/dru/clr/rog/bst.  Yeah, I know, priest heavy, but it's what was available.  :)  Anyways, Warfiend is a 2600 hitter and we only had a BST for tanking, but we pulled 'em anyways and survived.  I attribute a large part of it to the big HoT's above (except I have BoTrushar atm instead of SS).  It's a huge help between spams.<br />
<br />
They've also saved my ass a number of times kiting in groups or root/rot soloing when I need a quick heal while I'm being chased.   :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">is the epic /tgbable? I don't care about MGB so much, as I don't get into that kinda thing :P</div></div><hr />

No TA aint gonna be clickable from Inv , but epic 1.5 is as of next patch<br />

Zajeer-Dev wrote: After this next live patch, all epics will be usable for inventory. So if you're more of the one-hander type knight, then you can still have some effectiveness out of your epic (by being able to click it from inventory) and still use a 1hander and shield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>vincenzovs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It is defintely TGBable.<br />
<br />
Been using it a lot on raids. the &quot;Cleave 4.5&quot; effect is also nice based on testimony from some rogues I grouped with.<br />
<br />
The epic clicky  has filled a massive hole in my spell repertoire, and finally I don't feel AS resentful (I still feel some resent) towards Beastlords.<br />
<br />
However it is an odd place to put the spell we really needed (on the epic). Suprised me. I am pre-elemental and although people say the shaman epic is one of the easiest to complete it was still a lot of work, and my guild supported me massively and I am still the only pre-elemental shaman on my server with the epic.<br />
<br />
I now have the tools to do the job (keep a raid group or exp group in &quot;easy-normal&quot; fights healed) , but do feel sorry for more casual players who won't be able to get their epic.<br />
<br />
I suppose they have Ancestral aid which I didn't yet try.<br />
--<br />
<br />
Got my first KT group last week (after finally finishing the 4 th sewer trial) and was referred to as &quot;gimp&quot; in groupsay (dontcha love uberguilds?) for not having Balance of the Nihil by some of the &quot;uber guild&quot; members who invited me into their little group. <br />
<br />
I felt like a gimp as the Bard and Beastlord slowed while i got resists...<br />
<br />
2 days later i formed a vxed group with friends in order to get some more people flagged, and on the 18th Umbiki kill of my career the Rune i need (Yiktu is it?) dropped. <br />
<br />
THe cleric and I (the shaman) both lost the roll to a necro who has his GoD DoT now...<br />
<br />
I hear it drops a lot more in KT, but I swear the effort that I have had to go through to get to KT seems ridiculous<br />
<br />
This is one thing annoys the hell out of me. Sony say &quot;Slow is hard to balance&quot; (yes I agree) yet they balance the content against a spell that takes ridiculous efforts to get, and most will never get.<br />
<br />
***? Is all i can say.<br />
<br />
Sorry I digressed. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I've never seen the rune for Balance drop in KT and I've spent a ton of time there (or the direct heal, for that matter, although that's less important to me since we'll be getting an upgrade in OoW).

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I got my rune for Balance from a rare in sewer 1, I forget the name.  But now that no one is doing trials anymore I feel like I'm the only one thats going to get it, which sucks.   I have done over 30 sewer trials getting people flagged and only seen 2 runes drop.   You will probably have better luck just farming Vxed rares although getting people to do Vxed is like pulling teeth.  I hope it's better in your guild than it is in mine hehe.<br />
<br />
Ok that was off-topic ~  more on topic I had a problem with the right click effect on the epic last night.  I had just got it (my guild rocks), and we were exping in poEarth when the clicky just stopped working.  The recast time was way overdue but it kept telling me I had to wait.  I tried zoning, and camping to char select but that didnt fix it.  I finally had to log all the way out and then it finally worked.  Anyone else have this problem?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Grumpf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">hope they make the TA inventory clickable, even tho that would make it even more overpowered...that possible?  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>lightus_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">about the GoD spells:<br />
<br />
all 3 (not including the ancient spell) all drops in KT, but they are rare as hell there.<br />
Best place to farm them IMO is vxed and sewer trials.<br />
It took me a very long time to get my GoD which i got from vxed......<br />
and damn i love my GoD spells :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">any cleric rolling against you on a Yiktu is retarded.<br />
<br />
Thier Omens Light upgrade is not only thier 3rd 68 spell (not too bad, as 68 runes seem pretty common) but it's also 200 range which Holy Light is not!<br />
<br />
Explain to the cleric that they get a much better heal in OoW and that Nihil is something you'll be using likely forever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Jeis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">If that was a guild group i'd have hoped they would all pass as that one spell is probably the most useful and powerful GoD spell created, for other classes it has its uses but for a Shaman its like orgasm time:)</div></div><hr />

I did, but he rolled anyway. (what can you do)<br />
<br />
As for the necro (who won)....ok he got another dot but ... &amp;*^&amp;*^(<br />
<br />
Sadly they were both guildies as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
The real criminals here are SoE. Since they made Pained Memory (which I got last night and now love) they should have put a nihil into OOW imho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I've never seen the rune for Balance drop in KT and I've spent a ton of time there (or the direct heal, for that matter, although that's less important to me since we'll be getting an upgrade in OoW). I've seen the BoT rune drop over 20 times.<br />
Go back to KT and try again.  There was a patch about 1.5 months ago I'd guess, maybe about a month ago.  They didn't announce anything of course, but the drop rate of non-jelki runes was *highly* increased.  Up to that patch, I'd seen a grand total of 2 of the runes/spells drop that give nihil (I happen to have had the spell) in months of people farming KT for xp, and never saw the rune for heal.  After the patch, I've personally seen about 10-12 of each either in my own group, or mentioned through guild chat that one was rotting, in the span of about 2 weeks, with very little online xp time to notice this.<br />
<br />
I'd guess that if you took the north/south cragbeast camp, and xp'd there, you'll get a named pop about once every hour on average, and get a non-jelki rune about once every 2 - 3 named.  Jelki is still the most common run I think, but it's hard to tell.  They may have actually increased the drop rate of the other runes enough that its a 33%/33%/33% chance roughly that any one rune will drop off a named (with chance for 2 runes to drop off a single named).<br />
<br />
Long story short, go back and farm KT for xp and named, because the drop rate of runes is fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Jeis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Well newly equiped with my Shiny Cat Head on a stick, (looking more like a tasty lolipop every time i look at it), i went to fear last nite with couple grps guildies. Well fun is all i could say as we tried to pull everything in the zone at once, we had ppl kiting 20mobs while we tried to pick em off and stupid Berserker mob spawned too. So their i am running around kiting mobs and enraged imp thinking if i get low on hp and no time to get a heal off i'll pop me clicky.....so pop clicky hoping for nice new effect and smack me down with a kipper it says this effect does not work in this plane....<br />
<br />
How lame clicky effect doesn't work in PoFear</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">The nice thing about the Epic clicky is the fact that when you alternate using it with Ancestral Aid, you can keep a group HoT up almost full time. <br />
<br />
As for KT, I got my Balance of Nihil rune off a mob that dropped BOTH runes in one kill. Worked out very well, since one peson in group didnt have any spells, and I was the only other person that didnt have Yek yet. So we each got one. I have seen the double-rune drop quite a bit. Most of the nameds seem to drop Jekl as their common, and I have never seen one drop ONLY Yekl and not Jekl as well (not sure if I spells those right, heh).<br />
<br />
I hav heard the heal rune can drop in KT, but have never seen it. There is a guide on one of the other threads here, showing its more common drop locations though. Ferubi and sewers I think. However, I just got the OoW heal last night, and I have seen the future. With that heal, and Spiritual Serenity, and AA HoT, I can kept a tank up vs a named in PG. Was the Blind Hunter too, named Kyv, and we all know how nasty they are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Hey also add to the healing per tic the Ward aa thingy... Anyone know how high that goes? <br />
<br />
And the 60 Hp a tick regen spell. And heck while talking about it The regen leadership aa and Shaman are pretty much kinda sick at Group health regen. Toss a HoT on em as well and we are doing okay. <br />
<br />
I guess. <br />
<br />
Still pissed about Slow mitigation with every monster. It was fun without it damnit. Maybe since it is such a fast change they could code something in to make the Mitagation flag random? Then having a shaman for some fights would be a full on choice again. <br />
<br />
Dunno. Gonna have to think about gettting the epic though. I guess. Grr<br />

The reason why it works for SoW boots is because our class can cast SoW. If you have a right click item with a spell that your class can cast, you'll get the added effect from focus items.</div></div><hr />

You can hardly claim YOU deserve the spell more than any other person in the group. The just &quot;another dot&quot; is a nice boost to necro dps and you can hardly tell a cleric to skip the heal spell &quot;becouse he can get a better in oow&quot;.

Actually I can claim I deserve the spell more than anyone else in group as much as I want.  I can also claim I have a 12 inch pecker, whats your point?  If you are trying to say that no case can be made that it might be wiser to allow a shaman to loot this stone before some other classes, I think you are wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>vincenzovs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Actually there is method to my madness.<br />
<br />
I am not making some &quot;oh that is such a shaman item&quot; post like the ones you see on allakhazam. <br />
<br />
The point I (and others) are making is:<br />
<br />
a) every other class has an upgraded version of the Yiktu spell in OOW (while we don't) AFAI can guess/know.<br />
<br />
b) Slow is one of the &quot;major game balancing/unbalancing tools&quot; (depending on how you look at it) in the game. Sony know that Shamans will get this spell. so they balanced the GoD mobs against it. However, by making it ultra-rare they also unbalanced the mobs against us, if you get my point.<br />
<br />
That's what I am saying.<br />
<br />
I didn't give the necro a hard time, he won the roll, he looted the item, and yes he will do his dps function better as a result.  But I believe I have a point here, slow is the most important tool in our toolkit. If we can't effectively slow compared to other shamans, who will want us in their group?<br />
<br />
Do you think ubers would look down on a necro/wiz for missing a single spell? Perhaps a little, but not as much as they do on us lowbie (level 68 with 250 AAs) shamans without Balance....</div></div><hr />

You have to be flagged to get into KT, though you can be 85'd in.  To get the flag, you must complete the Vxed and Tipt 1-group trials, and either do all 4 1-group Sewers trials or kill Smith Rondo (raid event).<br />

Currently I've got Vxed and Rondo.  Still haven't managed to complete Tipt. :(</div></div><hr />

Flagging &amp; piggy already mentioned....  The best guide that I was able to find was from an article at RPG Expert (http://www.rpgexpert.com/).  I can't access that webpage from work but if you use the search funtion you will find it.  :cool: <br />
