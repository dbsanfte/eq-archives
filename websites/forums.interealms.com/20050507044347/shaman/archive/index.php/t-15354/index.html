<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Caelum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have gotten my Barb Shaman up to 44 (Stoicism rocks!)  and am considering a change over to Ogre, reading about people raving about the unstunnable from the front deal.<br />
<br />
However I read in some places the Exp penatly for Ogres is 10%, while in others it is 15%.<br />
<br />
Anyone have a definitive answer to this?<br />
<br />
I might roll an Ogre replacement if its only 10%, not much difference over a Barbarian's 5% really.  But to me 15% is just a bit steep.<br />
<br />
I know not being stunned is nice and all, but it seems the vast majority of my interruptions come from just getting beat upon period, not being stunned in general.<br />
<br />
This is another reason I am a bit reluctant to take the Ogre plunge.  I would love to play either race really, I flipped a coin to decide at first actually.<br />
<br />
But now I am considering the other side of the coin before putting too much more work into the Barb.<br />
<br />
It doesn't seem the unstunnable is THAT big a difference, but I could be wrong in the high end game and PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Foggy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It is 15%<br />
<br />
Personally I would trade my Troll in for an Ogre at 65, but until Torpor the regen of a Troll makes life and leveling so much easier it is worth the added 5% xp penalty over an ogre.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">your fine as a barbarian, trust me. Dont let race topics about this and that fool you, we are all the same once we get higher level and your about reaching those levels where it all blurs together. The only thing your really gaining is more of a EXP bonus and a wast of time to re-level a new toon and remember, there is no KEI anyore, so itll probably be slow then it was your first time.<br />
<br />
As far as unstunable, i was doing just fine holding offtanks indefinetly in Vex Thall on sunday, i think a 3 second Quiescence was a lil more important then ogre unstunabilty. Besides, the highe royu get int he game and the better gear you have and the higher your skills, the less you will get interupted</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">/agree Litgruv.  If I was starting over today maybe I'd be ogre (or troll), but there's no way it's worth relevelling the first 44 levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bilgoba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I wouldn't relevel a character.  Ogres &gt; * but it's not god mode.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I play an Ogre.  I agree that it's probably a bit of a better choice than a Barb, but honestly unless you're going to have someone else follow you around to level you back to 44 within a week, it's not worth the extra work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">just a side note..<br />
<br />
<br />
My barb sexiness &gt; all classes so that alone is worth not frontal stun immunity.<br />
<br />
Just thought id add that</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Polar bear form means that (especially in dungeons), if someone annoys you, you can simply bury your blinding white ass on their head and cause their monitor to glare pure white.  This is worth everything to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gagner67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">First, if you have made it to level 44 don't worry about changing race.  Unless your a power gamer an strive for the best at all time for all reasons.  Its not worth it to take the time.<br />
<br />
On the subject that Ogre in the upper game is the best race, I strongly disagree.  Personally, I find a troll to be best.  If you like Stoicism why wouldn't you like the recovery life of Stoicism plus Troll natural regen.<br />
<br />
If your worried about getting a heal off while being beaten on by a Teir 4 mob its not worth the worry.  <br />
<br />
Majority of the time a tier 4 mob who is aggroed on you due to a resisted slow or has just mitgated slow and is pissed will pump out enough damage to kill you unless the cleric is watchin very well.<br />
<br />
Personally, I would like as much regen as possible plus what Quiescence provides me to aid in exp groups or soloing.  In times of Canni I like my added natural regen that makes a difference when limitted on casting time.  <br />
<br />
Plus while soloing regular exp mobs I definately see the difference with nearly a 91 hp regen (without the use of potions) and standing.<br />
<br />
Granted 91 hp regen while standing is not all from troll natural regen but in my characters goal (which is 94 hp regen a tick) every point makes a difference.<br />
<br />
I would hate to think to whether I would need to use at least one Quiescence for just tank\casting on something like a blue LOY mob. <br />
<br />
I really enjoy the Hole zone now where blue mobs when found are hitting me there for at most 145.  It is relaxing to just know I could melee them.<br />
<br />
Your choice.  I guess.  But to me I would never trade a 65 troll shaman for a 65 Ogre as one of the above posters stated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The penalty is 10%.<br />
<br />
Barbs get a 5% penalty, trolls and iksars a 20% penalty, and halflings a 5% bonus.  There are also class bonuses of 10% for warriors and 5% for rogues (class penalties were taken out a long time ago).<br />
<br />
Remember, however, that experience progression uses an exponential curve.  Because of this, for example, it takes about 10 TIMES as much exp to get thru level 62 as it does level 52.<br />
<br />
This means that an iksar/troll with the same number of experience points will, in the high-end game, be only 1 or at most 2 levels behind a halfling warrior with the same number of experience points.<br />
<br />
Thus: go with whatever race you want to play (and ogres are an excellent choice, since they don't get stunned from the front).<br />
<br />
In the long run, your choice of race will make no difference, and in the short run, all it will mean is that you will be maybe a level (at most) behind your equal-exp contemporaries.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Krenk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I rerolled as the exact same, Troll. I love leveling, but hate guilds and dislike grouping. So the higher I get the worse the game is for me personally. The 30s to mid 50s level range is the best area of the game for me.<br />
<br />
Besides I don't like barbs. There's only 1500 barbs campared to the 20 trolls and 5 ogres on each server. People get tricked by the Wis is all or think that faction is a big deal, when it's not.<br />
<br />
This game has gotten so easy it's almost a joke to level any more. The gear these days for the low range is insane. I never used the KEI crutch, so that do not miss. It made people develope very stupid playing habits, and most of the players these days are really terrible at their respective roles.<br />
<br />
My first Troll Shaman came up on leathers and banded until the high 30s. There was almost nothing else to wear. You've all got it so easy, and most of you don't even realize this.<br />
<br />
Sometimes I wish for Ogre, but I really don't like the high end game simply because of the way it is structured to necessitate raid style playing. And the snare necklace really does help me solo dungeons better, but then I know how to use it, and have seen other people that don't. So some people are best off not trying that route.<br />
<br />
Ogre is only good for doing groups where you get at least 2 mobs per person. Shaman will always get enough aggro in that situation where the frontal stun immunity shines. Otherwise it is just a small perk that one can in fact live without.<br />
<br />
It boils down to personal taste, and I am evil at heart. Barbs stink, cats have fleas, and frogs are food.<br />
<br />
Who knows, maybe when I bored of this one around level 60ish, I'll reroll a new Ogre SHM.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ya all the races blend together at that high of a level, but the unstunability puts ogres ahead IMO. the troll regen is only a few points more than others, so you could just buy an item with some regen, just like a troll could buy items to make up for his lesser stats.<br />
<br />
it really is all the same depending on your gear so no need to fret about anything. besides, the exp penalty is nothing with exp in this day and age.</div></div><hr />

Don't sweat an exp penalty, and if you are all fired up to hit 65 then 2-box or whatever.  Just relish in the joy that you were not a Troll SK years ago. :p</div></div><hr />

worth re-rolling at this level though?  Not to me, but i really like being a barb so /shrug.<br />
<br />
With a barb i feel like a indian shaman or something, a plainsmen. It fits the bill for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Caelum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Thank you all for the replies, but my question still seems unanswered.<br />

I got one person saying 15% Exp penalty, and the other 10%!  Arg!<br />

Hehe but if it doesnt matter, guess I'll make the switch anyways.  You are right, the server is stuffed with Barbies.  I have seen like one Ogre Shaman since I started.<br />
<br />
Only problem is, no more Barbarian Spiritualist Hammer...*snuffles*.  Best 2k I ever spent at the Bazaar.</div></div><hr />

it's 15% for ogre and i wouldn't say it's worth it to reroll.<br />
<br />
just do whatever</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Bordans</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Ogre is 15%, troll and iksar is 25%<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Trena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I'll have to dig up the article on the ShowEQ forums but last time they published the details on xp penalties, detailing which races had which penalty, it was Barb 5% (to pay for Slam), Ogre 15% (to pay for stun immunity), troll/Iksar 20% (for regen). That was one reason I made Trena a Barb (5% racial penalty + 5% class bonus = break even). Well, that plus the fact that Barbs are so damn segzy and Ogres, Trolls, and Iksar....well....ain't.  :p<br />
<br />
Personally, I wouldn't reroll just to change race. Sometimes, I wish Trena was a noam. Then I drink a potion, then I get over it :p</div></div><hr />

Penalty is 15% =] IF you have the patience, and are worried about regretting it later.. reroll the ogre.. if you don't really care TOO much, stick with the barb :)<br />
<br />
The just of it is that in the high end game, depends on what you mean by high.. if the mob is hitting you 1100 a swing 6 swings a tic, he's gonna kill you stunned or unstunned, 50 hps/tic regen extra or not.. <br />
<br />
The ogre unstunnable IMO shines when you go to CT to solo and want to take it in the face w/o any worries (I guess bot giants too).. just like the troll snare comes in when you go to CT or dunno EMP in seb and want to snare gaters or not root so you can smash them from behind.<br />

<br />
The biggest misconception in this community is that &quot;unstunnable from the front&quot; is the important part of this ability...the -only- factor involved(that is a benefit to you, a shaman) is that you get a slight chance of channeling through a bash..nothing more.<br />
<br />
Ogre -Tanks- are the only classes that get any real benefit from it.....its this ability that enables them an advantage of keeping taunt/hate up on a mob...i.e. not missing a round due to stun.<br />
<br />
I've said this many times...in 4 years of soloing EQ...Ive -never- died due to a stun...stuns themselves are fairly rare imho, or at least rare enough to say that Ogres are not the &quot;uber&quot; race of shamans because of this ability.<br />
<br />
Chose what you think is coolest though...just dont let the -hype- steer ya wrong :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>pwredby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I don't know about ogre shaman vs. barb. vs troll.<br />
<br />
But my ogre Bst vs gnome Cleric, Ogre Bst is lvl 24, and Gnome cleric is lvl 25 and 1 yellow. So 10-15percent seems right.</div></div><hr />

Great point. If the hype were all its cracked up to be, you'd see a huge % of players choosing a certain race/class combo. Kind of like Iksar Monks before the nerf last year.</div></div><hr />
