<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Let's say SOE did every single item on this list.  Would we be overpowered?  Would our end-game issues be fixed?  I figured producing a list of specific fixes might be helpful if a developer wanted to work on shaman issues but didn't have time to work on the details.  In some cases, other aspects of the spells (mana cost) might need to be adjusted in addition to what I've specified to keep things balanced.<br />

I suspect that all of these things might very well make us overpowered, but honestly think we could get A LOT of the things on this list and still not be crazy good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grumpf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>jeyche Deychundei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">looking at it the only thing that may makes us over powered would be the nukes.... and maybe the dot stuff needs toning down (tho i want all those suggestions for dots done!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Dunno what your smoking, but man you need to stop hogging the bowl.<br />
In all seriousness however, you do have a few good ideas, some way over the top and others that are not even in line. Tone it down a little, we dont want to even make it look like we want to be the uberclassd00dsp33kl3tzskilz class, we just want to be balanced in line with current content and current class standings. 70ish% of what you have written above is just too much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I smell troll.<br />
<br />
Those numbers are so far over the top, nothing positive can come from posting them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Picking just one out of each of the groups, and I think it would make a nice spell set for the next expansion<br />
<br />
*Improved Daluda's Mending from 1550 hp healed to 1800 hp healed<br />
* Reduced recast time Malos, from 10.0 to 3.0<br />
* Improved  Spirit Quickening  +50ac, +500hp, +100atk, +70% haste, 1 hour<br />
* Reduced  casting time  Velium strike  6.0<br />
* Pet with innate dual wield</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Those sound fair to me Shamu.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I smell troll.<br />
<br />
Those numbers are so far over the top, nothing positive can come from posting them.<br />
<br />
He isnt a troll, has over 200 posts and is a shaman. Though all of those numbers together do make it seem like we are asking for way too much if a couple of them were implemented for next expansion it would be nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think that the following set would be good without being too far out:<br />
<br />
Healing/Curing<br />
<br />
* Increase Tnarg's Mending from 1300 hp healed to 1500 hp healed<br />
* Increase Daluda's Mending from 1550 hp healed to 1800 hp healed<br />
<br />
Debuffs<br />
<br />
* Reduce casting time of Malos from 5.0 to 3.0<br />
* Reduce recast time of Malos from 10.0 to 3.0<br />
<br />
Buffs<br />
<br />
* Increase the haste on Talisman of Alacrity to 60% to match SLTW<br />
* Change Spirit Quickening to Focus, SLTW, Diaku, Avatar, Dual Wield, and 60% haste -- 1 hour-- this adds convenience rather than power.<br />
*  Increase Avatar to 20 minutes with 10 sec recast. Would take about 2 minutes to rebuff a group every 20-30 minutes. It would be impractical to buff an entire raid. It would not last for an adventure without a Shaman in tow. <br />
<br />
Damage<br />
<br />
* Reduce the agro on ALL DoTs by 50% (All DoT casters need this--also fix spell casting subtlety to reduce aggro on DoTs)<br />
* Add -100 resist adjust to shaman poison DoTs (especially important for PvP)<br />
* Reduce the casting time on Velium strike to 6.0<br />
* Add -50 resist adjust to Tears of Saryrn and Torrent of Poison<br />
<br />
Convenience<br />
<br />
* Pets should have innate Spirit of Wolf when cast<br />
* Pets should have innate dual wield<br />
* Shrink spells should work outside group (and have confirm box)<br />
* Make stackable invisibility potions that do not require a rare forage from Guk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Improvements over existing spells would be nice, but to change all of those would take the devs about 4-5 years, according to how long it took them to recently change our HoT.<br />
So, I will keep mine to just a few.<br />
<br />
Talisman of Alacrity = NEEDS to be turned into a 60% haste.<br />
<br />
Bane = Turn this back into it once was, when it was in Beta.  This spell gets resisted, even when my Malosinia, Cripple, and root lands on the mob (Not to mention the recovery time).  HEY, this spell isnt even all that, to where these type of restrictions were needed to be put on it.<br />
<br />
Ferine Avatar = The &quot;all powerfull&quot; spell which only really adds 140 attack, isnt really &quot;all powerfull&quot; anymore.  At least not past Elemental status.  Instead of adding 140 to useless stat buffs, why not apply the additional spell bonus to something more usefull, like perhaps AC, or increased attack speed (past cap).<br />
<br />
Thats about it. These 3 alone would probably take about 2 years to be worked on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zodiax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Whats wrong with wishing? I like this thread. Hes at least thinking of ideas. Its not like hes demanding these all get implemented.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tickmunki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I believe that as long as we get some form of Group HoT spell, and a Spell haste AA. Thats all would wish for, after all its a wish list not a for reall deal. <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Its just my idea, not fact&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>lightus_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Talk about making shamans overpowered :)<br />
<br />
well if thats you dream, hold tight it might even happen......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Let's say SOE did every single item on this list.  Would we be overpowered?  Would our end-game issues be fixed?  I figured producing a list of specific fixes might be helpful if a developer wanted to work on shaman issues but didn't have time to work on the details.  In some cases, other aspects of the spells (mana cost) might need to be adjusted in addition to what I've specified to keep things balanced.<br />
Ok then, lets take a look and see how badly it would overpower us.<br />
<br />
Healing/Curing<br />
* Make Healing Gift and Healing adept affect Heal over Time spells<br />
* Increase Tnarg's Mending from 1300 hp healed to 1500 hp healed<br />
* Increase Daluda's Mending from 1550 hp healed to 1800 hp healed<br />
* Increase Breath of Trushar from 420 hp/tick to 650 hp/tick healed<br />
* Upgraded version of Blood of Nadox which also removes curse counters<br />
This combined still leaves shaman at lower then druid healing in GoD and probably a tiny bit over druid healing in long fights. No worries here.<br />
<br />
Debuffs<br />
* Reduce casting time of Malos from 5.0 to 3.0<br />
* Reduce recast time of Malos from 10.0 to 3.0<br />
* Change resist adj. on Balance of the Nihil from -40 to -70<br />
* Change resist debuff on Malicious Decay from -52 to -70<br />
This would make us a tiny bit better in GoD and LDoN and change next to nothing in PoP and earlier.<br />
<br />
* New version of cripple that operates on raw melee skills<br />
This one would depend a lot on the exact effects and magnitude so I cannot say anything about it.<br />
<br />
* New debuff/curse to increase spell recast times<br />
* New debuff/curse to increase spell resists<br />
If it works on NPC-only spells (like boss AEs) this would be a worthwhile ability. If it only works on PC-castable spells it would be useless.<br />
<br />
* New debuff/curse to increase spell fizzles &amp; fizzle times<br />
Useless until SoE actually makes NPC wizards nuke decently, NPC clerics heal decently and so on.<br />
<br />
Buffs<br />
* Upgrade to Spirit of Bih'Li (+65% movement, +50 atk, 1 hour duration)<br />
Nice. This one would be a spell that people want.<br />
<br />
* Increase duration of Ferine Avatar to 15 min, reduce recast to 30 sec<br />
* Increase the haste on Talisman of Alacrity to 60% to match SLTW<br />
* Increase the duration of Talisman of the Tribunal to 2 hours 30 minutes<br />
* Increase duration of Focus of the Seventh to 2 hours 30 minutes<br />
Purely a convinience upgrade.<br />
<br />
* Replace +Stat on Focus of the Seventh with raw +ATK and +PROC_RATE<br />
* Replace +AGI buffs with some kind of +MITIGATION buffs<br />
* Replace +DEX buffs with some kind of +PROC_RATE buffs<br />
* Replace +STR buffs with some sort of +ATK or +DAMAGE buffs<br />
If these would just give half the effect the melee stats used to give before people reached the cap I would be happy.<br />
<br />
* Change Blessing of Replenishment from +25hp/tick to +100hp/tick<br />
This would be nice for both us and druids. Still not great in GoD when you are nonstop killing 900 hitters but at least now you do not have to wait 20 minutes for the odd riposte damage to fill up.<br />
<br />
* Change Ancestral Guard to be +100 AC<br />
Not that I would mind this spell but why? This has never been something shaman were good at. It would be a decent spell though.<br />
<br />
* Add a vastly upgraded version of Voice of the Berserker<br />
* Replace +STA_REGEN on Acumen &amp; Acumen of Dar Khura with +ENDUR_REGEN<br />
* Change Spirit Quickening to +50ac, +500hp, +100atk, +70% haste, 1 hour<br />
A couple of low impact spells here. Yes the pet buff is nice but giving our dog an extra 10% or 20% damage will barely be parseable.<br />
<br />
Damage<br />
* Reduce the agro on Poison DoTs by 50%<br />
* Increase Damage/Tick on all DoTs by 100%<br />
* Reduce the number of Ticks on all DoTs by 40%<br />
So net aggro will be the same? Well, I guess it would be nice for soloing or for the few raids where you can DoT multiple offtanked MOBs.<br />
<br />
* Reduce the recast time on Bane to 3.5 sec<br />
* Add -30 resist adjust to shaman magic DoTs<br />
* Add -50 resist adjust to shaman poison DoTs<br />
* Add -100 resist adjust to shaman disease DoTs<br />
Puts us below necromancer and druid levels in DoT resist adjustments but nice nonetheless.<br />
<br />
* Reduce the casting time on Velium strike to 6.0<br />
* Reduce the casting time on shock of poison to 3.0<br />
* Add -50 resist adjust to Tears of Saryrn and Torrent of Poison<br />
A minor nuke upgrade. The -50 resist adjustment especially will do next to nothing thanks to the hardcoded resists.<br />
<br />
Convenience<br />
* Make a new Canni AA:  +500 mana, -850 hp, 20 second reuse<br />
This actually looks like the biggest power boost so far. More time for other spells is good.<br />
<br />
* Pets should have innate Spirit of Wolf when cast<br />
* Pets should have Focus of Soul already cast on them when summoned<br />
* Pets should have innate dual wield<br />
* Shrink spells should work outside group (and have confirm box)<br />
Does not change class balance at all obviously.<br />
<br />
I suspect that all of these things might very well make us overpowered, but honestly think we could get A LOT of the things on this list and still not be crazy good.<br />
Give us all of these things on the list and I still feel shaman would be underpowered in GoD. Give a specialist class like the wizard a 5% increase to his speciality and the class will be about 4.5% more powerful.<br />
<br />
Give a generalist like the shaman a 2% increase to half of his abilities right after designing an entire expansion to taker away half of his power and you will end up at 51% instead of 50%.<br />
<br />
In this game ten tiny upgrades to different areas do not make up for one big upgrade in a single area. This entire list is less of a power increase for shaman then the druid CH was for them. That does not mean there are not some nice ideas in that list. But it certainly is not a huge proposed upgrade to shaman class just because the list happens to be long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Fibonacci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I agree with the original post except for a few points. Mostly some of the changes should scale up to X rather than just a static change to X.<br />
<br />
Healing<br />
* Make Healing Gift and Healing adept affect Heal over Time spells<br />
* Upgrade to Tnarg's Mending for 2800 hp healed<br />
I don't care about adding remove curse to blood of nadox line .. have radiant cure for that.  <br />
<br />
Buffs<br />
<br />
* Upgrade to Spirit of Bih'Li scales up to (+65% movement, +50 atk) 1 hour duration. <br />
* Change Spirit Quickening to scale up to+50ac, +500hp, +100atk, +70% haste. 1 hour<br />
* Change Avatar line of spells<br />
  + Primal Essesence - change drop and/or research to make it obtainable at a more appropriate level.<br />
  + Change Avatar to 15 min duration, 30 second recast<br />
  + Change Primal Avatar to add +10% attack, 15 min duration, 30 second recast<br />
  + Change Ancient Primal Avatar to PA plus 20% over haste.<br />
  + Change Ferin Avatar to group Primal Avatar<br />
I would leave the stat buffs as is and add spells for +proc_rate et al to the Omens of Warcraft spell set.<br />
<br />
 <br />
Damage<br />
<br />
* Add -100 resist adjust to shaman poison DoTs<br />
* Add -50 resist adjust to shaman disease DoTs<br />
I swapped these two from the original list.  Posion is more the shaman realm while diseaes is the necro's forte.<br />
I'm not sure why we should expect to get a resist mod on magic based dot's.  It's really an after thought, not a shaman specialty.<br />
<br />
Convenience<br />
<br />
* Pets should have innate Spirit of Wolf when cast -- Duh!<br />
* Pets should have innate dual wield<br />
OK,they were in the original list but they are ignorant oversights that later became &quot;working as intended.&quot;  These are not upgrades or balance points.  Thses are bugs that are long overdue for repair.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Nope, I wasn't trolling.  As the analysis by Murtak indicated, I honestly feel like most of these are simply addressing specific problems people have brought up with specific proposed changes to spells that might fix them.  <br />
<br />
For all of those who think the sum total of these changes would be overpowering, please post a scenario using some combination of these changes which shows how we would all of a sudden become godlike.  That's actually the reason why I posted this.  I'm hoping we can catch scenarios like that and I can adjust my suggestions so we're fixed, not turned into god mode.<br />
<br />
To answer a few of the questions posted:<br />
<br />
Specific changes for &quot;new version of cripple&quot;:<br />
<br />
 -10% ATK<br />
 -10% AC<br />
 -10% damage<br />
<br />
So, a 1500 AC, 1500 ATK, 1000 hitting mob would become 1350 AC, 1350 ATK, 900 hitter.  Basically, let's have cripple make the mob 10% easier to hit and reduce its damage output by up to 20%.  If that tests out to be too much, easy enough to reduce the numbers.  <br />
<br />
The spell casting curses were intended to work on any NPC cast spell.  But I think they'd be nice for PVP even if they worked only on PC spells (might need a resist adjustment built in for that). <br />
<br />
I upped the AC dramatically on Ancestral Guard because I thought there should be a reason to consider casting it.  I can't remember the last time I cast it.  If +100 isn't enough to get people to choose it sometimes over other buffs with which it does not stack, make it even higher.  We get these &quot;ac buffs&quot; every release it seems like.  And we have an entire line of them.  So it seems like they are intended to be a &quot;shaman thing&quot; but are never good enough due to stacking issues with better spells, so don't get much use.<br />
<br />
I intended for the 50% resist adjustment on DoTs to be the net result.  I don't really know how agro works on dots, so couldn't really get specific on hot to achieve it.  But the idea behind doubling the damage per tick and reducing the number of ticks was to have a slight increase in mana efficiency and a significant increase in usefullness in groups.  Bane would be 3 ticks.  Blood would be 4 ticks.  Keeping both of these up for the bulk of a fight is pretty decent dps.<br />
<br />
I think the -50 resist on rain spells would be noticeable.  It feels to me like winters storm (druid rain) resists a lot less than Tears.  I 2-box a shaman and a druid quite often.  I think we actually could use rains without being forced to malo first if we had the resist adjustment.<br />
<br />
I only reduced our nuke casting times a bit.  Not sure why people feel this specific change would be overpowering.</div></div><hr />
