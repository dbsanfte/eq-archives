<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mishlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys,<br />
<br />
Just thought I'd drop a note to say hey and to ask for a bit of advice from the KOE druids. My play time is WAY reduced now adays so that I only have maybe 30 min every now and again to get on. <br />
<br />
This being the case I've started messing around with a druid gimp that I had so I can kite a beast or two, pretending they are my boss or cow-orkers.<br />
<br />
Any advice on equipment for the druid? I have all the jewelery that I need, so it will be mainly for other parts? Also where are some good outdoor, non-SOL areas to kite in?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any advice!!<br />
<br />

<br />
Blaydde</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>mishlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Right now the druid just hit level 21 and besides jewelry she's wearing cloth. I do have a nice 1hs so weapons are ok for now. Coming from a chanter background I have not gone tank with my druid:) <br />
I've been kiting in OT atm and am doing REALLY well thumping on whites</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Amarin Crystalthorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">OT is a good choice for kiting, as would be LOIO, Stonebrunt or SK.  In LOIO, for example, you can pull tigers to the shore and fear kite em.  Also, you may have some luck in Everfrost with the mammoths there.  I am less sure about the new Luclin zones.<br />
<br />
You might look at all of the following armor upgrades:<br />
<br />
Gator Legs<br />
Tizmak arms<br />
Mammoth or Molten or Kunzar cloak<br />
Treeweave for AC or Shroud of Nature/Runed mithril tunic for Wis<br />
GEBs (of course - *smiles*)<br />
Chrysoberyl Talisman or Blackened Alloy Medallion<br />
Runed Circlet<br />
Braided Ivy Cords<br />
<br />
All of the above will increase your wis and AC and, while not being too expensive or uber, should las you until yer 40 or so.<br />
<br />
Blaydde</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Also, I would look for a Chard Guardian Shield (10 AC, 9 wiz) and some Runed Mitheral Bracers are a nice addition with str and wiz. <br />
<br />
At your level, I would go heavy on mana jewelry items as they offer better bang for the buck than straight wiz items. Probably 30 is about the break even point. Case in point, I would go with the black sapphire earrings at 25 hp, 35 mana rather than the 3 wiz earrings. If your druid gets up high enough, you are going to want those mana items anyway. If you like to melee quite a bit and even if not, I think the 5 ac, 30 hp, 30 mana rings are a better option than the straight wiz rings at this point. Change those four out and you have a whopping 110 hp increase to your hps and at your level, that is rather significant. You still have 130 mana between the 4 items. <br />
<br />
Gloves would be split paw I believe. Not much wiz on gloves out there for awhile, but you can get them pretty cheap and they have other worthwhile stats. Arms just suck for a druid for the most part and that won't change. Hollow Bone Bracers are good with 15 mana, 7 ac and 7 MR or Azure sleeves are a good addition to your AC at no stats and 12 ac. Tizmak are excellent.<br />
<br />
Gebs are an excellent choice, but if they are a bit expenisve for your tastes, Dwarven Work Boots are not too hard to get.<br />
<br />
I think you want to melee a bit.. (or at least get hit). You want your defense to go up. At higher levels, there is a difference for those who kited/stayed clean and have a low defence and for those who did not. Granted, mobs hit much harder at higher levels and if one gets on you, you have problems, but extra defense often makes the difference between looking for a rez or getting that last second heal in to make it through. It will also make a difference when you solo later on.. there will be times you would have died had you not worked on your defense, so it is always worth it..<br />
<br />
Goodluck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Amarin Crystalthorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">All good choices Klydon.<br />
<br />
I could not agree more about defense.  Kiting now exclusively = many deaths later.  Amarin eventually maxed his defense by pulling hunters/foragers in TT during many months of rare hunting there.  I recommend that for any druids that are still defensively challenged post-50.   Nice loot too, and I know their spawn points like the back of my hand now, LOL.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hammerstalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Mishlan...<br />
<br />
I have a lot of the items Klydon has mentioned. They are currently cluttering up my bank. Shoot me a tell in game so I can hook you up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Aaeamdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Mana or Wisdom?<br />
<br />
The formula for total mana is:<br />
<br />
(Level * 2) + (Wis up to 200 / 5 * Level) + (Wis over 200 / 10 * Level)<br />
<br />
Since your wisdom is less than 200 and since items don't affect your level, the only thing to consider when making a comparison is<br />
Wis/5*Level.  At your level, you get 4.2 mana per wisdom.<br />
<br />
Some comparisons of common items:<br />
<br />
RMB v. Jaded Electrum Braclet<br />
<br />
5*4.2 = 21 v. 20 - RMB better at this level and get better as you level<br />
<br />
3 Wis earring v. 25/35 earing<br />
<br />
13 v. 35.  25/35 better now, will be better until 60 (where they will still be better, since you will be over 200 wis at that time).<br />
<br />
Neck peice is never close.<br />
3 wisdom v. 65 mana.  <br />
<br />
7 Wisdom Rings v. 5AC/30 mana/30 HP<br />
29 v. 30 - Mana rings better now, but obviously start getting worse as of next level.<br />
<br />
Since Mishlan can make all of the jewelry, I would start there.  I think it is good advice generally, but especially if you are going to kite, just maximize your mana at the expense of all other stats.<br />
<br />
One thing, somewhat outside your question, until you can quad, kiting is not really your most efficient means of advancement.  At level 20 and in outdoor zones, porqupining is much much faster.  Go heavy AC/HP gear, put up all your regen and thorns and use you mana to heal yourself.  Of corse you will want the mob snared, so you can run away to heal if you get in trouble, but that really is, even against whites, yellows and reds, a more efficient soloing technique at this level.  Tree form increases your regen as well.  This will work reasonable well, with proper mob selection (ones that don't hit hard) and/or adequate AC twinkage through your mid-thirties, then at 34 you get lightening strike and you can start quading.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>mishlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Woot you guys rock,<br />
<br />
I'll give you a tell in game hammer and we can work out a price for what you have!!<br />
<br />
Here is a list of the jewelery I'm currently wearing. If anyone has any suggestions on improvement let me know but Kly and I seem to have similar mindsets on this<br />
<br />
Fingers:<br />
Jade Vel rings<br />
30Mana/30HP/5AC each<br />
<br />
Face:<br />
Ruby Vel Vail<br />
8 Str/8 Wis<br />
<br />
Ear:<br />
gold Black Sapphire earring<br />
25HP/35 Mana<br />
gold jasper earring<br />
+3 wis<br />
<br />
Neck:<br />
Black Sapphire vel necklas<br />
65 HP /65 Mana<br />
<br />
Wrist<br />
Jade Golden bracelets<br />
15Mana/15HP/2AC each<br />
<br />
I have been working on defence a bit as well. At the lower levels the only real DOT I have besides flame lick is stinging swarm and does not seem to have much of a punch. So it seemed more mana effecent to DS myself and let the buggers kill themselves on it.<br />
<br />
If anyone has any more suggestions for either equipment or hunting area's I do appriciate it greatly.<br />
