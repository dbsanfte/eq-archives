<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>phatmatt63</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Umm... the title is pretty self-explanatory(?) but the guides are down and I know what to get just not where to get it or who to get it from.  I just started playing a couple weeks ago and am lvl 17. Also wondering about equipment.  Im using a velium short blade and stormfeather talons. Im in full trueshot mail cept for dusty soriz boots. Any suggestions?<br />
<br />
P.S. Im scared to leave Gfay because of horrible experiances in West Karanas and getting lost in Qeynos.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aethien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This is a passable guide, at Allakhazam:<br />
<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=178<br />
<br />
Sorry, but you're going to have to leave GFay if you want a Trueshot!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Amise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There's a really great Trueshot walkthrough at this (http://www.angelflame.com/ranger.html) website.  <br />
<br />
This is a great quest for getting out and exploring parts of Norrath.  If you're worried about getting lost on your journey, visit EQ Atlas (www.eqatlas.com) before you start  -  you'll be able to find maps there for all the zones you need to visit for the quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lauralei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just some helpful hints for when you head to Steamfont Mountains for the micro servos...<br />
<br />
In Lesser Faydark on your way to Steamfont stick to the wall on your left.  Don't go wandering around or you will be brownie fodder.  It's no fun trying to find your corpse in there.<br />
<br />
Watch out for the Kobold Missionary in Steamfont.  He spawns in the area around the giant cog in the ground.  A safe bet is to stick to the area closer to the windmills before the mino caves (you will see what I am talking about once you get there).  <br />
<br />
This is a great quest for the young ranger, and it is quite satisfying once you finish it.  Best of luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Oneiros</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Is that silly missionary still spawning?  I need to go give him some payback...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lauralei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yep...girlfriend took some revenge on him just yesterday with her ranger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>phatmatt63</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have been told that it is not worth the time to do the quest and I should just buy it 4 200pp. I almost have enough money but I'm not sure if it would be worth it. Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>mjfruits</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Not worth the time to do the quest? Dude, it's a 20dmg 45dly 100rng bow that you can get for practically nothing. Well, maybe not nothing as you will need to raise your Fletching skill to around 100 to have a pretty decent chance of a successfull combine on it. IMHO, no self respecting Ranger would ever buy a Trueshot Longbow. He/she would craft it themsleves. But I guess if you don't want to take the time to run around collecting the parts needed and making stacks and stacks of arrows to riase your Fletching skill, go blow 200pp on it in the Bazaar.<br />
<br />
At level 17, it's time to leave GFay. It's a big, big world out there, with lots of new and exciting things to do and see. Highpass Hold would be a great spot for you to call home for a while, and when you outgrow that a few levels later, step on in to Highhold Keep or head on over to Paludal Caverns.<br />
<br />
Another hint on collecting the micro Servos: use Tracking to track down the Clockwork spiders, but be aware that there are mobs with similar name like &quot;a rogue clockwork&quot; and &quot;a runaway clockwork.&quot; These are NOT spiders. The ones you want are called  &quot;runaway clockwork&quot; and &quot;rogue clockwork.&quot; And do watch out for the Kobold Missionary. He spawns in the little valley that the Minotaur Caves are in just past the windmills. He's a caster, so if you find yourself in a confrontation with him, DO NOT try to root and shoot him. I have removed him from my &quot;payback&quot; list many times but for some reason I just can't seem to take him off permanently. Same goes for that damned Cargo Clockwork, which by the way still conned dark blue to me at 41 so DO NOT mistakenly hit it thinking it's just another rogue clockwork like I did. If you're on Erollisi Marr server, send me a tell anytime and I'll tag along with you in your quest for parts :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kimexe Calmbow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Another clockwork spider you should NOT attack, Charlotte.<br />
She is a pet of gnome near windmill.<br />
Cargo clockowork and Charlotte should not be harmed ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>mjfruits</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well, Cargo CLockwork you can kill when you get higher in level. In fact, I leveled from 39 to 41 on the Cargo Clockwork. 8 minute respawn, too. And the great thing is, no faction hits!!! Just don't kill the Driver that pops when you kill it. That'll give you baaaad faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>phatmatt63</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I also have a question about duel wield. Which hand should I put the weapon with the lowest dly in?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>phatmatt63</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">umm does n e 1 know?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Aethien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Um, there are many discussions on this in the Equipment section. Do a search on &quot;Dual Wield&quot;, you'll come up with something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Oh and just FYI, at 100 skill, you do NOT have a good chance of making the bow. The bow trivials at 235. YOull have about a 5% chance of success. It took me about 15 attempts at 170 skill to make it, if i remember right.<br />
Usually a lot less hassle to buy one... also a lot better to buy a better bow once you get the money. Good bows with stats are common as spiderlings nowadays.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jalim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">You will find a bunch of bows in the bazaar, the main problem with doing the Trueshot quest is getting your fletching to a high enough level to actually make it, and spend enough time getting multiple parts to be able to make it below the trivial. <br />
<br />
If you have the cash and it isn't gonna break the bank, go ahead and buy it. To get to the trivial level for making it, you will spend far more. <br />
<br />
That being said, if you are one for quests and are raising your fletching skill anyway, give it a go. <br />
<br />
~Jalim~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Taldaas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">just an FYI<br />
<br />
I failed about 15 times at 102 skill and gave up.<br />
<br />
I tried the quest again at about 122 skill and i think i made it on the 6th attempt.<br />
<br />
When doing the quest you need to do it in mass.  Lanterns cost 1 silver so spend 10 pp on them (heh, jk but something like that).  Get the treant wood and wait for the boat (or port to BB, whatever).  At 120 skill get enough for 30 attempts.  Stash the stuff in the bank if you want.  When buying teh Kiola nuts jsut throw everything in bank and fill up 8 backpacks with em and then directly head over to Kaladim to make em into wires.<br />
<br />
The hardest part is getting the micro servos and the silk.  I would usually jsut save some ling silks if if could.  If not i would get enough servos for maybe 5-10 attempts at a time and then track teh lings in gfay or offer good money to newbs for em.  Then just combine and hope to tunare for a bow out of it.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Aethien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I was very lucky - Had enough for three attempts, made it on my second.... at 102 skill.  Maybe it's because they have some code or something to make it easier for Goods on Sullon. I've never seen one for sale, either, so making it was my best choice.</div></div><hr />
