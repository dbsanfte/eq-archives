<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">heals, <br />
cleric 100<br />
druid 64<br />
shaman 47<br />
<br />
slows<br />
shaman 75<br />
chanter 70<br />
bst 65 <br />
bard 50<br />
Rogue (yes its situational but I have used my rogue as the primarly slower in groups effectivly)<br />
<br />
so let me see if I have this right, Shaman, the best slowers in the game are better than the other 3 classes by a margine of about 33% 15% and 6% (rough numbers, hard to convert from a 75 base) <br />
<br />
but we heal 53% worse than the best of 3 classes<br />
<br />
do you see this? do you comprehend? the worst slower in the game is better at our primary role than we are at healing. thats our PRIMARY ROLE.<br />
<br />
Dots<br />
Necros, just flat out mean dots<br />
Shaman nice stackable dots no resist modifiers and expensive cost long cast times<br />
druids massive resist modifiers, cheap and relativly quick cast + fast running put them a very very VERY close second to shaman, in exp groups druids are actually better dotters, their best dot is both big time damage and fast run time + requires no debuffing to land. <br />
<br />
this leaves us situationally second place dotters, since we cant FD Necros win first place easy, since it generates so much agro we really cant even use dots for any kind of damage unless we plan on tanking raid lvl mobs, only good for the solo shaman. (note I am not complaining about solo shaman, we are still very strong when its time to play with ourselves) <br />
<br />
nukes, out of the 6 caster classes we are at the bottom of the barrel, clerics and chanters arent all that far above us but our nukes are laughable. eternal casting times+low damage+no resist modifiers make our nukes next to usless.<br />
<br />
buffs, I will not repost every single thread showing extensive parsing of stat buffs, its been proven since very very early in the game that stat buffs are next to usless unless given in truly massive amounts, the problem being that by the time you can get a massive stat buff you already have massive stats...so<br />
<br />
Hp buffs, <br />
Clerics<br />
Druids<br />
Shaman <br />
Bst (by a very close margine to shaman)<br />
<br />
mana regen,<br />
chanter<br />
druid<br />
bst<br />
bard (situational but damn nice while its there)<br />
<br />
atk<br />
Ranger<br />
Bst<br />
Druid ???<br />
shaman, with the agonizingly sucky spell that is FA, we can drive ourselves nuts keeping a crappy buff up on several targets. <br />
<br />
movment buffs<br />
Bard (situational but godly)<br />
druid/ranger Soe is amazing<br />
shaman with Sow...we got the first run speed spell in the game and still have no upgrade to it ***?<br />
<br />
haste<br />
chanter<br />
shaman<br />
bard<br />
bst<br />
chanter haste is a large increase over our best haste.<br />
<br />
so out of the buffs that people want we are close to last in all catagories and actually LACK one power of our sub class entirely.<br />
<br />
pets<br />
Chanter (dont argue this, chanters are ****ing GODS of the pets class's)<br />
Mage/necro <br />
bst<br />
sk<br />
shaman<br />
<br />
we are in last place of the pet classes, we have been told we are not even considered a pet class yet we get all the relevant pet class aa's, we are told we wont be getting pets that auto duel weild or have innate sow, why? just to piss us off, there is no ****ing logical reason for our pets not to have those 2 non game changing, nonoverpowering, do nothing but make our lives a tiny bit easier innate powers. so lacking a logical reason that leaves us with the impression you are not putting in those powers for the sole purpose of pissing us off.<br />
<br />
Debuffs<br />
Shaman<br />
Chanter<br />
mage<br />
bard?<br />
<br />
we are better at debuffing raid lvl mobs than chanters are by a slight margine.<br />
<br />
what else is there? Crowd control? chanters are so ungodly far in the lead in this area its not even worth mentioning.<br />
<br />
solo? whats the point, we solo well, not the top, no the bottom, who cares we still cant solo our way into the GoD trial required zones.<br />
<br />
Clerics are the clear leader in healing<br />
Necros for dots<br />
Wizzy's for nukes<br />
chanters for dps, you simply cant argue with me on this point, VoQ turns casters in to nuke machines, VQ turns melees into blenders and Charm makes the VoQ/VQ'd group look like lvl 12's with the 1k+dps pets can put out.<br />
the top 3 pet classes are very very close (not counting chanters this time)<br />
Clerics get the win for buffs, Hp buffs are always powerful, chanters/druids come a very very close second/3rd <br />
<br />
people say shaman are &quot;jack of all trades, Master of none&quot; well half of that is true, we are indeed masters of none, the one area where we lead we lead by a neglidgable margine at best. and in the other areas we are pretty much last place in them all. <br />
nukes are now more effecient than dots and draw less agro<br />
our heals are a joke,<br />
our buffs are only slightly above joke status<br />
our nukes are a joke,<br />
our dots are only good for soloing<br />
our PRIMARY ROLE as Slower/Debuffer can be done with a bot or even without, mages have mala, that and tash are close enough for most raids, chanter slow is almost as good, and thats all we bring.<br />
<br />
shaman have no clear cut ability where we are the leaders, so my suggestion is<br />
A. make us the clear cut leaders in some area, **** chanters and bst, nerf their slows down to bard grade or slightly above since you cant boost our slow, give us a slow with a massive resist mod and long duration, <br />
give us a DOT that puts the hurt on things and has a built in resist mod, make it fast and most important MAKE IT REDUCE AGRO INSTEAD OF MAKING US TANK! (it hurts my brain that one of the worst dps classes in the game also generates the MOST agro out of any class out there)<br />
<br />
<br />
compare us to druids, <br />
druids are arugably the second best dotters<br />
very very close to second in nukes<br />
one of the top 3 buff classes<br />
second best healer with a large margine over 3rd place<br />
druids fall into second place or very close to it in damn near every catagory they are part of. no I am not asking for a druid nerf.<br />
<br />
if you boosted shaman even half assed in each area you would have a class that was still not the clear leader in any area, still far from the front of the pack in any area for that matter but we would be playable.<br />
<br />
fix dog dog, <br />
give us a dot like bane was on test<br />
give us a nuke without a 12 minute cast time AND some decent damage, 1k+with 6 secs or less<br />
boost 7th to 800+hp<br />
give us Soe or some similar runspeed boost<br />
give us a 2k+ heal.<br />
<br />
look at that list, now tell me I am wrong and point and laugh at the silly whiny shaman and ignore us some more. <br />
<br />
if you put every single change on that list live on test, just boosting existing spells you would see shaman being played on raids and in groups and not being pissed off cause the other people there are carrying their useless unable to contribute anything selves. and shaman woulndt be over powered.<br />
<br />
(edit: forgot to add the part about my account being canceled if I dont see some changes made on the Live servers soon, as in by the end of the month, the only reason I am still playing is because of rl friends, when I go you may very well lose 7-10 accounts,)</div></div><hr />

o man, i remember you and me going at it over shaman, don't give in, ugh, there is always some semblance of hope. i maybe the biggest crier of bad news so far, but its not all bad, right now im playing the role of the bad guy, because, if i don't say it, who will ?<br />

<br />
Unfortunately it can't be compaired this way.  Because based on the way you are doing the math, a bard has a 0% slow, which would imply the bard isn't slowing the mob at all, when it is.</div></div><hr />

If you only care about HPs beastlords need a single additional slot. If you want three or more of HPs / ATK / Resists / stamina beastlords need less slots.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh well, I think it's safe to say that the slows are closer together than the heals in any case, and I don't really want to rehash the whole slow effectiveness thing again.  We've done that a few times. ;)</div></div><hr />

I will be canceling my account exactly 1 month after OoW comes out, unless, of course, I am able to heal for 1800 a blast (very minimum) BEFORE level 70, am able to DoT without drawing insane agro, and...well no that's it. I want to heal for 1800 before level 70 (no AA and no foci, straight 1800), and to dot without drawing insane agro. That's not hard to do, hell, that's something that should be done before 65, but I can wait till 71-73 for this.<br />
<br />
If it's not balanced in that way, I will see no future in the Shaman class, we'll be relegated to that of a Buff-Bot, or solo'er, and I don't want that for Shamad.</div></div><hr />

The fact that 100% slow = 0dps puts in this whole division by 0 problem.<br />
Division by 0 is not a problem - a 100% slow is indeed infinitely powerful as far as negating melee DPS is concerned.<br />
<br />
Slowing power = 1 / (100% - slow %)<br />
<br />
Thus<br />
1/25% -&gt; 4.00<br />
1/30% -&gt; 3.33<br />
1/35% -&gt; 2.86<br />
<br />
Now, if you want to have shaman as 100 you will have to multiply each of those by 25<br />
<br />
Shaman slowing = 100%<br />
Enchanter slowing = 83%<br />
Beastlord slowing = 71%<br />
<br />
That is on non-mitigating MOBs though. Mitigation makes it pretty much impossible to evaluate slowing power in a meaningful way. It is much much closer then the above though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Moibles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Shaman slowing = 100%<br />
Enchanter slowing = 83%<br />
Beastlord slowing = 71%<br />
<br />
Nice numbers but I don't think they reveal the important thing about slowing.  The important thing about healing is how many hps you heal.  The important thing about slowing is how many hps you don't take as damage.<br />
<br />
If a mob would normally deal out 10,000 hps in a fight, (yes, I know that is a small amount but for the purposes of figuring out the math it doesn't matter) when a mob is slowed immediately with no mitigation, proc, riposte or spell damage concerns the following are the amounts of damage saved:<br />
<br />
Shaman    = 7500<br />
Enchanter = 7000<br />
Beastlord   = 6500<br />
Bard         = 5000<br />
<br />
Using the same math that is used in the famous Cleric, Druid, Shaman comparison of damage healed.<br />
<br />
This gives us a relative goodness of slow as:<br />
<br />
Shaman    =  100.00<br />
Enchanter =    93.33<br />
Beastlord  =    86.67<br />
Bard        =    66.66<br />
<br />
Now I am not saying this is the best way to rate relative slowing power but I guarantee you that it is the only way that is equivalent to the method that is currently accepted for comparing relative healing power.   Any other method would literally be like comparing apples and oranges.  Not that I have anything against either of those fruits.  Or fruits in general really.  I like most fruits and many vegetables.  But nothing that ends in the word 'green' or 'greens', like Turnip Greens, Mustard Greens..<br />
<br />
Anyway, peace.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Both are valid ways to measure the effectiveness of slow. Your's measures the value of slow as a reverse heal. Mine measures the way it reduces MOB power and thus amplifies other heals.<br />

<br />
I may be misunderstanding you but a slow does absolutely nothing except to reduce the amount of damage you take from mob melee.  Yeah, people can argue about procs and ripostes but that not really an issue because you can't do anything about those.<br />
<br />
I repeat for the last time.  The purpose of this desire to compare our slow to other classes' slows is to show how unfair it is that others are close to our power in slowing but we are far behind them in healing.  I don't totally back that as a valid concept because we do other things besides slow and heal but given that that is what people want to do I am providing them with the *only* mathematically sound method of doing it.<br />
<br />
Anything else and I mean anything that comes up with a different number is not the same as the healing comparison that some are trying to come up with comparable numbers to and therefore wrong in this case.</div></div><hr />

This damage reduction can be expressed in two ways.<br />
a) how much longer does it take the MOB to do x damage.<br />
b) how much damage does the slow prevent.<br />
A shaman slow prevents only 50% more damage then a bard slow but that means it takes the MOB 100% longer to do x damage. That is where the different numbers come from. Both are valid.<br />
a) measures the value of slow as a debuff - something that is applied once and then amplifies the next 500 CH casts.<br />
b) measures the value of slow as a heal - comparing a single slow cast to a single heal cast.<br />

[QUOTE]<br />
<br />
<br />
I agree we bring alot more to the table than slow+heal, my point in this thread is that the extra stuff we bring is virtually nil compared to other classes with the same skill set AND that in our primary role we are arguably NOT the best class for the job. and that is the real key, we suck at every thing we do compared to other classes except slow and our slows arent all that when you factor in dps/buffs/CC and stuff like that.<br />
<br />
and dont get me started on the pvp side, they removed the resist changes from the live servers...back to being a malos caster so everyone else can land stuff :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Moibles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">If I am so obviously wrong show me the failures in my math.<br />
<br />
It isn't obvious that you are wrong.  I never intended to imply that.  I also cannot show you failures in your math because I am sure that you made none.  The only mistake you are making is using the wrong math for the problem at hand.  If you clearly stated for instance that 2 feet times 3 feet is 6 square feet, your math would also be flawless but not appropriate to the question.<br />
<br />
Other than using math that isn't appropriate to the specific question your only other mistake is thinking that a slow does anything else other than reduce damage taken during a fight.  Yes, I realize that the fact that it reduces that damage by slowing the rate at which damage is taken and that the slower the rate the easier it is for healers to keep the tank up but the difference between the top three slowing classes in the game in that respect is so small as to make literally no real world difference at all.<br />
<br />
So far I have just been trying to help out the original poster with the appropriate math for his point.  I don't personally share his point.  If my point mattered to anyone which it doesn't, especially to SoE, I think that the top three slowing classes are so close in &quot;slowing power&quot; that no one in their right mind would ever choose a Shaman over either of the others just because they slow a little bit more.

Another point of view: during a given amount of time:<br />
<br />
Shaman-slowed mob does X damage.<br />
Chanter-slowed mob does X + 0.2*X damage. (20% more damage)<br />
BST-slowed mob does X + 0.4*X damage (40% more damage)<br />
BARD-slowed mob does 2*X damage (100% more damage)<br />
Unslowed mob does 4*X damage (300% more damage)<br />
Virtual 100%-slowed mob does 0 damage (infinite less damage)<br />
<br />
Edit: this point of view focuses on damage (raw hp lost in a fight) to be able to compare with heals (raw hp gained in a fight).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Other than using math that isn't appropriate to the specific question your only other mistake is thinking that a slow does anything else other than reduce damage taken during a fight. Yes, I realize that the fact that it reduces that damage by slowing the rate at which damage is taken and that the slower the rate the easier it is for healers to keep the tank up but the difference between the top three slowing classes in the game in that respect is so small as to make literally no real world difference at all.<br />
That is simply not true. That is exactly what my numbers represent - the difference in slowing as it applies to the necessary healing speed.<br />
<br />
You claim slow is a spell that once cast creates a buffer of X HPs, dependant on fight duration. I claim that slow is a spell that once cast ups the value of all further healing by a certain percentage. Both are valid, depending on your point of view. Let me show you an extreme example:<br />
<br />
Regarding a 100% slow vs a 99% slow - You claim (correctly) that it only prevents 1% more damage, in relation to the original MOB DPS. I claim (also correctly) that it is infinitely more powerful compared to the 99% slow.<br />
<br />
You compare damage prevented, I compare damage left over. I compare how much slow helps other heals, you compare how much a slow is worth compared to a heal.<br />
<br />
So far I have just been trying to help out the original poster with the appropriate math for his point.  I don't personally share his point.  If my point mattered to anyone which it doesn't, especially to SoE, I think that the top three slowing classes are so close in &quot;slowing power&quot; that no one in their right mind would ever choose a Shaman over either of the others just because they slow a little bit more.<br />
That is certainly true in current content. Slow mitigation makes sure of that. On fully slowable MOBs that last a decent amount of time (so we can actually approach 75% slowage) that is debatable.<br />
<br />
On the other hand I know for a fact that not only will a group choose a Druid or a Cleric over a Shaman for healing but that they'd be touched in da head not to do so.<br />
<br />

That I can fully agree with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I'll just add that you, Diabalein, have posted exactly what I have wanted to say all the time, and have been trying to say. How good I have done it is a question on it's own, but anyways... :)<br />
<br />
I agree that we totally lack any utility as such. We have best slow in the game when compared to other classes, however over the time and expansions, the difference has been taken to such a minimal level, that because of the utility what other classes can give - and what we cannot - the difference becomes even smaller, if almost non-existant. And, with slow mitigating mobs, there's in many cases no difference at all, who slows, shaman or chanter or BST, since the effect will be the same.<br />
<br />
Buffs what we have are pointless, as the stats frankly mean a jack in EQ, and the new and upcoming OoW buffs, do not impress me at all, especially considering that other classes will get just the same damn buffs, or pretty much the similar to ours, so there will be nothing what would make us the &quot;kings of buffs&quot;. Our HP buffs are pretty much insignificant and all these so-called upgrades have been mostly a joke, cruel joke at that, as it seems that the &quot;upgraded&quot; thing is the mana cost, shorter duration then older spells and just a handful of more HP's.<br />
<br />
Mana regen, this &quot;edge&quot; of ours, is no longer and edge for a long time. Back when max manapool was 3k, Canni 5 was nice, but now when the manapools got to 6k, 7k and more then that, it's just a drop. Not to mention that literally all casters now have means to get significant passive mana regen, which is not too weak when compared to ours, however, while they regen their mana, then can do ANYTHING they want to do, while we can't even chat while regenning mana. I fail to find the &quot;edge&quot; in mana regen, when over 5 years I have been pressing the frikkin' Cani button almost a million times, unable to do anything else during that procedure. I'd like to see any other class and their spells, what they have had to use like this, that much, just to be able to show their &quot;edge&quot;.<br />
<br />
I have remained in EQ only due to the in-game friends I have made over these 5 years. They're all great people and are the reason, which still keeps my account active. I don't even log into the game if I am not doing anything with them. However, if SOE doesn't get their act together before OoW is released, then even this wont keep me personnally in the game. Not to mention that by that time, other titles are being released, or about to be released, thus I wont have even a second thought then about cancelling. I have many friends who, for their own reasons, feel the same way. So, I just sit back and watch what happens. We've said many times to SOE what our problems are, so they are quite well informed about these. Now we will simply watch, if they actually also care about these issues. If yes, nice, we'll continue to buy the service, if no, we'll be gone and wont care what happens after that.</div></div><hr />

Yes, this math is true, but I think it looks at the issue from the wrong angle.  The 20% disparities between Shaman/Chanter/BST in this evaluation are often then tried to apply in comparrison to the 100/64/47 of healers as a 100/80/60 percentile difference in ability with slowers.  100/80/60 percent rankings would extrapolate to Bards as being 0% slowing ability which is incorrect.<br />
<br />
Damage healed and damage prevented are much closer in situational analysis which puts Moibles 100/93/87/67 percents as being more valid IMO.</div></div><hr />

That is people putting them in the wrong order. It should be 100% (damage a shaman slowed MOB puts out), 120% and so. That will put a bard at 200%, and a bard slowed MOB indeed does twice as much damage.</div></div><hr />

Thank you.<br />

haha thats beautiful, and this may very well be the one time I feel a nerf is in order. if SOE cant figure this **** out on their own then maybe its just that time. drop chanter/bst slows by another 10% each, bard slow is pretty useless already for anything other than preslow. I dont know if another 10% is what it would take but the one thing I do know is SOE hasnt got a single ****ing clue what to do with this class. <br />
<br />
nerf non shaman slow?<br />
boost shaman healing/dps (pets/dots/nukes dont really frigging matter as long as its effective) <br />
fix shaman buffs to be something usefull.<br />
and probably the single most important part for me, DONT MAKE US PAY FOR A CLASS FIX!, ancient spells are NOT in any way shape or form a fix of any kind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Not that there will be any fixes anyway, but if there were, we could count on them being locked behind flags and keys and a rare drop even then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">you know I knew this, just forgot since the usually bst buff is about 5 slots to do the same thing as focus/sta but the end result is more. ah yeah we are the KINGS baby!!!<br />
