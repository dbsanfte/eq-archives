<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>greatmilenko_00</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I really dont understand how specialize works. I put points into alteration like everyone suggested. I read somewhere that you want to get your main specialize to 51? But can i put points into the other catagorys too, and still get a benefit?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">yes, all specializations may reach 50, but only one may exceed it up to the 200pt cap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">all you have to do is make sure that alteration is the first (only)specialise you get to 51, the others will then cap out at 50</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Yathandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Easiest way to max out alteration is to use a lvl 1 spell and keep casting it until you get to lvl 51 specialize.  Then throw points in the other specializes.<br />
<br />
Using lvl 1 spells to help raise skill is good, because as you get higher up you will need to practice some of your not so used skills like abjuration to prevent massive spell failure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You can't get to 51 spec until all other have been trained...<br />
<br />
So, change Yathandra's advice to : get alteration spec to 50 (not 51), then train the others, then finish getting that last point to lock in Alter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Also, if you somehow accidentally go over 50 in some other skill first, go to Temple of Solusk Ro in Lavastorm, some guy there gives a quest to reset it down to 50 again to respecialize.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Really, it's not an issue.  Just train them all and adventure as normal.  Unless you're doing something really unusual, like summoning enough food for an army, alteration will be the first to 51 just naturally.  You can cast the minor heal spell 20 or 30 times to give it a head start if you like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Koraden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The other have given some good advice, just make sure that you spec in alteration as you will end up casting cannabalise so much, you will really save mana :)</div></div><hr />
