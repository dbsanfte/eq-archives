<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Stopped us cold, big room with a million non-elites, hear you need to get a torch from the fire dudes and open a door, np, but, does the whole group have to fight their way through?<br />
<br />
Seems impossible without aoe.<br />
<br />
Stratholme seems pretty fun as of right now. Was walking around, went through a gate, it closed behind me, I was all alone and got swarmed by a ton of rats hehe.<br />
<br />
Mill</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not posting from experience (my mage is only 50, and shaman 54) but from what I've read, some people were complaining that you pretty much needed AE to be able to do (some of?) Stratholme.  Millions of non-elite mobs?  Bring a mage (one with instant cast arcane explosion, which *should* really be every mage out there, but some don't buy it for some reason).  If I'm AEing stuff, there's almost no functional limit to how many mobs I can kill at one time.  The only limiting factor is how fast I'm getting heals (when I pop off arcane explodes, I become the main tank for every mob there being AE'd).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Baz4</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There were some posts on this in the forums a few weeks ago.  If the search function is working, you should be able to find them again.<br />
<br />
The search function is critical to boards as big and busy as the WoW boards, I do not understand why it isn't a priority to get it fised and keep it fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Granted, I've never had a BRD group because our server has 27372438293 rogues, but I have watched my friend run BRD once, and Lyceum would seem extremely hard without any AE because of the insanely fast spawn time.  Stratholme is an alright instance, the only thing i really hated about it was that stupid eye and when it would go evade/invis you would get zerged by gargoyles :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That the thing that comes up and yells something about invaders? We kill it quick.<br />
<br />
What is harder, strath or scholo?<br />
<br />
Mill</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah, thats the wraith that yells something about invaders.  I haven't done Scholo either.  Everytime it's a raid and its viewing room only where we knock out Ras then like 7 named and then Gandling.  I've never done a full run before :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Baz4</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Found the question on the front page of the forum (just lucky - haven't seen it in weeks)<br />
