<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jooneau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I thought that list was for Web site updates, not incremental downloads.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">No those are just the files downloaded for use once the game is live.  The main game .exe still won't do anything with those files until the specified date.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Inqubus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">snd7.pfs was only &quot;new&quot; file to come down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">if u get LOY by download, then upgrade ur computer  ie new hdd...i assume that u will be able to patch the entire thing again ?<br />
As i am assuming they wil mail u a code on the 23rd feb once they take the cc payment?<br />
<br />
I guess guildies may do a bit of cd copying on this one tho )</div></div><hr />
