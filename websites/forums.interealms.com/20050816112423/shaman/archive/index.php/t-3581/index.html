<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bgum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok I just do not get it.  Many here state these are the rings to get when creating or twinking a shaman.  I will exclude from this those that are going up on thier first character where this is a viable and inexpensive option.  <br />
<br />
When I created Bgum after reading over lots and lots of equipment posts here and thier responses, I was set on two rings.  Bandit Shandel Ring and Jaded Velium Ring.  I guess I do not understand why this combination is not held up more then 2 Velium Fire Wedding rings.  I believe the extra mana and good amount of HPS is better then just straight HPS.  I lose one Canni attempt in the long run but gain 85 mana and some resists.  I am so wrong in thinking this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">For the first 24 levels of a new shaman, the ac/hp of the velium fire wedding rings cannot be beat.  <br />
<br />
The rings you mention are a close second, and many do prefer them.  After getting to regen/canni it is mostly your preference.<br />
<br />
resists will not be a factor until you are starting to raid.  Even a troll with an FR of only 5 at birth does not need much resist gear ... unless you want to solo drybones when they are still red to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Shadel Bandit Ring = 2 - 3k on my server.<br />
Velium Fire Wedding Rings = 500pp each, less if I know the JC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">6 \ 65s are some of the best rings ya can get for a shammy before high end encounters (and since they took out the TT ring again :( ).  I just now switched out one of mine for a Ring of Winter and it was tough for me to do it hehe, lost 3 ac and 15 raw hps (though the mana, wis, and MR on winter was enough to convince me).  BTW, the hps arent just for canning, as you said you only lose 1 cann from changing em out, they are so ya can take more hits too...and at your lvl, they will do even more since most likely you wont be hit for even 30 by most mobs.</div></div><hr />
