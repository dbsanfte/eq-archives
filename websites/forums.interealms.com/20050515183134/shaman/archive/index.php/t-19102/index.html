<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rubitt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">after reading through all the excesive ideas of changes and spells for GoD i come to the conclusion that the best thing soe could do in GoD to even off the shaman is give us a detrimental haste aa.  figure something along the lines of 5,15,30% and the rest along the lines of quick buff.<br />
<br />
1. this would benefit our nuke dps by signifigantly reducing casting time. and help with dots as well.<br />
<br />
2. this would make debuffing more efficient in fast killing groups.  with a good spell haste item this would mean being able to cast malos before turgurs and still have the mob above 90%.<br />
<br />
3. since our debuffs would be cast faster it would mean we could get to healing faster, since the major problem with healing is before the mob is slowed.<br />
<br />
<br />
sure i would love a new fast heal, and unresistable or unmitigated slows but i think this would be the best balance with out pushing us to the point where druids start complaining again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Only part I disagree with is that our major problem with healing is before the mob is slowed.<br />
<br />
Our actual problem is that our heals are so behind the other priests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dredak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I hope that the other priest's slows will catch up to ours soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dredak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I guess the reason I have trouble agreeing with this whole need-better-heals business is that we have NEVER had good heals.  Since level 1 we have always been a crappy healer.<br />
<br />
At 65 I am a better healer now than I have ever been before.<br />
<br />
However, I agree that we should be the undeniable king of Slowing...a title which is not so clear atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thats odd, until 58, I was just as good a healer as a druid.  Did you forget to buy a spell or something?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dredak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I never said anything about druids.    /boggle<br />
<br />
Until level 58, yes....druids were equally as awful as we were at healing.<br />
<br />
That is, unless I &quot;forgot to buy a spell or something&quot;.  Ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Maybe I missed it...  Did our slow get better at 58 to justify the sudden healing disparity that was created?<br />
<br />
I do kind of agree that the major problem with our heals is that they're completely insufficient versus unslowed mobs, and with the long cast times on malos and slow, if you get a resist, you're often so far behind in healing that it's damn near impossible to catch up enough to have time to try to slow again without killing your tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My apologies, you mentioned &quot;other priests&quot; so I just assumed you included druids.  Both shamans and druids are adequate healers pre-58.  Not good, but adequate.<br />
At this point, if I dont hit a slow on a mob incoming, I NEVER get another chance at it.  I have to chain heal just to keep the tank alive.<br />
An example, I was in pov doing golems last week.  I was healer/slower, beastlord was puller.  When slow landed on the first try, I was able to heal with kraggs and easily keep up with the heals.  When slow bounced, however, it was a very different story.  With just a 50% bst slow on the mob, I had to chain tnargs.  This only gave enough hp to the tank to give me time to cast tnargs again, no more.  Never on those pulls did I have enough time to cast a 1925 heal, or re-try slowing.<br />
Another case, our guild was killing inny in nadox.  The leader didn't know that inny gated, so when he did, the clerics were out of range.  I targeted the tank and started spamming tnargs.  Tank died with me at 50% mana.  I simply could not heal for enough damage in a short enough time to run oom.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tudani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Creative/knowledgeable use of Q can help with this.  Unfortunately if you don't have Q torpor is useable...but has very big problems.  But don't be afraid to even use torpor if it will keep your group alive.  Against unslowed mobs however it is a problem depending on your tank.  Spell haste items are a huge deal in helping with this, get BoR whenever you can, and if you don't have a spell haste item pick up a mage summoned ring before you go hunting.<br />
<br />
Druids warented the increase in healing due to their total lack of group desireability.  Now they are perfectly able to replace clerics in many situations.  They are much less efficient at it, but with the exception of maybe a ldon hard a shaman + druid is just as good as shaman + cleric.  It would be nice however to see an upgrade to tnarg's that either healed more or cast faster but with a lesser healing/mana ratio.  Though I don't see this as something that is as critical as other people think it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Dredak, guys like you used to say the same sort of thing right after Kunark came out, and we were using Greater Heal until level 55 when we got Superior Heal.  It was a mess.<br />
<br />
Shaman healing was totally inadequate, so they moved Superior Heal to 51, gave us Chloroblast at 55, and then Kragg's Mending at 58.  Followed by Torpor at 60 of course.<br />
<br />
Of course we heal and it needs to be better than just be a &quot;crappy healer&quot;.  <br />
<br />
We went down that road once before and it was a mistake that required a fair bit of post-release tinkering.  <br />
<br />
Shaman heal, and with druids they need to heal effectively.  Don't buy into the mindset &quot;we aren't healers&quot;, because that's bunk.</div></div><hr />

- Today we are crappy healers. With new GoD spells we are going to become useless healers. That needs to be addressed. We need upgrades to stay at the crappy healer level and not the useless healer level. It's called game balance. Every healer class in GoD gets a direct heal upgrade, except us, that needs to change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">for healing<br />
<br />
what i would like to see is a 2k quick heal.. doesnt have to be effeceient hell our other dd heal arnt, if you gave shaman the same heal as a druid but made it cost 1 and 1/2 more mana the druid would still be the better healer. (cos shaman just couldnt keep it up)<br />
<br />
i would perfer an upgrade to quin for 400hp/tick but then get a shaman only aa for that 1 line of spells that increases this yo 500.600.700.800 hp/tick. and increase mana cost to keep same ratio.<br />
<br />
this would mean the lower planes and normal ldon arnt affect and shaman still not a great healer, but massively improve the shaman for alot of aa for higher end. it doesnt hurt cleric or druid as they still got better dd heals, 800 times 4 is 3200hp , with exended 50% more 4800 which i think would be ok. and it take time to get the aa?<br />
<br />
for buffs <br />
things with attck focus effects and skill improvers could all be useful, and more combined buffs cos they just way to many buffs again from various classes<br />
<br />
for debuff<br />
mainly just faster cast and recast. possible a less resistant type too. (this slows malo etc)<br />
<br />
for dps<br />
i liked bane so a dot similar would be nice,  a better dd, an improved pet that can hit things more often (not more per hit or more hp)<br />
<br />
i not asking for wizard nukes, just what cleric get be nice , they not a dps class but they gett much better dd which in groups is better dps than we do. they mellee better witht herir summon hammers, and they get that pet(dot) which was pretty good. (i must admit i havent see hammer pets alot lately so maybe not that good)<br />
<br />
i really dont think this overpowers us not when you consider what other classes getting.<br />
<br />
just think of this, cleric are getting a gather mana type aa new dd  and stuff<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">You can come along way if you max your AA's and use Tnarg's in conjunction with Quiesence. The problem is that it takes more time (time we should be debuffing or cannibalizing in) and thus we have to be more active to keep up. We have to make sure Q is up on MT all the time and be ready to pump in a Tnarg when they drop dangerously low while making sure the mobs and their friends are malosed and slowed.<br />
<br />
This is less of a problem when playing with Paladins as maintanks because they can heal themselves somewhat. But if there are no backup healers and the shaman has to slow/debuff each fight we have hard time being main healer. Preferably i would like to have a druid or cleric around to be dedicated healers so i can debuff and make DPS (nuking IS more fun). But for the situations when i find myself the only healer it would be really nice to have a little extra juice in the fast heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">yes you can, but then so can druid and cleric, it not like we the only ones get those aa, but the base spell still alot lower than druid. hell a palidan can go along way with same aas cant they?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yes. Paladins with full Healing AA's are absolutely WONDERFUL to group with. Especially those with the weapon from time that procs group heals :D<br />
<br />
And ofcourse any healing upgrade would be nice ofcourse since i dont think they will reduce cast time for debuffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">soory wasnt getting at you, just alot of poeple jump on the oh but with aa you can and seem to miss that all other priest get the same aa. <br />
and try say this is fine:)<br />
<br />
i know your post wasnt in this vain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Yes. Paladins with full Healing AA's are absolutely WONDERFUL to group with. Especially those with the weapon from time that procs group heals :D<br />
<br />

<br />
But, is there a place for a shaman here?  I've been in ldon's with a high-aa'd paladin.  I even got to heal a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">They want speed and buffs now and then, and they might actually need a slow (just because theyre too lazy to chain stun) on the nameds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">We dont get good heals because we have slows...thats the logic I hear from sony.<br />
<br />
welll sony heres where your logic leaves the shaman.<br />
with a cleric a group has no need for a shaman or any kind of slower for that matter as long as he has hybrid healing or a solid tank.<br />
with the same group - cleric and + shaman you can no longer do the same mobs, why? because even slowed the mobs STILL out dps our best healing abilities.<br />
<br />
an example of my shaman with 5 melees. buff all, group replenishment is one of those. now heres the trick, the mt switches EVERY mob. now all I have to do is keep the tank alive. so long as hes at 20% or more at the end of the fight he gets no more heals, same with next mob and so on. then when I ran out of mt's the first mt is full or kinda close to it.<br />
<br />
better exp than nothing but very slow, very very hard on the shaman, and VERY dangerous over all.<br />
<br />
my point is even if I PULL with slow and it lands I am still less useful to a group than a cleric when it comes to my primary role.<br />
<br />
note:shamans primary role is that of healer we are just a preventative damage class as opposed to the more normal post damage heal types.<br />
<br />
whats my point? Shaman slows are NOT powerful enough to warrent such crappy heals, sure we do better than a druid would but druids are not a group oriented class, 90% of the druids I know prefer to charm kite for exp/loot.<br />
<br />
stop dicking us around and fixk class balance.<br />
how about one spell thats a malo+slow in one? <br />
how about Q being 400 or more per tic?<br />
how about druid grade heals? even if they arent as mana efficient for us?<br />
we are a rock solid solo class, but at 65 we solo pet less, and use all of our amazingly powerful group buffs to do what? jack up our own hp's so we can get more mana with cani.<br />
I dont even slow when I solo for exp in tactics, just plain old run3 and hp buffs with mr so the DK's dont snare me.<br />
<br />
groups dont need shaman with bst and chanter slows a druid brings more to the group and that says alot when you compare buffs.<br />
<br />
oh yeah *** is up with our group haste? upgrade it to our best haste and maybe it will end up getting mem'd now and again.<br />
<br />
<br />
I love my shaman...I hate my shaman...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Bamce ConstaCani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">as for pre 60 dru vs shaman healing,  druids healed better than use for one reason, they could just heal, they didn't have to slow, they didn't have to haste, they didn't have to debuff, they didn't have to cani.  all of they're efforts could be focused into healing, maybe snareing if you didn't have a ranger, necro, sk, etc etc,  <br />
<br />
we don't get our first grp regen spell until 56,  didn't get any group stat buffs (ya know, when they were maybe usefull) until 57, i belive druids had some kind of group hp buff before then for when clerics wern't around not 100% as i'm not a druid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">miss out druids can nuke well, dot ok, debuff fire and anull magic and buff fire/cold charm( only animals though), have mana regen in hp buff, have seperate mana rgeen and hp regen spell (mainly outdoor only), can succor to zone is things go bad, group sow before us? ,  and very important a good ds, that alone is probably as good as slow the mob kills itself hiting you. unslow mobs faster.<br />
<br />
now i dont think druids are overpowered.<br />
<br />
however shaman are underpowered. especially when slow migated</div></div><hr />
