<br />
It is sure too hard for me, my wrist is screaming at me for even thinking about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would rather unload a shotgun into my head than try that, but then after the very simple stress of cann4 for the longest time, I don't even wanna try a bard on their own, much less 2 boxing :o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Taoxek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I used to do it, but it gets pretty tiresome quite quickly. Also if one game is zoning you lose access to the other one till done zoning. Can be very dangerous. Its WONDERFULL for powerleveling though. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You wouldn't be able to twist songs very well when you swap back and forth. Would make the bard pretty ineffective. I've pl'ed a bard witht hat set up with my druid and it went ok, but its very labor intensive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You CAN hit yourself in the foot repeatedly with a hammer, but I don't think you WANT to : )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jonat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">ok so bard is out  so let me pose this question. my shaman is already 65 with all but 3 spells (pox, ever breath, levi) so i want to level another character or 2 in this case so im going bl since they have a shamanistic aspect and i want to solo rather than group because this is just a knock around duo. what is one of the least labor intensive and easiest to 2 box with?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Foggy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I knew a guy that used to 3 box a Bard, Cleric and Wizard - used to do a bloody good job too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Lots of people did good jobs with programs like macroquest.   Actual 2 boxing a bard wouldn't be worth the headache imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Mage would probably be your least labor intensive toon to 2 box. Besides clerics they are about as easy a class to play as there is. All ya gotta do is sic the pet and nuke so ya don't waste mana at full all the time. Gate when crap hits fan, mod rod when needed, and Call of the hero when needed. Pretty easy, very good dps etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It really depends on how you play but having a 2nd account druid or wizard comes in very handy.  Especially a druid.  With the combination of Damage Shields,  HP buffs, DoTs, Nukes, Charm and Snare you can do some quite amazing things.  And you can even port yourself around  :b</div></div><hr />
