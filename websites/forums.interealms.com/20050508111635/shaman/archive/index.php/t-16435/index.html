<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was actually using my epic today since I haven't really used the dot much and i noticed that the last two ticks did 167. I could have sworn that one did 167 and last did 179. Anyone else notice this? I tried to bug it but I couldn't get the bug report to work. I mean it is only a 12 dam difference, but come on, I have to get my dps one way or another.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes, this was mentioned a few times last week or the week before. The last tick now only does 167 instead of 179. <br />
<br />
I think if you're worried about the dps on those last 12 points then there's more to be worried about than you think... ;)</div></div><hr />
