<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Salas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just an idea but since i made and necro alt i have been going to The Necro Boards (http://necro.eqclasses.com/forum/) <br />
<br />
I noticed they have 2 categories we don't a &quot;NOOB&quot; section and a &quot;SOE/DEV&quot; section which these kind of post get put into the general section of the shm boards <br />
<br />
Im not saying to copy the necros or that the boards need to be changed<br />
just an idea i had</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">people can hardly fathom the idea of posting in other forums besides general as it is.  Give them more choices and their heads might explode!!  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">To move posts where they belong is what moderators are for  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would love to see a &quot;noob&quot; forum, assuming that &quot;noob&quot; encompasses any questions pertaining to under level 60 concerns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Btekippe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Concerns &quot;under 60&quot; hardly makes one a &quot;Noob&quot;.  Granted when I see that term spelled that way I tend to think of it in a deragatory sence.  Noob or Newb or any other version of Doodspeak is something that makes me grit my teeth for one and typically (not always) shows someone looking to either get a rise out of people, or the quickest way to &quot;fat lewtz and sic levels&quot;.<br />
<br />
Granted it's only my opinion, which buy the way will get me a cup of coffee if I come up with 50 cents too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lorddaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">newb was around WAY before dude speak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">As far as the SOE/DEV section goes, I'm pretty sure Sunmoon has said that he doesn't want people to address SOE directly on these forums.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I personally think it would be good to have a separate forum for new shaman issues (staying away from the newbie/noob word).<br />
<br />
It would be somewhere for all those &quot;which race&quot; questions, and for people who're new to the class to ask advice, hopefully without being immediately directed to the &quot;search&quot; function.<br />
<br />
I don't see a great need for it, just that it could be nice, if used properly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Btekippe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Lol Lorddaeth, you missed the point, I wasn't giving a dissertation on the origins of doodspeak or weather or not the chicken came before the egg, I was attempting to make a point that the context in which it was set makes &quot;Noob&quot; or being sub 60 sound derogitory, which I feel is hardly the case.  Hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">So before kunark was release was a level 50 a noob?  No.  That's pretty lame.   Noobs are true new players at say level 30 and under imo.   Not like there really are any true new players these days though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If you are going to add two new sections why not add a third, it can be titled:<br />
<br />
&quot;Weekly druid question on which class is the best&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bailie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I agree that it might be nice to have a &quot;beginning tactics&quot; forum or something similar.  Not all of us are ready for torpor/q and still struggling with some of the newer aspects of the class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Salas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">i just wanted these sections for all the which race questions as we seem to get one everyweek<br />
<br />
and for the SOE/DEV thing it wouldnt have to be for them but a place to put shm idea like the countless rabid bear wishlist</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Denero Creed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Speaking of Noobs.  Last night I had a 51 Monk ask me what regen was.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>jablek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">oh ok thanks...my lvl 65 mage buddy told me about that spell...on a raid the other day he had to wait for emperor ssra to spawn with some peeps cuz alot of the guild went out to go kill some stuff while they waited for spawn and he was only mage so he had to stay to CotH them all back, lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Lol ... Well had a wounderful Dood hose my chance for tear about 2 weeks ago when he desided to go on a sight seeing tour of fear.  The mage in his groups desided to be nice and CotH him back after he started up a nice train and was trying to mem his gate spell.  After he got Cothed back to group he proceded to ripe the mage a new one for training the raid by CotHing him back to the raid.  (note: Not mentioned but CotH Strips you off the agro list of all mobs when its used)  The 2 mages in the raid were husband &amp; wife and after being so upset the wife desided to leave.  Thus making the hubby leave.  As it was a small raid this basicly hosed our DPS enough to make taking the last two golems up very risky so raid was called.  NOW that is what I call a Drood.  Bah I really dislike that little halfling now.  Wish I really could eat that Newb.  Sad thing was he was level 62 and should known by that time.  Or at least enough to not be spouting his mouth off in OOC.  Oh well I'll get another chance some time.  JUST say NO to Newb Droods.  They be on my yummy snack list now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The reason I consider everything under 60 &quot;noob&quot; is because basically it is the same questions over and over and over again (how do i solo?  how do i canni dance?  what should I pick as a 2box partner?  where should i hunt?  what gear should I buy?).  These questions basically flood the general forum and any good threads are pushed aside.  Nothing against sub 60 people or anything, their concerns are just entirely different from the 60-65 community.</div></div><hr />

Ouch man that sucks thats why druids suck arse<br />
<br />
The reason I consider everything under 60 &quot;noob&quot; is because basically it is the same questions over and over and over again (how do i solo? how do i canni dance? what should I pick as a 2box partner? where should i hunt? what gear should I buy?). These questions basically flood the general forum and any good threads are pushed aside.

<br />
I agree with you but like the above poster said just because someone is 60+ doesnt mean their not a noob</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">what should I pick as a 2box partner?<br />

I was quoting Jinheim, and it was one of a list of things he said. I wasn't shooting down a 2box question thread, I was agreeing with Jin about the large amount of repetitive posts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>GallaenaCT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">When I first started reading the Crucible board, one of the things that bothered me was the lack of a newbie section. I'd like to see one.<br />

Hate to tell ya, but when I hit 60, I'll have just as many questions as I did sub-60.  Just because I hit 60 means that I'll know where to hunt now, or know what armor to upgrade to next?  Hmm, I would like to hope I will, but I don't think I'll know all there is to know.  <br />
<br />
I've only been playing a year, and only started my Shaman in February.  But I have the ability to pass on my experiences and knowledge to those lower level than me, just as you can pass on your knowledge to me.  Isn't that what the forums are about?<br />
<br />
Canni questions are just as relavent to a level 34 Shaman as a 65 Shaman asking for AA progression advice.<br />
<br />
Guess I've always lived under the old addage &quot;The only dumb question is the one never asked&quot;.<br />
<br />
No way intended to be a flame, just an objective observation.  It's all good.</div></div><hr />
