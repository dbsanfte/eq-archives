<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>CowGuru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello, I am working on research for a project about the emergence of MMORPGs and the communities that have sprung up around them. I feel it is a particularly important topic in light of the growing number of users and expanding variety of MMORPGs becoming available, and as a former Everquest player myself I have found it to be a convenient place to start. I am beginning by launching a questionnaire to all the Everquest-related sites I can find while doing literature-review on the topic. If you could take a few minutes to answer this questionnaire I would greatly appreciate it. Compiled results will be used confidentially, and you are free to omit any question you feel uncomfortable with. Of course, if you answered this questionnaire on another site please don’t answer it again ;) Thanks!<br />
<br />
1.) How old are you?<br />
<br />
2.) Are you male or female?<br />
<br />
3.) Where do you live (nation/state/city)?<br />
<br />
4.) What race or ethnic group(s) do you identify with?<br />
<br />
5.) What is your occupation?<br />
<br />
6.) What is your average yearly income?<br />
<br />
7.) How long have you been playing Everquest?<br />
<br />
8.) Have you ever quit playing EQ for a period longer than 2 months? If so, why did you quite, for how long, and why did you return?<br />
<br />
9.) What are your character(s) class and level?<br />
<br />
10.) Do you belong to a guild? If so, what is the average member level? Does the guild have particular orientations (role-playing, raids, etc.)? Are you an officer or the guild leader of the guild?<br />
<br />
11.) Do you know people from the game in real life? How many and what is their relation to you (friends, family, fiancée, etc.)? Did you first meet them online or in real life?<br />
<br />
12.) What raid experience do you have (dungeon raids, dragon raids, plane raids, etc.)?<br />
<br />
13.) What server(s) do you play on?<br />
<br />
14.) Have you played any prior RPG orientated games (MUDs, CCGs, D&amp;D, etc.)?<br />
<br />
15.) What are your favorite things about EQ – why do you play?<br />
<br />
16.) Do you see yourself maintaining any of the relationships made in EQ beyond the game (perhaps across games, in real life, email, etc.)?<br />
<br />
17.) How many hours do you average per week playing EQ? How many hours per week in EQ related but not in-game activities (e.g. forums)?<br />
<br />
18.) How do you divide your time between grouping, soloing, and other activities (trade-skills, questing, buying/selling, etc.)? Do you tend to group with the same or different people? <br />
<br />
19.) What zones do you tend to spend the most time in (if any)?<br />
<br />
20.) Do you plan on playing EQ2 or other MMORPGs in the future?<br />
<br />
21.) Have you ever been to a Fan Faire? If so, describe the experience.<br />
<br />
Any other comments?<br />
<br />
Thanks again for taking the time to answer all that. ;)  If you have any questions or would like a summary of the results when they are done please feel free to email me at cowguru31@yahoo.com</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>morbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's just a bit annoying to see this spammed on every EQ related messageboard I read, often in the wrong forum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>CowGuru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It is not my attention to annoy people, unfortunately there is little I can do to avoid doing so on such a large scale survey. Some people support it, some people are indifferent, and some like you will be annoyed :(. On boards with an OOT forum I did consider posting it there, but the problem with doing so is such forums often miss many EQ players.<br />
<br />
I don't know how many forums you visit, and I can sympathize that perhaps you visit upwards of a half-dozen forums during the week. However, it is a single-lined subject thread and since you are familiar with it there is no reason to waste your time opening it up. I think you protest too much.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm sorry if I have annoyed you but I'm not going to stop the survey.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, my guild has about 6 gatherings a year accross various locations in North America.  I attend 2 a year, Baltimore was my first.  I exchange email regularly with my in game friends on a variety of topics both in game and out.  Most of us plan on staying in EQ until a better game comes along that we all want to play.
