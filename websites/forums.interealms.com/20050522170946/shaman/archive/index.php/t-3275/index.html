<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was in Seb a couple of nights ago, and merrily slowing the mobs left right and center when a couple of guys run past my group with a mini train.<br />
<br />
So we pull the mobs off him and kill them but I had problems slowing one of them (a froglok dar knight) with Turgur's Insects. I got the message &quot;Your spell did not take hold&quot; which puzzles me. what would cause Turgurs to get bounced like that?<br />
<br />
I think I'm right in the assumption that Turgurs is the best slow in the game. The only other time I've had messages like that is when I've tried to buff/debuff with a lesser spell and a better one has already been used.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A higher level shaman or enc than you had slowed it I should imagine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The mobs had been Turgured by a higher level shaman most likely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yep I hadn't thought of that. <br />
<br />
Makes sense when you think of it. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">N00b ;)<br />
<br />
The reason it happens when a higher level has slowed is because the % that turgurs slows is based on you level so your so effecitvely yours would be a 'lesser' version of the spell.<br />
<br />
Will have to come and join you in seb some time mate :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">/em flick's the V's at Kronenbourg :p <br />
<br />
I see you've fixed your sig now. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mairi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Could also have been a higher level enchanter. I have noticed that even though Turgurs is a better slow, if a higher level chanter casts slow on a mob, I can't get Turgurs to land.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Velarius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Roughly....<br />
<br />
Shaman Slow for Turgurs... 15 + Current level of shaman....<br />
<br />
Chanter Slow... 10 + Current Level chanter...<br />
<br />
These are just rough estimates I got from a friend who supposedly had been looking it up, but it makes sense to me hehe...<br />
<br />
Might be wrong, but I don't think its too far off though...<br />
<br />
And btw... I group with a 60 chanter a lot and I'm currently being level 58, I don't have a problem slowing now, cause now my slow is better than the chanter's and even though chanter some times pull with slow, I can still override it!<br />
<br />

Sorry to hear that :(<br />
<br />
I'll catch you in game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Turgur's Insects<br />
 % slow is 15 + lvl (66% (L51) to 75% (L60))<br />
<br />
Forlorn Deeds (lvl 57 Chanter Slow)<br />
% slow is 10 + lvl (67% (L57) to 70% (L60))<br />
<br />
So you always have a better slow than a chanter (unless he is 6 lvls higher than you).</div></div><hr />
