<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chewy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So.. I'm in a group, and we start to break up leaving me (55 shammy), 58 necro, 56 rogue and a 52 Ranger...  We had been making fun of the warrior we had before he left because when I would slow and get aggro I'd take less damage then him..  So we figure let's try me as the main tank.<br />
<br />
It worked well, in fact the exp was better then the full group with cleric and a warrior.  I only kept everyone with HoS/Sta/Haste, and even after my Hero Bond faded (leaving me with self buffs), the group worked well..  The exp was better then when we had a cleric and a warrior..  Kills were almost as fast.  All I did was keep Stoicism on and Sup. Heal every once and a while.  I'd E bolt for aggro.  Was always FM or close to it, and the only death we had was because the necro couldnt land snare.  One time we got 2 ravens and a treant and we still survived.<br />
<br />
Was a very good time and good bragging rights for the guild.  Got alittle awe inspired unto those who dared to listen to my story.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not to be a jag off but I for one am blown away that at 55 with that gear you tanked even the ravens.   WTG though :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yeah it works well in tier 1, with torpor it's easy.<br />
i was easily tankin CY's in pod npnp.<br />
once in tier 2 it's a lot harder though, especially with some of the annoyin procs.<br />
a failed channel can mean death without a cleric and it's a lot harder on the mana.<br />
can still do it though, i've tanked giants for BoT flags. (not the named ones, hehehehe)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Back when I did PoN, my shaman tanked Hobs cause warrior aggro sucked.  My ranger routinly tanked PoD CY groups (using a 2hs rather then DW) and just recently tanked a BoT mini when the MT went down.  Key to a chain class tanking is avoiding reposte damage which can be 50% of damage taken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Really the lines between Shamans and Melee classes are *very* blurred, all the way up into the mid 50's. But the instant you get to tier 2+ you really just can't make that comparison at all. Shamans are undoubtedly the best casting class at taking damage, but almost all melee classes pass them up with AA abilities and as levels increase. Nice work though.</div></div><hr />
