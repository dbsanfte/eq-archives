<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shenlon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">how useful is this in the nerfed form?  still worth buying? can you click off the effect?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">very. yes. yes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's an amazing item.  I had the effect on me permanently from level 52 to 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just so you're clear on the downsides:<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
It must be equipped to use the effect.<br />
<br />
The effect won't work until level 35.<br />
<br />
The effect last around five minutes (so you'll be swapping it in and out a lot to reapply the effect.)<br />
<br />
It snares you (I think a 60% snare)<br />
<br />
The effect overwrites SoW / Spirit of Scale / etc.<br />
<br />
The effect generally does not stack with regen spells (unless SoW is also up, in which case it will overwrite SoW instead of your regen spell.<br />
<br />
All of this said, the staff is great great great- it just takes a little getting used to !!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kome_battle_shm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Got one two weeks ago...just a Great item for us and much less expensive than the tunic.<br />
<br />
note: runspeed I,II,or III will not affect the speed you run at when you are snared by the effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>shamy60</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What they cost now you know??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sordar Spiritrunner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I had one once, and didn't realize how good they were and sold it.  Though that was a long time ago, i still regret it.  This item is even better if u carry around epic sow boots, then just have sow on above your regen in the spell list and it will stack, then if u need to move fast again, click it off and click boots.  Of course this only works outside.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Outside you can get it to stack with chloro if you first have SoW up.  With troll regen on top of that it really works well for getting hp/mana back fast.  Inside I use it to save mana, but it is kind of a bear to keep swapping at times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Durich</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The staff is one of the best items I bought for my shaman. Since Im the only shaman in the my Guild I am on a constant buff - canni - med/heal routine. With the staff and a fungi tunic I can canni down and not waste the mana on a regrowth and be back to full health in under 3 minutes and typically back to Full mana (we seem to lack enchanters). Yes it snares you but when I use it that does not matter ie mana breaks, or during a fight (since when do you need to run to slow a mob) and 30pt combined regen is nice when you have a mob beating on you.<br />
<br />
Yeah its a pain to rotate items to click it but once you get it down it's second nature. Sow boots are needed if you plan to run away a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zorarian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I find it useful also after I get rezzed. Just click the staff and start cannidancing, no need to wait for a kei or something.<br />
<br />
-Zor</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I bought a staff for 8k recently and I find it to be very useful.  However, it's worthless in dungeons because the effect wont stack with regrowth unless sow is on.<br />
<br />
I hear stories of this selling for 100k on other servers and im tryin to figure out why.  Is their some other version thats better or what?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The pre-nerf version worked from inventory, so it was usbale by any race/class.  For necros, it was worth a ton.</div></div><hr />
