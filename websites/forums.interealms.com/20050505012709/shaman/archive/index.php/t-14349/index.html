<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>rliujr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is my first EQ character.  Am a lvl 27 Ogre shm.  Don't have a lot of cash.  Am wondering what armor is available at my lvl either by mob drops or by quests.  Prefer armor with wisdom since I'm a slow, dumb ogre.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>kowalsky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">go in bazaar and have a look there. should save you time and money :)<br />
<br />
you can get Totemic armor if you like the plate look for about 200pp per piece (BP will be about 500). (doing the quest will take ya more time and plats than byuing it)<br />
<br />
you can get Ry'gorr armor for cheaper, but you will have a chain look. Been a long time since i went to Ry'gorr Fort in EW so can't tell if you can get it by yourself.. but i'm pretty sure other will give ya more tips.<br />
<br />
have a look for the cougarskin mask quest in IC too.<br />
<br />
there is also some quest armor in sharlvarl, but dunno if it is good enuff at your level.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>qhor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Don't worry too much about gear at your level.  I think in that period<br />
I wore a lot of banded or bronze brigandine (from paludal caverns)<br />
armor.  Pretty much whatever I could pick up while exp'ing.  I think<br />
SplitPaw has a couple decent armor drops for shaman.  But frankly, I'd<br />
say push for experience until ~40, then either harvest some platinum<br />
in Rathe Mountains or Crystal Caverns or newbie zones for silks, pelts<br />
and other tradeskill items.  By and large, you'll probably find better<br />
gear for time invested by farming platinum and buying in the bazaar than<br />
you would farming equipment.<br />
<br />
I'd suggest buying cheap items for every slot, shoot for 1) Armor Class,<br />
2) Hit Points, then 3) Wisdom/Flat Mana.  AC will keep ya alive, HP you<br />
can easily convert to mana via cannibalizing, and wisdom/mana comes<br />
last as mana regen rate &gt; size of mana pool.<br />
<br />
Once you have decent stuff in each slot, save up for larger items that<br />
will last you for many levels.<br />
<br />
Let me think of some suggestions.<br />
<br />
Rings: It's pretty standard for shaman to wear velium fire wedding rings.<br />
       I've been wearing mine for ages, still using it at 61.  They're 6 AC<br />
       and 65 hitpoints.  If you an find one for 300p or below, buy it.<br />
Chest: Ry'Gorr battle mail is pretty nice and cheap.  Should run ~100p.<br />
Misc...: Jaundiced Bone stuff is pretty nice.  Good AC, cool plate graphic,<br />
       and the occasional useful mana-free click spell.<br />
Hands: SplitPaw hide gloves are quite nice and may in fact be attainable<br />
       by you at your present level.  Or, Leaf Scaled Gloves are nice and<br />
       very very cheap (50-100p).<br />
Head: Metal Linked Crown is cheap and will last a while. ~100p.<br />
<br />
Just a few ideas.  Do a search in the bazaar for each slot.  Make sure<br />
to select your class/race/deity combination and also a price range, then<br />
search each slot for Hit Points items.<br />
<br />
If you prefer to camp or quest for your armor, try SplitPaw, perhaps the<br />
East Wastes Ry'Gorr camp (not until high 30's though, I believe), the<br />
Twilight Sea quests for totemic armor, and also Hollowshade Moor is a<br />
very interesting zone with a lot of great items for the level they're<br />
attainable at.<br />
<br />
Anyway, hunt the bazaar, farm some cash, work on levels, *cough*<br />
befriend people working on tradeskills and nudge them for extras *cough*<br />
and as always, search and read these boards and sites like Allakhazam.<br />
<br />
Best of luck to you!<br />

While good advise, dont discount some of those big wis items.  As an ogre, you wis is lower than alot of other classes.  While being able to turn hp into mana is an invaluable skill that has ruined every other caster class for me (thier mana regen is way to slow, exp with the KEI nerf) doing it ALL the time gets old fast.  Nothing made me want to stop playing my shaman more than having to canni all the time in order to keep up with mana.  <br />
<br />
When my shaman was young (25 or so) I stumbled across this board and folowed the same advise...AC/HP then wis.  My base wis was 105 or so.  It didnt move much as I tried to aquire the highest AC/hp items I could.   Was forced to canni my way to the early 30's and HATED my shaman because of it.  Buffs and spells took SOOO much mana because they were balanced against my ability to regen mana by cannibalizing.<br />
<br />
Then I decided to increase my mana pool to a size I was comfortable with and THEN worry about the other stuff. At the base of it all shaman ARE casters after all, and live and die by thier mana pool.<br />
<br />
I got my wis up to the mid 160's and got some good +mana items and that helped immensely.<br />
<br />
The point?  Try both ways if you want, but find what works best for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Asyth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My very first toon is this shammy :)<br />
So I completly know where your comin' from.<br />
<br />
I am a barbarian shaman.  So I know alot about halas n00b quests and how to farm up pp via quests in that area.<br />
<br />
First thing I suggest fer a naked shammy is to do this quest.<br />
Stats aren't much but you raise your tailoring up to ~ lvl 30 at the same time as you get yourself a cloak with light ac and resist.<br />
At the same time killin 'gnolls helps inprove some faction for you, which you may or may not be interested in. ( I hunted in BlackBurrow from lvl 8-15 )<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1026<br />
<br />
<br />
Next to farm up some pp I suggest at ~ lvl 13-15 you head over to erud's crossing, Nektulos Forest or Queynos hills.  Kill willow wisps, get the greater light stones and do this quest.<br />
(keeping in mind only magic items hurt them or your spells)<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=374<br />
I do not know if you will be KoS, i know my erudite was not. ( you will be givin' the greater lightsones to a merchant, recieving a book, than sellin' book to another merchant nearby for ~9pp per book)<br />
<br />
<br />
Also a good way to gain pp is to do some tedious tradeskill farming.  Spiderling, spider shadling sillks, eggs of any kind, snake scales, zombie skins, all are relativly low end tradeskill suppiles you can sell in bazaar mode to peeps who hate to farm up tradeskill components.<br />
<br />
PoK has quite a few awesome no drop quests for real nice gear.  The easyest of which is this one:<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2193<br />
Cougar pelts sell in bazaar for ~30pp per. Cockatrice beaks are 20pp off a vendor or you lvl to your mid 30's and go kill yer own in Dreadlands or Overthere. The undead froglock tongue you can get in Lower guk (or farm vendors and/or Bazaar ) tiny rockhopper eyes rot in Shar Vahl on many vendors and cost a few gold pieces.  The end result bein' a mana pres 2 ring with some nice stats.<br />
<br />
<br />
What did i wear at your level? LoL I was in 100% gnome skin. :) Worked out fine till ~ lvl 30 where i found i had to make some pp and get some better gear.  (I lvled to mid 40's without kei, its easy enough, and way to exspensive to donate for buffs anywho)<br />
<br />
Weapon wise, you can find a decent piercer or 1hb in bazaar for a 80-200pp just keep yer eyes peeled :)  I used a centi warhammer (30pp) until ~ lvl 35.<br />
<br />
Wish ya' luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Look around for bargains, as an ogre theres a few large race only items from kael that sell cheap because not everyone can use them, picked up an 18 ac 20 hp checstpiece for my troll shammy on FV for 20pp, think it was called a giant scalemail chestpiece or somethin like that. Do some of the PoK quests, farm some tradeskill junk (EK is full of spiders/lions for pelts) and sell em in the bazaar. Also the spider camp in Uguk might still give ya xp ( I don't think so but maybe). Get some decent gear, get some levels and then you can hunt in places like crystal caverns farming velium or maybe tenebrous mountains farming acrylia. Either way get a decent mana pool, get a decent amount of hps and have fun.</div></div><hr />
