<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Alright, here's the deal. My computer can fully run Luclin graphics - unfortunately, there's a pair of problems.<br />
<br />
1) I can't see any of the woading on barbarian models, except on one male model. I can get through life with my face looking squeaky-clean and schoolgirlish, but, I'd really rather not :)<br />
<br />
2) Erudite females look as if they're wearing a bathing suit and have a coat hanger tied around their ankles. It's very bizzare. On the up side, Erudite women have some really badass thighs.<br />
<br />
So... Anyone know how I can fix these? Turn all models off, and turn them on again or something? Some sort of graphics card update (voodoo3)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>DanninSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">id update the graphics card to a geforce 3   :)<br />
<br />
<br />
seriously tho..   no idea what it might be hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Try going through your ini file and looking for &quot;loadarmour&quot; lines, if you have some and theyre set to true, try turning them to false or deleting them. I can create all sorts of graphics bugs on new models by playing with those entries! I have a mix of new models and old along with velious textures, I cant remove the bugs completely but I have removed them from my own characters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Woo! Naked Erudians!<br />
<br />
Now if only I could reproduce the naked Vah Shir bug, I'd be one happy kitty.<br />
<br />
I run a GF3, and I'm seeing some odd problems, but I think it's PoP related. My wolf is rainbow colored, wolves in other areas of the game are striped, and warders are just funky looking. Ooze black or Ooze yellow.<br />
<br />
I'm not ready to blame the GF3 yet. I'd rather blame Verant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>MagnoMightyMidget</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Actually it sounds more like you have texture caching turned on.  Go to your EQ directory and delete all .txc files, that should fix the problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mullzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">This funky stuff happened to me.<br />
<br />
- If you are using ANY of the new models, find the INI file setting for LoadVeliousTexturesBlahBlahBlah and set it to FALSE.<br />
<br />
It tries to load the Velious armor textures and place them on the Luclin models.  It doesn't work.  My Fungi Tunic became this weird collar/necklace thing and my pants turned into Spandex!  Yes I have nice thighs too but spandex is a little too revealing thanks.<br />
<br />
I had this setting on TRUE because I thought it would load the nice velious textures for the models I didn't have turned on (if you enable even one model all the other ones get the lame old world armor graphic with the velious color).  It is either buggy depending on your video card, or is *working as intended*.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have the same problems with the erudites. And somewhat the same problem with barbarian's wode. The only wode I can see is on male barbarians, but I can barely see that. Some don't show up at all, some are just one little dot on the face somewhere. Wish I could fix it.<br />
<br />
BTW, that velious armor thing doesn't work for me. I'd know because I switch them on and off a bit depending on whether or not I'm using luclin models or old models. I know my barbarian has some sweet pants with the velious textures turned on.<br />
<br />
When I first got luclin I turned on some models. They were ALL naked. No details, except for the backside, but they were all still pretty naked. I fixed it by updating the &quot;drivers&quot; for my video card. Just went to the site and downloaded it, and they were all somewhat normal except for the two problems I mentioned. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gruog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Its just time to retire your voodoo. they wernt that great when they came out and now they are simply old and basically useless.  EQ uses directx8.1 and voodoo cards support no dx features past 6 or 7.</div></div><hr />
