<br />
Started killing these bad boys just last night.  Good times....<br />
<br />
I just find that I am low on mana and health after so it's a slow go.  Was wondering what everyones techinque was when they were a fresh level 35.  I am not badly equipt in terms of gear and weapons ( Ice Wurm and a Pile Driver).  Bless me with your wisdom :)<br />
<br />
MMMmmmmmmmm plat.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't think I did Rathe until I was in my 40s, but here goes:<br />
<br />
1. Get you and pet full buffs in PoK. Level-appropriate Paladin, Cleric, Druid, etc. buffs. Also, give pet two weapons. Keep your own Regen, Haste, HP, AC, Atk, and Str buffs on your pet (or whichever of those you have at your  level).<br />
<br />
2. Tribute effects you lack to maximize your range, duration, and DoT crits.<br />
<br />
3. Pull with slow.<br />
<br />
4. Root, DoT, reroot, back up, med. Back pet off and heal as necessary. Tank for pet if you can, when you need to.<br />
<br />
5. Repeat until mob is dead.<br />
<br />
You'll have to find a balance of how many DoTs to stack; going slower will save mana and reduce downtime, but increase the chance of an add. Also, I used to make some plat by exchanging other players' copper and silver and gold for plat (at 10% charge), and then gating to a bank (when I needed rebuffs anyway).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kowalsky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">a tip when you are overloaded with coin is to go to the merchant in the zone and sell all (don't forget ya charisma buff 120+), then buy peridots..  will help ya a lot : sells back at almost same price, and you can trade peridot for cleric buff :)<br />
<br />
regarding the hunting, like samanna said, root and rot is your friend at your level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>niwggib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">and you can trade peridot for cleric buff :)<br />
<br />
Clerics no longer need 'dots for buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Oh and you can sell in zone. <br />
<br />
Watch your encumbrence.(sp I know). Helps to group with a tracker.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>frynque</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i found when i did the RM rotation, was not to let the pet tank, &quot;too much&quot;.  the first several pets are flimsy even if buffed (unless you get a cleric to toss a symbol on them).  DO give it 2 1-hander weapons, dual wielding is your pets key to DPS and holding aggro.<br />
<br />
loose recipe:<br />
<br />
make sure SoW is up (check the buff clocks for other buffs too)<br />
<br />
pick a giant that is away from any other giants.. adds are very rough at this level range.<br />
<br />
pull with slow or disease dot<br />
<br />
run giant to nearest wall/corner area.<br />
<br />
root and back up.<br />
<br />
stack on some more DoTs, like disease, secondary poison (previous level poison spell).  dont go nuts nuking, since DD breaks roots near invariably.  have root handy at all times because the DD component of our DoTs will also break root sometimes.<br />
<br />
keep pet OFF the giant until its around say 40-55% health.  that way you dont have to spend too much mana healing the pet.  also have the pet SIT at all times its not fighting.  your pet regens like a FIEND when its sitting.<br />
<br />
once the giant turns to run, join in on the bashing/hitting.<br />
<br />
wash - rinse - repeat<br />
<br />
also note, for the love of the gods, have all your weapon skills maxed for level.  theres nothing more pathetic than a shaman who cant tank mezz because their 1hb/2hb or piercing is below 50.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Setanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ahhhh, Rathe Mountains - the good old days. My guild's motto is (roughly translated) new ways to die. We have a section there - Interesting Times - for the CR stories, tho it developed into general stories some time later.<br />
<br />
Here's my memories of Rathe Mtns:<br />
<br />
Isn't it nice to come back after the rigours of a hard day at the office / uni / school / whatever (otherwise collectively known as &quot;Real Life&quot;) and be able to settle for a nice relaxing session of EQ?Hmmmmm... EQ relaxing? Other than a few of my more exotic customers, I've rarely come across something that can annoy so much in such a short space of time.<br />
<br />
After the wedding events yesterday, I was on a bit of a high and in a generally good humour - especially since we survived an episode on floor six in TOFS I was sure would end up on this page as another FF epic corpse run.<br />
<br />
A few folks were down in EW and asked if I was up to anything. Sadly there was non-one at hand to port and me being a gnerally lazy sod, I decided to stay on Luclin. Qual thought we could meet up for a session in Echo and logged on ... to find he was in Velious. Not to worry, I'll go have a gander myself in Echo. Camped to blazes. Nothing missed there Qual. At a loose end, I hit on the idea of trotting off down Rathe direction, original plan being - ironically as it turned out - to go for xp with a few clopses I know I can solo rather easily. A port, quick jog and nice healthy swim (You have become better at swimming! 176) later I arrived in Rathe. Calling my trusty spirit hound to my aid, I set out for the giant area.<br />
<br />
Well, there was one cyclops. Light blue. Maybe if I went round the back there'd be more? Nope. Couple of druids, though, committing GBH on six poor unsuspecting giants. By the time I got back around for my second circuit, there were two nice even rows of giant corpses. Still no cyclopses. <br />
<br />
Just about to call it a day when a giant spawns right on top of me. Ever ready (no that's not his name), my trusty hound lept to the attack. So I calmly (!) back off a few steps, root, rot, repeat, and call the pet to my side to watch the evidence that the bigger they come the harder they fall. A short (ish) time later a pretty stinking rotten giant oblingingly falls over dead. 60 mana, 100hp for me and pet, 36 plat off the corpse and I'm a happy camper...<br />
<br />
...except suddenly I am staring at a black screen 'YOU HAVE BEEN DISCONNECTED' Really? Very reassuring of them to put that there in case you think someone has cast blindness on you.<br />
<br />
Some time later, reconnected and back in zone to make sure I'm not dead a level 35 runs past with 8 percent hp screaming for help. A couple of heals and a chloroplast later, he's happy as larry. Or Daffy. Happy as someone happy. Never did see what he was running from so frantically. <br />
<br />
Anyway, MOBS being well known for their ability to sense low mana, who decides to materialise right on top of me but another Hill Giant (this one deserves capitals for the grief he gave me - credit where credit's due, he had me going) (for the sceptics, I was NOT standingin the same place where the first giant - lower case coz he was a wimp - landed on me). Anyway, this time no pet. O.K. Just out distance him a bit, turn and root. Ran, turned and ...<br />
<br />
... ran again. Nobody bloody told ME Linford Christie was working with the giants. This was going nowhere. Then SOW ran out. Do I have it memmed? No. Not since the wonderful last patch made my DoTs stack. Stop. Stand still. Time the spell to land between his swings. It works!!! Back off (meme damn SOW and cast) and shift into root, rot, repeat mode. Poor bugger's had it now. He has 4 percent hp left and a bloody cyclops materialises in front of me. On the plus side I'm back to near full health, so I reckon I can get out of this alive. Ran a bit away (this guys was more Eddie the Eagle than Linford: whatever he was good at it wasn't running). Turn and root. Easy.<br />
<br />
Except I've managed to pull a total Aquaticism. Snatched ignominious defeat from the jaws of glorious victory. I'd just rooted myself. No mana worth talking about so forget heals. Nothing for it, lay into him. Finally root fades and I'm off running (quick stop at the now dead giant corpse for my hard earned cash, 48pp not to be sneezed at) easily outpacing the lumbering cyclops. Must be that one eye. No depth perception. I've made it!!!<br />
<br />
Oh no I bleeding haven't. I'm travelling straight ahead. I'm not turning left or right. There's a hillface in front of me...<br />
<br />
...&quot;YOU HAVE BEEN DISCONNECTED&quot;<br />
<br />
Did the cyclops catch up and hammer the bejesus out of me? Was it the gelification effect of ramming a cliff face under the effects of SOW that killed me? We may never know.<br />
<br />
If you're passing through Rathe, pause a moment by the entrance to Feerott and remember the poor sod who died because he cared enough to help a fellow adventurer, driven to hysteria by his terrible wounds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shamad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">No, no, no, no, no guys you've got it all wrong. The safest and fastest way to kill the HG's is to simply pet kite them at that level. I did that from level 34 all the way to ~44, a few years ago, probably before PoP. <br />
<br />
The basic tactic is<br />
#1: Have sow on dogdog and yourself. <br />
#2: Pull with slow (great agro and good for &quot;oops&quot; moments)<br />
#3 Root, then lay on your diesease dots, then your poison dots.<br />
#4 Let root break, send in dogdog, and run, run fast. Run to the area were there are no HG's or Cyclops's and justgo in a huge circle. Make sure dogdog does not taunt. It's imperative that you keep the agro at all times. DogDog will be doing probably 60% of the total damage, so keep him hasted and dual wielding. <br />
#5 When your dots break, tell dogdog to back off, he has sow so he'll catch up to you, thus outrunning the HG. Then from max range, stop and re-root and re-dot. It should take no more than 2, maybe 3 rounds of thise at level 35 before the HG is dead, and you loot the bagillion PP. :)<br />
<br />
I did this for 10 levels, getting a bunch of plat and a bunch of exp. It took me maybe a month and a half at most to get those levels, but I was the richest non-twinked level 44 shaman in the server. :)<br />
<br />
At 44 the tactics changed, dogdog can tank them as long as you slow, and probably wouldnt need more than 1 heal.</div></div><hr />

Well, when I was level 35, the most common technique I used when confronting a Hill giant alone in Rathe Mountains was to wet my totemic pants, drop my Glowing Wooden Crook, and run away sceaming in terror for the nearest zone line.  :p</div></div><hr />

LOL, yeah, me too, I remember reading about the fountain of wealth that the HGs were (are?) and I got killed so fast it wasn't even fun. And I was wielding my fine steel spear (spears had just appeared as the shaman weapon of choice).</div></div><hr />

All i used to do when weighed down with sp and cp (dont think pp or gp counts for shaman weighing down) was just to buy a couple of rations or somesuch a they cost 2 or 3 gp each but they take the payment in cp and sp before they take gp.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>niwggib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">HG's used to be MONSTER sources of Plat. I remember picking 140pp off of a HG with one press of my pickpocket button and he still had plat when he was killed!<br />
<br />
Ahhh... the good ol' days!<br />
<br />
I used to just roam the valley checking out other peoples HG's, boy did some people not appreciate that! Hence why I no longer play my rogue - it brought out the @#$% in me!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">pick up a couple gnoll hide lariats in the bazaar for dog dog, duel weilding stun procc's is a significant way to drop mob dps. that + slow and you should be able to tank halfway decently even at 35.</div></div><hr />

We used to see one of those every 3 months or so.  Kind of like old faithful erupting...</div></div><hr />
