<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gaga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys, just hit 33 last night and am gonna try and hit 34 tonight. Just wandering if there were any tips regarding pet usage while soloing...<br />
<br />
If there's a guide please point me in the right direction :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Don't know if a guide exists, so heres a few pointers:<br />
<br />
Key all your pet commands onto a blank page of 'socials' hotkeys, so you can have normal spell hotkeys and pet hotkeys to hand.<br />
<br />
34 pup isnt very tough, think of him as a rogue dot you tank for, and position him as such, to side or behind the mob. <br />
<br />
/pettaunt off, With slow, dots and root its easy to hold aggro on yourself and control the fight with pet taking no damage. If you take a bit of a barshin, then root, back-up, heal, re-engage etc. When I first got pet i had 770ish AC and would tank for him just using melee and poison dots. It's more efficient to kill lots of low blues(near the point of being light blue) with pup than fighting high blue/evens/yellows etc, dog hits better and takes less damage if he catches aggro.<br />
<br />
It is possible to pet kite using no pet taunt, sow on pet. Aggro mobs with a lot of dots, break root, let it hit ya then run in big circles with pet nipping on mob from behind. I find this a boring, clumsy and inefficient tactic but good for taking down mobs that are too tough to fight toe to toe. A good tactic to fall back on when LoM sometimes ;)<br />
<br />
Don't buff the pet except for haste, and perhaps regen situationally. Use F1 and assist to toggle between you, pet and mob for fast targeting.<br />
<br />
Be careful with pup in dungeons, pathing and mob proximity can cause a mess, these are things that are learnt by trial and error.<br />
<br />
In full groups crawling in dungeons I rarely use pup, too much hassle a lot of the time, esp if mezzing multiple pulls or I'm doing Crowd control.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">One thing that it took me about 15 levels to realize is that, while our pet has few HPs when compared to a Magician or Necromancer pet, it does have some HPs and regenerates them pretty quickly. So while you shouldn't make your pet tank the entire fight, there's no reason not to let it tank down to about 25-50% health while you med, and then have it heal between fights. Once I've cast all my DoTs for the fight, or don't plan on casting another DoT for a while, I'll root the MOB, back up, and sit down. Once the pet's health gets low, I'll stand back up, cast a DoT if necessary, and tank the rest of the fight.<br />
<br />
There's nothing more annoying than sitting there at 50% health/mana with your pet at full health, grinning and wagging his tail.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I believe the aggro rules have changed a bit - I have NEVER seen my pet taunt a mob off of me when only he and I are attacking.  I am ALWAYS the mob's target.  And I've never seen the pet taunt the mob off of any melee type, either.  So I leave taunt on now - at least I get the &quot;Taunting Attacker, Master&quot; message to let me know when he has gone astray and gotten into trouble.<br />
<br />
Also, I do buff my pet with an HP buff.  It makes a difference sometimes.  He has a great regen rate, he's always ready to go before I am even if he was down to 10% or less.<br />
<br />
Most common pet problem: he hates everything that attacks you.  So you if park him (/pet guard here) and run out to pull, and the thing you are pulling casts on you or hits you once, he will leave his post as you run back and run out to attack it.  Sometimes this puts the mob in an awkward location for the fight.  Solution: use /pet back off as he runs by you - he won't attack again until you or he is attacked - or make the mob mad enough at you to forget him (i.e. use slow and a couple of dots).<br />
<br />
As long as you pull with slow or some other spell and don't get hit on the way in, he'll happily guard until the mob comes to your pull spot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Riokhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yes the pet can not out taunt anyone anymore. They changed the rules cause Necros were doing some kind of trick with pet and pet taunting which was an unbalance to the game. With the power of a Necro I could just guess at what they were doing....hehe.<br />
<br />
I think this is the correct info anyway. I read about it long time ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I know some folks have a separate bank with all their pet hotkeys, but I prefer to have them mixed in with the other ones that I use most of the time, so that I don't have to be flipping between pages in a pinch.  My pet bank of hotkeys is as follows:<br />
1 - Slam (I know, I know - it's my only special melee attack and I'll be darned if I'm taking it out :p)<br />
2 - Heal<br />
3 - /pet attack<br />
4 - Spells<br />
5 - JBB<br />
6 - Sit/Stand<br />
7 - SoW boots<br />
8 - /pet back off<br />
9 - Epic DoT<br />
10 - Sense Heading/Loc combined<br />
<br />
This is almost the same as my standard bank of hotkeys except that the pet commands are replaced by my assist and slow announcement hotkeys.  I very, very rarely ever am using a pet on a big raid where there is a need for assisting and even less often when I am slowing for a raid, because of the inherent agro issues and subsequent problems mezzing mobs that have my puppy nipping at them.  So keeping these two banks saves me from flipping from one bank to the other.  They are the two most important pet commands, I just type the others as needed.  I find it faster to type &quot;/pet taunt&quot; when desired once after I summon it than to flip banks, hit the hotkey, and flip back.  That command just toggles, you don't have to type the on or off bit.  I have yet to find a situation where I will want my pet to taunt on certain mobs and not on others and therefore would have to keep changing it.<br />
<br />
Ditto all the other pet commands...she'll regen faster if you tell her to sit &quot;/pet sit&quot; (reverse it with &quot;/pet stand&quot; I think) but once you do that it seems to overwrite other commands about whether she is guarding you or a certain spot, so I don't use it much.<br />
<br />
Speaking of which, &quot;/pet guard here&quot; will tell your pet to guard the spot where she is currently standing.  If something attacks you within her agro range, she'll run out to attack it, and will return to that spot when everything she's agroed on is dead.  Note the &quot;within his agro range&quot; bit...if you want to pull a caster mob, your best bet is to park puppy a good bit away before pulling, so that she doesn't charge in and agro the whole camp when the mob casts on you before it comes running to attack.  The other option, &quot;/pet guard me&quot; is what she defaults to when first summoned.  That just means she'll (attempt to) follow you around and will agro anything that attacks you.<br />
<br />
One more obscure one, &quot;/pet as you were&quot;.  This seems to override all previous commands and sets her back to default.  I'm not sure if it also overrides a /pet guard here or not.  I've only used it a couple times and quite honestly I couldn't even tell you why it was right in that situation.<br />
<br />
Make sure you buy the Summon Companion spell, I think it's available from the spell guy near Shady in the EC tunnel.  You can use it to summon your existing pet back to you if she gets lost...very, very handy in dungeons where pathing stinks.  Only thing is that it won't work if your pet is agroed on something, so you still have to be careful not to let her get away if there are mobs nearby that would agro her, which they often will even when green since our pets are so much lower level than we are.  But you can always summon your pet somewhere clear and per her there, then run past the greenies that would agro your pet and get to where you want to be and then summon your pet...you just can't invis en route or else puppy dies...pets always die when you use any kind of invis.  Just make sure that when you are using Summon Companion on a pet that's parked somewhere else, you're ready to immediately do a /pet guard me or /pet guard here, since she'll take off for that spot again when summoned.<br />
<br />
When you're ready to say goodbye to puppy, I think there are several commands that work but I use &quot;/pet get lost&quot;.  Kind of harsh, which is why I always hug and thank her first.<br />
<br />
As for general tactics...they vary by mob, but I usually park puppy (with taunt off) in the desired fighting spot, pull mob with slow, root it as it nears camp, apply dots as desired.  If root hasn't broken yet and the mob hit me to agro puppy, then I go ahead and send her in and sit to med up.  I watch her health (&quot;/pet report health&quot; will tell you what percentage of life she has left)and I run in to tank myself as needed.  At 34 you might still be able to do a decent bit of melee damage if you've buffed yourself up.  If that's not proving effective then you might want to try using DDs in between reapplying dots.  If you're not able to channel through the hitting often enough to do much damage, you could try just standing back and healing puppy all through the fight.  You'll have to experiment to see what is most mana efficient for you for given mobs.  As long as the mob is slowed you should be able to call puppy back to you &quot;/pet back off&quot; if you time it between hits from the mob.  (Puppy will reagro if she gets hit before she makes it out of melee range of the mob...sowing her helps here too.)  That is sometimes handy if you send her in too soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ogreshm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Incorrect. The change had nothing to do with necros. There was a bug which caused mobs to become VERY angry at pets. I mean mobs would be glued to pets from start to finish, no matter what. One guild exploited this bug by using a charmed giant in KD (enchanter charmed; vastly stronger than any pet) to tank the Avatar of War.<br />
<br />
VI's &quot;fix&quot; was to make it so that mobs would completely ignore pets if any PC on their hate list was in melee range. It was a VERY sloppy fix, IMO. Pet classes are currently broken because of this, especially beastlords.</div></div><hr />
