<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">a cure that is an AA ability thats MGB'able .. like blood of nadox, but also cure curses.<br />
<br />
say  4/6/8<br />
casting time 6.5<br />
cures 10 poi/desease and 5 curse counters first tier to<br />
35/35/10 at tier 3<br />
removes different numbers of counters per tier.<br />
if not MGB'd would just be a group cure useable every 4 minutes that overrides the RC line.<br />
<br />
we are the best at cures ... why not mgb them.<br />
<br />
this would make multiple shaman useful, and VERY saught after by raid guilds.<br />
give me feedback.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
but ... knowing SoE ... it will go to a druid, with our luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Can't MGB instant spells, else we would already be MGB'ng Nadox or Tiny Terror. To be MGB-able, the cure would have to be over time. They tried that with Celestial Elixir but couldn't get it to work... That's why instead they pimped out our Torpor (minus the downsides) to the clerics.</div></div><hr />

i know they can get it to work. even if it has to be overtime, make it like an AE that mobs do.<br />
but yes, you are right.</div></div><hr />
