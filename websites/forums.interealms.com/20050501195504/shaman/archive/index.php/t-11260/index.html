<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wanedorf Arcticbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys, well i tried the duo of war sham and didnt like it, plus we played on sz newts and it sucked.  So we rerolled to good team, i am shaman still and my brother is now a mage.  Is this a  good combo for leveling?  Any tips tactics or advice on where to hunt?  Goods dont control many places.  Thanks any tips would be great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Banuddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Shaman + Mage is an excellent combo, just have the shaman slow and let the mage pet tank with the shaman healing as necessary.<br />
<br />
As far as hunting, I can't help you there since I do not play on SZ so I don't know which places are feasible.  That combo can do well at almost any level-appropriate hunting ground, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kadira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">On blue servers, Shaman+Mage are one heck of a duo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wanedorf Arcticbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">ba ba ba aaaa bump</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Excellent job wanedorf, good team all the way buddy.  your team should do well.  i'd suggest hitting up unrest at the lower levels, then soloing the graveyard in mistmoor till about 38, then hitting up TMountains till about 50, maybe JaggedPineForest somewhere around there, and then working in PoI, JPF, katta, KC, or seb.<br />
<br />
If you want to look me up, talk to howlur in game.  good ranger, team BP!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">forget Unrest, that zone stinks.  Go to Paludial and get more exp/kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Racknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yah, why be level 16 when you could be level 25?  Padual all the way</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zukl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I two box my Shaman with a Mage and it was a)tons of fun b)fast to level.  I took my Mage to Shar Val till about 4 then to PC till 25 then I moved to GD and did Tizmaks till about 30 then went to CC and hunted the bottom of the pit till 41.  My mage is now level 42 and he has a 243int.  The money you get from selling the velium from CC will be awesome.  Remember to keep all drops and sell them every copper counts.  I am now in DL at the ridge but it is kind of slow so I will explore around and see what I can come up with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Just learned something nice.  If you are high level like 65 and know a mage with the new spell that charms an elemental, head over to BoT for some REALLY good duo action!  It's like partnering with a chanter, but the difference is, the mage NEEDS you to make it work now that gate has been nerfed in PoP zones.  Mages have no root or CC of any kind.  When their charm breaks they are mostly hosed.  With a good shaman along, you could recover from charm breaking.  Might still wanna keep Gate memmed tho LOL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Careful reading required, he said SULLON ZEK.<br />
<br />
It's not a bluebie server where you can just go anywhere you want and be all happy and nonchalant about leveling.  &quot;Oh, let's go to paludal, nah, lets go on over to oasis,&quot; says random blue noob.<br />
<br />
You go to paludal, and you're going to get ganked by the high level evils and neuts that have fun terrorizing that place.  But I mean, if you want to try and level there, go for it.  It's just a pain in the ass.<br />
<br />
Like I said, careful reading required.<br />
<br />
ie, the zones you all listed for him to level in are just about worthless.  BoT?  Lol, goods can level in PoI, and thats minimal.  Evils (hello speedd) and neuts terrorize and train that zone liberally.  And since PoD is usually a neut zone, that means goods (99% of them) have one PoP zone to level in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">SZ sounds like the absolute WORST pvp server.  No rules, no restrictions, hell, even a reputation wouldn't hold people back from any dirty trick possible.  All in the name of &quot;good&quot; or &quot;evil&quot; or &quot;neutral?&quot;  Yah SZ is the last place I'd wanna roll up a character.  Sounds like a griefer's paradise, and the only good side of that situation is to BE the griefers.  If you're not griefing you're getting griefed.  I learned that years ago when I played UO.  Learned I could win a fight or two against an evil player, but I'd get ganked more often than not by a posse of em.  So I went evil and became a griefer.  Was a lotta fun for a while.  Even looted houses and such.  Amusing.  Got boring tho, so I gave away everything to some friends and left the game for good.   I vowed never to play that kind of PvP again, since it just wasn't fun.  <br />
<br />
From what I understand, RZ and TZ servers have their own ettiquette and social rules.  If you start griefing, people gonna find out and take note.  Wars and personal fueds are one thing, casual griefing is another.  Oh, and you can't have high levels picking on newbs anymore.  That has to be refreshing.  Nothing worse than getting ganked by someone that you don't stand a chance to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Wanedorf Arcticbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Landragon its the best pvp server out there, you get griefed ask your team for help!  NO XTEAMING, zone battles are always happening, its a blast.  Much more challenging and exciting than blue servers.  I used to play xegony had few high level chars, this doesnt even compare!  You have a whole team on your side..<br />
<br />
GO GO GOOD TEAM</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">All I know is that when Fansy terrorized the Evils and Neut's they whined like a 5 year old girl to the mods.<br />
<br />
Being &quot; evil &quot; and even &quot; neutral &quot; apparently is all well and good when you can gank, and grief n00bs. However, when the shoe is on the other foot..it's<br />
<br />
/petition time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>em2johns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">You are pretty lucky to have a full time mage duo partner.  Outside of shadowknights, I think they are right up there at the top of my personal list.  Good thing about mage pets is they don't ask for buffs all the time, mage hastes their own pets, mages can summon you those extra cool Naki rings, and their pets don't complain when you use Torpor to heal them!  Overall, a happy go lucky combination for any shaman.  Have fun.</div></div><hr />
