Is my SS going to still work? Anyone tried it out today?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Welcome to Neriak :)<br />
<br />
Population... 1000 DE's and YOU!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yup, sends you to Neriak now that Gukta is the new frog-home.  All new trolls start in Neriak, so the stone now takes you there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">To recap without being a jackass...... sorry, not in the best of moods today (or this week in general...)<br />
<br />
Trolls got moved from Grobb to Neriak. Ogres got swept along because they had a shared stone. Probably, new stone for ogres to put them back in Ferrot where they belong. Trolls are now starting in Neriak so expect to have your stone remain bound there for awhile.<br />
<br />
And yes, it will still work.<br />
<br />
But I hope you didn't hose your neriak faction hunting the 3rd gate,  in your low 50's, like so many of us did... that would REALLY REALLY SUCK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Eldril Mystwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">havent hosed my faction with the ogre yet... as for my ranger, Yep, 3rd gate, I have had some fun in there. Spent my younger years killing the guards in and outside of neriak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Wait, wait, wait, where exactly does it put you?  I'm an ogre, and several DE factions don't like me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well, snice the effect is prayer, like the faith stones, it might just drop you in your guild......<br />

I could be wrong though.</div></div><hr />

How about doing the Druid Epic ... which kills DE factions.    /rude to cheesy Dev's ... do I get a rebate?   Faction improvement?   New Quests?    I'm not expecting it ... this is just another halfarse attempt to distract us instead of improve the game.   Spent 40 hours creating 'Snapon' covers for old Grobb content ... move Trolls in mass to Neriak ... and sit back and grin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">the swamp is home, and Grobb is mother<br />
<br />
i hate neriak. why do i have to duck in my own homecity??<br />
<br />
damn</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I did plenty of time hunting in 3rd gate, and don't have any problems in Neriak.  You only trash your Dead faction.  I don't know that there are any mobs on that faction in Foreign Quarter, and there are certainly none in the troll area of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The faithstone ports you to Nektulos in an area North and within sight (but not agro) of the DE guards at the Neriak entrance.  Forgot to grab an exact LOC - but it's close enough to Neriak you shouldn't be lost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Grobbles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">In my heart Grobb will always be home ,  I think i might spend the rest of my days killing frogloks everywhere , then head west and maybe diminish to the 'Troll Undying Lands'<br />

This is what pisses me off the most.  I didn't start a Troll as my main to be a freaking second class race in EQ.    Esp as a foreigner in the Troll section of somebody elses city.   May as well just come out and said ... Trolls are second class citzens and don't expect anything else from the Dev community.   <br />
<br />
Again ... I fully expect to see updated content for Trolls in the &quot;New- BS&quot; city ... quarters.   But on the other hand ... I'm prepared to find the same content thrown into Neriak on any corner that allows, same quests but broken, and faction issues out the rearend.   <br />
<br />
GM's and guides are going to be working for the next couple weeks (when available) on getting Troll issues worked out ... so that's the reason it was done now instead of closer to release of LoY.   This way Trolls will be forgotten and everyone can go jumpy jumpy off making frogs while poking fun at Trolls.    Tell me again what was the reason for Evil cities ... and why EQ now only has 3 starting cities for Evil's?    Is it that much easier to code for Goodie than Evils?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The troll move isn't finished yet, quit your damn whining and see how it plays out first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Walknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I wondered how long it would take before the Whine Police showed up. <br />
<br />
Please get bossy somewhere else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gruog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The swap port potion still goes to the same place in innothule. I am VERY upset my spiritstone got changed.   The Trolls got their butts kicked by the froggies not us Ogres so why do I have to used &quot;banished&quot; spiritstone???<br />
<br />
I think they need to make different stones for Ogres and trolls now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I've always thought so too.<br />
<br />
Being an ogre, innothule just seems like a chance to spend time running through two zones and zoning.  Considering some stones get you right by your city, or at least in the same zone, and PoP stones take you to Feerrott not too far from the ogre starting city of Ogguk, what's so handy about the Inny stone for ogres?  Sure, you can coax up a value somehow somewhere, but talk about limited!  <br />
<br />
And...that's when it planted you in Innothule! <br />
<br />
Now, you have to run a very long ways as an ogre to get to your starting city once you use the pottery spiritstone.  You'd have to be kinda nuts to do that.  It's easier just to get there almost any other way -- druid port to feerrott, wizzie port to Ro, POP portal right to Ogguk practically.  <br />
<br />
I suppose the upside is that you can get to Nektulos fast if you've ever had a craving.  But who the heck does?</div></div><hr />
