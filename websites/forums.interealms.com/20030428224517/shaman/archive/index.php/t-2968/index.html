<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Alminah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Vah Shir is the only shaman race who has no gate potions to their starting home.<br />
<br />
Has anyone heard anything about it? ..like if they plan to implement it someday in the far future or if they have said they definitely won't do it or something along that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I doubt it, as VI mentioned something inane about no ports to Luclin, other than the Spires.  Of course, they've also said that they couldn't do away with hell levels, ponies couldn't be added, and a myriad of other things that they've done.<br />
<br />
Luclin is a moderately decent expansion, but they need at least 2 teleport spots, even if they make them castable only while already on the moon...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Submit it via Feedback and the Developer's Corner.  Often.  Keep doing this until they add one :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">you know the day after they add vahshir gate potions ...<br />
youll see a brand new pot in the firepot room</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Durnitol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">they'll work it in after PoP or after the expansion after that. After Luclin becomes unused for lack of port areas or safe travel (easy exp) they will port in more ports.</div></div><hr />
