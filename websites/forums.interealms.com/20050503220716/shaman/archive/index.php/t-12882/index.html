<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Icebreaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was looking to throw about 100k at a twink just for entertainment, and was trying to figure out what class gains the most from twinking, and what class do you get the most from twinking. I've played every class to 40+, got rid of my twink account, and now I need something to mess arround with as a break from my main, and mebbe even level up if I like it  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bohemith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd say with cash, melee &gt; casters (fungi tunic) in terms of twinking benefits, and I'd say any melee with FD (sk, monk) would gain the most from twinking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Given that kind of budget (wish I had it for my main ;-) ) I'd go for a ranger. Nice DPS, decent spells and twinking can cover their only downside, AC and hitpoints.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Albadia Fii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Id have to agree with Monk.<br />
<br />
A fungi on my server runs about 80k so your mileage may vary. But that leaves you 20k to play with. If you focus on HP gear, you can easily hit a nice number and solo straight through to 50+.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Melees gain much more from twinking than casters do, but caster twinks make huge gains from KEI.<br />
<br />
A monk with two nice weapons, a fungi tunic, and a haste item is probably the best twink you can make in my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you just want something to have fun on while not playing your main, I'd vote for monk too.  Grab a couple nice weapons, a good haste item, and a fungi, and he could be naked in every slot till 50+ and not have a problem.  With FD you really cut down the amount of times you'll die, which is nice if you just want a break, who wants to spend all day on a CR?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fethanin_ECI</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">aye, monk would be best to spend the 100k on :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>paragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think it doesn't matter at all, pick a class you want to play, then twink it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I would say a melee would benefit best.  My preference is an SK, but then again, I already got one.<br />
<br />
If I were to twink out a new char, it would probably be a mage.  Already got an SK, Shammy and Ranger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My advice, if you do pick a melee class...dont twink him until he's about 10th level at least. If you give a level 1 super nice gear (particularly weapon), it will retard his skill development. He'll kill mobs so fast with a good weapon that'll he wont have the opportunity to get ranks of weapon or defense/dodge, etc. Just use buffs at low level and let him use his newbie weapon until about 5th level. Once he has a decent start on all his combat skills, then you can twink him and let him work. The skills eventually catch up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>tannus vidar 2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I would twink a bst, lots of fun...only trouble is finding a fungi patch instead of a tunic</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Certainly, its hard to twink a caster well coz they are dependant on their mana and spells for damage. KEI &gt;&gt; all for casters at low levels. So that cuts the options down to melees...<br />
<br />
I've got a beastlord as my highest level alt, and he is great fun to play. Perhaps not going to benefit the most from twinking as you can't twink the pet so well, but certainly a fungi patch would let em tank non-stop which helps hugely. Get a couple nice fast weapons and you're away.<br />
<br />
Monk, ranger and SK are also good alternatives I'd say. Monk + fungi is a classic twink, FD stops you dying so much and they are good fun. Rangers can benefit hugely from some nice weapons and hp/ac gear, and SKs just seem like darn good fun.<br />
<br />
Its really up to you I guess, just stick to any melee class and you should be fine.</div></div><hr />

I have a fantastic time playing him. He can solo or group easily, and can play main tank in an exp group at his level with no problem. The recent mitigation un-nerf was a big boost to his soloing ability at 53.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I made myself an ogre warrior barbie doll to &quot;deposit&quot; unneeded funds.   With 100k, get him a CoF and as much cultural armor as you can get.  That stuff is recommended level 45, so it's not too uber at low levels for your skill-ups, but never &quot;bad&quot;.  You can go cheap on the weapons, remember to not have a high damage weapon below 20 due to the cap on hits, mosscovered branch is nice till he gets dual wield, couple of lammies or lammie/jade mace is a nice beginner combo too.  Get him a wurmy from 20 to 40 (at which point the higher damage bonus on fast weapons comes to play).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Bohemith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If you want to twink a caster, I'd say twink a shaman.<br />
<br />
However you might go all melee which would retard your spell development, it would be advisable to cast and melee (after all, were gimps before 24).<br />
<br />
With canna at 24 + Fungi + Kei you'll basically have unlimited mana. It will be nice when you get your regeneration spells too :)<br />
<br />
But for melee, I'd say SK. Monks are everywhere and kind of get boring. The great thing about sk's is that they are dynamic, getting new spells over the levels. <br />
<br />
If I was you I'd hook my SK up with a fungi tunic, then just buy crusty armor and some cheap but fast 2h peirce wep (theres a 25/30 + stats, some kind of dragonbone spear I can't remember the name, that runs for about 1k on my server) and just level him up. That'd be super fun...<br />
<br />
Man now I want to put a fungi on an sk twink  :p</div></div><hr />

That is all true, but why would a 62 shaman make a shaman twink? :-p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Go with a beastlord, for screwing around as an alt there is no better class.<br />
<br />
Steelbear, that isn't really true, as long as you twink them well they'll have enough padding to get past the fast leveling. Even before they dumbed down levels 1-10 expwise, melee characters did not come close to maxing out their skills untill later(around level 19 is where my skills caught up with their caps on my first character, a warrior, almost 4 years ago).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I'd twink a paladin if I had alot of money..<br />
<br />
mainly cause I love lower guk (grew up there) and pallies kick ass in LGuk nowadays<br />
<br />
I'd also go gnome, with like 200p you could get 40% spell haste clicky arms for it that are rechargable.<br />
<br />
kinda assy on the stats side, but 100k could fix that easily :p</div></div><hr />
