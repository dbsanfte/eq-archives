<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>siden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />
I'm hoping to get some advice on duoing up my Shammy(Troll) &amp; Beastie(Iksar) in the most effective way.<br />
<br />
Currently my Shammy is level 58 and Beastie is level 52.  Both have good equipment on account of my retiring my level 60 monk quite a while back.  Shammy has fungi/jbb but no epic.  Beastie has decent HP/AC gear and good weapons for his level.  The main reason I retired my monk is that there seems little point levelling him past 60 as his power does not increase much at all by getting to 65.  So I'm keeping him at 60 for the forseeable future.  I've also found he has become very one dimensional now that I'm used to spells on my characters.  Both a shaman and a beastlord gain considerable power by going all of the way to 65, and so I plan on taking them both past 60 asap.  I don't expect to get torpor or malo any time soon, but Q is very affordable on my server and malos should also be reasonably obtainable.<br />
<br />
What would make a decent levelling route for them?  I have no experience of the PoP planes at all as I've been 'resting' for some months now.  I'm uncertain when I can safely start venturing to tier1 to speed things up, or whether I should just hit Velks etc. for a few levels?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any advice,<br />
Scrote of KB.</div></div><hr />

<br />
what method are you using to solo POD/N and what gear do you have?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>jathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i retired my monk as well, after the nerf. BL and shaman make a great team. you can heal the pet all you want and not get agro. high-end BL pets tank better than a monk and do nice damage.</div></div><hr />
