<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lokes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just heard on the news that a Boeing 767 plane crashed down in Queens. I can't believe this is happening again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Waran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Let's not jump to conclusions Lokes...<br />
<br />
There is no sign as of yet of this being another terrorist act.<br />
<br />
Let's just hope and pray for the families of the victims today.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Moebeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Actually it was an Airbus type of craft.<br />
<br />
From what I've heard so far it looks like they lost an engie (literally, fell off) right after takeoff.  Although these planes can fly with losing power in an engine it was only a few seconds after it took off so it did not have the speed to compensate for the loss of balance.  It crashed about 1 1/2 minutes after takeoff from the info I have so for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rowandil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I also heard about this crash and my heart sank. New York has suffered so much tragedy recently that it's so sad for this to happen there even if it is an accident. Reports also indicate that there were around 90 people lost in the 9/11 attack from the neighborhood where this aircraft went down. Hopefully this remains an accident and not a further attack on our country.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Canoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I was visiting a friend not 5 miles from where this happened...and saw the flames....<br />
<br />
<br />
So far they still don't know if it was mechanical failure or sabotage....but not a &quot;terrorist act&quot; hopefully by the information they have so far.<br />
<br />
My heart just goes out to those injured and killed, period.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lokes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah it seems like its not a terrorist act.....So far the info is that one of the engines fell off, few mins after take off... Still a tragedy and I pray for the families of the passengers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fallanthas Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Turns out the engine ingested a number of birds and self-destructed.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is always a problem this time of year.<br />
<br />
<br />
A tragedy for those involved, another blow to New York and the airline industry, but not a malicious act.<br />
