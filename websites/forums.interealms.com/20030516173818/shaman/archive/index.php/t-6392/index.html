<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Voxus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im a 53 shaman w/ fungi and jbb i have about 1500hp.<br />
<br />
Im wondering if I am able to solo to get the pages in CoM?<br />
<br />
No one xps in CoM on my server so my guild and friends would have to go out of their way, which id like to avoid if posible. Is it posible to Solo get the pages in Com? Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">For sure you will be able to - 5 of the 6 pages drop right at the entrance which I was soloing at level 49.  The last page drops in the stables ~ you might have problems getting mobs solo there but root and slow should help turn the tide for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Voxus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What mobs drop them exactly?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Any mobs.<br />
<br />
For me, though, the fog and mist golems dropped 5 of them. I think that was random luck. The ones right at the gate seemed to consistently drop pages.<br />
<br />
I soloed there a bit at 51, things were turning lb then, and I got the 5 all by myself, no problem.<br />
<br />
The last one, the spectral courier, I needed a friend with a bard to know when he was up. With the friend searching, we caught it quickly twice, the second time he dropped my student's log.<br />
<br />
I think I spent about 4 hours getting my pages, all told. Maybe 6. It was a lot easier than the the rest of the epic.</div></div><hr />
