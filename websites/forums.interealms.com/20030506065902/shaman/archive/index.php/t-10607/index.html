<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Toshizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I would like to see you PvPer's ideas and stratgies that you would utilize when facing a class. What do you do? what don't you do, etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
Many thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Which class? What level? I dont want to purge everything I know about PvP on here. If you just want general knowledge there is a forum for it and a search option.<br />
<br />
Also for good general info go to casters realm under shaman secrion and there are strategy guides.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Toshizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i would say around mid levels around 30 to 45 and thanks for site, i remember about that now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">A shaman is pretty deadly around these levels in PvP. Our dots are pretty nasty around here and do some good damage. Most people dont have the huge hps you see 50+. <br />
Also, if you can afford it, get a Blight, Hammer of the Scourge (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=556). Truly evil weapon. I used to fight a shaman with one while I played a rogue and it was almost impossible to beat him. He would 'joust' and wait for a proc. And since you can buff your dex you will proc alot more.<br />
<br />
Mana conservation is key to win with the shaman. We cant kill very fast so you have to make your mana last around 3 minutes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kome_battle_shm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">my 1st rules:<br />
<br />
Gate, spirit of cheetah, heal always memed.<br />
SoW first slot, if snared dispell yourself.<br />
Pumice, counteract poison potions always with you (to dispell tash on you)<br />
<br />
solo until lvl39 with slow+ 2hb will save you a lot of mana when in a pvp situation.<br />
<br />
always dispell your opponent at first, these days they all have Kei and HPs on them.<br />
<br />
Buff yourself with all your good buffs even charisma one in the first slots to prevent the dispells on you.<br />
<br />
vs a caster I always heal myself before to attack him in any way.<br />
<br />
often meddin in the water when i can or at least getting hps back after a xp fight or a pvp fight.<br />
<br />
well played your shaman is one of the best class in self defense,if not the best :)<br />
<br />
with these basics rules (i probably forgot to share a lot of my rules) I'm dead one time between level 19 and my current level 51 on rallos. :)<br />
<br />
Shammies rule!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shubert TZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I use the malice line of spells first.  Then go for flash of light and root.  I keep them blind while I dot them and then go in and melee or just med while they die.  Melleing is also a good option but I would get a 2hder</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">blind is a great pvp spell.  can have resist problems so be sure to debuff MR as suggested.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>throxis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Resists will make a huge difference for a shaman in just about any fight. First you need to keep your SVM above 150 all the time. Druid/ranger snares suck and pally/cleric/shaman blind sucks! Also a good idea to keep SVC and SVF above 100 at least, if possible above 150. Both Wizzies and Mages can drop nukes on you faster than you can heal yourself if you don't have adequate resists. With good SVC/SVF you'll generally take minimal damage from their nukes. AC is basically useless in PvP so sacrifice it for resists where possible on your PvP gear lineup. The only classes you really need AC against are melees and if you can't land your spells on them you need to gate anyway cause even with uber AC you can't tank them for too long. If you can land your spells on them then the fight is already over. There is nothing a pure melee(monk, rogue, warrior) can really do to you if you are landing. Hybrids, particularly SK's can still do a lot of damage to you but if you are able to land spells they won't do it with melee damage, they will be forced to resort to their relatively gimpy spell lineup. SK's will simply lifetap you till either you're low enough for HT to finish you or they go oom. Rangers will try to root you and get out of spell range to hit you with arrows, if this happens you might be finished depending on the ranger level. It's important that you keep an obstacle between you and the ranger so he doesn't turn you into a pincushion. If you're rooted there's no way to do this, might as well just gate. If you slow either of them then they really can't melee you. Pally's are a real pain to bring down many times because they have decent heals and a CH they can use every 70minutes or so. They can also make it very difficult to get your spells off with their stuns. A pally can sit and absorb your damage, using cures for your dots and heals to repair whatever damage you do to them then wait til you are oom. In my experience pally's have been probably the toughest class to PvP next to chanters. <br />
<br />
You'll hear these guys on this board extoll the virtues of high AC and HP which is generally excellent advice however in PvP a large mana pool and high resists are far more useful. I had a fight with a 53 warrior recently where it took me 6 casts of malo to get it to land, that is after burning a full 5 charges of pumice on him to debuff and a couple casts of nullify. With the two nullify's thats almost 1200 mana spent just debuffing the guy, I barely had enough for the dots to kill the guy, ended up sow kiting him around while plague and Ebolt finished him. I have 190 wis but almost no mana gear so about 2K mana to start the fight and a mana pres 2 item. Good thing I had my sow booties cause 30 seconds into the fight I had zero buffs on me. He pumiced the hell out of me and even with malo on him i couldn't stick slow the 2 times I tried. It was a fight to land Ebolt but my disease dots landed well. Had I known his SVD was so low I would have skipped all debuffing and simply sow kited him with all my disease dots stacked on him.<br />
<br />
There are so many things to be said about PvP, strats for each class from each classes perspective etc. I could go on and on but no time.</div></div><hr />
