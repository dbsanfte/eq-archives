<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Area</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Never botherd with a surname but at 55 thought what the heck.<br />
<br />
Trys all the combinations of slow / slow's / slower given my first name is Area thought it would work quite well .... but no go :(<br />
<br />
In the end typed *** for a laugh, yep no problem .... Area ***  .... lol <br />
<br />
Just hope I get petitioned :)<br />
<br />
edit: Lol even this board censors it W. t .f</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gruog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Whats wrong with &quot;Fidyone&quot; for your last name ?? =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">you can petition to have your surname changed.  Only problem is that it's harder to get a clever one since the GM has to give it to you right there.   :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Meladrak Doushi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">you can petition to have your surname changed.  Only problem is that it's harder to get a clever one since the GM has to give it to you right there.   :D<br />
<br />
Petition to have your surname removed...say you don't want a surname and they will just clear out your surname.  You can then choose a new surname by using the surname command.  Worked for me when I no longer wanted to be Meladrak DOUSHI because my (ingame) father wound up pissing a lot of people off.  After thinking about it though and having the surname removed I went back to being a Doushi by using the /surname command<br />
<br />
My point: Just ask for your surname to be removed...you can latter choose a surname on your own.<br />

<br />
I might be thinking about something else but doesn't it have a pop up box when you choose a surname asking if you are sure?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There's some people in my guild with surnames &quot;s.t.f.u&quot;, &quot;w.t.f.&quot; and &quot;o.m.f.g.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Area</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hehe petioned myself the GM answers asking what surname would I like to change it to ?<br />
<br />
So just asked if they would be kind enough to just remove it so I can pick another at a later date. No problem removed.<br />
<br />
Was tickled and amazed that W.t.f went through after trying 5 or 6 'normal' ones that didnt. <br />
<br />
The pop up box comes up before the surname gets checked which does seem abit retarded. Only find out it goes through when you get it.<br />
<br />
May just stick with having no surname :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Spite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Sometimes when you get your surname removed, they'll put an underscore _ in there, so that you can't use the /surname command: you'd have to go thru a GM again.<br />
<br />
Oh, and from what I've heard, when you roll up a character, or do a /surname, sometimes there's a GM sitting somewhere on SoE's end who gets to approve or disapprove of them.  Dunno if they watch it 24 / 7 tho. *cough*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">How about Sloe?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I would go with &quot;Effect&quot;.  Area Effect.  It would make alot more sense for a Wizard/Enchanter, but oh well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Keeki Cuppcakes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i don't know why some names are rejected either. my first druid was named lluna kindashy. later changed to luxlucis (her name then meant moon light in latin) i tried to make my warrior twink's surname luxlucis &amp; it was rejected.  :mad: i dunno why. i tried to make keeki's cupcakes &amp; it wouldn't go through either. i dunno why.  :rolleyes: but the ones you mentioned goes through. /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Bryd Wildfyre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">As for Slow, my shammy's (My primary is 65 monk, i box a 65 shammy) name is Slowe Poake.<br />
