<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Foradce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hopefully this hasn't been mentioned yet. With the latest patch you can now choose between using the 5 pets with spirit call 3, or the pets from advanced spirit call. Just make a hot key for either both and pick which kind you won't, however they do appear to be on the same time. Still a great change though and I'm suprised they didn't mention this.<br />
<br />
This was a real shock since I went to use SC and I got my 5 pets that did less damage. Thought they had broke it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thats neat, so you have the choice of a tanking set of pets ( for escapes more so ) or DPS pets. If you ask me they should improve on this and increase the DPS to ASC and the HP to SC making them 2 seperate and functional AA's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Awesome... hope this is a permanent change.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Nice change... I missed having 5 push-puppies at times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks for posting this, was thinking asc was broke.  Nice heads up, and nice change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kinedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Is the timer for both AAs linked or are they on separate timers? I assume they are still linked.</div></div><hr />

Here's your answer :)<br />
<br />
And good news btw, I never wanted to train ASC just because SC3 is more useful for raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I actually sent a petition that spirit call was broken before I realized the hotkeys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Patzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">/n00bmode on<br />
<br />
omg we get five pets at once?! that rocks<br />
<br />
/n00bmode off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yes, but they only last 60 seconds.  Still very cool.<br />
<br />
&quot;Puppy POWAH!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">nice ! .. i guess now i can get ASC :) .. i've been holding off on that because i liked the larger number of pets from SC</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Woohoo!  I've been hanging at SC3 forever because I like the puppyzerg.  I've mentioned at least once on the crucible that they should just make it two abilities, on the same timer, since there are other skills that do the same for other classes.<br />
<br />
Would have been nice for them to mention it in the notes.  Oh well, don't look a gift horse in the mouth, even if it's a silent one!<br />
<br />
If I train ASC1 and see in two patches they've &quot;fixed&quot; this &quot;error&quot; or something... I'm gonna be so mad... hotter than a tin roof on a tar paper shack!!!<br />
<br />
But I'll try it anyway hehe.</div></div><hr />

Woohoo!<br />

/agree<br />
Training ASC1 when I login, and ASC2 will be my next selection once I have the points (had been saving for Secondary Forte or Pet affinity).<br />
 :) <br />
Nice to have a bit of hidden good news every now and then!<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />
