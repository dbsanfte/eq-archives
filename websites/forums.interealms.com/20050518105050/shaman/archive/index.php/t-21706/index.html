<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>obulus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello,<br />
<br />
I used to play a 65 shaman on FV server - where you can only have on character per account. My close friend has 2 accounts and plays either his 65 ranger or 65 druid. Gear on the 3 characters is Elemental/VT type.<br />
<br />
I intend to come back and don't know if I should play my shaman or start an enchanter. What I like is beeing able to have the choice when I play : duoing, soloing, or grouping. My friend plays very often, so we can usually duo or group together. On FV server I can reroll easily since gear is tradable.<br />
<br />
As I see it, I can either play shaman and my friend his ranger, or I can play enchanter and my friend his druid. In the first case, it would be slow/tank. In the second case charm/tank. Both are fine with me. But I've read the crucible quite a bit recently, and several shamans seem to be disappointed with the class. I don't want to come back to my shaman and not be able to group, or feel like I'm not needed...<br />
<br />
What would you do ?<br />
<br />
Ps : Oh yeah... my shaman has all his spells etc... but I really hate canni. And since the new big canni spell is Ancient, I don't intend to see it anytime soon. That's a big plus for the enchanter to me...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You already have a 65 shaman.<br />
Try playing him and see how you like it.<br />
At present, I'd say the enc/dru would be a better combo than the shm/rng, but it depends where you hunt etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">First to the canni comment: (and just IMO) with Canni 5 I don't see the love/hate point. It makes up for so much and takes so little to do ... not like the constant canni dance pre-5.<br />
<br />
I play both a shaman and enchanter, and both 65. Yeah, lots of comments are beating shaman up on these boards, and if you search I am sure I made some of them, or at least supported others. I do the same on the enchanter boards ... and wizard ... and even necro. Point is, it is easy to focus on the things lacking or weak in a class and post about them.<br />
<br />
Chanters can do some amazing things. So can shaman. Frankly, if you have the 65 shaman on FV still, I would recommend you play him again and see where it stands. Are you enjoying it. Find out, after you re-acclimate yourself to the game and its changes, what the limitations to being a shaman are - if any by your standards.<br />
<br />
Flipside: if you make a chanter keep in mind you are not going to powerlevel a caster like you can a shaman/priest or melee. Chanter is going to be mana dependent, paper armored and, very much spell dependent. Most classes don't have to have all their spells as they can get them - chanters are NOT one of those classes, especially not in the higher levels.<br />
<br />
As for charming, subtle nerfs ... er, &quot;not intended&quot; adjustments ... have dampened charming somewhat and totally in some zones. Don't shoot for making a chanter to just charm - it limits half of your group options.<br />
<br />
Good luck, whichever way you go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>obulus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hi,<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot for the answers so far :)<br />
Maybe I should ask this on the enchanters' forum, but since you brought the subject... What do you mean by subtle charm nerfs ? Oh and could you make a comparaison of what your role is as a 65 shaman vs. 65 enchanter in a group and in a duo situation ?<br />
<br />
For example : in which zones do you prefer to hunt as an enchanter in a duo situation, and what you think is less/more fun when you play your enchanter ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I play both as well, but to me, the idea of deleting a 65 Shaman to start an Enchanter at level 1 is insane.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">An enchanter/druid will absolutely obliterate a shaman/ranger duo, charm is that good.  However, I would be pretty surprised if that holds true in the next expansion, which is where you will presumably need to go to level to 70 reasonably fast.  Also, add me to the &quot;you are nuts for deleting a level 65 character with a full spellbook&quot; chorus!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If your friend will be there to duo with, then you won't really have to worry about finding a group, and the complaints around here really won't effect you.  <br />
<br />
If I were in your shoes, however - yes, I would absolutely delete the 65 shaman.  Of course, this is because I spent the last 2 years doing all of the duoable &amp; single-groupable EQ content.  All that's left is this slow-mitigating crap, where a shaman is about the single LEAST useful class you can bring along.  Even if slow is mitigated, an enchanter brings a lot more to the table than a laughable heal, and a HP buff.  <br />
<br />
However, if you're going to be doing primarily duo and group stuff - keep the shaman, it'll be a lot of fun.  Really, I think the advice from above to give the shaman a test-run to see if you're having fun is the best possible course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>obulus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks again for the comments, it got me thinking...<br />
<br />
The fact is that I don't raid anymore. I only play in 3 situations : group, duo and solo. Usually in : Tier 2-3, sometimes Elemental or older zones. So it's true that I won't see all the high-end related issues. In particular healing will not be a problem - a priori.<br />
<br />
But to add something, it wouldn't bother me to delete a 65 character to start a new one. I actually enjoy playing in older zones. I also have a bard friend who could help me - be on /follow and mana-song me while playing his other character.<br />
<br />
What bothered me with the shaman was that when I was in a group to slow (+buff etc..), it was getting boring after a while since I didn't feel like my 2 dots would change anything. If I was in a groupe to slow and heal, I couldn't chat at all since I had to canni so much. I was thinking that maybe with charm and no canni, grouping would be more fun with the enchanter.<br />
<br />
I guess I have to figure out myself if I prefer the slow/tank or the charm/tank type of game experience. I actually like feeling strong and beeing able to duo big things with a meleer, slowing and healing... I don't know if I would like to be fragile and not be able to heal at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">let me add something here.<br />
shaman/druid are an excellent combo, I have done it tons of times, rotting or druid charms while shaman slows and pulls and does extra CC are very very workable. I would prefer to group my shaman with a druid over a ranger 95% of the time, rangers are crap tanks and with our crap heals you would end up oom after every fight from chain blast healing for the last 5 min straight.<br />
Chanter/Druid charm pairs are sweet as well, and chanters are probably the most powerful pve class in the game, there are very very few places your chanter wont be able to solo/group if you learn the class and play with skill. once you hit 61 you get a reagent free 1500 point rune that does wonders for your survivablity. I use it with my chardok DS clicky to pl lowbies in mistmoor, just pull a train and then tank with the rune while the mobs beat them selves to death on the ds, the lowbies just need 1 pbae (more if there are resists) to get the exp from a large pull. the lack of heals is something you will have to get used to with a chanter. super expensive shaman regen pots are one way to go, if you take the time to get your ring from rivervale and the faction to recharge it you can be an uber healer as long as you are standing in the RV clerics guild. (note this faction rocks, I had a mob CH me while I was pvping nearby, took me from 30% and about to run to 100%) both classes are very powerful, I think I prefer the shaman but its not by that much and I know the chanter brings a ****load more to the table than the shaman does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Depends on how you want to play.  <br />
<br />
- Shaman/Ranger means Ranger tanks, not ideal.  <br />
<br />
- Shaman/Druid (which I do with my RL buddy all the time) works well enough.  He can charm animals to tank and snares all, I buff pet, debuff and slow mob, add my pet, and root mob if charm breaks.  I also heal him if he has taken damage and is busy re-charming.  Will be easier once he gets dire charm.  However, this tactic is limited to animal charming, so only good in certain zones/areas.  Or you can root and rot.  Have done this also, both can root, and he can snare just in case.  Pile on dots, shammy LDoN magic dots and 60+ dots don't break root (as you probably know), so this works great.  Lots of DPS and snared mob means time to re-root or escape.  Not as fast as charm killing, but you get full exp and is less risk.<br />
<br />
- Chanter/Ranger again either means Ranger tanks, not real good, or charm killing.  Ranger handy for root/snare and dps, but lousey heals, so you have to be careful.  Dire charm obviously lowers risk considerably, but does take a while to get.  In the meantime charm breaks (always at the worst times) will mean high drama.<br />
<br />
- Chanter/Druid is a great combo, two charmed pets is insane, plus heals, buffs, snare and root.  Can't be beat.<br />
<br />
If you want to charm for a living, go Chanter, but Shammy/Druid is a viable choice also.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Enchanter/druid is incredibly strong, but It would be difficult to me to delete my shaman to start over.  With the boxed edition of eq being fairly cheap, it might be worthwhile to consider opening a new, second account, and not reactivating the first.  That way you always have the shaman to fall back on if the enchanter doesn't work out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thank you Jdthomas ! That's what I am going to do. I decided to sell my shaman gear and start an enchanter on another account to play with my druid friend. That's because I took a look at the enchanters' spells and AAxp and I saw THE thing that made me smile :<br />
<br />
- Spell : Illusion Froglock (lvl 65)<br />
- AAxp : Project Illusion<br />
<br />
And I imagined how fun it would be to join a group and turn the cleric into an Ogre, the warrior into an Halfling, the monk into a Gnome... and I realized that some enchanter spells were really fun, and after all that's what I want from the game if I start again !<br />
<br />
And as you said, if I ever feel like pressing the canni button like a madman to keep a tight FA rotation on my meleers, therefore increasing there damage output by.... blablabla... I'll still have the shaman :)<br />
<br />
Thank you very much !</div></div><hr />

<br />
Uh-huh.<br />
<br />
Don't mean to rain on your Disneyland parade, but allow me to offer some perspective on this.<br />
<br />
First off you need to get to 65. PL'ing is great and shortens the trip, but it is still a road to travel.  BTW if you suck at Charming or are not comfortable with it then you just added to the journey.  Then we're talking AA's.<br />
<br />
You're at least 27 or so AA's from Project Illusion. (I have over 150 AA's and still haven't gotten this one)<br />
<br />
Now that spell. It's level 65. It's a Rune. And it costs (on Xev) 10K+.  Which admittedly is down from the 40k or so it used to be. Oh BTW, C5 and VQ also cost 40k or so. Admittedly you play on FV so the prices may be different.<br />
<br />
You don't need to strip your Shaman clean to twink your Enchanter. AAMOF there are stories of people (Eugee) who did Enchanting work in Sebilis naked to prove it could be done. (People kept trying to give them robes).<br />
<br />
Borrow 5k and go the following route:<br />
<br />
1) Put all points into Stamina then Charisma.  You can buff your own INT; and STA gear for an Enchanter is tough. My Enchanter has a 253 STA and it is a pain to get there.<br />
<br />
2) Velium Fire Opal Rings. <br />
<br />
3) HP Gear. Don't focus on 300 INT at level 1. Focus on 300 HP. I have never died due to lack of INT. (Shaddup! :)) I have died to lack of HP a lot.<br />
<br />
4) Race. Gnome (For tinkering) or DE (Ultravision and Hide). You want hide because it allows you to break Charm when MOB gets low without using a spell slot.<br />
<br />
Since you have a Bard friend, then your Shaman can heal the Enchanter, the Bard can pull and DS and you can NUKE. (yes Nuke).  AT level 12 your nukes are as good as a Wizard. Enjoy it - because the paradigm changes quickly.<br />
<br />
Better to have an unstripped Shaman and not need him, than need him and not have him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Fenril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">You already have a lvl 65 shaman stuffed, spell book full or close, with aa and such... stick with it imo, especially as you aren't working on GoD.<br />
<br />
The huge problems with shamans come with GoD, its content, LDoN hard and maybe the last part of time (maybe! personnally I don't have any ;)), so for now, you aren't really concerned :).<br />
<br />
On PoP, I have only a few problems with the shaman's abilities, on LDoN hard, a bit more and on GoD, well... better to not speak, i'll be a bit ... bitter ;).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">My last comment on this.  Also look to the future.  Many of the comments made are based on the current status of EQ.  However, I believe that changes/adjustments are already in the works, and we know that a new expansion is coming in less than 2 months, with a higher level cap and new spells/aa's.<br />
<br />
Who is to say what they eventually do, but it is clear that they have heard our issues and are at least contemplating what to do.  I for one am confident that things will get more interesting (and dare I say better) for high end shaman in the near future.  Just the new Omen spells on Lucy (Test) indicate a move in the right direction.  Direct buffs for damage and other attributes vs. stats will make them always desirable.  So, as we get to the point that the stat buffs become OBE, we will have other usefull buffs to acquire and cast.  Sounds like a good approach to me.<br />
<br />
I'd do as JD said and start another account, but would not strip the Shaman, EQ has a way of going in a big circle, and eventually things will come back around for the Shaman.  Maybe sooner than later (my own wishful thinking).<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>haruuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">this thread is interesting to me...i have a 65 shammy main, and my best friend in rl is playing a 65 enchanter main. i can definitely see strong arguments for either, especially if we're to assume that the character is *always* going to be grouped with either the ranger or druid. <br />
<br />
personally, there's nothing in the game i'd rather have than my shammy, and i don't feel down on the class at all as it now stands. sure, there are a lot of people pointing out this or that perceived deficiency, but the bottom line is that we have the ability to do a lot of useful things, even if we don't do a couple of them (in particular healing) as well as a few people would like.<br />
<br />
that said, my enchanter friend rocks (doesn't have Dire Charm yet, which i know will be a huge change), but spends a lot of time making comments about things he loves about my shammy. <br />
<br />
tough call, in my opinion--i have duo'd with a necro a few times who charms Sentry mobs in Veksar and we go crazy there, so the idea of the enchy (with DC)/druid combo is crazy to me, but no matter how long i sit here rolling this over in my head, i just can't imagine being happier with anything other than my shammy.<br />
<br />
i guess it's just a matter of tinkering around and finding the one that speaks to you.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
can't wait to sham/enchy duo with my buddy once he gets DC...muhahaha...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I deleted a 65 shaman with over 100 aa and a full spell book.  Got killed soloing in PoS and just did not have the energy to even loot corpse.  After a break I played a Necro to 57 on FV.  The necro was very powerful but not as engaging as the Shaman.<br />
<br />
Now I have bootstrapped a Chanter to 60 ( ok will ding tonight with 18 days played ) on a new server.  Charm soloing takes some practice but is both very powerful and a rush.  Crowd control in the dudgeon environment is also a rush.<br />
<br />
If you like to start over and enjoy developing a new character then I would delete that shaman and play the chanter.  It is my view that developing a new character over some significant time is far more entertaining then grinding raids at the high end of the game.  Better yet, do it on a new server where most of the people have chosen a similar path.<br />
<br />
Even on a new server, getting spells is not nearly the problem that it once was.  I have almost all my spells banked all the way to 65 and am only missing a number of the various imbue spells.  When I ding 60 tonight I will sit down and scribe all of my none-ancient 60 spells including KEI.  This is not the days when torpor is 60k and KEI is 100k.  The most I spent on any 1 spell was 14k for the 65 VoQ.<br />
<br />
Shaman Notes:<br />
<br />
1) I loved my shaman pre pop when I could torpor tank the most amazing things.<br />
2) I hate root rot.<br />
3) I don't miss active mana regeneration all despite Can V / Q / and a lot of AA directed at maximizing the benefit, ie SCRM and QB3.<br />
<br />
Chanter Notes:<br />
1) I miss the physical toughness<br />
2) Love CC and encourage the pullers to be sloppy<br />
3) Charm solo is a rush.<br />
4) Dynamic and complex class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Keep your shaman.<br />
<br />
As someone who plays both a shaman and an enchanter, I can tell you that a shaman/druid combo is nearly as effective as a chanter/druid combo.  You'll lose some DPS from the chanter's charmed pet, and you'll belimited to zones where you can root-rot, where there are animals, or where the shaman can effectively tank the mobs, but that's still a heck of a lot of zones.  My shaman can solo just about anywhere outside tier3 PoP.  A well played shaman with VP can be just as effective as a chanter at crowd control, and your druid can also crowd control pretty darn effectively, so you won't lose too much there.<br />
<br />
If you do go chanter though, I suggest you take your time at the lower levels to learn the class, every aspect of it.  Crowd control is your primary need to learn, this DOES take a bit of practice, but you also need to learn how to charm effectively and efficiently (i.e., not get your group killed).  Charming is a skill that requires practice, nerves of steel, and fast reflexes to do right...but you already have everything but the practice part of it down, because shamans have the same requirements.  Any enchanter who does not know how to charm is wasting over half of the class' effectiveness.<br />
<br />
The Enchanter is one of those classes where you MUST be good at what you do before you reach the higher levels, or you'll get your entire group killed.<br />
<br />
And before I get stepped on, yes, shamans are another of those classes.  Basicly any support/healing class MUST be good, because the entire group depends on them, and one mistake by your chanter, shaman, or cleric can wipe the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>csivils</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I recently switched servers... On my previous server I played a shaman/paladin combo.<br />
<br />
On my new server I switched to enchanter/cleric.<br />
<br />
For me, the enchanter/cleric combo is much more powerful.<br />
<br />
When I get my buddy code (soon I hope), I intend to experiment with adding a 3rd character to the mix (trying to choose between warrior/ranger/druid/mage).<br />
<br />
I think you should use the buddy code in much the same way.<br />
<br />
Use the buddy code to make a new account and play the enchanter.<br />
<br />
If you like 2boxing (we need to come up with a name for 2boxing on one box), then keep both accounts.  Otherwise, at the end of the free month you can strip the least favorite toon and go forward with confidence that you've made the right decision.<br />

<br />
I especially liked the comparaison you made Radag between ench/sham, and the warning you gave me Binder about taking my time to level.<br />
<br />
I found low level FT gear, usually no-drop on regular servers, but with no rec/req level on FV and I got my new lvl 1 chanter to FT15. It didn't cost me that much, and I don't intent to powerlevel him with my friends' bard. I'll try to do a mix of tanking/nuking until around lvl 20 to keep defense maxed. Then I'll switch to charming. The FT gear should help me reduce downtime between kills without taking away the fun of leveling in low level zones.<br />
<br />
And about the change incoming Thunderwolfjr, I really think that I should make my mind with what's available now. I don't even have GoD, and I don't think I'll buy OoW if it's aimed at the same people. My interest in no longer to be the more efficient class, while it's still important of course. But more to have an enjoyable gameplay which means to me : no longer canniing, doing various and exciting things like charming, CC,  and illusions. I know shamans will get even more powerful with new buffs, dots, pets and new heals. But buffing and doting is not what I would like to do (even if very effective) when I come back to Everquest.<br />
<br />
Once again thanks a lot about all the comments, my next post will probably be on therunes.net with a title like &quot;Please help a newbie play his class well !&quot;. How fun when I think of it :) ... a gnome monk...</div></div><hr />
