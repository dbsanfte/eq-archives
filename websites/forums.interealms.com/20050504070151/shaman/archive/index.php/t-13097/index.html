<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hundejahre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok,<br />
<br />
I know I'm setting myself up for flames, but like I said this is a special case.  I'm about to start the Macintosh Beta ( flame that part if you want to, I use both Mac and PC ), and starting in a Norrath that will be nearly empty.  My main in the PC world is a DE Shadow Knight, I love him but at this point he depends a lot on others.  I played a Shaman long ago, but only to 19, but I have a few Shaman friends I can ask for help with issues but I'm trying to decide how to start.<br />
<br />
The races in the running are Iksar, Ogre and Vah Shir.  I have used the search and gotten a lot of ideas, but here's what I need advice on: I will be playing in a world with ALMOST NO PLAYERS, NO GEAR IN THE BAZAAR, NO GUILDS TO JOIN, AND NO HIGH LEVELS TO PASS THINGS DOWN.  This means NONE of the gear mentioned in all the posts here for quite a while, and when it does show up the stats may not be the same.<br />
<br />
So I'm asking all of you veteran players out there to imagine playing with no gear and give your oppinions.<br />
<br />
At this point the cats are all but out of the running, but if you have a good reason to play one toss it in.  The Iksar regen and AC bonus seem ideal in a world where getting good gear is a long way off, and the XP penalty seems less an issue when I'll likely be alone anyway, and after playing a DE for so long it's going to be hard to lose UltraVision, but at least InfraVision will help.  Ogre's not getting stunned from the front seems the only great reason to pick them, but when you root DOT single mobs is it a real issue?<br />
<br />
So after all this explaination if you really feel the need to flame me go on, you've read this far you deserve it.<br />
<br />
BTW, the name and address used here are not the same listed with SOE, and other than this post I will not answer ANY questions about the beta ( I probably already violated the agreement ) so don't ask.<br />
<br />
For those who want to answer thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The Iksar newbie area (Field of Bone) is very very good, as are the surrounding higher up areas. There are a number of quests that you can do (Curscale Armor for one) that will give you some decent newbie equipment while you level up.<br />
<br />
Also, the zones stay quite good as you level up (LOIO, Warsliks). I think I remembered reading that (if you were insane) you could go from 1-60 within one zone of Cabilis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>veggi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">When Venril Sathir opened i started a kitty shaman and loved it. The starting quests are fun and yield some nice rewards.<br />
The starting city is not bad, a the newby grounds are in the same zone.<br />
<br />
Kitty can travel more safely on the old world, but with the pop ports that aint that much of an issue.<br />
<br />
You'll be surprised how fast some stuff will be available to you btw, ie on VS it didn't take more then a month to see some nice stuff in baz. (before transfers)<br />

Cya</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd have to agree with Rewts, I think.  I'd likely go with Troll, for the snare neckpiece.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Er, those can still be done with the trolls hoggin the couches in Neriak, right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Hundejahre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Woohoo, very fast replies and not a flame in sight... I figured given the unusual nature of the question that would be the case.<br />
<br />
One thing I should add, and this is publically released info so I'm not leaking anything, PoP isn't part of this yet, so getting from place to place is traditional boats and Nexus ports.  Wondering how long until the first port who...errr druid starts porting for cash.  Even before PoP my SK never used them unless going to a raid.<br />
<br />
I've actually played to kitties before, a warrior and a shaman (shaman to 18).  They were ok, but it seemed a pain to be a large race without any of the advantages of a large race, always being out of food, etc. but it would let me hunt in my favorite newbie hunting ground (Everfrost).  Also, being agnostic, can the cat's work up faction to all the other cities ( I know Cabilis is tough but I have a human agnostic monk friend who did it )?<br />
<br />
As for trolls... they got their asses kicked by FROGS, 'nuff said =p j/k (not really).<br />
<br />
Oh, last question, and I'm pretty sure the answer is yes, but can most Shaman quested spells ( well, canni2 anyway) be traded?  I don't want to work on FV faction.  I've only really ever played on FV where you can sell your own mother if you can find a buyer (almost no No Drop items) so I kind of forget what regular servers are like.<br />
<br />
Thanks again all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Macs suck (sorry, my pc made me say it)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Honestly? I would be which one you like best. None of the benefits but frontal stun immunity are worth a damn once you get stoicism/torpor/quiescence.<br />
<br />
Vah shir have sneak.. very useful really.<br />
Iksar have slightly more AC<br />
Ogres are frontal stun immune<br />
Frogs have ultravision, are a good race and small(opens up some armor options while locking some others away)<br />
<br />
Nothing else is all that important at the end.<br />
<br />
But during the trip along the way some extra regen or a snare necklace would be cool. <br />
<br />
But honestly.. just play whatever shaman race visually or mentally stimulates you, not what is the best powergaming choice. Pick the powergaming choice and you will have a toon, pick what appeals to your aesthetic side and you will have a character you can identify with and love.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hail,<br />
<br />
It depends on your goals in my opinion.<br />
<br />
If you plan on leveling as fast as possible to 60 w/o stopping to explore and have fun, play an Ogre.  The ability to keep from being stunned from the front would be nice to have later in life.<br />
<br />
If you plan on leveling fast by soloing to a certain point without stopping, then taking your time to reach 60 while enjoying mid-level dungeons, Naggy/Vox raids, etc, I'd say go Troll for the Snare necklace.<br />
<br />
If you want to be able to have an INITIAL leg-up on your gear, I'd recommend Iksar.  Eventually, just one or two pieces of gear (if you play a non-iksar) will overcome the AC advantage, but I'm sure it will probably make a difference early on.<br />
<br />
If you want to be able to travel and accomplish many quests without alot of faction work, I'd say choose a kitty or barbie shaman.  The advantages of the other races aren't very important in the overall scheme of things.  If SoL zones are available, the initial faction woes (inability to buy food except at home, horrible faction work just so you can use a vendor) are immaterial, as you will have Shadowhaven and the Bazaar available from Day one.<br />
<br />
I personally would probably STILL choose Barbarian, with Froglok a second choice if that race is open for you.  The aesthetic (barbies are beautiful!) &amp; roleplay value of a Tribunal Shaman for me are worth more to me for entertainment value than any of the race-specific abilities.<br />
<br />
Good luck with your Shaman regardless of the race you choose!<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

The racial differences between Shaman are feet.  The RP are miles.  Doesn't do you a bit of good having no stun if you don't like being an ogur for the rest of your life.  Pick the race you want to RP and be happy with their abilities/penalties.  Both of these are well balanced between the races.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. You don't HAVE to give the advice at all, I suppose I should have named the topic &quot;If you've ever answered a race question before don't answer this one.&quot;  Oh wait, you didn't answer it did you?<br />
<br />
2. I stated that this was not quite the usual case of someone asking this question, and believe me (or don't) I did a few searches before EVER EVEN THINKING of asking it for this very reason. BUT in every search the subject of gear came up, people are mentioning it here even though I put in that it shouldn't be, people bring up 2-boxing and mules, not something I'd ever even want to do.<br />
<br />
3. I stated, though again not in the title, that I was pretty set on 2 races.  Out of what, 5 that can be shaman?  I never said &quot;Mommy pick a race for me&quot;, I said &quot;From you're experience, if gear and likely grouping were not available, do you have any insights I may have missed?&quot;  There's a difference there and it isn't very subtle is it?<br />
<br />
Now there are realy only 4 types of reply to my original post:<br />
The informative reply, exactly what it sounds like and also what most of these have been.<br />
The friendly reply, not really any info but the author makes you smile and you're glad they took the time to write it.<br />
The flame, easy enough to ignore and they don't bother me.<br />
And the authoritative slap in the face (i.e. &quot;How many times do we have to go over the same ground?  Thread after thread here will give the exact same advice....&quot;), really pretty hard to respect those.  Sadly without that preface it would have fit the friendly reply type.  Oh well, takes all kinds.<br />
<br />
So after insulting a regular like this expect to be flamed out of existance, but rather that than take the slap.  You complain about people asking the same questions, stop answering them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">It sounds to me like you're asking us to take responsibility for a very personal decision.  If you did the search, you'd find all the info in those other threads.  That info hasn't changed.  No one else can tell you that you'd be happy playing a Shaman and no on ecan tell you that you'd be happy playing a specific race.  Try every race if you'd like for a couple of levels, rerolling is easy, living with a decision you don't like is hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>windfinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Just want to post a thing on the Iksar, most upper end shaman gear ( for you lets say upperend is say fear/PoG ) can be worren by all races so you will have more ac then a same or close to same equiped other race. now lets go on to play style.<br />
<br />
with my iksar shaman ( now 64 ) I rolled him up with one thing in mind, I was the shaman that was in the front ranks leading the rest of our warriors and knights of fear in to the fray not sitting back and supporting them. so I have been geared since lvl 1 for smaking the heck out of anythign that gets in my way ( right now just vcasting slow cripple and bane ( some times not ) I give ANY tank a tough way to go on keeping aggro to the point that after sevral hours some warriors have plan stoped trying or some SK's and pallys are crying for mommy couse there mana is non existant. I take this as a MARK of pride. sure some say that i am a warrior in denial but I look at it like this, every race/tribe needs or has had a spiritaless leader come to the forfont of there time and lead them in to battle not just tell them what to do ( in the time the game is set anyway well rough paraleling that is ).<br />
<br />
for Equipment Iksars<br />
<br />
curscale/leather/rhinohide/some bought chian types will take you comfturble in to the high teens low 20's<br />
<br />
Banded will take you right on up to around 36-40<br />
<br />
Cabscale should start around 30's or alittle low depeding on luck up tell you can get Iksar blood... ( 40-45 arounds )<br />
<br />
Imbuded cabscale will take you right on throu to 55 or untell you get ...<br />
<br />
Iksar fear armor - as soon as you can ( 46 to 60+ )<br />
<br />
just so you all know even on establised servers I was wearing all armor I had made tell i was 54 ( immbude cab scale ) and that is when i get fear armor which i wore tell i got some spiritweaver and some other asorted armor at around 58 59 but the fear armor had not out lived its life but only bearly.<br />
<br />
so you can see armor is nto hard to come by for a iksar we have the lucktery of not worring as much about the AC on it BECOUSE we have out natrual hard 40 ac bones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">It doesn't matter, play what you like.  That being said, Iksar &gt; all~ =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">but when you root DOT single mobs is it a real issue?<br />
<br />
Rather than go on a tirade, let me just give you a hint: if you're root-dotting to solo before 60, you're doing yourself a disservice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">There is one point about Vah Shir that is often overlooked now.  Travel is very restricted until about level 25 or so.  To get to anywhere on the old world (or to the Bazaar (I still remember my first trip there))you have to pass through Paludal Caverns (which is not a trivial thing for a new character) or pay for a port.  Without PoP books playing a kitty can be rough.<br />
<br />
The newbie areas are very good though.  Nearly everything you could want or need and plenty of quests to keep you busy.  There's even a dropped Banded armor equivalent that you could start collecting as early as level 10 (loda Kai armor).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>paragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I recomend barb. <br />
<br />
second is frog.<br />
<br />
it isn't so much about how easy they are as much as where they are located and the factions.<br />
<br />
with no books to click you are going to have to enjoy the area you are starting at and to me there are no better places to start at than blackburrow or crushbone, and the frog would be close enough for you to make the run and if you are careful about it making it safely to hop the boats in FP.<br />
<br />
more importantly, start saving your money as soon as you can and buy banded pieces you can afford. someone will be making it and selling it. watch for good deals on shields and weapons too. don't forget cutthroat insignia rings. 1ac is 1ac :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Since you cannot rely on gear I'd say ogre. Most HP, and no stun when root breaks and you have to reapply.  Also, as a CT worshipper you can improve faction in Cabilis relatively easy to use the Kunark circle for fast advancement.<br />
Endgame isn't really a point here if it's a 3 month or so beta, you cannot take the time it takes today to quicklevel someone, and compare it to starting a true newb on a true newb server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">The danger of playing a newbie ogre is that once you get a taste of stun immunity, you might not want to play any other race ever again.</div></div><hr />

Though I am not much of a roleplayer...like not at all, I still find myself getting into character when I play alts.<br />
<br />
Since it is beta though, you won't have the character long enough for that to matter.<br />
In beta I would follow the others advice</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Ogre &gt; all. I never died becasue I was stunned and couldnt get a heal off, or run. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I have played iksar to 52, troll to 36 and ogre to 61.<br />
<br />
Iksar is by far the least gear dependant of the shaman races and the easist to boot strap on a new server.<br />
<br />
a) ac bonus<br />
b) high starting wisdom<br />
c) nice agility<br />
d) great starting area<br />
e) good midlevel armor quests.<br />
<br />
However,  Final is right.  Play exactly what you want to play and to hell with min / max.  If you are not happy with how it feels to drive  your character around, it will simply not make any differance what kind of racial advantages your character has becuase you are not very likly to play him for long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Ogre. <br />
<br />
Issue closed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Porgy Beastmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I think you can't play a frog... cause PoP isn't in the game.. so LoY prolly isn't...  Might not be able to play a troll either, same reason <br />
<br />
I don't know what's going on with Barbarians... and why he didn't name that one... especially considering he named Everfrost his favorite hunting ground... Maybe were gonna see gnolls as a playable race next expansion ,and they took over Halas... and VI was getting ahead on the Mac Beta.  But I'll stop at that.<br />
<br />
Ogres will be good for frontal Stun, but post 60 (when other abilities &quot;become not useful&quot; which I disagree with... but whatever) in PoP if you're getting hit for 355+ a hit, stun is the least of your worries.  I hardly ever get stunned except from behind anyway.  Ogres will have a very easy time getting around to everywhere.<br />
<br />
Iksar have great regen, level fast in their own zones (no XP mod in FoB) and are 2 zones away from xp to level 60+  FoB to 8, Kurns to 15, LoIO to 20, WW/FV to 30, Dalnir/Nurga to 35, Kaesora to 45, CoM to 55, Sebilis to 60, and soon Veksar to 65. all within (at most) 4 zones from Cabilis,  but if you get bored with those zones easily... you're gonna hate being an Iksar until druids and wizards come to Kunark... both boats off are KoS to you, and the run through FM and Dreadlands (to the spire) is really hard to do before level 19 and invis... and even then.. the giants in FM and Dreadlands see through invis.  Seriously, the Iksar are pretty set for craftable armor for low cost.  And the imbued cultural is pretty easy to get when you pick up Iksar Blood.  You can do CAnni2 without leaving, though for your mace quests (another reason to pick Iksar) you'll have to visit the Gorge once.  There are a few hard to get spells from FV or OT... that part is annoying.  Other problems though... Clerics Wizards and Druids are lacking from Iksar Culture.  While I truly believe almost any content in the game can be done with just Iksars... There are those problems.  Also remember... on a new server, Iksar necros learn to be great in groups.  OVer half of your epic is done withint 3 zones of Cabilis.  and they have best planar armor.<br />
<br />
Vah shir, Sneak is a godsend for quests, and merchants who don't like you.  Safefall is very underratted.  They have amazing quest series, the cape is &gt; almost anything pre PoP.  they have a good newbie zone, and access to PC for amazing leveling.  They are also good aligned race, so easy faction.  JBB, no Fungi though I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Eriadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I play an iksar because it suits the playstyle I wanted to play.  I like the AC and I like the regen.  I liked the higher WIS (so I can get gear with AC and HP).  I even like the faction.  In the end, it's up to you.  For those who say regen is not that important once you get Stoicism or Torpor ... well, I'd have to disagree.  I love my regen.  Even with Stoicism, I canni-dance a lot.  Between fights, I don't want to do more than a few med ticks of canni-dance, and then go pull (especially with C3 these days).  So I save the power-canni till I really need a lot of mana.<br />
<br />
As for starting on a new server, how does that really affect you?  Well, you won't have access to twink gear, as you said.  Faction ties into this, as you may want to do some quests for gear.  Transportation will be an issue.  I'd take a look at what quests you think you can reasonably accomplish, given faction and travel considerations, and go from there, if that is your concern.  Balance that out with what you really want to play.  Stats-wise, they all have their advantages and disadvantages.  Iksar have AC, regen, but lower STA.  Ogres have more STA, but lower WIS and AC.  In the end, you have to have enough of all of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Hundejahre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Ok, a few more bits from me concluding with what I've chosen and maybe even why...<br />
<br />
I didn't include barbarians in the list because I have no desire to play one.  Nothing against them, my wife plays one on FV, but it's just not for me.  I still love everfrost as a newbie zone, but once again I won't be a newbie there, save a spot at the IG's for me =)<br />
<br />
Frogs are not an option because, as the poster guessed LoY isn't included in the testing.  Trolls are included but I've never wanted to play one.<br />
<br />
Kitties... if I were going to play a good race this is what I would pick, but being a DE for so long has made me come to enjoy the dark races AND the struggle that goes with it.<br />
<br />
Ogres have a lot to offer and ever since Luclin the graphics for them have been nice too, but it just isn't quite enough.<br />
<br />
Iksars it is.  They have the look, the history, the struggle to get anywhere in the old world ( I consider it fun to be hated, what can I say? ).  The regen and AC will help (this is a beta and I very much doubt I'll live to 60 or beyond).  And it will be good to see what it's really like.  I imagine all toons will be wiped when the Mac version goes Gold (hasn't been stated yet, I'm making an assumption).<br />
<br />
For everyone that came out and played thank you, we can let this thread die now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">What you stated at the end is exactly what I was looking for from you.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Asraguard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Hey Hunde,<br />
<br />
Like most replies in this thread have said, there are advantages and disadvantages to each starting race. I guess the most important thing you posted was that you have no help at all when starting your character and this does affect starting race.<br />

If I was making a twink shaman (ie one that will have a lot of help with both gear and leveling) then I would definately make an Ogre. Trolls would be next highest on my list but I do think the snare necklace they get is slightly over-rated. Its a long cast time and only lasts 60 seconds so is probably not going to make a huge difference to soloing abilities.<br />
<br />
Barbarian's and Kitty's would be high on my list if I were making a shammy that was going to have no help. Having good faction is always a nice thing when you are a newbie trying to get by and trying to travel around and explore many zones. I have no idea about Froggie starting faction but if their faction is good too then I would add them to the list with Barb's and Kitty's.<br />
<br />
Iksars are a great starting race if you are going to have no help cuz I still think Kunark is the best expansion VI has made. Iksars have terrible faction but VI accounted for this by making everything you need available right next door. If you can put off the urge to explore Norrath for a while you will find that all the zones you need to get your character to level 60 are only a few zones away from your starting city. Field of Bones is the best lvl 1-10 zone I have seen, then Kurn's Tower will quickly take you to lvl 20, then Lake of Ill Omen quickly to 30 and then Frontier Mountains and Overthere quickly to 40. The zones are so well layed out that you can easily solo as well. From 40 you can hit Dreadlands or City of Mist to get you to 50 and then theirs Kanor's Castle to get you to 60 if you can be bothered staying in Kunark that long.<br />
<br />
The other advantage an Iksar shaman gets is the innate AC boost and the regen which helps tremendously at low levels if you have no money for gear. Also the newbie quests are very easy to do and get you fully clothed in no time. The iksar shaman only armour quests are easy as well and get you some decent gear. Plus the Iksar Cudgel quests make sure you get a good weapon to use if you cannot afford to buy one.<br />
<br />
I started an Iksar Shaman when I was in the same position as you. Didn't leave Kunark until I was level 30 and even then I was disappointed by other zones and returned to Kunark to EXP. I was still in my quested armour til level 51 :p . A lot of people will say don't play an Ikky cuz they cannot use a JBB but its not like I could ever afford one until I was level 55+ anyways and by then its usefulness was fading fast. Oh and a tip if you make an Ikky, put starting points into Stamina!<br />
<br />
I hope this helps,<br />
<br />
Cheers,</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Eilderts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I play a fairly well equipped Ikky Sham, but if I had to start all over again I would choose one of these 2:<br />
<br />
Ogre OR Vah Shir<br />
<br />
My reasons: <br />
Against the rest:<br />
-Regen doesnt matter that much past 10<br />
-Barbs are like old-world kitties (old world= crap exp)<br />
-Snare necklace can lick my balls (I aint no pansy druid)<br />
-I dont got LoY<br />
-Kunark is just an inferior Luclin...though good stuff does drop<br />
<br />
For Ogre:<br />
-Can you say no stun? Wow I wish iksars had this. With ac bonus it would be definately the best race.<br />
-Intimidating/stupid look is good for roleplay<br />
-Can get a Allize Volew (we love zilla backwards) neck item with affliction efficiency 1 at lvl 5 (wow, very nice for broke newbs)<br />
-JBB<br />
<br />
For Kitty Kat:<br />
-Moon exp= bad ass<br />
-Newb quests are VERY good, which is nice since ur starting from scratch<br />
-I find it humorous to have a cat with a pet dog. Dont know why.<br />
-JBB<br />
<br />
Although Ikky is 3rd choice. Regen is aight (I mean I got the spell &quot;Regenerate&quot; and &quot;Bearform&quot; right now, it all adds up pretty nicely), plus kurns was a tight place to lvl. AC bonus is pretty cool. With superior (self-earned) equipment, I have slightly better unbuffed AC and HP than my friends 38 troll shm with my lvl 32 ikky shm :P. I also have more mana (201 wis with c3, plus some mana stuff).<br />
<br />
Also, to maximize your cash and item income, I would hunt in :<br />
1-5) Newb area<br />
6-24) PC<br />
24-34) HHK<br />
34-39) OT or JP basilisks (my fav)<br />
39-44) EW ulthorks<br />
44-49+) DL?<br />
<br />
bah anyways, hope I helped. Also, if you lvl fast enough, you can get ahead of everybody and solo HHK guards at 34 for unbelievable money. Then u gotta wait for the l33t players to start selling Fungi Tunics, JBB's, and REIF's :P.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Started a bst in shar vahl and got all the newbie armor for fun -- the most recently added newbie armor tends to be the best.

<br />
I'm not an ogre, I'm level 63, and I don't really have a problem with getting stunned.  *shrug*  <br />
<br />
I'd love to have iksar regen, too - but exp penalties just kinda piss me off.<br />
<br />
If you don't pick the powergaming choice - think of it as a personality test.  People react differently to barbarians than they do to ogres.  It's just human nature.  Who doesn't think &quot;punt&quot; whenever they see a gnome?  Think of what you'll get the biggest kick out of portraying yourself as.  That'll make a lot more difference, unless you'll be isolating yourself for the most part.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For a NEW Server with no high level Players.   I woul dhave to Pick Vah-Shir, here's why. These are just as they appear to me.. not weighted in Value.<br />
<br />
1.  0% XP Modifier.<br />
2.  Sneak/Safefall<br />
3.  Starting City is in Luclin where Travel is Easier and XP is better<br />
4.  Vah Shir have some nice Racial Specific Tradeskill quests, plus, you're levelling up in the places needed to farm to tailor Acrylia armour, which, on a new Server is nice Armour to get your hands on.<br />
5.  Vah Shir are AGNOSTIC - This makes Factioning easier should you choose to Faction to gain Entrance to other Cities not normally open to Barb/Froglok (Good Shamans)<br />
6.  GOOD Faction in Halas.<br />
7.  Can use JBB<br />
8.  Easier starting Faction for when you do your Epic than if you were Troll/Ogre/Iksar<br />
<br />
<br />
The only downside I can see is the &quot;No Snare Neck&quot; arguement and to be honest.. Playing a Barb Shaman for 3 years, I never missed not having it much.<br />

<br />
Orges don't get stunned from behind either... only when they are moving.  I rerolled my 47 shammy barb to an ogre and never looked back.  It makes a huge difference not being able to be stunned.  And regen means nothing, when I started my new shaman I sold the fungi as soon as I got torpor.  No way Ikky regen could have stood in the face of 15hp/tick and I still got rid of it.  If you want a racial advantage that will even make a difference in the end game play ogre.  But really there is no difference in the end game so play whatever you think looks coolest.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">I agree with the ones that say to play what you think you will like best.  I have played a barbarian for 4 years now and no matter what bonuses ever other race has I would never want to change.<br />
<br />
Its not all about min/maxing for everyone, I want to be a dashing hero, not some fat ugly slob or scaley lizard, I dont care if they can get stunned or not or have massive regen, so I died a few more times than them when I was growing up, never once did I say 'gee, if I had stun immunity I could have lived.'<br />
<br />
I also had nearly no faction issues (not as big a deal now) but I cant imagine having to wait outside and beg someone else to buy something for me, or get hacked down by some guard that was nearby and suprised me or whatever, much of the differences and bonuses balance out in one form or another.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Ogre &gt; than all. Why? Becasue we are pure of heart, and must therefore be victorious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Troll that worships Inno.  For the Shaman class, regen will always matter.  Even in the end game.  Troll can use JBB, Iksar can't.  If you are choosing Iksar because of the regen, take troll.  The AC bonus is really moot post 60.<br />
<br />
PoP has eliminated starting zones.  I've take a couple of twinks to FoB to level up.  Once you learn the roaming guards pattern, avoiding them is a piece of cake.<br />
<br />
If I had to do it all over, I'd pick troll and wouldn't care less about the exp penalty because the regen is worth it that much as far as I'm concerned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Kreskk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Its really a debatable subject that will never be agreed upon what race makes the best shaman.. but with the scenario spelled out by the original poster Iksar is the best choice to go with.<br />
<br />
They cant use a JBB, but with no twinks, no guilds, no other people etc.. you may not ever see on anyway. Infact there is a lot of high armor you may not see aswell, in which case the iksar bonus armor makes up for a bit of that AC.. I know i have 752 AC at level 40 with Bronze Bigadine chest, arms, legs that i got from bandits in Paludal caverns.. heck banded is better then what i have, and thats still some High AC i have. Plus only them and trolls get regen. Ogres arent worth your time since your not doing PVP or any uber guilds or soloing dragons and such, stun wont make a big difference if played correctly, i know it never has for me :P<br />
<br />
But the most important factor is the way we look... Iksar are way cool looking. I mean have a look at an ogre... are you worried about pure numbers here? and a troll for that matter too.. that is YOUR character.. I wouldent be caught dead looking like either of those two races. If you even consider any personal Role playing aspect.. would you want to play a ogre/troll &quot;Me so dum, me barsh u bad!&quot;. and look at the troll and ogre women.. lmao... that should make your choice for you right there.. ick</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Fulgrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">I'd play a mage or a necro</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">If you would make a mage or necro, you'd end up duoing with a shammy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Tavish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Since your only asking about the 3 I would say kitty for the natural sneak and safefall ability.<br />
<br />
If you'd rather have the snare necklace for soloing then I would definately go Troll, plus the natural regen is kind of nice.<br />
<br />
If you change your mind and want to expand on races, the froggies have a natural regen also and from what I've seen level pretty fast. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">I'd like to throw you some advice (although you may be aware of this already)...Ogres 'no frontal stun' ability dose -not- guarantee a 'no interrupt' ability. Its not something Id base the choice on as I've played this game for 4+ years and have -never- ever...ever been killed solo due to a stun. <br />
<br />
The perception of the 'leetness' of Ogres non frontal stun attribute came from the warrior class...who DO benefit greatly from not losing aggro due to a delay in their dps/taunt factor.<br />
<br />
Although, as a troll I wouldn't recommend picking trolls based on the snare necklace either /shrug. IMO trolls/Ogres are the front runners when it comes from a technical powergaming standpoint, but in the end I agree with the notion you should pick what ever race you think -looks- the coolest. :)<br />
<br />
just my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Bahamute</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">go with troll. JBB regen slam and they are fun to play. I went barbarian as most do and I wish I had made a troll.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since the author of the post is brand new in respects the Vah Shir maybe both fun and perfect for him.<br />
<br />
As for what race is most powerful I would argue Troll.<br />
The power of Regen is no joke (and on the /side snare is a nice toy)<br />
For example I regen without the use of any regen potion 91 hp a tick STANDING.  It is entirely possible, I just don't want to be called out on how I do it, in fear that something which happened after last patch will be fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Sarania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">&quot;There is one point about Vah Shir that is often overlooked now. Travel is very restricted until about level 25 or so.&quot;<br />
<br />
Not to flame you too hard but it's not really that hard to get through paudal using sneak. I did it all the time at level 10. Besides you dont really need to travel out side of Shadeweaver's, Paudal, and Hollowshade until you are about 30+. <br />
<br />
I did most of my leveling as an untwinked kitty shaman in those places. I only left when I got bored of them. <br />
<br />
Besides trying to Sneak your way through Paudal is like the old days of running from Freeport to Qeynos through Kithicor at night. It's kinda scary but It's always a challenge.<br />
<br />
<br />
Warg and Veggi have made alot of good points about Vah Shir. The citizenship quest is very good to do cause it gets you to level 2 without having to fight a single mob in about 10 minutes and ends with a decent cloak at level 50+. The only pain of it is having to do the Sonic Wolf Bane quest and having idiots always screwing up hollowshade.</div></div><hr />
