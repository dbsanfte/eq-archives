<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ruuka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It has been said before and needs to be said again : Any spells that cost 60K or 100K are too darned rare. <br />
<br />
I'm lvl 59 and have been watching to buy spells for last 2 levels. I have been looking for Malo, Pox and Torpor. The only spell I have seen for sale in a month are Malo for 60K. <br />
<br />
Prices will never drop as long as only one spell comes up for sale in a Blue Moon. There should be enough drops that you can get it yourself or have 2 or 3 or 4 up for sale at any given time. <br />
<br />
More and more, I believe VI has a &quot;Let's screw with the player&quot; attitude. An attitude I hope comes back and bites them where it hurts when they release future products.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ruuka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks sweetheart. And get a job you pathetic farmer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Khayla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm in the same boat also, as are many shamans out there.  <br />
<br />
I've never seen torpor for sale, malo twice for 40k.  I was lucky to have Pox drop for a guildmate in Seb who passed it to me, so I'm 1 for 3 in 3 months.<br />
<br />
I've given up trying to understand their reasoning for making our spells so hard to attain :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>UbercyrusForbeis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Our spells are that hard to get for one simple reason.<br />

They are awesome. I hear my guild necro bitching every so often that our dots are better, our debuffs are better and because of topor our mana regen is better. And he's right! With those spells, we are one of the best classes in game.<br />
<br />
If these spells were just handed to us, we'd have a million shaman morons out there... we'd be the new druids. /shutter<br />
<br />
Yeah, it sucks to try and camp it... or buy it, but most of the shaman I've know that are true shaman (aka the guys and gals that don't whine and give up to play an alt when they don't get Topor or Malo at lvl 60) end up getting a copy after a while.<br />
<br />
Kinda SoE's survival of the fittest...<br />
<br />
As far as &quot;Let's screw with the player&quot; and it biting them... EQ reached the 100,000 users online mark back in July of this year, better than 2 years after the game's initial release, I don't think they're having any major customer retintion issues.</div></div><hr />

That was like 1 week after they released the Bazaar, most of those players were bazaar bots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ruuka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Sorry all it is pretty pointless to complain about spell drops at this point. I was just looking at the enormity of farming plat or spells or winning the Lottery for a drop and it got to me. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">solo sebilis bugs=1k+ pp per hour, don't need torpor or malo to do it... 60-100 hours later... and presto, torpor<br />

sadly this is probably the best option for most people</div></div><hr />

Malo for 1k<br />
Torpor for 25k<br />
Pox for 20k<br />
<br />
Now 60 and hapily using all of them.<br />
<br />
Did have torpor drop off a dragon that was killed a few days before I dinged 60 which would have been nice if I didn't already have it banked but oh well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Point to your post?  To gloat and brag?  Dont know what server your on, but malo is about 40k and torpor about 60k-ish, IF they are ever for sale on Quellious (been looking for them since October, and NOT ONE COPY for sale since that time).<br />
<br />
So again, what was your point?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Seefar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have no idea what the drop rate for these spells is, but as an up and coming shaman I would love to see them drop more and prices go down.  What Torporless, Maloless shaman wouldn't?  Right now they sell for 60-80k ea on my server.<br />
<br />
There is a HUGE area between incredibly rare and common, not just two extremes.  If the current drop rates were doubled or tripled these spells would still be extremely rare.  So with some careful planning, it is possible to increase the drop without completely unbalancing the class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Numzan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">hey its a challenge to get all your spells...... I dont agree they should be put into vendor mode though.<br />
<br />
I agree 60k for a player like me, means to sell of everything i have 4 times over for 1 spell. Maybe 10-20k for a lower end player like myself seems more challenging to me. 60k plus for a spell is almost impossible to maintain.<br />
<br />
I dont care about drop rates, and i dont think you should either... play it the way the rest of us do..... its more of a challenge.<br />

<br />
I'm confused by what you mean here because it seems like you contradicted yourself.  One the on hand you say that the spells should be around 10-20k each, but then you say the drop rates should not change and we should all just play the game as it is.  Huh?  The only way the prices of these spells will go down is if there are more of them dropping.  <br />
<br />
We all MUST play the game by the rules of the game designers.  We have no choice in the matter if we choose to play.  However, at times, there are issues that a large majority of a particular class agree need to be changed.  When this happens, if there is enough unity on the issue and enough feedback to SOE, occassionally changes will be made that strengthen a class.  <br />
<br />
The only way to find out what these issues are is to discuss them in forums like this and find out what the majority opinion is.  This issue has come up several times, and the general consensus seems to be that there needs to be some adjustment of the drop rates on these spells.  <br />
<br />
Currently there is a mini Torpor spell on test that may be a compromise of sorts to the drop-rate issue.  It can only be speculated whether this new spell was designed because of the issues over the Torpor drop rate or if SOE previously had plans to introduce this spell.  Either way, it may be a step to helping out those of us who just can't scrape together 60-80 or sometimes 100k plus for this spell.<br />
<br />
The game is quite a challenge and at the moment 20k seems just as impossible as 60k.  I don't think I will be seeing those spells in my arsenal any time soon either way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry if it sounded like I was bragging, didn't mean it to sound that way.<br />
<br />
The point that I wanted to make was you can get the spells with a little work, not necissarily camping 1000 juggs hoping that it drops. Camp stuff with higher money drops and buy them. It'll probably be a lot quicker. I raised the spell money doing item sales and worked as hard as I could to find someone that was selling at a reasonable price. The only one that dropped in my lap was Malo because someone in the bazaar had no idea what it was worth. <br />
<br />
I play on Torv, at any given time there is usually a torpor or malo up in bazaar but at a rather high price. I just got out the word to as many people as I could of what I was looking for and eventually someone got back to me like hey torpor just dropped off this dragon, want it for 25k? Didn't even know the person that asked me, he had just seen that I was looking for it. <br />
<br />
Personally I just find that easier then camping mobs that have a really lousy drop rate. <br />
<br />
Should the drop rates be raised? I say hell yes. I was on a gore raid for the first time ever the other day and she drops a completely worthless lvl 59 druid treeform spell that no one would even use. Its crap like that that should be removed from droptables that keeps people from getting malo/torpor/pox. Even with what I did pay for the spells I wouldn't care if they all showed up on a vendor tomorrow for 10pp each. It wouldn't help me know but it would help others I know that are oracles without malo ect. <br />
<br />
Hell on day of the gore raid a prophet was in GD asking if he could buy pox if it dropped. That show the problem with the drop rates enough?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>GroutRavenPaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Do what I did, get your favorite 5 friends and go farm the Seb Protector til he drops Malo and Torpor for you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How many people would suffer thru levels 1 - 59, however?  How many items in the game have been around for 2 years and keep going up in price?  There may be the odd adjust like when ODS got the focus ability added to it but how many other items have not changed and still gone up?<br />
<br />
How many weapons were &quot;uber&quot; in RoK and are junk now?  What's the cost of the best weapons from that expansion?  How many people even use a weapon from that era on their main characters?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Reading some of these posts I wonder how many people have actually gotten their own spells and how many just got them given to them by their guild.<br />
<br />
I have been farming 60 spells.  I've now gotten at least one copy of every 60 spell that drops except for six.  Two of the spells I haven't seen drop are Torpor and Malo.  The others are one Druid , one Wizard and two Cleric spells.<br />
<br />
If I was an enchanter I'd be well pleased: every droppable 60 chanter spell has dropped for me at least 3 times.  They sell for peanuts in the bazaar: they are THAT common.<br />
<br />
I have now bought Malo: but only by farming so many 60 spells for other classes that I could buy it for 60k (and no Kunark spell from any other class costs anywhere near that much on my server - the nearest is Sunstrike for 40k).  I'll get Torpor as well eventually: but I have little doubt that it will be by buying it (server price around 75k): I won't see it drop.<br />
<br />
I only kill GWs so perhaps other drop tables are kinder to shamen.  But no matter: the bazaar prices show that with the combined drop rates from all drop tables in the game Shaman spells are a LOT rarer than ALL other class'es 60 spells.  <br />
<br />
I read some shammies saying go to VP to get shammy spells.  That may be good advice, but why should we have to go to a zone like that to get them while a chanter can buy all his and have change left from 1k pp?<br />
<br />
This is ridiculous and it ought to be corrected.  In fact it ought to have been corrected 2 years ago.</div></div><hr />

Your necro friend is an idiot, none of that is true, not at any level.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Sanctifier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Heres how you get malo/torpor:<br />
1. get friends in a guild, and farm guardian wurms<br />
2. hoard up large amounts of pp, buy it<br />
3. get VP key, get a group of friends, farm guardian wurms inside VP<br />
4. do alot of druid epics for fay and hope it drops<br />
5. kill harla dar in WW and hope it drops<br />
<br />
stop crying, whaa, malo/torpor 60k!  Just do it.  Yes they are overpriced, because they are powerful.  Take you all of one week to farm lodizal, sell the shells at 10k each and get your malo/torpor.  If you are near 60, you probably are not soloing your entire EQ career, and if you are, your best bet is number 2 :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Islowem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">*Quote* 4. do alot of druid epics for fay and hope it drops <br />
<br />
Spawned Faydedar only drops the druid piece, you must be thinking of the weekly Faydedar.<br />
<br />
You have better chance of getting malo/ torpor with helping the millions of clerics with Royals in Chardok, then you would helping druids.<br />
<br />
Slow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Servilous in EJ dropped Malo the last two times we killed him. Find a warrior of Pally that needs help with his epic and kill two birds with one stone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Wolfborn01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">whats torpors???<br />
<br />
61 and still haven't got it yet don't know if i'll bother</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Although the drop rates on the high end shaman spells are ridiculously low, these days they are a LOT easier to get. I mean, now that PoP is well established and many players are in the 61 - 65 range, it has made certain things that used to be the domain of the uberguild far more accesible to smaller guilds.<br />
<br />
Mobs such as Severilious for example drop Torpor quite regularly, and lets face it they are not that hard these days - sure, you aint gonna solo them, but 18 people level 57 - 61 can drop Severilious without too much trouble. Surely it isn't impossible to find a guild that can field 3 strong groups? <br />
<br />
Incidentally, this is part of the reason why the spells are so rarely sold - because killing Kunark dragons is a &quot;guild raid&quot; type activity, any extra copies of the spells tend to be jealously hoarded by the guild for shaman who have not yet hit 60.<br />
<br />
My guild is not uber, but we can take Severilious (we still get our asses handed to us by Gorenaire). Severilious is what we do when other mobs are camped, and as far as I know we have 3 copies of Torpor on our spell mule waiting for our shaman to level to 60 - we wouldn't sell them for anything, but it don't mean they arent there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Chamelius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Going to have to agree with quanit, you and that necro are missing a few screws if you think shaman dots are better than necro ones.<br />
<br />
They have more lines, they are more mana efficient, they dont draw aggro nearly as much as ours as their dots build in damage as the ticks pass, and they dont break root so they are much better for root rotting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I really wonder if its true rarity or just percieved rarity and &quot;windfall&quot; mentality....on Karana just about every upper level zone is perma-camped by one guild or another (and trust me on this there are LOTS of uberish guilds here)....Copies of Torpor and Malo are almost never seen in Bazaar and never on the trade channel...the last time I saw a copy of Torpor for sale in Bazaar it was 120k, hows that for a rude awakening for a currently un guilded shaman with no epic and around 3k in the bank?<br />
Malo? forget about it, I have seen people auctioning WTB Malo for long long time, so long now that most simply just skip it and move on to the 63 (?) one and save their cash.<br />
Avatar? last time I saw it for sale it was 15k and that is just for plain Avatar.<br />
Heck last time I saw Voice of the Berserker it was 35k and Pox was 25k this morning.<br />
Do a search for ANY other spell at that price range...you will find only one thing about them in common...they are all shaman spells.<br />
I just think that people have for so long had the perception that they are rare and valuable that no matter how many copies are floating around in guild banks that they will never trickel down to less fortunate souls.<br />
There are very few windfall items these days, shaman level 60 spells and Windblade being good examples of this.<br />
I am not saying that Torpor and Malo should become vendor spells, it would make the class trivial then....Torpor turns an already efficient class into a monster, but for crying out loud, any spell that costs 120k from other PC's has a problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Yea Karana prices are through the roof :( One mistake I made was hunting mostly in PoP zones from 54-57. Yea levels came fast there but the loot is crap. I'm now back in seb where I can make 500pp-1k+ a night and just hope by the time I'm 60 I have half the cash saved so I can just solo the rest :) Will turn on AA to 50% once I hit 58 to slow down the process. <br />
<br />
I'm just thankful for the pok book in cabilis, makes the seb run very easy after getting a  KEI.</div></div><hr />
