<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">In the Northeast corner of FV there is a giant camp... three giants (Forest Giant Arbors and the occasional Forest Giant Verdant), on a nice short spawn. There are tons of wanderers a few levels lower than the giants- just about all warrior types. I started there around 40 on the wanderers, and started in on the giants when I hit 43 or so. At 45 (when my JBB started working) I was easily be able to hold the entire camp. <br />
<br />
There is a zoneline 30 seconds from the camp, there is a bank/city in the zone, and the giants drop very nice loot (forest loops, lumberjack caps, straw belts, minor gems, tunics that sell to vendors for 60pp, etc.) Wanderers (frogs and dogs) drop regular stuff, couple plat and the occasional bronze/fine steel weapon. <br />
<br />
Experience is outstanding here- I'd go hunt in Guk, Karnors, Maidens, whatever... but I always kept coming back.  I was making a yellow bar every hour to hour and a half- amazing solo experience that kept working all the way to 48.   Also made a few thousand plat along the way- nice!  Heck, even though the giants are mostly light blue now (at 49), I'm tempted to stay a little longer... I'll bet I'd still get a yellow bar every hour and a half to two hours or so.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">any advice on breaking the camp?  I hunted Giants in WW back in my 30s but couldn't keep up with the spawns, and I couldn't break the camp. (I'm talking about a 3 giant spawn in a clearing East of the Fort).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You'll never get all three, but chances are you'll get two.  I would just cast whatever spell I was pulling with, wait for both to come, then cast root.  One stays, I drag the other to my camp spot (15 seconds away by the swamp of no hope zoneline.)  Being able to take a punch helps here in case you get a resist.  :)<br />
<br />
Of course, you could always just pull with root.  Sometimes the other one will come, sometimes they'll all just sit there staring at you.  I recommend /rude'ing them mercilessly until root breaks, or maybe drop a DoT on the non-rooted one to hurry him along.  :)<br />
<br />
I was able to do the camp in the 30's, but I got much better experience doing wanderers.  One more thing- if you get a Verdant (in your 30's), you're in trouble.  Either run for the zone or prepare for a loooong battle (I killed him in the upper 30's once just to prove I could, but I was left with very little health and mana... kind of like my recent battle with the $#%@#! &quot;ravishing dvorlag&quot;.)<br />
<br />
&quot;A ravishing dvorlag adheres to the ground&quot;<br />
&lt;half a second goes by&gt;<br />
&quot;Your Root spell has worn off&quot;<br />
<br />
BLEH !!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kome_battle_shm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This fort is a great camp,YES :)<br />
<br />
Pull with roots, the other one not rooted will follow you far away from the fort. (Kunark / aggros range : mobs don't forget you BUT don't follow you forever...)<br />
<br />
<br />
Verdant :  time to go bank :p</div></div><hr />

At 52 now, and wishing I had a similar spot at this level.<br />
Using OOT, but it just isn't as nice.<br />
<br />
Take care,<br />

Is started out hunting Drolvargs and Froggies in the flat area just south from the camp pulling into the valley where no roamers come. At 43 I could solo very nicely there. Even better when my War buddy showed up.<br />
Giants then became the staple diet from about 44. Level seems important with the root resists, getting significantly less as I increased levels. I parked dog at a little alcove South east of the camp. No roamers came that close and I never seemed to get any adds.<br />
I'd pull one by rooting the other (the third one at the back won't aggro). THen drop a slow on it while I tanked with dog as backup.<br />
I'd use the posion dot and that was it.<br />
At 42-43 I'd hold only the two front ones. Then I could handle the third in spawn sequence.<br />
Loot I thought was really good. I was there for around 3.5 levels and I made about 3.5k. Loads of foremans tunics, hammers, etc<br />
And I think 5 forest loops dropped (although i didn't take them all) Even the froggies dropped some nice FS.<br />
All in all it's a nice steady, peacefull camp. Only broken by the sporadic OOCs for Qwinn (who I nailed plenty times )<br />
With an easy zone out and banking in zone its handy too.<br />
And if you're bound at firepots its only a couple of zones away from Cabilis and the only Kunark firepot.<br />
Watch out for the Verdants though. THey were tough cookies at the lower levels, resisting like crazy and delivering a good pounding.<br />
<br />
