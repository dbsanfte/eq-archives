<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vishik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hiya.. few weeks ago I was doing the eruds x'ing part of the epic. When i gave the opaque gem to ooglyn, and went to follow her into the water, she was supposed to dissapear right? well i went to the loc she was supposed to be spawned at and she wasnt there.. so i redid that step but with a tracker friend the next time. she was still not at the same spot, however my friend tracked the NPC's that she is supposed to spawn... but somehow they seemd to despawn ..... This was on XEV server, and im mainly just looking for some info on this part from someone who has done it recently (within past 3 weeks) so i can go ahead and finish the quest :)    also if i did anything wrong please let me know as that will help as well</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's been a long time, but she is supposed to appear and then various spirits will spawn and despawn.  It's the test of patience, so make sure you wait for correct spirit.<br />

Belgar has an excellent quest write up that can be found here:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vishik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">on the guide it says wait at that spot even if she not there.. but when my friend tracked her we found her but in a spot way far from the island just swimming there... and when i hail her the only thing she says is - <br />
 Ooglyn says 'Ooooh, it you, shaman . Me's been waitin for you cuz our frenz say you comin an need<br />
da test. So's I gib you da test. Hmm, now where me put it? Ooglyn been waiting for sign for so long<br />
dat me forget where me put test. Keep your eyes out for sign while me look for test. Oh, hey,<br />
shaman, they gib you gem? I need dat gem, please, heheh.<br />
    like when i first hailed her.. would u recommend that i still stay at the loc -1600, +4200 and wait for the other NPC's to spawn?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Test of PATIENCE.<br />
<br />
Since you can't be bothered to read the link:<br />
<br />
After Ooglyn finishes casting spells, she starts to run away. Follow her until she disappears into the water. Then run out over the water (make sure you have levitation and some sort of underwater breathing on) and head to loc -1600, +4200.<br />
Dive down about 10 feet into the water and cast your pet spells. Then proceed to the bottom of the ocean and wait patiently as this test suggests.<br />
<br />
Patiently wait at that location. Five different spirits or Heyokah will eventually spawn. Be patient. Your goal is to receive &quot;a broken arrow&quot; from Abe, and a &quot;gem&quot; from the Greater Spirit. As such, only the conversations with Abe and the<br />
Greater Spirit are presented here. Conversations with the others is merely &quot;fluff&quot;. Did I mention patience? Several have reported that using Invisibility to Animals while waiting will keep the sharks from attacking you.<br />
<br />
Others have recommended staying levved above the water to avoid the sharks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">40 mins for the entire thing, ran like clockwork for me and IV animals works fine against the sharks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Only note with being lev'd above the water, the visibility in the water stinks, and if you're not where you can see the earlier folks, it is completely possible to miss Abe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Heeoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I did the test of patience last week on Xev and everything worked fine.  Boring as hell, long wait for those clowns to spawn but they all finally popped and I am now running around with the shield of falsehood.  <br />
<br />
Boots up next!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Seanus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">And the test of patience is just that... waiting for the right mob to appear without dying to the sharks.  &lt;b&gt;Invis versus animals&lt;/b&gt; works great, but I found I had to drop it to talk with the NPCs.  I died my two times trying this... first to a shark halfway through the test, and the other just after I got the gem (dang shark timed it nicely).<br />
<br />
Has anyone tried to do anything more with this broken arrow?   I'm thinking there is some quest associated with it, but the dialogue doesn't give me much clue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Nope, broken arrow is a red herring.  Generally, for EQ quests you get one item and then you're done.  The Test of Patience seems to have been designed for shaman to talk to Abe, get the arrow from Abe and say &quot;Okay, done&quot; without waiting for the Spirit to show up and getting the correct quest piece (the gem).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>BryeLLe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">So it can be safely destroyed? I'm assuming it'd be easy (with a little patience) to get back...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yep, destroy it. You can always go back if to get a new one if needed, but it has been 2 years, and I don't see Verant putting in a use for it now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">can solo the sharks easily at 57, I did it at 54 I think with little problem....although my druid friend got eaten lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Seanus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Verant saying that 75% of the quests in the game have never been completed.  Now given that many of the quests result in junk (thinks back to Ivy quests) compared to todays drops, just where are these components, and how can I use them =).<br />
<br />
As has been said before though... it can easily be obtained again, and quite frankly I'm running out of inventory slots again...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">&quot;but I found I had to drop it to talk with the NPCs&quot;<br />
<br />
i had no problems here. i'd say a shark pats by every 5-10 mins, i just kept invis vs. animals up all the time.<br />
<br />
i did however waste a lot of time because abe spawned right on my fat ogre body so i couldn't see him until i switched views :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Moonhaawk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Did this by myself at 32.  No need to follow her.  Just go to -1600, +4200 with lev on.  Cast Invis vs Animals, and take lev off.  Change point of view and look for the spawns.  I could not see them in normal view.  Click and hail.  I think I missed the first 2 spawns, but, got all my stuff.  My next stop is Mistmoore.  I want those boots!!!<br />
