<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wampaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone had much experience in POG? Im trying to talk my guide into going for some armor drops. Its sounds great. No faction, gems, or pitiful armor drops in kael to worry about. I know the armor doesnt drop as often as hate, but who cares when it is so much better. Im willing to mess up my tunare faction for this good armor. I was also wondering what it looks like. Is it that blue armor I see high level shamies wearing? How bad are the drops? How hard is POG to break? Any info or advice would be apreciated :) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Smylee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not to rain on the parade, but PoG armor is RARE. ie. expect to do a whole bunch of &quot;west of the river&quot; clearings before you get 1 or more pieces. It is entirely common to wipe out all the easy mobs and get only 1 or 2 armor drops. East of the river the mobs are much harder, and have the chance of dropping BP/Greaves, but again, rare as heck. <br />
<br />
The blue armor you see is either the WW dragon stuff or Wolfcallers (skyshrine) armor. It's not too hard to get providing you have a couple of groups (well balanced) of lvl 60's. However, the PoG armor is still very nice, just rare. My PoG legs are the same colour as my fungi tunic (in new models on an ogre) and are, shamefully, seethrough. I get a lot of degrading comments cause of that reason :D.<br />
<br />
<br />
Breaking PoG isn't too bad, just get everyone to zone in invis, and run straight to the west wall from the zonein. More than likely invis will drop on someone, and the Protectors of Growth will be on them in about 30 sec's if they are kos. If invis sticks, run to the wall and get main tank to uninvis and wait for the 2 little pog's to come up and whack on em. Once engaged and agroed properly, start killing, and time their death so that you are ready in 26 minutes (i think) for their next spawn. The agro from across the zone so as soon as they pop, you'll know about it.<br />
<br />
Then just keep killing everything that moves. Simple :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Cleared the entire PoG today on the premise of Tunare popping (advise : DONT do this unless you know she is up ;p) drops were exceedingly rare.<br />
<br />
My advise , avoid like the plague, PoG is without a doubt the most dull and unrewarding zone in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've been part of numerous PoG clearings to kill Tunare (and just to farm armor as well) and shaman armor is very rare.   You are MUCH better off killing in Kael for the same armor.  Takes a much smaller raid, faster repops, and a lot less of a pain.  Just start your clearing from the EW zoneline and kill all the way to the arena, you'll easily have the faction that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>mojoejojo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I love my POG BP.  The Sta buff proc is nice and saves quite a bit of mana, and I LOVE the AC.  Now to get some greaves....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">PoG is ok, if that is all your guild can manage.  You will get armor here, just a matter of time and pressure.  Also good gem drops are present.  Lotsa BDs and stuff to get yer guild resist gear equipped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I hated POG and thankfully my guild only raided there a few times before realizing that Kael was a much quicker source of same caliber armor (as well as stuff for paladins, druids and rangers!!).  I went to 5 or so POG raids and got boots, I got a full set of Thurg (minus bp) in a about a week or so of Kael arena raiding.<br />
<br />
And of course, after hunting in PoG I have that annoying guy in BW chasing me all the damn time, not to mention those annoying greenie mobs in DC.<br />
<br />
What I really hated about POG were those every half hour spawning, sensing KOS individuals from anywhere in the zone, pretty resistant, half goat freaks.  They made CR fun fun fun!</div></div><hr />

A tip for dealing with Telin Darkforest swiftly . . . Root.<br />
He's not MR at all.  I wanna solo him sometime just to say I did.  He does hit fairly hard tho, might be a good challenge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Lindorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Agree with all who considre this zone pretty unrewarding for Shami's. In 7 raids I did not see a piece of Shami armor drop. However, I must say that on one of the raids I missed a BP dropped and it was a gfood piece.<br />
<br />
As others have noted the armor in Kael has same stats and is much easier to get. In addition you will move the CoV faction that you need for SS armor from the HOT. <br />
<br />
PoG's are a real PiA and the named are not always worth the fight. The good news, however, is that you do not need a stone or wiz to get you there and though the pogs continue to be a problem, cr was much easier in PoG than any other plane.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Iscadia Starhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Doesn't fighting on the PoG tank your faction in both Kelethin and Felwithe?  I know there's no real reason to go there...but I do so love my elven trail mix....  :D <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The only faction changes I've noticed due to my adventures in POG:<br />
<br />
1) Can still go to Felwithe, but can't go to cleric guild, bank is fine<br />
2) Can still go to Kelethin, can't go to druid/ranger guild, bank is fine<br />
3) Can still go to FV, supposedly there is a KOS mob on the docks someplace.  I spent a lot of time in FV after POG and never had any problems<br />
4) There is a blue to 60 ranger NPC in BW that is always chasing me, he's never killed me<br />
5) There are green mobs as you zone into DC and turn right and head to KK, they are just annoying<br />
6) Lose faction with POG, of course (and it appears non recoverable)  Clerics/druids who worship Tunare need to keep this faction to take advantage of several nice POG quests  (a high elf cleric friend tried to do some kind of muffin quest to repair her faction and was unable)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I hate PoG.  You become KoS with a quarter of the NPC's in the game (quickly too) and nothing ever drops.<br />
<br />
I did manage to fix my faction with everyone but that bitch Tunare:<br />
<br />
Kill orcs in crushbone until Pandos Flintside in West FP no longer hates you so much he'd carve through his own mother just to get at you.  You will need to kill A LOT of orcs.  <br />
<br />
Once he's dubious, start feeding him muffins.  Four stacks of four muffins each and you'll get 16 faction hits each time with all those Tunare lovers.  I fed him backpack after backpack of muffins.  It takes a ton of them, but at least they are cheap.       <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Eoin MacManus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Things that won't like you after about 4 kills in Plane of Growth:<br />
<br />
1) Tunare druids and rangers (Soldiers)<br />
2) Tunare pallies and clerics (Clerics)<br />
3) Tunare<br />
4) Tunare's little no armor dropping biotches</div></div><hr />
