<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kazlaaz Bonedust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well I searched and didn't see anything about this and the Boston FF is coming up soon. So, out of our shamans, who's going?<br />
<br />
I'll be there, although I'm not signed up for the actual FF event, I'm staying in the same hotel during that time. Half the reason I'm going is to see David Bowie, hehe.<br />
<br />
Who else is planning on attending?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'll be there. I'm a local.<br />
<br />
Planning on dragging as many people to the Black Rose as possible (excellent local irish bar if not a hair on the touristy side)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mazirus Slaymaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">most of my guild going... i get to sit and do nothing<br />
<br />
oh i should add insidious blood to sig lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jeddi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Greetings,<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Angryor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'll be there, Boston is local to me as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just had to cancel my registration.  I have a court date Monday after the Fan Faire in California.  I'd have to fly out on Friday night and then back on Sunday.<br />
<br />
It's doubly annoying because I'm moving to the Boston area 3 weeks after the FF.<br />
<br />
No Fan Faire for me.</div></div><hr />

I've never called you Legends scum, but I will bite you, only because that's what trolls do to barbarians.</div></div><hr />
