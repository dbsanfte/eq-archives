<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kolnie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just created a troll shaman and it's my first evil character, so my question is. where are they NOT KOS? I've heard that they can't go in any good cities, except Shar Val, but what about the other evil ones? I want to take her to the warrens to do the kobold molar quest in paineel, but I don't know how safe it would be to enter here or if she could trade in cabilis while hunting in the field of bone. Any help will be appreciated</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Callibis - KoS<br />
Oggok - safe<br />
Neriak - safe through the first zone of the city<br />
Paineel - dunno<br />
Shadowhaven - safe<br />
Overthere Fort - safe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You will start out KoS in both Cabillis and Paineel. Faction work can fix that though. You will probably have an easier time getting faction fixed in these two cities if you are a Cazic Thule worshipper. <br />
<br />
Hunt in the Warrens to fix faction with Paineel. Kill most Kunark Goblins and Sarnaks to fix faction with Cabillis Troopers. Turn bone chips in to the guy in Field of Bone (lots of them) to fix faction with the rest of Cabillis. <br />
<br />
Innoruuk worshippers will be more welcome in Neriak, and can do some nice uests there - primarily the snare necklace.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xelot Bloodseer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Also, in Shar Vahl, you have access to a shaman trainer, spell merchants, alchemy supplies, batwings, fishscales and the like. Pretty nice &quot;home away from home&quot; for any shaman. Great place to bind while fighting in Paladul Caverns.<br />
<br />
You can increase faction in SV by killing the Loda Kai in Shadeweavers. They're great XP up to ~15 on the front side and maybe 30 on the back side.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Safe in the Outpost in OT, KOS in FV.  Safe in Thurg and if you worship Zek you should be safe in Kael.<br />
<br />
You will be kos to both seru and katta.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You will start out KoS in both Cabillis and Paineel.  <br />
<br />
My Troll, a Cazic-Thule worshipping beastlord was not KOS in Paineel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kolnie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks for your help. My troll is Cazic -Thule worshipper so that means i can go to paineel then. I'll work on the others with time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Paineel is super easy to faction and the quickest way to faction Cabilis is to do the explorer knives quest in LoIO.  You are probably not KOS to bloodsabers below Queynos and can get around the entirety of Oggok, Neriak, OT, Thurg, SH, and SV.<br />
<br />
The places you will get killed that might surprise you as a new CT troll are: Kael, Katta, Seru, FP, and HHP.<br />
<br />
Just keep your distance from every mob and con it first.  As a rule, everything wants you dead and you should have SoW/invis up always.  Outside of quest completion, faction is meaningless for a gating class with the PoP expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If u have planes of power do NOT waste leveling time fixing faction u will NEVER need. With pop every city is the same. Need to bank yay freeport is near click zap hello Plane of knowledge bank spells and portals to everywhere. <br />
<br />
That si why faction does not mean anything. u never need to enter a city and if u must (epic or quest purposes u get inviz at 29 (rather late but betetr than never).<br />
<br />
If you do not have Planes of power then faction fixing is in order or what i recommend is that u buy pop. It's cheap and the transportation is worth the money u spend even if u never ever get flagged for any other planes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Good luck<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Even in the &quot;safe&quot; cities you may be kos to someone.  <br />
<br />
In Oggok, stay away from the chef (butcher?) near the bank.  He hates trolls.<br />
<br />
In Neriak you can go in to the second and third zones, but there will be some npc's you need to avoid.  Usually easy to avoid, but if someone has aggro'd guards to one of the guilds and got them out in the &quot;streets&quot; you may get a surprise.<br />
<br />
<br />
As stated above - With PoP transportation and access to a bank is easy.  With Luclin it was already pretty good.  And in Velious you start non-kos to dwarves and some giants (kos to Kromzek, non-kos to Kromrif, iirc)</div></div><hr />
