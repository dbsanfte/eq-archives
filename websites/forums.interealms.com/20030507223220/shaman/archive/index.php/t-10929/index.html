<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Daksa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi Everyone,<br />
<br />
This is my first post on these boards.  I started my shaman about 2yrs ago in order to play with my husband and have loved her ever since.  I am a in a small family guild and we do not do very many large raids.  I am able to save up plat and buy nice equipment if I have to.  At the moment I have about 10k to spend and really need to upgrade my equipment.  I was thinking of upgrading my legs but would appreciate any advice I can get from the wise shamans on this board.  Thank you in advance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>SkegBlackwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Jarsath Scale Leggings would be a free upgrade if you ever hunt In Karnor's. They are no drop and often people leave them rotting.<br />
<br />
Or maybe Sebilite Scale Legs or Brown Chitin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Racknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd go brown chitin, and get yourself a spider fur belt and a set of veluim fire wedding rings while you are at it.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mingh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Drop the howling harpoon in range, and get  Sarnak Prayer Beads 35 hp's or Goranga Idol. (sta + hp's)<br />
<br />
Brown chitin legs are quite cheap and good HP upgrade. (25 or 35 Hp's)<br />
<br />
Drop the Wis rings and get the 6ac 65 hp's to replace. 130hps<br />
<br />
Plat ruby veil can be replaced with death mask of the elysians. (cant remember the Hp's - around 35 or so).<br />
<br />
These alone will give you around an extra 250hp's and keep your wis at around 200.<br />
<br />
I run at 158 wis, and havent had a problem with running oom.<br />
<br />
Possibly a coterie cloak - 40 hp's or a hiero if you can stretch that far (75 hp's)<br />
<br />
Take a look at my profile for more ideas, id try to balance the wis/hp's to get better all round feel.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Sadly your at the same point a lot of shaman are at; leg slots that are both cost effective and worth wearing are far in between...pick up some Brown Chitin Legs, maybe Dragon Hide legs....with one you get a decent hit point/mana/wis jump, the other grants you a nice ac hit /shrug just depends on what you consider most important at this point in the game. Oh yeah forget Seb Scale legs, barbs cant wear em :(<br />
Ranged slot, I cant say a lot about, they are a PITA, I got a cheap Sandwich of Foul Smelling Herbs and decided to use that till I can find something better (really freaks people out on inspections)...Goranga Idol, Sarnak Prayer Beads, Beginners Magic Tome (simple PoP quest) are all solid choices.<br />
And I have to agree with the other posters, snag a few hit point/ac rings. I use a Djarns Amethyst Ring and a Shadel Bandit ring, but a pair of Velium Fire Opal rings do just fine as well.<br />
I try to balance a wis that I can live with (I try to aim for 195+ with bear form, I used a few AA to let me get that easier) with a ac that is easily buffable to the 1k mark (a huge world of difference) and a nice chunk of hit points.<br />
Good luck and have fun.<br />
<br />
Edit: Oh yeah where did you get that wonderful spear :D?????</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Daksa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thank you all so much for the info! I will be doing some shopping tonight!   I have been reading the other threads and do realize I need to get my hands on some HP gear instead of wisdom gear. <br />
<br />
P.S<br />
Helfdane I bought the wonderful spear.  :D  Actually I sold my Runed etched Iceworm fang for 200pp more than I bought the spear for! I got a great deal.</div></div><hr />
