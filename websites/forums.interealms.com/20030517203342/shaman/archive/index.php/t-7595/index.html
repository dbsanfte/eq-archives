<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey Folks!<br />
<br />
I just read about the Summoning Beasties Quest in Fungal Grove on Allakhazam's.  You can get the Vah Shir usuable Fungi Tunic by doing this.<br />
<br />
Here's Link:<br />
<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.hml?quest=1570<br />
<br />
Anyone here done this before?  And would a group of lv. 50-55 folks be able to handle the small bottle turn in?  <br />
<br />
I've never been in Fungus Grove before except to do faction quest with an alt...so I'm going to go back to Alla's and read about zone, but seems this quest  takes part in Bandit area...does anyone start out KOS here?  As a cat I have sneak and can get to indifferent for the purchase/turn in that way.<br />
<br />
And finally, if you have done it, juts how rare is the vest drop?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any feedback on this quest!!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">its extremely rare. So rare in fact, that i have only ever seen one on my server. If you do them enough, you will eventually get one, but i wouldnt get your hopes up on a quick drop. I have spent prolly over 100hours of time there and never seen one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Quanit Icebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I got one from that quest, first time and only time I ever did it.  In fact, didnt know it dropped there to begin with, was just going to help some friends.<br />
<br />
FWIW, one group 50-55 wouldnt have a chance I dont think.  You need two groups of people to do the quest, one for the top and one for the bottom.<br />
<br />
2 Balanced groups would work in the 54-60+ crowd, but I dont think 50 is gonna cut it on this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Podunk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have seen two drop in my single group encounters both going to people in my group that could use.  They retailed out at 70Kish if sold and we were all level 58-60 for it and a balanced group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Naw, we used to do the 3rd level (hardest) with a single group all the time. However we were all 60 at the time we were doing it. On quellious these are cheaper than Fungis, but not by much. Usually around 50-60k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Have done this a handful of times.  The small is definitely doable by a single group, but I'm thinking you'll want a couple key players (crowd control, for example) to be 60.  I think we held the small bottle with shaman, cleric, bard, ranger - all 60 - if that point of reference helps.<br />
<br />
I'm wearing the only vest I've seen drop on these trips, I think your chances are a LOT better than getting a regular fungi... and there are nice drops for other folks as well.  Not to mention I've never failed to have fun doing this, and the exp seems to fly.  But it always seems to when you're having fun.  :)<br />
<br />
Useful info - nobody starts KoS to the caveman caller folks you need to buy the rotgrub(?)... booze from.  You also don't start out KoS to the bandits, which I've avoided killing, since every time I get turned around in that zone, I end up in the middle of a bandit camp.  Mmmmm, getting backstabbed by 6 lvl 55+ critters.  Sounds fun...   Er, anyway, I don't think you need to go thru any bandit camps to get there.  If you hug the wall to your right as soon as you get out of the little settlement area, you can run there without invis if you choose.<br />
<br />
I've never seen anyone else doing this quest, which surprises me, because it's an absolute blast.  Another beautiful point of this spot is you can keep inviting people out.  Once you have too many, start another tunnel going.  It's the ever-expanding guild fun-nite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yep 1 group of 60's can do the medium or fast one.<br />
Enchanter is fairly handy to have...<br />
<br />
Other nice drops include a +25 DR/PR Helm (Tarmok Tribal Headband). Sorta like the SoL version of a Froggie Crown. Possibly quite handy for Cursed raids(?) or any raid where AE Disease/poison is hitting you.<br />
<br />
We did it a bunch of times over two weeks and got TWO Fungus patch vests! <br />
<br />
A nice AC 32 +10 wis +15 sta +15 svd shield drops too (Stretched Fungus Hide) as well as some other not bad stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hey All! Thanks for the feedback so far, much appreciated :) .<br />
<br />
I'm getting close to dinging 55 and think I'll wait to ding it before I lead some guildies to this spot.  The extra bearform wis +regen, Kragg buff, Chloro heal, and new pet looks like they might help a good bit.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, sounds like 2 groups definitely needed if most of us are under lv. 58, huh?  Have a very good lv. 55 chanter in guild I'm gonna try to rope in for CC.<br />
<br />
This just looks like so much darn FUN!!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">A nifty invis item for bards and rogues can drop in this quest if I remember correctly, Tiny Cloak of Darkest Night. Its no drop and great ammo to use to talk those classes into coming and doing the quest with you, bards especially love it for breaking charm.<br />
<br />
When we first encountered the quest we had two groups clearing from each end, works well. The easy setting may be too boring, you can stop the quest at any time and go and buy a different trigger if the pace isnt what you expected.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The fungi Patch vest sells for twice the regular fungi on Brell... very rare. A neat snare range item can drop too (swollen gland or something?).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Finally did this quest with my guild this weekend.  Was a blast and everyone wants to go back again.  We had 2-3 groups of lv. 50-56 folks, so was really a guild party.<br />
<br />
In 8+ hours we got 2 nice shields (I won one--yeah!):<br />
<br />
Stretched Fungushide Shield<br />
32 AC +15 Sta +10 Wis +15 Dis<br />
<br />
And two 2HB (30/45 +25 Dis. or so I think), a piercer, and tiny cloak.<br />
<br />
We did have two of the named mobs get &quot;pushed&quot; into the tunnel wall and lost them, just a caution.<br />
<br />
I like the new shield, was wielding a SBS for daily use.  I needed the AC upgrade and the WIS nice because I can replace some other pieces with lower AC now (Chok. Spaulders gotta go!!!).  Keeping the SBS in the bank though for the resists when they really needed.<br />
