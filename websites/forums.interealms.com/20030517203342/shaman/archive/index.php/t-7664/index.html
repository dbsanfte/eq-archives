<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Itzkul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just want you guys to take a look and tell me if you see anything that will help me out, i keep going oom in groups, solo I am fine on AC but I would like more HP. Any advice would be great. Here is my profile:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, the biggest easy to get hitpoint upgrade I see is a pair of velium fire opal rings.  That would add 130 hitpoints.<br />
<br />
Also:<br />
<br />
Neck - ivory collar from Chardok<br />
Ears - imbued ivory (player made)<br />
shoulders - obulus death shroud<br />
Wrist - sentry bracer, bracelet of fortitude (might be too expensive), dragon hide bracers from WW<br />
Mask - enshrouded veil (very cheap, adds 30 hitpoints, mana), crystal spider eyes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It really depends on the amount of cash you have to throw around, but playing conservative and adding to Glori's suggestions I would go with:<br />
<br />
Shoulders:  Tattered Mantle, Chodkai Hide Spaulders, Giant Scalemail<br />
Rings:  Jade Velium, Coldain quest, Golem Tear<br />
Head:  Kylong, Totemic <br />
Ears:  Electrum black sapphire<br />
Boots:  Iksar Hide, Tribal War<br />
Arms:  Giant Scalemail<br />
<br />
Just a few ideas to give you a bit more mana/hp.  JB armor is really something I would try to limit to a single slot if possible because it is pure AC and nothing else.  There are quite a few items from Luclin that might be cheap and fit the bill as well so search that Bazaar! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Nothing too expensive / uber<br />
<br />
Ears: Imbued golden ivory earrings (player made), Earring of Cleansing, Earring of Purity, Earring of twisted leaves, Forest loops (solo Arbor giants in FV).<br />
<br />
Neck: Ivory imbued collar<br />
<br />
Face: Crystal spider eyes<br />
<br />
Fingers: Velium fire opal rings (keep velium jasper for tradeskills), Shadel Bandit ring.<br />
<br />
Bracer: Coldainmilitary bracer (quest - need level 50+ friend for last fight), Bracer of Hammerfall<br />
<br />
Shoulders: Elder wolf hide, Tattered mantle<br />
<br />
Legs: Jarsarth (ask politely in KC - they rot on corpse in basement), Kromriff Military leggings (quest need level 50+ friend for final fight)<br />
<br />
Feet: Black fur boots (epic quest stage 2)<br />
<br />
Shield: Crystal Chitin (less AC than SBS, but good wis / mana)<br />
<br />
Range: Howling harpoon (ridiculously cheep for like 6wis 40mana in range), Ceremonial smudging stick (easy camp in hollowshade, but long).<br />
<br />
Edit: P.S. You say you are going OOM in groups, it is probably not a &quot;wisdom&quot; thing per se - your wisdom is quite ok for your level - you are probably trying to do too much. If all you do is slow mobs, haste and altuna tanks and regen / tuna self, you are doing your job - anything else is icing on the cake. Remember,  in a group, just because shaman can do everything, doesn't mean you must do everything!</div></div><hr />
