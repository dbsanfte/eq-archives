How do you remember level 34?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I remember running around in my totemic puppy kiting my first Hill Giant. :) was fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Durdend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I remember lvl34 as ALOT of pet kiting in Velious, until I wised up and hit a few older dungeons for great exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fethanin_ECI</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">lvl 34.... i think i was in the overthere grouping, then gained some intelligence and went to lguk.... I never was a soloing kinda person til mid 50's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Huge turning point -- you begin to get a taste of what real power is like.<br />
<br />
Your companion's fragile, but if you keep him alive he can be a nice little 30 point/tick dot.<br />
<br />
Bites for 30, kick/bash for 10.  Does a good job interrupting casters that'd be dark blue to you at that level.  He can dual wield (but doesn't do so on his own) so try to convince him to do so by giving him 2 rusty weaps.  This will &quot;force&quot; him into dual wielding.  The off-hand attack is pretty rare, tho... but it exists.<br />
<br />
Buff his dex, then give him a 1h velium weapon first (then trade before giving him a 2nd weap).  Think you'll be pleasantly surprised.<br />
<br />
You get a good DoT at 34:  Scourge (hits for 40, does 504 in 2:06)  Talisman of Tnarg will go a long way towards promoting your (and your companion's) survivability.<br />
<br />
I solo'd a LOT doing the root/rot and finish with melee methods.<br />
<br />
At this level, you can take the first couple of steps towards the Spear of Fate without any outside help.  By the end of 34, you can be holding the Shield of Falsehood.<br />
<br />
34 was fun =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Scarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I remember it for a 9 hour and a 5 hour corpse retrieval in one weekend.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brettation</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">ATM im twinked with a fungi tunic ect. for canabalization and other very high end gear, I have 228 wis with like 500 in mana items... I don't have a hard time soloing its just slow as hell because I have limited mana regen even with kei and DPS sucks only have a 12/26 melee and Dot's<br />
(Affliction) and (Tanted Breath).<br />
<br />
So hopfully 34 will allow me to increase the speed of how fast i can kill higher level mobs...<br />
<br />
<br />
Obviously with regen stacked with fungi I do tank, with slow of coarse!!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Level 34 was where I started to think that the shaman class might not suck as much as it seemed to.  I remember going straight to South Karana with my dog Laser to solo Centaur Chargers for hoof chips so I could finish up my Totemic Sleeves. <br />
<br />
Unrest basement, CT, SK, and Rathe Mts. were no match for my Screaming Mace!!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Genine Goosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I remember exactly when I got my pet. First of all, this is my main and first character on EQ! I was just learning about quests and the totemic gear and had even spoken with the ogres in LR! I had heard rumors that the named cyclops in RM could drop the totemic boots. I thought, my pet and I will show those cyclops' a thing or two. <br />
<br />
Cast pet, buff up pet, sit and med and canni for 15 minutes because that took all my mana. Slow cyclops, dot, root, dot, root, crap OOM, dog dead, zone! Zone back in, cast pet, buff pet, sit and med and canni for 15 minutes. You get the idea!!!<br />
<br />
Then I got some advice from another shaman. Think of your dog as a dot, not a tank. That was the best advice I had ever received. It was all downhill after that. Never did get the totemic boots to drop and I wore my banded boots until level 45 when someone in an experience group in DL felt sorry for me and ran to the bank and got me a pair of Dwarven Work Boots :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>starlite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">i have to be hobest i found 34 an anticlimax; as i had expected the pet to be a superhero-  wel ist more a papertiger in reality; this was a shock!<br />
<br />
Dont expect that pet to do much!  the 39 pet is abit more enduring!<br />
<br />
if u prepare by NOT expecting the pet to tank u will be less disappointed and a happier bunny than me at the time.<br />
<br />
erm...spent 34 having a blast in solb wich was in the days of it being full of 40 to 50 players ALL the time.  Was still HARD work then as my gear was so naff.  i had an ubber bp of giant foremans tunic !!<br />

I remember summoning my first dogdog and getting all choked up. My first main was a Monk..and I was disappointed with how his abilities didn't really seem to ramp up with each level.  This was a MILESTONE for me seeing my character make real concrete advances.<br />
<br />
Sure..ok..I was a bit let down that dogdog wasn't even as tough as a ranger.  I didn't let that ruin my fun though.  My groups were gonna have another basher for free!<br />

At that point I decided to go check out the scaled mystic quests 'cause my banded armor was starting to chafe..</div></div><hr />

Flew through 34 and 35 in one night!  It was really funny since I grouped with a buddy on one night and was level 33, next night dinged 34, brought out the dog and hit 36 a few hours later.  The following night I grouped with my buddy again and he asked &quot;So where did those 2 levels come from?!?!&quot;  Hehe - dogdog rules!</div></div><hr />

Couldnt wait to get my Totemic Helm.  Soon afterward I searched for Grizzleknot but never found him, eventually had to give up and buy the bark (think for 9k) for MQ from someone luckier than me.  Soloing Hill Giants was also fun but not particuarly good xps at that level.  34 IMO was a huge level, 39, 49 and 51 were the big ones after that.</div></div><hr />

How do you remember level 34?<br />
<br />
I remember 34 well.. I was hunting the druids in East Karana with a couple of Necros (This was pre-Kunark --- there were not too many places to go back then heh). We had a blast.. I remember druid players would /shout threats at us for killing the druid NPC's and every so often one would train Proon on us. They'd /shout that they would refuse to give us SoW or port us, and my necro friends would /shout right back &quot;We don't need your stinkin' SoW, we have a REAL woman with us!&quot; lol. <br />
<br />
I'd keep regen on the necros and heal all the pets. Once I dinged 34, I got to learn about pet control and commands from the masters ;) <br />
<br />
At 35 the druids went green, so I had to move on, but I'll always remember those days. What fun. The druid NPCs remember too.. if I ever set foot in Surefall Glade uninvis I'm sure the entire zone would erupt in &quot;YOUR REPUTATION IS AN AFFRONT.. blah blah blah&quot; and the zone would crash.  <br />
<br />
And the book being gone... ooo! I dinged 35 in the sewer in Cazic Thule killing alligators. I was so excited to ditch the book!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">First thing I did when I hit 34 was run from my group in South Karana (I know, noob alert!) and buy him in West Karana... Cast him (took half my mana, since I had like, +4 wisdom on my gear or something... I was really, REALLY poor), and tried to zone with him. Boy I was ticked.<br />
<br />
ANYWAY, we went into Paw, he mauled Gnolls... We went to Cazic, he mauled lizards. Then we went to dreadlands and really got our butts kicked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I went camping Totemic helm and I casted EB on dingo because I was afraid he'll drown ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Yep.. 34.  That was when I first could solo.  Full banded armor, fine steel spear, Qeynos kite shield.  <br />
<br />
I would solo guards in the commons when all the groups in highhold keep basement were full.  Bind at the bank in highhold keep, get my name on the list for a warrior room or raider room group, run to the commons and solo guards until a spot opened up...  If the guards were camped, i would hunt spiders in East Karana.<br />
<br />
Happy memories of days long gone.</div></div><hr />

I also remember 35 very.... no more book!!!! woot!!!! lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>windfinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">ahh 34. what was i doing at 34 .... lets see I think that was ether right before SoV or right after SoV came out so i was ether in OT or in GD dependign on the time. ) I think the firsst time i realy pulled out the dog was when i was partnering with a warrior killing the giants in GD at 34 or 35. we where all about killing just freaking large things, have been killing giants in one form or another since lvl 16 or 15 when we could take the giants at the WW giant fort in a pair or with the realy cool necros that where around there ). <br />
<br />
I have to say i never thought of my dog as a tank. I have been tanking since i was lvl 19 soloing the giants in WW fort when my warrior friend was not there. I know all the tricks to making sure thay dont add and let me tell you the OLD frenzy was just about the coolest trick i had and saved sevral groups i had.</div></div><hr />
