<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zionak Maliseer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">On the alchemy link of this website, it says that Greater Regen stacks with Chloroplast.<br />
<br />
Does it stack with Regrowth?<br />
<br />
Does it Stack with a Fungi and or other Regen items?<br />
<br />
This potion is not all that easy.  With it's difficulty level, it should stack with any form of regen.<br />
<br />
I'm looking to break this potion into the market if it's worth it.  <br />
Knowone sells them due to the cost of making them and difficulty lvl but if it stacks,  it might be worth trying it out<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Konarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I can personally attest to it stacking with Regrowth and the Iksar regen BP so yes it stacks.<br />
<br />
It helps out soloing on fast repops. :D</div></div><hr />

Is a very nice potion to have in your bag for emergencies.<br />
<br />
It gets overwritten by celestial heals and by the necro heal spells.<br />
<br />
So warn your group when you have one on.<br />
<br />
Not sure that there is much of a market for it.  You would have to begin by educating your public as to its use, and then convincing them to pony up the cash for it.<br />
<br />
Melee classes are likely to be reluctant to use it, it does have a neg str effect, and may have a slow to attack speed side effect.<br />
<br />
Necro's are unlikely to want to use it because of the neg to int.<br />
<br />
I see lots of uses for shaman, and carry at least one with me at all times.    But you will need more than shaman who cannot/will not make it for themselves to make a market.<br />
<br />
Let us know if it takes off.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Heelah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">actually, this does stack with celestial heal. i was griping at the cleric cuz i jus used a potion, so i sucked up some mod rods to keep ahead =P but heal over time did not overwrite the potion effect. (this was with the mid-grade potion, not the greater)</div></div><hr />
