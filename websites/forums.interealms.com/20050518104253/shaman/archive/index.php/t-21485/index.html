<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Dear Sony Dev Team,<br />
<br />
I am writing to inform you of a possible flaw in your loot tables for ldon, specificly the miraguls ldon in the 58-65 range. in the past week I have been helping a friend work up points to purchase an item from the miraguls merchant and in our many missions we continue to get the following drop, (please note I am posting this because I feel the item is VASTLY overpowered for the risk involved)<br />
<br />
Brown potion,<br />
nodrop <br />
Disease awareness 1<br />
5% mana pres on all disease spells lvl 20 and lower.<br />
<br />
not only does this item drop on missions where there are no shaman/sks/necros involved it comes from a chest...a chest that costs almost 20pp to open. (Damn cheap for the incredible power of this thing)<br />
last night the shaman who was along for the mission was truly extactic to get his hands on one of these. it meant he didnt have to make it from scratch and that now he could cast his lvl 5 dot Sicken and save a whoping ZERO MANA PER CAST!?!?!?!?!?<br />
<br />
I beg you, have more care with your loot tables, if this item should find its way into the wrong hands there will surely be havoc that spreads across all servers. think of the chaos, all those shaman casting Sicken for NO LESS MANA than they could cast it with out the uberness that is the &quot;Brown Potion&quot;<br />
<br />
thank you, that is all.</div></div><hr />

Get ready for a nerf!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I did actually /feedback it. I was pretty scathing in my feed back though so it probably wont get read. just one of those things thats so unbelivably stupid it should piss you off but really just makes you laugh because its on par with so many things in the game right now. I dont know why anyone bothers with ldon names or chests. outside of augments I havnt seen a single piece of gear thats wearable (ldon hard stuff yes, not normal though). lvl58 rec on a piece of gear a lvl 30 would scorn is what we usually get out of these. we have been saving stuff up, the guild leader will no doubt get the next expansion and we will have a nice pile of tribute crap he can turn in for guild tribute...the problem is we are already running out of room to store this crap.<br />

meh went ahead and posted it there, it should be good for a laugh over there as well :)</div></div><hr />

<br />

I don't think anybody gave you the neg rep bump for just that Lit...I think they just don't like you and gave it to you for the sake of giving it to you.</div></div><hr />
