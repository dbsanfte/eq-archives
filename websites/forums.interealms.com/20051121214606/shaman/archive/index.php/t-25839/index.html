<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, so a group of friends gather once a week on a PvP server as a nice change of pace.  I thought I would share my 'blog' that I post up over at my PvE guild website...I enjoy reading WoW stories from other players.<br />
<br />
Since this is cut-n-pasted from my PvE guild website you won't recognize the names:<br />
<br />
Snap - Tauren Shaman<br />
Wolf - Troll Shaman<br />
Kast - Undead Priest<br />
Esri - Undead Mage<br />
Synn - Troll Rogue<br />
<br />
We are all currently lvl 25-27.<br />
--------------------------------------------<br />
We got a guild!!!<br />
<br />
Last night we had TWO groups of White Wolves on the PvP server. So Ubu (Wolfnip) was kind enough to fly around and grab all the signatures for the guild charter. Some very good names were suggested, including the Sweathogs and the Black Wolf Clan…but in the end the Apple Dumplin Gang   was floating over everyone’s head. Nothing like getting your ass beat and having to tell your friends it was the Apple Dumplin Gang that did it. <br />
<br />
It was great seeing green mistells! I felt like I was home again.<br />
<br />
I thought I would share a few stories:<br />
<br />
1) We are rumbling around Ashenvale and I’m off by myself (lvl 26) and I catch some red text (ie. an enemy player). I had already lost track of a 25 paladin so I wanted to catch this one…whoever “this one” was.<br />
<br />
I run that way and it’s a lvl 20 hunter. Obviously terrified, he runs up into the crotch of some big tree roots and I hear the “pwwwhoooo” as he stealths up. Unfortunately, his Stirgid Owl pet is standing there flapping its wings. Doh!<br />
<br />
I decided to just let him know I that I saw him so I killed his pet. He unstealthed after a few seconds and started plunking me with arrows as I beat down his silly owl. I /saluted him and turned and ran off, hoping he’d get the message that I wasn’t going to kill him. I get a little ways away and I rotate my screen and see this little elf chasing me down with a big sword in his hand. WTH??? He must have been in the mood for steak or something. Needless to say, he died.<br />
<br />
2) A bit later 5 of us are at the Zoram Strand and I catch a 33 Hunter scouting us. We were totally unorganized and somehow, to my extreme embarrassment, those 2 Hunters killed all of us. Nerf Hunters!<br />
<br />
3) We prowl around a bit and head down to BlackFathom Depths. Synn scouts ahead but there aren’t any Alliance around, just mobs. We are checking gear, etc when suddenly I hear the mobs further down the tunnel start to cast spells…<br />
<br />
A Dwarf paladin comes tearing around the corner, running flat out! He zips through us and heads out the cave. We jump in the water and chase him, but the little guy manages to get a full turn ahead of me on the stairwell…so I rarely had a clear line of sight for spells even though I could see him…and being able to heal to full while running is a powerful ability indeed.<br />
<br />
He gets up out of the ruins and we lose track of him for a few seconds…which was just enough time for him to run up into a corner and hide…just as we catch him again he *pops* and disappears (hearthstone I guess).<br />
<br />
4) PVE interlude: Finally we enter the instance, and generally have a good time romping and stomping. We’ve been here a few times now (both as Horde and Alliance) and so it’s familiar, although right at the temple entrance we let a runner go and the resulting train wipes us out.<br />
<br />
We kill the big boss at the end (a VERY challenging fight), and click on the stone at the end of the cave to leave. I won’t give anything away, but the way you leave the dungeon is AWESOME!<br />
<br />
5) Flush from our victory and with full bags of loot, we come spilling out of the BFD ruins and almost run over ANOTHER Dwarf (hunter). Wolfnip is the first on him I think, and the poor hunter runs behind a wall to try and hide. Unfortunately for him, I was coming around the other side of the wall and in a flurry of daggers, staves and elbow jabs we all beat him into the ground.<br />
<br />
6) Now we decided to head up into Auberdine (Darkshore). This is a Alliance held lands, which means we can’t start any PvP… You’d think it would be boring. WRONG!<br />
<br />
The first Elf we come across is a lvl 18 something, and he runs right behind a tree and stands there…I can almost see him holding a twig in front of his face hoping we don’t see him. Too bad he was PvP flagged.<br />
<br />
He died. <br />
<br />
We rumble on down the road and run across various Elves…they are all non-PvP flagged and even then the sight of 5 members of the Apple Dumplin Gang makes them pause and back up a bit. <br />
<br />
We see some red text running down the road and we cheer – more targets! It turns out to be a lvl 44 Rogue! Hmmm….we’re sure we can't take him, he’s double our level, but he doesn’t seem to be interested in taking on 5 of us. He shadows us for a bit and so we turn to the coast.<br />
<br />
Poor old Heldan Galesong. He lives a quiet life, fishing on the shore, far away from the hustle and bustle of Auberdine. Too bad he is also far away from the guards. <br />
<br />
Now that we’ve killed an NPC we should really see some response. <br />
<br />
6) The best part of the evening : <br />
<br />
The Cavalry has arrived. A lvl 45 Warrior comes riding up on his charger and dismounts. With a sneer he charges me (intercept?) and starts laying down the smack. Too bad he underestimated the Apple Dumplin Gang! I start running around in a circle like my hair is on fire and Kastogir heals me while Wolf, Synn, and Esri start in with the beatsticks. You could almost see the look of astonishment on the warriors face as we start landing the spells, stuns and stabs. He died with a surprised look on his face. A lvl 45, PLATE wearing, butt stomping warrior got beat down by a bunch of lvl 25-27 Dumplins .<br />
<br />
However, our victory was short lived…a lvl *57* Alliance shows up out of nowhere. In his best British police voice he says “ ’ello, 'ello, wot’s all this then?” and then gets down to the dirty work of cleaning up the mess we started.<br />
<br />
It’s over in barely a minute, I think we got him down to about 60% before we were just 5 little corpses on the beach. I hung around the bodies for a few minutes and by the time I released there were almost a dozen Alliance gathered around. <br />
<br />
----<br />
All in all, a fantastic night. Tonight was the cloth wearer’s turn to really rake in the loot. We beat the hydra that defeated us last time, so we are making progress. And PvP was a lot of fun as well.<br />
<br />
Lessons learned:<br />
<br />
a) Strength in numbers. We OWN Ashenvale Forest. People see the Apple Dumplin Gang rolling down the road and they either hide or die. It seems like most Alliance (and Horde) are solo’ing at this level, and they really don’t stand a chance against a group.<br />
<br />
b) Teamspeak. Other than one incident where somebody shouted “Cucumber!” over the channel (/cough), TS is VERY handy. Its amazing how much more coordinated you are on your attacks. Plus it makes the game much more social. Please please please get and use Teamspeak.<br />
<br />
<br />
Best quote of the night (over Teamspeak): “If there  are any more invisible mobs up here, I can’t see them.”</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Hydra fight was awesome, except don't do what we did.  Our rogue seemed to think you needed to light ALL the candles at the same time ... note to self ... don't trust rogues.<br />
<br />
Ashenvale, no way.  Head to astraanar and try to roll the town, watch the response from the Palliance and the freak parade of guards.  On my server, Splinter tree post gets rolled EVERY night by the same group of gank tards who feel that mopping up guys 30-40 levels under them and screwing all the quests there gives their e-peen a polish.  When the horde responds, which it almost never does, it drives em off and either they return with a raid force, or they wait out for the people who might actually challenge them in PvP to leave.<br />
<br />
Totally on board with teamspeak.  It simply is such an advantage my whole guild is on it when we group, raid or even seperately screw around.  Last night it was a huge edge even in PvE as I (37 shaman) duoed Scarlet Monastary with a 60 Warlock (no suprise, he did most of it, but TS came in handy for calling heals for his pet and himself on bosses and for telling when to follow and when he'd pull to me).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Cool stories snap. Ya, numbers can be rough, I got killed twice by 6 people level 33-50 last night, cause I was stupid. One 48 hunter of ours joined and we ate them though.<br />
<br />
had some great fights with a 60 alliance rogue last night too, he got me when I rezzed, and when a 57 warrior was with him, and he kept sapping people stealthed, caught him a few times by himself though and he died, he was CB evis'n hard, but I have 4083 hps and do not go down easily.<br />
<br />
<br />
Gonna actually put the maces up and try ambush style and see how that works, my stats are not perfect for it but heh.<br />

<br />
Mill get the stancesets mod (and it's meat and potatoes part weapon quickswap) You can set it up to double dagger only while stealthed, then as you come out of stealth both maces get equipped.  It really really helps for the high ambush damage then sinister to your hearts content. <br />
<br />
It is an amazing mod. Almost feels like cheating. (Laughs)<br />
