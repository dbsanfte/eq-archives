<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rehunh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was recently poking around in the allah's database and found that a lot of nice stuff can drop from this event in the deep but I was unable to find any information about where to start it and what kinda of raid strength it would require to do. My guild said to try and set it up but I don't know what and how many of each class to start recruiting for it since I know so little. So ummm yeah if anyone has any knowledge relating to this or could point me to anothe rgood source I would appreciate it.<br />

My suggestions?  Bring as many people as you think you will need to handle waves of 12 mobs at a time, most of which are unslowable.  My guild did this event like 3 - 4 times and we took between 14 and 20 people each time (all level 65).  Bring some people who can AE, makes things go a lot easier.  You cannot add people after the event starts, so make sure everyone is there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rehunh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Cool thanks for link and info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">first 3 (4?) waves are stunnable, bring 3 chanters, set them up in  a triangle in the center, have casters load pbae's, melees get up on walls when mobs spawn melees agro and drag to center where the fun starts. no pets allowed during these waves<br />
the rest of the fight is pretty much off tanks while the main force kills the worms one buy one.<br />
<br />
and yeah for a giant penis the big guy has some nice drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tidykat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Not sure how your guild ranks onthe food chain, but my guild is appraoching the ability to soon go kill Bert, and we generally have 30 people there, minimally 6 tanks.<br />
<br />
the first 3 waves we gather inthe center and AE.  The waves of 6, each (assigned) tank takes a worm, and the raid focusses their energies on one worm at a time.  usually have a couple minutes spare between those waves.  Wave of 2, have 2 warriors for (may need defensive depending on tanks hp/ac), and the last one, we use 1 warrior tank, in defensive (has around 8200buffed i think) and all start pouding on the worm.<br />
<br />
As far as shamans...first 3 waves we chain our pathetic ae nukes, and the rest *I* tend to cripple each, then BoSaryrn each, sit back, cani to full, then assist raid as needed.  Last worm..Cold DD works well...gotta use MD and malos..and witht hat, epic, Saryrn, PoX and Ultor bounce often.  Dont even bother with bane..can't get it to ever land.  I use pox, ultor and Velium strike mostly.  and patch the mt if you need.  Loot up, and move on.  Funfight..sometimes long..and LOTS of push (for us anyways) =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">For a pre VT guild : 16/20 members are enough . Well if you have at least 3 cleric . A chanter help a lot for some wave, 1/2 wizard ,a couple a tank (at least 4 ,ranger are ok ,but it's way better to have 6/7 tank including hybrid).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Lots of the worms are actually slowable and rootable on the first few waves, just remember which ones and get your tanks on the unslowables ~ mez the rest then kill when you're done with the others.   At least that's how we do it.  You will need a minimum of 6 tanks I think to do this right and it's a ton of fun :)</div></div><hr />
