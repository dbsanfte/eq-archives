<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mekil Jueaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">After some thought I realized I prolly shouldn't have posted this :(  hope I didn't piss anyone off with it.  Was having too much fun with people at work so I thought I'd pass it on to you all to mess with your friends.  So make it short, sorry if I messed anyone up, it wasn't the reason I posted this :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hammerstalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Actually I thought it was funny. All you have to do to fix things is a quick control+alt+delete and end task hehe. It might tick some people off though.</div></div><hr />

Three finger salute=ctrl+alt+del<br />
Why's it called the three finger salute? Because Microsoft deserves more than one finger heh.</div></div><hr />

     1) Run into your network administrator's office while he's not there.  (You know, the one who rigged up the &quot;personal alarm&quot; to go off when you sat down at your desk last April fools.)  <br />
<br />
     2) Have someone distract him while your in there - it takes about 5 minutes to do.<br />
<br />
     3) Take a screenshot on his computer - but don't do anything to his desktop before you do.<br />
<br />
     4) Open up a paint program, hit Ctrl-V and save it as screen.bmp under C:\.<br />
<br />
     5) Create a new text file, and put the following code in it:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
With &quot;&lt;&gt;'s&quot; instead of &quot;[]'s&quot;.  (Does anyone know how to include example html?)<br />
<br />
    6)  Save it as scn.htm under the C: drive.<br />
<br />
    7)  Point his web browser to C:\scn.htm and then hit F11 to enter full screen mode.  Also, make sure the bar on top is set to &quot;auto-hide&quot;.<br />
<br />
    8) Go back to your office.  Wait until he tries to click on something, and let the magic begin.<br />
<br />
    9)  Laugh in his face.  (Optional)</div></div><hr />
