<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Arborealus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings,<br />
<br />
Please take the time to read and act accordingly...The Code Red Worm and variants are pummeling bandwidth nationwide causing slow loading of webpages, connect no browse...collateral mail server issues will ensue as Firewall Software which autogenerates abuse email to abusers domains floods mail servers.<br />
<br />
I am currently unable to stay connected to the EQ servers as a result of almost constant Port 80 (TCP) requests on my firewall (I logged over 3000 requests today!!)<br />
<br />
<br />
CodeRed II was discovered on August 4, 2001. It has been called a variant of the original CodeRed Worm because it uses the same &quot;buffer overflow&quot; exploit to propagate to other web servers. Symantec AntiVirus Research Center received reports of a high number of IIS web servers that were infected. CodeRed II is considered to be a high threat. <br />
<br />
This is a level 4 alert from Symantec...<br />
<br />
Threat Assessment: <br />
   <br />
Wild: High<br />
Damage: Medium<br />
Distribution: High<br />
<br />
Vulnerability:  Windows NT &amp; 2000 users, variants have been reported to infect Win98 &amp; ME with personal web server installed. Variant II is essentially a Trojan giving full access to your machine to anyone able to exploit it and causing it to vector the virus to other vulnerable machines.  While there is no known current payload (damage causing mechanism) it is quite concieveable that a variant including payload could be introduced shortly.<br />
<br />
What you should do:<br />
<br />
1) Read the Symantec Brief HERE (http://www.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/codered.ii.html)<br />
<br />
2) Update your current virus scanning/protection software (this should suffice for Win 98 &amp; ME Users).<br />
<br />
3) Use the Code Red Detect tool from Symantec HERE (http://security.symantec.com/us/nav/common/common/bin/CRDetect.exe)  Note this tool is functional only on WIN NT &amp; 2000.<br />
<br />
4)  If it is detected use the CODE RED REMOVAL TOOL (http://www.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/codered.removal.tool.html) (NT &amp; 2000)<br />
<br />
5) If you are running NT or 2000 with IIS please apply the latest patch from Microsoft for IIS.  It can be found HERE (http://www.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/codered.removal.tool.html)<br />
<br />
6) If you are on broadband especially look into the purchase of a Hardware Firewall (I can recommend the LinkSys and Net Gear models for ease of use) or alternately use a good Software Firewall software (Black Ice etc NOTE: I do not recommend ZoneAlarm that prog seriouly hosed my host file).<br />
<br />
Thanks for taking the time to read this guys if you have any questions regarding this please feel free to contact me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If your firewall or router has a web interface, i.e. you can connect and configure the firewall through http, then change the port so that the firewall does not respond to port 80.<br />
<br />
Cisco routers 677 series have a known flaw with this kind of trafiic, and other routers may have this problem too.<br />
<br />
If you change the router to respond to, let's say port 800 instead, you would access your configuration through http://192.168.1.1:800/ instead of the normal way.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, it seems that the Code Red is pretty much on the retreat at the moment, but it still is very active.<br />
