<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>shadow-wolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Seen a few questions on soloing at 56, so since that's where i'm at, i thought i'd post the places i've tried.  Please feel free to add.<br />
<br />
Jaggedpine Forest<br />
What: Griffons (only the occasional dark blue at 56), giant anacondas and panthers (panthers will lower faction with jaggedpine folk, and animals i think)<br />
Pros: Easy to get to, bank, supplies and druid port very close by.  In wolf form, nothing except poachers, gnolls and pontamids will agro on you, all of which are static locations.<br />
Cons: Trees are a PITA, can be hard to find a mob in peak time.  Also i found judging positioning when fear kiting the anacondas somewhat difficult at times and would get the &quot;you cannot see yout target..&quot; message.<br />
<br />
Plane of Justice<br />
What: Festering Rats<br />
Pros: Great XP, nice spot you can kite to and the mobs get stuck due to verants great pathing code.<br />
Cons: Mobs here hit hard and have a ton of HPs, also get adds sometimes.  is this dependent on lvl?<br />
<br />
Timorous Deep<br />
What: Raptors<br />
Pros: Less crowded that other spots, raptors have low HPs and pathetic magic resistant.<br />
Cons: Raptors have a HUGE agro range, means fairly likely to get adds.  Fairly out of the way, hard to get to, and no easy zone if you get into trouble.<br />
<br />
Plane of Disease<br />
What: Diseased Rats (?)<br />
Pros: Great XP<br />
Cons: Even more HPs than the rats in PoJ, hit harder too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">PoJ rats stop adding at 57.  Once you get there, it becomes a lot easiers.  Also try using Swarmcaller/Earthcaller for slowing at first..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>daktarien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Western Wastes <br />
What: Velium hounds, Brontos and Mammoths<br />
Pros: Relatively racant,  decent loot, decent xp, can check for scout<br />
Cons: Pain to get to,  Pain to get out, can be painful to run into Ice Burrowers.<br />
Other: Is a great place to get some exp while wasting time waiting for ToV raid to begin.  Check the hunting guide out under the Guide thread.<br />
<br />
Plane of Nightmares<br />
What: Small bats, ravens and night stalkers are all soloable<br />
Pros: Great exp, ok loot, easy to bum a rez if you mess up<br />
Cons: somewhat crowded, mobs can tickle if you loose control, large agro radius<br />
<br />
thanks,<br />

Do you think I will get exp in TD ?<br />
<br />
I think they are 41-44 what is the limit level for dark blue at 57 ? <br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

I'm thinking raptors will be mostly light blue to you at 57.  For me at 56 i had about 30-40% light blue.  Viscious Raptors should still be dark blue, so that could be worth a go.  Might be slow going though only hunting viscious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wyverne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">So I hunted Raptors and Vicious Raptors last Week end. Half the raptors was light blue and all the vicious was dark blue.<br />
I am well stuffed and was pulling as fast I can but the exp wasnt really good.<br />
I was in 100% AA exp mode and I won 3 blues per hour.<br />
I will look for another place next week end.</div></div><hr />
