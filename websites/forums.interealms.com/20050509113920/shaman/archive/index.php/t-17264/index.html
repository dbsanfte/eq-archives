<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>nornez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok i finally got to finishing nd3... after run3, mc3, canni5, mgb, scrm &amp; now nd3 what are some good &amp; fun aa abilities to look at going after. <br />
<br />
I have been thinking mebe I should get healing adept &amp; ca3/lr5 next seeing as how 75% of my time in game is raiding... but hell after nd3 &amp; how slow aaxp comes because of all the raiding I was thinking mebe some fun aa abilites next.<br />
<br />
I have also thinking like RC1 would be good to get. mebe suspend minion 2, how good is VPx? have been waiting forever to get clicky root pants without much luck so mebe VP would be ideal.... spirit call looks like a blast also tho.<br />
<br />
any ideas welcome</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Denn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">VP3 rules outside of PoP.... I just love this AA. I have to say my favorite thing about it is very few people know about it... leaves people guessing as to what just happened.<br />
<br />
Spell Casting Fury/Fury of Magic<br />
Healing Gift/Advanced Healing Gift<br />
Quick Buff 3<br />
These 5 are what I went for after getting canni5, MGB, SCRM<br />
<br />
Suspended Minion is one of my favorites for soloing... I wish there was a 3 to cross zones<br />
<br />
Spirit Call 3 is just plain fun but I fail to see much DPS from mine</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Radiant Cure 3 is god. Remember, it doesnt just kill poison, disease and curses.. it can also gives chances to remove ANY detrimental effect on the character, the higher level radiant cure, the more chances it has to remove them. What does this mean?<br />
<br />
Your group members get hit with uncurable AE(like aaryonar ae, uhmm the **** those black drakes in tov ae.. and that the blue ones proc on you(thunder strike?). <br />
<br />
If you do pvping, it is especially godly.. nothing, and I mean nothing makes a necro cry like RCing off lifeburn and FP and grinning at him =p<br />
<br />
I like DD crits(after the ones you have) have them up to the 1st pop one.. I crit pretty damn often, and with foci/bardsong it gets even more fun.<br />
<br />
Have a level of healing crits, a lvl of healing adept(which I bought right when I got ornate arms.. figuring that both together would make tnargs pretty sweet.. and it does). Im also pathetic.. I got rabid bear.. and hastened rabidity up to 3. heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Suspended Minion should be towards the very back of your list.  I didn't train it until AA #294 and I definately do not regret waiting that long.  It's pretty cool for duels but otherwise, all it really is is a small timesaver.<br />
<br />
RC3 is alright, but RC1 and RC2 are nearly worthless.  Even RC3 doesn't cure most LDoN effects in one cast.<br />
<br />
VP3 is a good AA and I'd get it early.  It is great for crowd control in LDoN and you can use VP as your primary root against mobs with really low disease resist, but VP is not a substitute for other roots.  If you don't have clicky root or a castable root memmed, then if your VP gets resisted or wears off, you have to wait 2 minutes for the skill to repop.<br />
<br />
Spirit Call isn't that great.  It was &quot;a blast&quot; when pop first came out and almost no one had ever even seen it before.  The novelty wore off pretty fast, though, and now it is just another ability (an ability that I do not find all that useful).<br />
<br />
If you spend almost all your time raiding, I would advise this path:<br />
<br />
SCM3 -&gt; QB2 -&gt; HG3 -&gt; HA3 -&gt; AHG3 -&gt; AHA3 -&gt; Defensive AA -&gt; whatever you want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>kowalsky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">well.. after all this AA's, take a break and pleased yourself.. you've done enough for your raids.. now it's time for you to get fun AA :)<br />
<br />
why don't you get SC1.. not a lot of aa, and can be usefull with an unexpected add. of course it doesn't add a lot of DPS in raid versus big named.. (about 1k per pet) but it is still a little more to add to your raid.<br />
<br />
regarding suspend minion there is a nice thread here: http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=16629<br />
<br />
basicaly if you are a solo fan, it worth getting it.<br />
<br />
I wont call RC1/2/3 and VP1/2/3 fun AA, but they are usefull AA.<br />
<br />
and then..  when you'll be ready to start again big AA grinding.. just do as said in previous messages !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">CS3/LR5 are a godsend.  Worth every freaking point.  It can not be emphasized enough how good these are even if you are not in a raiding guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">quickbuff is nice 6 second torpor/q is forever &gt;&lt; quickbuff 1 shaves .6 seconds 2 shaves 1.5seconds and 3 shaves 3 seconds..its high on my priority list now; not to mention things like 2.5 second invisibility and any other buffs you cast..<br />
<br />
CA/LR are great...its a lot of points though..<br />
<br />
Fun AA's VP/SC/SCF are definitely worth an invesment of at least the first tier.<br />
<br />
suspended minion if you solo is probably a good idea too..i cant even begin to count how many times i've had to invis and kill off my pet after i summoned and fully buffed him..  Its a lot of points to get level 2 though, and isnt for everyone :)<br />
<br />
<br />
My advice is look at how you play and decide what aa would have the largest impact on your play time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>nornez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">forgot to add that I have QB2 with wicked bone for a near 3 sec Q. I was going to do CA3/LR5 after ND3 but looking at how many aa pts that is , I think I will hold off.<br />
<br />
Something that is bugging me atm is being max'd out on stats when buffed. How good is planar power, I heard after a stat hits 280 anything beyond that comes with dimishing returns. Whats the deal with planar &amp; would that be worth some aa pts at this point?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">For fun bufs, Virulent Paralysis2 and Spirit Call1<br />
rock. VP2 has a decent enough knock back to get<br />
the mobs out of range. The three pets from SC1<br />
may not do much damage, but they can keep a <br />
mob busy for a minute.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">RC1 and RC2 are nearly worthless  <br />
I couldn't disagree more.  RC1 is the best 2 points I've ever spent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sinjuneq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I would recommend HA3/Advanced 3, HG3/Advanced3, CA3/LR5, CS3/ID5. I like the fact I can hold my own in healing with a 2320 Kragg's heal, almost (normally) 1800 Tnarg's heal and a crit that is between 3100-3400hp heal and I crit alot with Advanced HG3 and my Quie heals for over 1800hp now. CA3/LR5 are VERY noticeable, especially during raids on slow agro. I like the fact I can thumb my nose at a mob who misses 5 out of 7 swings lol. BTW, RC3 and VP3 are a must!!</div></div><hr />
