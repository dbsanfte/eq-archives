<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Taradoni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The easiest way out of the stalking issue is basically lie. I have had 2 female guild members that were getting the same thing. My advise to them was to tell the individual that for a while they thought theat they were funny, and that they personally enjoyed roll playing. I had them go on to say that they had started a female character and that it was a male controling the toon. Then if they continued to start talking stern and telling them to go %^@$#^%$ themselves and to get a life. This cured both issues of stalkers. It is easy to be anything you want in chatrooms or EQ, and the individuals that are on the stalking end never knows who is really behind the keys of any given toon. In the case of someone stalking to the point of hacking your PC for personal info, theres not much you can do but move South and get a handgun permit. lol <br />
   Hope that helps some folks with this issue, and remember that if they will not accept the fact that you are male then start questioning their manhood, this will put a quick and certain end to the issue all together. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valedhel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Me and a bunch of friends have a diffferent approach to this problem. We all hang out in a chatroom whenever we're online. Most of us also have 50+ main characters. <br />
<br />
A lot of us also have female toons. (hey, a female inky cleric gives me something to look at while waiting for the tank to freak out over his health status). *cough* but I digress.<br />
<br />
Anyway, typically, the moment someone begins harrasing one of our female toons (which are mostly low leveled, since we all started playing around the same time 6 months or so ago) , the offender would immidetly receive several tells from one of us to back off his GF/sister.<br />
<br />
Lateley, I've taken a break from leveling, and re-visited all my childhood haunts (thanks PoK) and PLing a couple friend's alts in-between running off to kill a giant or gix, or griffon, etc etc. The last stalker to harass one of my friend's alts got challenged by a horrifyingly red PC standing next to her holding a _very_ wicked looking axe.<br />
<br />
From what I heard, the stalker never came back :p</div></div><hr />
