<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Matey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Looks like they're starting to patch stuff in to the live servers for LDoN.  There's some teaser mobs up in Freeport that talk about LDoN as well as new skills, &quot;Inspect&quot; and &quot;Open&quot; in the skill choices menu.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">they've had the beta open for it a lot, if you were online at all when they advertised it you could be seeing the whole thing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You have been downloading stories to go along with those NPC's for something like 2 months now. Those characters have been moving all over the place as the stories have progressed. First was OT, and there is an entire encampment of them in Lavastorm near the SolB entrance, PoK has had the opne guy staggering around for a few weeks, or at least until he took the portal to WFP, and WFP has seen a couple of different setups of them now.<br />
<br />
LDoN code has been getting patched into the servers for a couple months as well. There have been very noticable bugs that have appeared (and since been fixed) that were attributed by SoE to changes in the code due to LDoN optimisations that LDoN required.<br />
<br />
Which rock you been living under?</div></div><hr />

No. The rats in FP (and every starting zone) were part of a newbie mission added months ago. The Exterminator NPCs correspond to the rats. Hand in 4 rat whiskers to the exterminator for plat and some pretty darn good xp at level 1-3 (when the rodents would give fairly decent xp) and faction based on whatever faction dominates that zone. For example, the exterminator in WFP would give Militia faction while the one in NFP would give Clerics/Priests of Marr &amp; Knights of Truth faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Berusa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There are also a bunch of NPC's just like the ones in Lavastorm in the East Commonlands tunnel, theyre holding some secret they dont want to tell us. suckers. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There's also an unusual pit that has now appeared in NRO which contains moving sand at the bottom of it.  I didn't take the location, but it's just west of the eagle totem by the water.</div></div><hr />

Umm, that's cuz those are the adventure NPCs for the Rujarkian Hills adventures.  ;)  <br />
<br />
SRo = Deepest Guk<br />
EC = Rujarkian Hills<br />
NRo = Takish'Hiz<br />
Butcherblock = Mistmoore Catacombs<br />
Everfrost = Miragul's Menagerie.<br />
<br />
