<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have less than 4 hours a day of free time, but I find myself getting bored during those four hours. I enjoyed the WoW beta, tried planetside and quickly abandoned it, and I've gone a good number of months (maybe even a year?) without playing everquest. But it seems to be nagging me.<br />
<br />
Is there any reason to come back? My 65 shaman should still be preserved, but if the players feel the game is in a poor state I will believe them and stay far, far away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Frakass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">OoW is really not bad and shaman friendly, worth giving a shot imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you are actively looking for a reason to come back, for sure - OoW is fun...in that inimitable EQ version of &quot;fun&quot; way.<br />
<br />
If you are hoping to be persuaded against coming back, then hell, there are so many other things you could be doing. There has to be several million books out there that you haven't read yet, or if you want to get really radical, I hear &quot;outside&quot; can be pretty neat too!</div></div><hr />

What is this 'outside' you talk about? I've heard of it a few times don't think I've ever seen it =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">What is this 'outside' you talk about? I've heard of it a few times don't think I've ever seen it =P<br />
<br />
Careful.  I went outside yesterday around noonish...the moon was on fire.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Outside&quot; is a poor approximation of an Outdoor zone. The mobs are harder to find nad pull, and the faction hits an be murder (or attempted murder, depending upon your skill!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Man whoever is running outside has a killer graphics card. <br />
<br />
I mean I saw leaves. And some of em even fell. And were fully rendered.<br />
<br />
And there was this human female.. I mean.. damn she had nice polys. All rounded and..... Oh nevermind.<br />
<br />
Baking skill is just crazy easy to raise. They have these vendor purchased things like Frostys... And wendys chili for when you are tired of the Grind at the oven. <br />
<br />
and Screw Gems... they have this little distraction called a playstation... Wow. It is amazing.<br />
<br />
And the tell system is so cool. No /t but you cant just key in your friends name. you have to have thier data id number.. Some weird folks call it a phone number. But it isnt phoney.. So I dunno.<br />
<br />
Sad thing is. Nothing really drops tradeskill loot. at the most you get some bits of skin. But it does not combine with much. Or occasionally a wallet. But the plat ssytem and banks are screwy. They actually keep track of deposit sizes and stuff. <br />
<br />
And the guards are crazy fast. I think they are exploiting. Bastards.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyways this RL has a lot of wild quests. But some are more time consuming than others.. I mena I been camping all week for a Paycheck drop but the bastard boss mob just aint spawning. Maybe Ill see him tomorrow. I will be ready... Where is that new epic weapon I got linked to me a few days ago..... Oh yeah there it is. Cobbled together Mouse Bolo.... Dunno what class it is for but.. Ill give it a try tomorrow.....<br />
<br />
Night!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Your call Penny, but when I quit I was so pissed off I still have no desire to return.  I found I really enjoyed and appreciated single player games more now and returned to my RTS roots.  From what I read here though OoW isn't too bad overall, but still more of the same old crap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>frynque</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">to be fair, i did the same thing.  i had even gone as far as selling my acct, activation keys included.  but after 8 monthes, i felt i missed the comradery and hunting.  so i bought evolutions and started playing again.  i didnt buy ldon, or oow or god, since i was starting over at 1st lvl, having higher lvl expansions didnt make sense.<br />
<br />
there are times i miss my 64 epic shaman with GM smithing, but it quickly passes because, for the first time in many years, i have the thrill of challenge again because the zones i'm running thru are so under hunted, its actually dangerous to cross them.  i have ACTUALLY seen HGs on a regular basis in WC.  i cannot remember the last time i saw a HG in WC more than once in a weeks time and it didnt die before i could cross the zone.  its almost like playing again 4 years ago.<br />
<br />
if you're going to come back, do it for the friends and fun.  other than that, its just like everyone says, its more of the same.  game hasnt changed much, just more nerf bat, more quests, more raid targets, more zones.  but nothing truly innovative has happened in 2 years, except for LDoN but that was short lived.<br />

<br />
LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sullon One</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">im still having fun with eq after 5 years</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You have a desire to play eq because eq was something to do in the evenings. I've not really come across a pure alternative like that, not even WoW Beta(which I seem to enjoy more playing casually than hardcore) but I have a mixture of games that fills the void well sometimes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well, I came back, but only because I got too bored at work, and EQ is still better than working, at least.  In short, my advice is to clearly define what you want out of EQ before you go back.<br />
<br />
Specifically, you KNOW the extents of EQ's entertainment value, you know what you did and didn't like about it.  Make sure you set yourself up to do only the things you liked about it.  If you loved raiding, focus toward a raiding guild - and pick one within reach so you don't have to level grind to get in (if you hate level grinding).<br />
<br />
I have some already that go into a lot of detail about how I set up guidelines for myself when I started again, because I have a tendency to get so caught up in the game that I don't realize I'm making myself hate it all over again.<br />
<br />
So far I'm having a lot of fun just questing, soloing or grouping with random people, and doing my own thing.  Doing a lot of stuff I didn't make time for before.  It's fun, in a slow, EQ kind of way.  Expectation and planning are the keys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ok - the reason I left was because of higher-level guilds &quot;cockblocking&quot; lowerlevel content and preventing my own guild and other guilds of the same type from having any chance of competition in the areas. Example: Vex Thal and EP's being raided for alts.<br />
<br />
At the root of this problem was the population. Does anyone know if Tunare specifically has had a server split? Are there servers with raiding guilds that don't have this problem?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kellenial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Several years ago, I thought Drinal spawned from the split of Tunare and Mithaniel Marr. I could be wrong though...wasn't too far after the first or second BotB...around Velious time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
AHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAA Oh my god<br />
<br />
That is the most hilarious thing I have read on the internet in like.. a week.  And that's saying something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That was absolutely hilarious! That was the first time in weeks that I've actualy laughed out loud from reading something on the internet. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Well, if your server is anything like Xev, you can expect the EP's to have convinced a lot of guilds to stop doing VT, because the time vs. reward doesn't stack up.  The top 3 or 4 guilds on Xev had dropped entirely out of the VT rotation by the time I dropped out of raiding guild life.<br />
<br />
One can only hope that Omens would do the same for PoP, because the EP's were fairly crowded, last I checked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Has Sol Ro or the Elementals been opened to the great unwashed masses yet? Have any improvements been made to LDoN (e.g. choosable adventures, removal of time limit, all foci available, etc...)?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">You poor critter!  I suppose it'd be even worse without fellow EQ'ers to commiserate with...  Let me reassure you that EQ is TERRIBLE.  You're not missing a thing.  Right guys?  Yeah, you're um... better off over there!<br />
<br />
Ok, that's a stretch.  Be safe, shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Ranlron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I'm not sure which is which, is it sadism or masochism that causes us to come back?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Masochism... it's enjoying getting pain, you won't be able to convince me that it's sadism or enjoying giving pain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Some amazing A+ single player/online games came out this past months. They sure can waste time equally as well as EQ could.<br />
<br />
Doom3<br />
Counter Strike source<br />
Star Wars Battlefront<br />
Warhammer40k - Dawn of War<br />
Rome - Total War<br />
Sims2<br />
<br />
My personal favorite so far is Warhammer DOW.<br />
I have no desire to return to EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Psycotika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">wow, I havnt been here for a long time. what are the odds that like 3 topics on the front page are about comming back? =P<br />
<br />
lately Ive gotten the itch to come back. Im going to fight temptation though. Ive pretty much quit EQ from 2004 on. once in a few months Ill want to log on, pay for a month, get totally bored in a week, and let the account run out. why start the cycle again?<br />
<br />
plus im a total casual gamer, dont like to group or raid much. since thats about all EQ seems to be anymore it really offers me little. sure Id like to get to 65 (isnt it 70 now?) but whats the point? to get a snazzy title and be able to kill bigger things that look like what I was just killing?<br />
<br />
anyway, back on topic. if the things that made you quit eq in the first place are still there, then why bother comming back? just my 2cp</div></div><hr />
