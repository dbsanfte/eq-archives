<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Myzr, last I read it was doing a check on mana.  If you have sufficient mana, it uses the mana.  If you are low on mana, it uses HP.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kanelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">is this a constant ability kind of like a bank overdraft or is it activated?  if it is activated, how long does it last/recast time?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bartmeista</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm sincerely hoping that it's just broken at the moment, and have a feeling that it is.  It's an amazing AA for doing non-mgb buffs on many groups, for added damage output, and should be useful for when you're oom!  I ran into it real-time last night in Old Sebilis (ahh, an old fav. :) ), we were fighting the Berserker epic 1.5 mob, a massive Jugg.  Anyways, he has a 1k/tick mana dot that obviously hurts a little, heh.  Popped SC when I was approaching no mana, and just received &quot;Insufficient Mana...&quot; over and over.  Bugged it as I had done previously, of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Myzr, last I read it was doing a check on mana.  If you have sufficient mana, it uses the mana.  If you are low on mana, it uses HP.<br />

It's working the other way around. If you have sufficient mana it uses the HPs ass advertised, if you don't have sufficient Mana, it will give you a insufficient mana message and not work at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kinadorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It is supposed to be activated and it gives a buff which lasts around 4 mins and has a 30 min reuse.  While activated it is supposed to cast all spells using your HP instead of mana but at a higher cost.<br />
<br />
However, it is not working correctly at all.  I have seen it use my mana instead of HP while activated and I have also seen it use my HP like it is supposed to even if I have enough mana to cast the spell.  I haven't used this a lot except after a rez to rebuff but it is easily noticeable when it is using my mana pool instead of HP to cast the spells because my HP doesn't go down and my mana bar does.  It seems really broken atm and it does not do what the description says.  In my opinion it is pretty worthless in its current form.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks for the info. Bug this. Guess I will hold off on this AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Myzr Snowman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeah Chut - I seen it work with full mana and work with like 17 % mana and i seen it also not work with full mana and like 17 % mana so it like a gamble each time I use it .. <br />
<br />
PS I know that you need to have at least the min amount of mana to cast any spell -- ie if your gona do 7th you need to have at least the 2k mana( yeah I know its not 2k ...) in your pool before you can cast ... SO make sure you have like 25 % mana or what ever you need to start mgbing and and etc to buff everyone - or how ever you use it ...<br />
 The one time it worked on a raid it was wicked - and at the end of buffing everyone i was almost full mana ... so its a great AA when it works ....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>lightus_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">even now when its bugged I still like the AA for ninja medding, doing a killing group in RS, can easy drain all my mana if I dont chain canni (and I do get tired of that) so  when i get down to 30% mana and canni5 is down i pop SC and can med up like that. but i do look forward to when the bug is fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The AA isn't bugged at all.<br />
<br />
The only problem with it is what has been mentioned. If you don't sufficient mana to cast a spell, it will give you an insufficient mana message. <br />
If you do have sufficient mana, but the spell you are casting would drop you below a certain HP level, it uses mana instead of HPs to save you from getting low on health.<br />
<br />
The AA has a duration of 3 minutes and a reuse of 36. It leaves a buff that is dispellable. The ratio seems to be 1.8:1.<br />
<br />
As it is, it's a soloing tool and useless for mana drain fights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I bought it right before I came to work, that REALLY sucks..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Myzr Snowman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Actually Giac I have it use mana when i am like full hp also sooooo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Actually Giac I have it use mana when i am like full hp also sooooo<br />
<br />
Can't be. <br />
<br />
It wouldn't use mana, if you had enough HPs unless you didn't notice that it dropped or you actually never cast it(maybe it was interrupted for whatever reason). I purchased this ability the day after Omens went live and it has never happened to me.<br />
<br />
Edit: Do you remember the circumstances?<br />
<br />
I am 100% sure that this ability works fine now(it was fixed a few weeks ago).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm sorry you lost me with this one.  Does it give you an insufficient mana message then tap your hp's?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Does it give you an insufficient mana message then tap your hp's?<br />
<br />
No, it first performs the &quot;sufficient mana&quot; check, then activates the &quot;cast using HP&quot; mode.  So if you have a mana drain on you and are at 0 mana you cannot cast at all.</div></div><hr />

Correct.</div></div><hr />

Should have read:<br />
<br />
If you don't have sufficient mana to cast a spell, it will give you an &quot;insufficient mana&quot; message.<br />
<br />
If you had 50 mana in your pool and wanted to cast a 100 mana spell while this ability is active, you'd get the insufficient mana message and nothing would happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Blah.  That completely destroys the reason you want this in the first place.  If the buff is up, you should cast out of HPs.  End of story, even if it kills you to do so.  It's a self buff that you activate.  You know damn well when it's up and when it's not.  It's like Cannibalizations.  You don't get a safety no-cast if you have under 2k hps when you pop it off.  If you don't have sufficient HPs when you canni, you die.<br />
<br />
When you pop off the ability:<br />
-all casting should be done out of health pool, regardless of how much mana you have.<br />
-if you want to cast out of mana pool, you shouldn't have activated the ability in the first damn place.<br />
-if you want to cast out of mana pool, click off the buff.<br />
-if you have sufficient health to cast the spell, you cast it, and lose the appropriate amount of health.<br />
-if you have insufficient health to cast the spell, only then should the ability force you to cast spells out of your mana pool<br />
<br />
If health &gt; mana cost then cast out of health pool, else cast out of mana pool.<br />
simple.<br />
I'll have to see if I can hunt down spell guy at FF and bug him about this, if it's not fixed before then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>7ekno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">It's still a damn handy AA to have ....<br />
<br />
With a bit of imagination, you can use it in all sorts of situations (and I really prefer not to list them all here due to fear of nerfage) ....<br />
<br />
I haven't noticed it acting any different from the day it went live ....<br />
<br />
All the facts about the AA are stated above, it is really up to your ingenuity and experimentation to work out the usefulness of the Ability.<br />
<br />
Suffice to say, I use it every 36 mins in XP grinds!!!<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Ghwerig-AO</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I bought this AA, and like it quite a bit.  Its very useful when I need to buff multiple groups or after I just died and want to get back into the fight right away.  But, this AA is most definately bugged.  There are times when it will use mana when I have plenty of HP to use (more than 10000 of them actually).  Since I noticed this behavior, I have been monitoring my Mana / HP levels when I cast spells.  So far, I have found no pattern to its behavior, it just seems like 15% of the time it uses Mana instead of HP.<br />
<br />
One thing I have yet to try is killing myself using this AA.<br />
<br />
-G</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Well, it's strange that two people report it using mana instead of HPs when they are full health. <br />
<br />
It has never happened to me, so I guess I was wrong when I said it doesn't happen, and should say that the AA works just fine for me(apart from what has been mentioned).<br />
<br />
The only time I use this is when I am soloing basically. It is useful for that, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>GrishMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I don't mind that it starts using mana so much when you hit 50% health.  Unnecessary but not the end of the world.  I do very much mind not being able to use it with insufficient mana however.  That is the point of this AA.   Sure, there are uses for it as is.  Make no mistake though, it IS broken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">/agree Juujuu</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Chifari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I like the aa.  It's a lot like Gather Mana, which no one would argue is bad.  I only ever use it upon rez, but it is really nice to jump right back in and do full rebuffs.  Only problem is as previously stated... often don't have mana for group focus due to insuff mana message, but it's a minor problem... canni5, pmx2, and you're set.<br />
<br />
chif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Groon01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">This ability is completely random for me, about 30% of the time it will use mana instead of HP. I cannot put my finger on what is causing it to bug. Most of the time I use it to buff after rez when ae buff isn't available. If I chain cast Talisman of Wunshi it bugs a ton and keeps using mana more than half the time. If I mix things up and alternate between Wunshi and Sense/Fortitude, it bugs alot less. Could they have worked in a cap as to how much free mana you can get over a given time?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Myzr Snowman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I think the bug is random - last night it worked perfectly - and dam its nice when it works properly ....I even seen it use mana then hp then mana as i cast spells -</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">For the record I got this AA this weekend, it is really nice. You have to have the mana to cast the spell as stated but for 5 mins you can go nuts casting whatever you want. It is fairly useless for mana drain AEs however, if you don't have the mana you are not casting anything, even if your health is full. Still a worthwhile AA however, great for popping it when you need to chain heal for some reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Gaknab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I got this ability a few days ago and I love it. I haven't noiticed any problems with it like those mentioned above.<br />
<br />
I pop it at 20% mana and get 4 and a half minutes of free casting. Keep you HoT up and canni like normal, when it's done you are back up to full mana. Needless to say I use it everytime I get low mana if it's up. Well worth the AA's in my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Don't even bother with the HoT, just heal yourself with the direct heal, it don't cost anything. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I haven't got this AA myself, but it sounds like if a spell would take you below 50% HP, then it reverts to using mana.<br />
<br />
Personally I'd like this changed so it won't use HP if it would take you below 30%. I'd also like them to remove the &quot;check for required mana before casting&quot; limitation. =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I like the aa.  It's a lot like Gather Mana, which no one would argue is bad.

<br />
<br />
What's pmx2? usually I have to canni 5, canni 4 until I get enough mana to bot myself and end up with 1800 mana and full health, just so I can pop this ability and f07 1 group, then my mana drops to 1600,. have to wait for it to regen, then f07 1600 mana again.. wait.. ***<br />
<br />
LIFT the stupid mana requirement. Make it so if I WANT to die I can chain tnargs and die. I don't need a safeguard much like canni 5 doesn't have one. This spell should not be using up any mana at all or have anything associated with mana.</div></div><hr />

I got this aa and so farI have not had the bug happen.  Everytime I hit it I'm a mana god can chain cast anything I want with a hot up I love it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The last couple of night, I have been noticing the 'bug' more and more ...<br />
<br />
I certainly hope its a bug and not a 'feature' (aka stealth nerf).....<br />
<br />
From what I gather, its totally random .... SC has used mana instead of HPs when my HPs have been full, 90%, 55% and others inbetween ... there seems to be no set pattern to when mana is used or HPs used .... even consecutive casts can come from either pool .... F7 once from HPs, F7 again from mana and the next F7 from HPs .... totally random ...<br />
<br />
I have and will continue to /bug it every time I notice it .... because without predictable behaviour, this AA isn't useful :((<br />
<br />
If it is a new 'feature' I want my damn AAs back .....<br />
<br />
How the hell do we get an answer from SoE on such an issue?<br />
