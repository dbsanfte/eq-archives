<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Serj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Nadox is fixed on The Tribunal as of about 2 minutes ago.....good luck on other servers!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Guntar Ghostdancer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Was this fixed or did you happen to get lucky and have him spawn while you were there?<br />
<br />
Was your experience repeated by any other shaman?<br />
<br />
Please list the stage of the quest you are at including whether you have done any additional parts after this stage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jeis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Did you get any emote when u zoned into Nadox as from what the Devs mentioned?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Serj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It is defiunately fixed.  I logged back in after the ninja patch to the zone and got the emote, but since another shaman was there before me I let him have the spawn when he got back in.<br />
<br />
I waited 2 hours killing the room for something to do and camped and came back and there he was yet again with the same emote.<br />
<br />
So you can trigger him more than once as long as you don't loot him.<br />
<br />
I did everything out of order even looted the swarmfiend piece, end farming, and killing the groupable stuff out of order and was still able to spawn nadox after the patch.  I was unable to do so on sunday and monday, but since they fixed it today I was able to spawn him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jeis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If this is so that is great new and well done the Devs for a fast fix. Will find out when i get home and hopefully be another epic'd shammy.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gnawl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It is fixed I zoned in a found a dead nadox corpse there.. waited 2 hours and zoned out and in again.. got emote and nadox popped.
