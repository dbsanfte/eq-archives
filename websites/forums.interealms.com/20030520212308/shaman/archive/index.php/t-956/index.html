<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>tunes77</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Now that they have changed Cazic-Thule to a high lvl 50+ zone, how am I supposed to complete the Totemic Helm quest?  According to the info I have I need the glacier bear pelt from the caves in Everfrost Peaks and an item of a lvl &quot;20&quot; mob in Cazic-Thule.  Is that mob still there and still level 20?  If the zone is geared to lvl 50+ characters now, what chance do I have of getting it?  Or has the quest item changed and is dropped somewhere else?  My shaman is level 26 and is jst starting to gather the items for the various pieces.  Thanks for any help.<br />

I have no idea how it works, since there aren't even close to half the mobs outside that there are inside, but supposedly everything is there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I saw a Lizard Page standing on one of the temples outside Cazic-Thule, surrounded by a few other lizards. I killed him on a whim, and he didn't drop the Ogre Chamois, but I would hope that after a few tries, he would. I would bring a group, or be of a level that the lizards are green, as I don't think you'll find a Page standing alone.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I happened to have the rest of the ingredients for a 2nd totemic helm, so when I was running through the swamp soon after the patch, I offed the 2 pages that I could see on top of a pyramid...  2nd had the chamois.  In true form, I only get lucky when I really couldn't care less if I got it or not. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Korman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yes, the Lizard Pages still drop the chamois.  Just like the previous poster, seem to get stuuf quickly when I really dont need it!  )  I was running through Feerott and looted a chamois off a page's corpse that was rotting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>mdbarbus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i finally got the ogreskin chamois. Only had to kill 17 of the pages. thanks all just didnt' think they were dropping the skin anymore.</div></div><hr />
