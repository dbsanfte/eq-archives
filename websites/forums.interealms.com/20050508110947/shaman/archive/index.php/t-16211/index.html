<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>LucidX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi I have a lvl 30 vah shir shaman. I just got my befriend animal spell to get my pet. I was wondering what animal should I charm to make a good pet?</div></div><hr />

Seriously befrend animal isnt worth the hastle. But if you are really serious about it just try casting it on an animal and if it sticks go with that one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Main problem with that spell is its level restriction.  The mobs you will be casting that spell on will most likely have a level range that crosses the max level that the spell with affect so will get you a mob your not able to charm when you were expecting to have a new best friend.  That charm spell for me never lasted more then 30 seconds it seemed.  I would just tough it out a few more levels and get your true best friend Mr. dog dog.<br />
<br />
PS. It only affects mobs I think up to level 25ish range or so.  All I really remember was I could not charm a single mob in Veleious (cougers &amp; Walrus) due to they were all too high a level.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not entirely sure you can use Befriend Animal effectively even at 29....although I cant recall what the level limit of the animal mob is at the moment.<br />
<br />
  If I recall correctly though its a very limited spell for us....more of a fun type spell.  I use to like to charm bats just to...well, have a bat pet. :)</div></div><hr />

I thought trolls were supposed to be the most evil of the shaman races, but it turns out it was barbarians the whole time!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Grimlikans in LoIo are great, and they will beat the pulp out of your first summoned pet, you can still get a couple levels of exp there if you want, but don't recomend that anymore</div></div><hr />

<br />
I doubt you're serious anyway, but does the level restriction on 51+ spells count on charmed mobs?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Level restrictions dont apply to pets or npcs, only players.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I remember the gators in CT being somewhat possible to charm, don't recall how many of them crossed the level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Not since CT revamp.<br />
<br />
The only area i recall 29 charm works is LoiO, which is bad exp at level 30. At level 34 charm works on tigresses in OT which is quite useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Not since CT revamp.<br />
<br />
Nope, of course not, only mentioned it to give a reference of the approx level.<br />
As a side note, before the famous Befriend nerf erm fix, you could charm bats in SolB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">about the only combat use of charisma ... buff yourself with CHR when charming, suppossedly it helps the charm last longer, debuff the mobs MR as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Juff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I charmed hoppers in MSeru for a bit - was nice damage output, bit of a PITA though.<br />
<br />
And charmed skunk in Toxx &gt; charmed moss snake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>blakkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">You can also charm sabretooth Grimalkins in Lake of Ill Omen, use malise line and cha buffs to get it to stick a little better.  Also pretty useful in South Karana, get elephants....<br />
<br />
Not a lot better than a toy unfortunately, but you can practice pet control. <br />
<br />
When playing with charmed pets, always keep root ready as you wont want to slow. Let the pet use itself up.. take a lot of damage, then kill it when charm breaks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>LucidX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">OK so I should wait till I get charm animal at lvl 34? I'm sort of a newbie so I didn't know, I thought this was the way I got my pet. I charmed some low lvl bats in Qeynos Hills that worked but as someone else said that's just for fun that wouldn't actually help in a battle. Thanks for the help. :O)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The only time I ever used the animal charm was in South Karana at lvl 29 when I was hunting Chargers for the hoof chip for the Totemic quests. I was able to easily charm Bull Elephants and they were always dead long before charm droped. :) But it gave me enough time to lay everything I had on the Charger before he turned on me. Worked prety nice and was a very good return for the mana cost of the spell.</div></div><hr />

At level 34 you get a summon companion spell that summons a pet much like a mage/necro/beastlord/sk. The charm spell is left over from way way way back (like summer of '99) when Shaman had the actual spell Charm and there were no charm level limits. Then it changed to the animal deal and then level limits went in. The level 29 Befriend Animal is the only charm spell now for shaman, only druids get the higher level versions.<br />
<br />
As someone who went up against NPC shaman before the charm changes, it was a 'good thing'(tm).<br />
