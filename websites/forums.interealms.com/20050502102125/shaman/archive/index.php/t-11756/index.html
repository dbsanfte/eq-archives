<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hagle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm just wondering what was biggest let down in PoP for everyone. Mine was the fact that we're not the king power soloers anymore, I atribute this to our lack of healing upgrade ie quiessence. Charm classes solo stuff we could never hope to solo. I do have other things like the lack of zones to exp in but thats not my biggest let down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fozy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think the serperation it has caused from friends with flags and such for me was the biggest let down.  Where a group of friends used to go and do stuff all the time others would rather go into higher tiered planes and such.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Helios</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Mine was the way they implemented slow mitigation to bring all slowers closer together in terms of effectiveness. Now shaman seem like a kind of fill in for a key class you might be missing like cleric/enchanter, but they don't really bring anything unique or especially valuable in an optimum group. For example, the trials..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Flagging. Flagging separates friends, makes it impossible to take a couple weeks off the game for RL and basically ends with the top 1 or 2 guilds on a server having a 5 or 6 zone private playground. Im sure thats just what they wanted when they did the beta test feedback. It basically ****s you if you are a more casual high end player. It ****s you if you take a week off and miss flagging events. It ****s you if you dont have time to spend 300 hours camping greens for key parts to do the alternate flagging quest(which by the way ****s you in its own way by not being able to progress past it once you are in). Dont mind me, just bitter about being a Prophet stuck with 4 zones total to grind out the umpteen millionth AA point that wont actually improve my character much at all.<br />
<br />
Slow mitigation.. I dont mind this.. frankly slow was absurdly overpowered as it was. Cept where mobs were totally immune and it was totally useless.. this is a nice inbetween for some mobs.<br />
<br />
Other then flags my biggest bitch about pop is Enchanters. I hate them. Screw them and their charmed pets that out DPS entire groups of DPS classes, them and their soloing for Ornate BP's and Legs. It makes me wish Enchanters werent permitted to do anything but vend C3 in the bazaar. I loathe them and want their class wiped out of EQ. Or at least raped of their charm spells. =p<br />
<br />
Bright side: Tnargs Mending(spell still makes me giddy.. specially when I crit it while spam healing a MT in a boss fight heh). Quiescience. True spirit. Breath of Ultor. The new group haste and group shrink. And the best bright side is being able to visit old raid content with smaller forces(ntov etc). Which is basically all I have time for.. a saturday or sunday afternoon where we zip in and kill 3 or 4 dragons and call it a day. Fun, and even allows someone without a ****ton of weekday playtime to participate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Flagging gets my vote for biggest let down.  HAlf of my guild is flagged, the other half is still in Hot/Ssra.  We hardly ever do any real raids anymore..just a group or two here or there.  Getting asked to come to slow for some guildies only to find that I cant cause I havent been flagged yet.   <br />
<br />
Getting flagged is a pain in the ass too, cause I hate subjecting the same people to the trials over and over again.  I think after the 5th group or so the ones that were helping get others flagged gave up in boredom.<br />
<br />
And although Im not there yet, I am disapointed with Quiescience.  What other class has gotten an upgrade like that....same damn spell...just without 2 effects.  Its just plain silly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well. Quiescience looks like a ****ty upgrade on paper.. but really its cut above on torpor lol</div></div><hr />

The seperation of freinds sucks, good idea gone wrong...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>icebain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ok it took me 18 months to get to 60, during that time I forght all over the Place, made lots of friends did quests, tradeskills died alot came up with mad Corpse reteaval plans and had a great time. Now i meet people in Pon who have no idea, they got to level 25 in 2 weeks (in PC) and have not looked back, they have never quested never felt the joy of making your own first armour upgrade, its kinda sad realy. Then they hang about with me for a bit and then Poof they get flagged for Tier 2 and i never see them again. Will they be playing in another year i doubt it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">While trials are pretty high(why not make alternative frickin trials, you did it with hedge maze), I have to say  making ALL previous content obsolete sucked.<br />
<br />
<br />
PoP exp is nice, and solved alot of the grinding problems(I love to raid, I absolutely hate to exp), but places like Ssra, SG, DN, ToV(god forbid you actually snag some decent xp while raiding), HS CT...etc..should be bumped up to better match first tier exp modifier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Slow mitigation(Shaman's death). Sub par healing upgrades(Low desirability in groups and crippled soloing ability). <br />
No debuff enchancements through AA's or Foci(Malos is no enhancement, Grummus is nice, but when you have to Grummus, you know the encounter is designed with it in mind, and you can't solo anything that only allows Grummus in PoP.<br />
<br />
No reduction in Fizzle and Resist rate for my DoT's even though they are the worst out there(reason being my oh so ****ing overpowered mana regen)<br />
Still no passive mana regen(Active mana regen(Canni) needed to get a significant upgrade, if you didn't plan on giving us a passive way to regain mana beyond meditating).<br />
<br />
Healing upgrade is sub par as i already mentioned, but Q is a joke of an upgrade. Torpor was godly, but was restricted in its use. Q should be healing 1 k/tick with side effects or 600/tick without them, if you want it to be as important and necessary as Torpor was back then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Maybe I am the only one, but I havent had this fun in eq in ages as I have now.. It might be that I switched guild and login only to raid. I never/seldom exp anymore, I just login, run to e-plane.. get in raid and love my time. Im having a blast atm.. Sorry all who doesnt :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">agree Salorm<br />
<br />
Although I have just started my flagging exp.  But it does suck when I realize that I'm faced with the fact that if I miss a raid for a flag...I am ****ed.  We just killed Mith Marr last night..and oh, damn, I had to work, so I am not flagged for that.  I'm sure that we will go back to do it again as soon as he repops..but what good does that do me cause I know that there is a chance that I will miss it again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I love and hate flags.  I love being able to go to a zone with few trains, great exp, and where names have not been invented for every little nook and cranny that people hit for exp ala Sebilis (&quot;camp check pls&quot;).<br />
<br />
I hate the fact that it takes a whopping 30+ peeps in raid just to get someone missing a flag into that zone and you are basically still screwed if you miss a flagging event.  Flags should have been something that could be picked up and saved for those who missed the event by guildleaders and such.<br />
<br />
The biggest let down for PoP was the wishy-washy spell list.  The spell structure for 61+ needed more attention and creative thought put into it.  Just following the same old template of providing upgrades to stats/rains/DoTs was not working to the point where SOE had to make basic changes to spells post-release.  Even spells like PE and Cripple that are worthy of upgrades were ignored.</div></div><hr />

You mean something like a alternative quest for a zone that maybe took a lil longer to do , but didnt require a huge raiding force ? Maybe like 1 group or something ?  ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, too bad you have to camp green con boring **** for umpteen million hours, only to find that getting flagged in the alternate fashion will mean you will never progress past that zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Vixy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Really, I get very sick of the class envy.<br />
<br />
We are an awesome class, the best there is, in my opinion.  We get great heals, slows, buffs, we solo amazingly!  If we had snare we would totally rule.    And probably be TOO powerful (much like chanters, who will be nerfed shortly).<br />
<br />
We still solo wonderfully, and let's face it, who WANTS to be the healer in a group? I sure don't.  I avoid anything but backup healing like the plague.  I have too many other things to do, like buff, debuff, slow, dot, nuke, manage agro.<br />
<br />
3k heal would have been nice, but I'm not upset over it.  I think Sony has FINALLY started listening to us, which makes me happy.  Group DA, Group shrink, Group speed and trash the worthless group str group dex spells! Yay!<br />
<br />
QS is going to rock when I eventually get it. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I am kinda stuck at trials - don't belong to a guild and PoN stuff is light blue.  I 2 box a lot and most of my crew is past 61 now and not much fun to sit in PoN and kill trees over and over, even though they drop thoase spiffy gloves (JK).  So I spend a lot of time with trader up and selling potg in nexxus, while I watch tv - the thrill is gone.  Hope I find something I enjoy to do in game - it has been my enjoyment for a very long time.  Really cannot bring myself to start a new character at this point -knowing a brick wall is waiting for him.  Pre PoP was ok for me - getting AA and good loot.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Imho as well as the alternate quests being there as an option, each major flag boss should drop a very small (Like 2 tops) TRADABLE items that can be handed in for that boss' flag.  This way if key people miss a key flag, np, they are not potentially screwed and you can still get them through.  The number would need to be kept low to stop the otherwise inevitable Ele plains flagging kit for sale in the bazaar from turning up though =)</div></div><hr />

1. The Holy Trinity is stronger than ever<br />
2. Classes that previously had trouble getting groups now have it even worse<br />
3. Flags, would work if it wasn't so poorly balanced in favor of dps classes.<br />
4. Want to move to the next tier?  Sorry, you need a 50 person raid to take down a level 70 god.<br />
5. Loot in Tier 1 and most of Tier 2 is a farce.<br />

The druid heal is my second.   I have heard they did this because we have slow.  This is a joke to me cause you dont see to many exp groups without some type of slower.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kialan Lecariuz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I've been hesitant to post on this topic, but might as well bring it up.<br />
<br />
My biggest, biggest gripe about PoP are the spell *durations*. Inconsistencies. The biggest example of this is...<br />
<br />
(Luclin) Talisman of Epuration  Level 58<br />
-increases PR/DR by 55<br />
-400 mana, 7 sec cast<br />
-lasts 2 hour 30 min<br />
<br />
(PoP &quot;upgrade&quot;) Talisman of the Tribunal Level 62<br />
-increases PR/DR by 65<br />
-500 mana, 7 sec cast time<br />
-lasts 1 hour. (Yes, that is one hour 30 minutes less duration than its &quot;inferior&quot; version. And it is a 10 point upgrade over epuration)<br />
------<br />
Now of course let's check the Druid equivalents:<br />
<br />
(Luclin) Circle of Seasons Level 58<br />
-increases CR/FR by 55<br />
-400 mana, 7 sec cast time<br />
-lasts 2 hour 30 min<br />
<br />
(PoP) Protection of Seasons Level 64<br />
inceases CR/FR by 72<br />
-450 mana, 7 sec cast time<br />
-lasts 2 hour 30 min<br />
<br />
Okay, now this is what I see:<br />
Shaman loses 1 hour 30 minute duration.<br />
Druid upgrades by 17 points CR/FR (while shamans gain 10), is 50 less mana to cast, and has the same duration as their previous spell.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
See something wrong there?<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, Focus of Soul/Focus of the Seventh loses 20 minutes duration over Focus of Spirit/Khura's Focusing.<br />
<br />
The druid equivalents stay the same duration.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have bug reported these, feedbacked them, emailed them, no avail. Things like this piss me off way beyond. A level 65 shaman hp buff lasting 1 hour 20 min LOL, what a joke. And the group stat buffs still lasting 1 hour 3 minutes. I have decided to not level above 60 until I find some good reason to do so. I am not accepting these BS spell &quot;upgrades&quot; which lasts hours less than their &quot;inferior&quot; predecessors. Then druids don't lose anything, they gain. /vomit</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Naarlina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">In many ways PoP was a GREAT expansion.  It provides alot of content, and surely for the highest end guilds they have tons of playgrounds.<br />
<br />
For the smaller guilds, there is still alot of exploring out there.  My guild rarely has more than 24 people online, and usually around 18.  We have been able to use PoP to strengthen everyone in the guild, and not only tackle Luclin/Velious mobs that were previously out of reach, but also go in and kill some of the new tough mobs in PoP.<br />
<br />
Here is my complaint though.  If you are level 65 and you are not in a guild, you probably only have 4-6 new zones to play in (getting flagged for PoV or PoS without a guild can be VERY difficult for some people.  They really screwed that flagging up making DPS matter so much.)  At 65, the only good place for xp without some flags is PoV and PoS.  Now, CoD and HoH alternate quests were fairly well done, as you can do them with a lesser group than needed for PoV/PoS (although more time is needed).<br />
<br />
The bottom line though, is there simply aren't enough zones for the non-uber guilds.  If you are unguilded you are probably looking at PoV/PoS and then CoD/HoH.  If you have a small guild you can throw in BoT.  <br />
<br />
It is my hope that Sony will follow up the good ideas they started in PoP with an expansion having more zones accessible to those in the non-uber guilds.  An expansion in the fall that has more Tier 1-2 type zones and fewer Tier 3-5 zones would be just the trick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">They should just remove the limitation of quest flags, so you can progress<br />
with quest flags similar to raid flags (for those crazy enough to spend the time  :D ).<br />
<br />
This different handling of the two ways of progression was a stupid idea from the beginning.<br />
<br />
And it wouldn't hurt to actually have mobs with loot (wow, what an idea) in tier1 and 2 zones<br />
(/sarcasm off). I don't consider one 80p-piece per hour for a full group as loot ... There are some nice, albeit very rare drops out there, but what is wrong with some 'normal' sellables?<br />
<br />
Can only agree to the stealth nerf of shaman mana costs with lower durations (/rude), didn't have the balls to say clearly as designer 'OK, we think shaman mana regen is too powerful, we tune it down', have we?<br />
<br />
Hehe, just realized, that the week with 'no SOE bashing' seems to be over for me  ;)</div></div><hr />

A sense of progresion is important, yes.  But there was that sense in Velious.  Sleeper's aside, Velious was unkeyed.  Yet you didn't have everyone slaughtering every ubermob etc willy-nilly, because the mobs were hard.  Hell, I am pretty sure that AoW was not killed on most servers until after Luclin.  Let the difficulty of the encounter by the gatekeeper, not some contrived and horribly inconvenient flag system.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">my biggest beaf are the experience modifiers.  I personally love fighting in CT, 4c is a great place for fast pace fighting of non-trivial mobs, with a rare chance for loot thrown in.<br />
But the experience is unacceptable compared to PoV or BoT, my estimate is a factor 10 minimum between the upper PoP zones and even the best &quot;old world dark blue&quot; camps.</div></div><hr />

with the group, not enough DPS (and would have to wait in line half<br />

Slow mitigation sucks. Slowing mobs is what we do!!! THAT's our main<br />

Chardok was always better exp then seb, but I always prefered the loot drops in Seb so I spent more time there.<br />
<br />
So far the of the 8 or so BoT minis I have taken out, the only thing that has dropped is spectrals and the key.  Not to mention they are only 4 of them and are only up every 6 hrs and are KSed like crazy.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I agree Flagging is the biggest problem. I'm now level 59. My guild has about 12 members who are more than half way through the planes and the rest just cannot get there for the quick leveling because of how brutal Trials is and how ridiculous some of the flagging procedures are.<br />
<br />
I'm just now getting several tells a day to come to tier 2 planes when I'm LFG. More tells for tier 2 than for tier 1. It's so frustrating. I really dont see how a shaman is supposed to get to tier 2 without a guild or really high level friends to baby sit him through it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Flags, without a doubt.

Hey, c'mon:<br />

Now that's what I call PIE.<br />

PoP disappointed me because it split everyone up.  Half my friends either stopped playing or mostly play alts.  Once a week I sacrifice a nite to total boredom buffing trials groups for my guild.  It's the least I can do, since they had to hand-pick a high DPS group to get MY sorry ass through.  But if I watch one more trials group fail because someone snuck their lvl 55 frickin bot in again...<br />
<br />
I think if you're in a guild who's moving on through the elemental planes you're probably having fun.  If you're not so lucky, things are really stagnating.  PoP was a mistake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">my guild is not the top guild on the server, but we took the time to get everyone through the pov/pos/bot/hoh/cod/tactics flaggings.  we have back flagged a lot and are still flagging for tactics.  there are maybe 2 people in the guild who don't play a lot and consistantly miss flaggins.  i do see a lot of my friends in underpowered guilds getting left behind..meaning grouping with them to xp it tough.  pop does split friends who aren't in the same guild up.<br />
<br />
i agree with the sub par loot in lower teir planes as well as the over powered charm which the new nerf didn't solve...well it did sort of with mages...<br />
<br />
i like the progression of flags...72 people/flag limit is stupid for the guilds who are allied or raid with more than 72 people.  i like how the camp time for keys was reduced...ie compare the tower of saryrn key to VP or VT for that matter.<br />
<br />
after they changed our spelll list post 60 the only thing i am wishing we had was a shaman 3k heal and a druid 4k heal...maybe some form of the bear that is stackable with the horse would be cool :)  otherwise i am pritty happy with pop.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bah.  That's just silly.  Sure, chanters kick a lot of ass with CoD...but clerics and warriors aren't needed, and neither are enchs, if they're not charming (and most don't outside of BoT).  Last night we were doing a guild group in PoV.  At first, it was me and a monk (has about 3400 hp) duoing.  He'd pull, kite it around in front of me while I maloed and slowed, then I'd heal him with quies.  Rarely had to use Tnarg's.  Then we gathered more, including a war, paladin, and cleric.  Then those three left eventually, and it was down to Me, the monk, a ranger, and a bard.  I still never had to take a med break except right after Fo7 casts.<br />
<br />
And the exp was better with just the 4 of us, no plate tank, no ench/cleric/druid, than with our previous full group.<br />

This brings me to my next point.  People who whine about quiescence being a poor upgrade.<br />
<br />
Most of the people I see bitching about it are level 55 or some such, who haven't even gotten torpor yet.  The only people who I can see as having a real gripe with Quies are the ubers with 9k-10k buffed tanks and 6-7k buffed casters.  Quies is an awesome spell...I can be main healer and slower in a tier 2 or 3 group, provided the tank isn't some newb with as much hp as me or something.   :p  Just like smoking crack, don't knock it til you've tried it.   :D</div></div><hr />

It's currently the only 60+ content in the game. There is no PoP-lite where the exp isn't insane but there are no flags, for example. And you can't just stay at 60 and go 100% AA (believe me; I and many others tried in the beginning) because human nature drives people to do what's new even if it might be better not to. You end up being left behind, which sucks hard in a massively multiplayer game.</div></div><hr />
