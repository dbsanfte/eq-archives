<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Syklopz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm looking for advise about some video cards.  I'm looking to get a geforce4 agp card 64 or 128.  Here are the cards I'm looking at getting:<br />
<br />
PNY Verto GeForce4 MX 420 64MB SDRAM AGP Graphics Card — VCGF4MX42A<br />
AGP interface; 64MB SDRAM memory; 2.7GB/sec. memory bandwidth; nVidia Shading Rasterizer; nView multidisplay technology; Accuview Anti-Aliasing<br />
 ThinkAbout™ It<br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
    PNY Verto GeForce4 Ti 4200 64MB DDR AGP Graphics Card — VCGF4TI42A<br />
64MB DDR memory; 8.0GB/sec. memory bandwidth; Lightspeed Memory Architecture II; nVidia nfiniteFX II engine and nView display technology<br />
 ThinkAbout™ It<br />
<br />
 <br />
 <br />
    PNY Verto GeForce4 Ti 4400 128MB DDR AGP Graphics Card — VCGF4TI44Z<br />
128MB DDR memory; 8.8GB/sec. memory bandwidth; Lightspeed Memory Architecture II; nfiniteFX II engine; nView display technology<br />
 <br />
Now, I noticed there is a difference on performance.  The memory bandwidth is a significant difference.  But, what I was wondering, is there an actual visual difference between these?<br />
<br />
Cuz I'm kinda wanting to spend under $100 for a vid card cuz I have some best buy cards to pay for them.  I currently have a voodoo5 5500 AGP 64mb card.  If I got the geforce4 agp 64mb sdram, would I notice a difference in performance?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kryscha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hell yeah there's a difference.  MX cards are basically GF2's with a few modifications.  With such a small bandwidth and slow speed, you're going to find EQ will get graphic lag quite often.<br />
<br />
If you're getting a GF of any kind, always go the pure one (ie Ti4200) as opposed to MX cards. (if you can afford it of course... if not, save up.. the performance difference is worth it)<br />
<br />
For example, I was running on a P3 733 with 356MB memory a GF2 GTS.  The performance difference between it and my friends GF4MX was negligible.  I upgraded the GTS to a GF4Ti4200 64MB, and the difference is AMAZING.  I am able to run with several Luclin models on, no graphic lag that I've noticed except bazaar, and all this on a P3 733. (now, if I upgrade the CPU and M/B to a P4, I should notice another increase in performance)<br />
<br />
So yes, there is a big difference between the two.  But go with your budget.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The Raedon 9700 is also quite good... but of course more expensive.  If you looking for top of the line geforce is also releasing a new one here for the holidays I believe that will blow the rest out of the water.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tulson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have a a GF 4400 128.  For all other games (Quake, Wolfenstein, etc.) it is amazing running 1500 res.  <br />
<br />
For EQ?  Have not seen a huge difference.  I usally run 1024, max textures and all models on.  Good perfromance, but still get major lag in areas like Bazaar, PoN, etc.<br />
<br />
I suggest you wait until after christmas and get the 4400.  Should drop in price then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Avoid the MX like the plague.<br />
<br />
If you want to go for decently priced by a true geforce 4.<br />
<br />
If you want what is currently the best get the ATI9700.<br />
<br />
<br />
That sums up the video card market.<br />
<br />
If you want more detailed info go to www.tomshardware.com<br />
<br />
They have awesome video card reviews and other hardware too. A great site.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>throxis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I upgraded video and memory both within a shourt amount of time and I noticed much better performance from the memory upgrade, 256 &gt; 512 SDRAM than my video upgrade 32MB Radeon LE DDR &gt; Gainward Golden Sample 128MB TI4200. In fact the vid card made almost no noticeable difference on EQ...now UT2K3 is a WHOLE different story ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Syklopz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm already at 512mb of RAM.  Friend of mine is getting me WinXP Pro.  Maybe I'll just buy another 512 or so instead.  What do you all think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gruog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You'll never use more than 512megs.  I would avoid a 9700 for eq.  I had a 9700 and returned it becaue the performance in EQ was worse than my ti4200.  For every other game though the 9700 is the   shizznits.... So if you play only eq, go for a gTi4600.   If you play other games consider a 9700.</div></div><hr />

Hehe I decided I'm going to buy a GeForce 4 Ti 4600 to replace my &quot;Intel Graphics Controller&quot; :)</div></div><hr />
