<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Shaman Equipment - Common Upgrade Path<br />
<br />
Many questions posted on these forums pertain to suggestions on equipment upgrades. We have decided to create a list of the most common equipment upgrade paths by slot for our Shaman brothers and sisters.<br />
<br />
I will be continually revising and updating this list according to the corrections and changes of the contributors that will be posting below.<br />
<br />
This list is NOT to be considered a full list of Shaman equipment, just the most commonly available and commonly used options.<br />
<br />
Notes: I don't want this thread to turn into a AC/HP vs. WIS debate, so let me mention right from the beginning that items will be listed on this thread by usefulness, lowest to highest, with a strong bias towards AC/HP. I have seen effective &quot;Wis&quot; Shamans, and I understand and agree that Wisdom is important, but only in a secondary nature in my opinion. I will be more than happy to listen to suggestions why one piece of gear is more useful than another, but ultimately the order of the items listed here will be based on my opinion. The buck has to stop somewhere. When an item &quot;does&quot; have additional Wisdom, the Wisdom bonus will be bold in the item listing.<br />
<br />
Giant Scalemail Sleeves (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=3942): +11 AC, +3 Wis, -3 Int, +20 HP Races: All Races<br />
<br />
As time allows, I will also be linking the items to their entry on Allakhazam's as shown above.<br />
<br />
**************************************************<br />
<br />
Equipment Criteria<br />
<br />
Droppable<br />
To appear on the list, an item must be droppable. No Velious quest armor, for example.<br />
<br />
Value<br />
The monetary &quot;platinum&quot; value of items is being ignored for the most part. Server prices vary, and trying to track those variations would be futile.<br />
<br />
Resists<br />
Resistance gear is important, but specific to certain situations and not generally used for everyday experience hunting, thus you will not find resistance-specific items on this list, i.e. Blue Diamond gear.<br />
<br />
Commonly Available<br />
Items on the list must be commonly available.<br />
<br />
<br />
**************************************************<br />
If an item is usable by one race, its listing below will be color-coded per the below key.<br />
<br />
Blue = if the item is Barbarian only.<br />
Green  = if the item is Iksar only.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Some other arms commonly used: <br />
Hardened Grey Flesh <br />
Sebilite Scale (iksar)<br />
Nathsar<br />
Barbed Ringmail</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">More arms:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You can slip Ulthork Arms in there right after banded.<br />
<br />
Also first exception would be supple scale armband for focus effect, resist, and its (hate to admit it) pretty darn high mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I am hesitant about listing all the gear of a certain type, like the Dragonspine Vambraces. I am thinking from the standpoint of an &quot;Upgrade Path&quot; as in if I had item A what would be my next upgrade.<br />
<br />
I don't see many people going from Worked just to Reinforced, although that is certainly an upgrade. Do we want to emphasize the &quot;Upgrade&quot; or the &quot;Common&quot; in Common Upgrade?<br />
<br />
Although the merits of having the list complete has its merits as well.<br />
<br />
Please give me your thoughts on this...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">How about somthing like:<br />
<br />
Worked/Reinforced/Heavy/Matchless/Peerless Dragonspine Vambraces +15/16/17/18/19 AC, +8/9/10/11/12 Str, +4/5/6/7/8 vs Disease</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">one thing that would be nice is a table with a list of all the different shaman armor types (totemic, scaled mystic, JB, planar, velius quest, etc) in excel or something.<br />
<br />
But what id really like to see is a finalized table of point values for different stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i gather u are seperating tradeable armour, from quest armour<br />
<br />
which is a good idea!<br />
<br />
really thers 3 categories:<br />
<br />
mob droped/tradable<br />
<br />
mob droped/ no drop<br />
<br />
quest items(no drop)<br />
<br />
smithied (tradeable)<br />
<br />
errr ok thats 4  lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Heres the arms that match the criteria and are only wearable by Iksar shaman should you want to include.<br />
<br />
Sebilite Scale Vambraces  +12 AC +4 Agi +4 Dex +2 vsFire +2 vsPos <br />
