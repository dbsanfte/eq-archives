<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xtraez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys, got a quick question for ya. I play a shaman, and I use a Spine Chill Spear in my primary spot and a Slime Coated Harpoon in my range slot. Question is when I want to use the range weapon it tells me either a.) the target is to far away, or b.) the target is to close. What gives? I've made a hot button for the range slot but everytime I use it I get the same results. Am I suppose to throw the spear or does it work like a secondary slot? Oh by the way I'm a level 26 shammy and lots of things are still new to me. Thanks.</div></div><hr />

If you could use it, it would be thrown and &quot;not&quot; returned, so it would get quite expensive to keep throwing your equipment at mobs.</div></div><hr />
