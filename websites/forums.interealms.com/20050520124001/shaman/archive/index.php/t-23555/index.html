<br />
Apparently the new titles are in for competed epic 1.5 and 2.0:<br />
 <br />
Ranger - Windcaller<br />
Paladin - Lightbringer<br />
Beastlord - Feralkin<br />
Shadowkinght - Pain Lord<br />
Bard - Composer<br />
Enchanter - Mindbender<br />
Wizard - Acolyte<br />
Magician - Thaumaterge<br />
Monk - Transcendent<br />
Warrior - Champion<br />
Rogue - Ragebringer<br />
Cleric - Deacon<br />
Druid - Naturewalker<br />
Shaman - Heyokah<br />
<br />
Its test server, so the could change.  They REALLY need to change the wizard one, as an alcolyte is an assistant to a priest, which is not what wizards are.  Also notice that Berzerkers didnt make the list.<br />
<br />
Heyokah kicks ass though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>jeyche Deychundei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">the wizard one should be Thaumaterge not the mage...<br />
mage should be something like elementalist like one of their lvl titles<br />
<br />
also<br />
<br />
Enchanter - Mindbender<br />
<br />
thats such a LAME name... we all know every enchanter wants to be called mistress/master</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think they meant for Magician to be Thaumaturge - performer of miracles.<br />
<br />
Rogue... how original.  Title them after their epic... Geez. <br />
<br />
Deacon sucks too.  Naturewalker is bad, but I can't think of anything better right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">ac·o·lyte   Audio pronunciation of &quot;acolyte&quot; ( P )  Pronunciation Key  (k-lt)<br />
n.<br />
<br />
   1. One who assists the celebrant in the performance of liturgical rites.<br />
   2. A devoted follower or attendant.<br />
<br />
<br />
Guessing SOE means number 2 here for wizards.  Perhaps their epic 2.0 is a familiar or something?  Or maybe just a drunk party girl that follows them around.  Never know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">These titles are apparently available to characters that have completed their epic 1.0.  These are not the titles you have to earn through AA or quests or whatever.  Here's a link to the thread on Graffe's. (http://www.graffe.com/forums/showthread.php?t=21783)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>kilher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">what about nec?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">In the original threads it mentions that the person did not know an epic'd necromancer so could not see the title.  Similar situation with Berserker.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">That's cool - how will one change one's title though?<br />
<br />
Graffe's doesn't say...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I got the impression it was a matter of talking to someone, and having completed your epic.  It's an optional title.</div></div><hr />

<br />
enjoy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">ohhh I'd definitely choose heyokah over elder  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Same here.  Since the Heyokah are the Native American Shaman that communicate with the spirit world, specifically, the &quot;Thunder Spirits&quot; it would definitely be my title of choice.  <br />
<br />
&quot;The word heyokah comes from the Lakotah (Sioux) and is used in reference to a particular type of shaman. According to tradition, the heyokah is one who has &quot;dreamed of the Thunder Spirits.&quot; This dream bestows great powers upon the medicine man/medicine woman.&quot;<br />
<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Hoping they add Dar Khura to the selectable list for us kitties.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Windcaller is stupid.  I hope I can keep Hunter as my ingame name appears as Hunter Grendalkhan Rose.  Go read Matt Wagners Grendal for a explanation.</div></div><hr />

 :) <br />
<br />
So I guess my title will be Heyokah Dekurgen Heyokah.<br />
<br />
Echo?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Hmmm Didn't Ryu from Street Fighter say Heyokah when he shot out a fireball?<br />
<br />
Wasn't it more like Ha-du-kin or something along those lines? Can't remember its been so long hehe :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes it was.. but it sounds close, I just thought it was funny:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">One translation of Heyokah is, in fact, &quot;holy clown&quot;, but you have to understand the context in which that term is used. In some of the southwestern US tribes (IIRC specifically its Hopi, though it could be Zuni, or both) the Heyokah, or holy clown, is a very important part of the religious structure, having the job of reminding the population of their humility, of their place in the order of things. They act in some ways as a trickster, humbling the mighty and keeping everything in context. The provide &quot;balance.&quot;<br />
<br />
In that light, I think Heyokah in an imminently appropriate title.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">heyokah is sooo stupid!!<br />
<br />
people who obviously have never even looked at the original epic quest should keep their mouths shut  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
and yes im aware of his other post :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Gudin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Hmmm Didn't Ryu from Street Fighter say Heyokah when he shot out a fireball?<br />
<br />
nah, that'd be the Hadouken</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Ice762</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">fitting name seeing how shm abilities are laughable</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>vincenzovs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I think Heyokah is an excellent Epic title, given that this is what Shamans who complete the epic quest are actually called.<br />
<br />
I hate sharing Elder with Beastlords and Druids, Heyokah here I come!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Maitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Cool ... Heyokah, the most fitting title they could find.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Agrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I agree Heyokah is a good tital for us, but it seems most of the others are a little flat...  and I know this idea was mentioned here a long time ago, maybe they ran with our idea but just couldnt come up with suitable names for the others.  They need to poll the other classses about what they want to see in a tital.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Just to clear up the Thunder Spirit and Holy Clown translations for Heyokah, you're getting about half of it each.<br />
<br />
  A Heyokah sees the Thunder Spirits in his vision quest (a ritualistic 3 to 5 days alone in the wilderness with no food or drink.  It places one at the very brink of death so they are brought close enough to the spirits that their own personal guardian spirit can manage direct contact.  The spirit who appears is used as an indicator of your life path).<br />
<br />
  If you see the Thunder Spirit during a vision quest, that is the greatest honor.  The Thunder Spirit represents life itself (as opposed to seeing the greater spirit of a simple animal form which can mean anything from the Owl's Teacher, Bear's Healer or Wolves Hunter).  The Heyokah is the greatest of all teachers for the tribe, and the strongest of healers.  The &quot;price&quot; for this power however is that he becomes the Holy Clown, or Opposite Man.  All his reactions are the opposite that would be standard.<br />
<br />
  So if it was a clear cloudless day with the sun beating down on the village, he stumbles about as if in the darkest night.  If it is snowing outside he dresses in only a loincloth and grumbles about the heat.<br />
<br />
<br />
  Of course, the spirit quest is only one of the ways that tribes use to select their jobs, in some tribes it is simply your own dreams that determine it and that person simply dreams of thunder.  I recall reading about one in which you had to pull the entrails of a dog from boiling water, but a Heyokah would always end up with the heart and (more importantly) his body would not scald from the boiling water.<br />
<br />
<br />
  Anyway, maybe us all being Heyokah explains the hundreds of newbie nekkid barbarians in the middle of Halas taking their sweet time to get to their body and gear... they are simply too hot! :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I know I saw a portrayal of this in a movie once. The man washed with sand instead of water, and rode his horse backwards.<br />
<br />
I thought it was Little Big Man, but I can't find a reference to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Perhaps I'm slow and missed it somewhere ... but does anyone know where the Epic title will go on our names? Will it replace the AA title (Baron/Venerable/Elder) or will it be put alongside them?<br />
<br />
/bow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">One title I'd love to see for those with a Medallion of the Hero of Shar Vahl is &quot;Hero&quot; (maybe) or those with an Officer's Cloak of Service (Military Officer). I'd prefer &quot;Royal Guard&quot; over &quot;Heyokah&quot; personally (having both the medallion and cloak ;) ), but that sounds more like a pally title (similar to Lord Protector).<br />
<br />
After reading the rest of the thread... Dar Khura would be good too.</div></div><hr />

It replaces your current one. And since the NDA is lifted I can say you just have to hit shift+t and select from all the titles you've unlocked. Its a fun little system, but nothing big.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>gnarishal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Yes Samanna, it was Little Big Man :) will have to watch it later to see if I can pull the referenced name out.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Meglo Maeneac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Maybe we're looking too deeply into the Heyokan thing.. After all, our entire epic quest was about becoming Heyokan.. could just be an extension of that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Heh.<br />
<br />
So, can you change titles at will, is it a one-time thing, or what?</div></div><hr />

On Beta, you could change it whenever you wanted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Wazbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">That would be cool if they put in titles for old quests such as the qeynos badges.  My ranger did the Qeynos badges and they were loads of fun.  You could also put them in for the Necklace quests for priests.  Or the 8th Shawl, or 10th Ring.  The possibilities are endless and could produce some real cool titles.  But knowing SOE it will probably only be put in on new quests and not in Old School quests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">How fun, to change your title to Baron(ess) (or nothing), and have people think you only a couple (or no) AAs. <br />
<br />
At least then when I go /anon and equip my Runed Heretic Longsword and Parrying Daggar, I might actually fool someone.</div></div><hr />
