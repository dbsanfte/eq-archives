<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hobo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, true to my word I created a shaman to eventually two box with my monk.  Last night, with a lot of help (thanks Fen!) Hobo managed to ding 20.  However, to be frank with you all, Hobo is not a talented shaman.  He is simply intended (for the most part) to be a 2-boxed companion to his monk friend.  He hopes to gain talent slowly as he occasionally will break out on his own for the fun of xping in a group.<br />
<br />
But Hobo also wants to learn the intricacies (sp) of his class as he is begining to enjoy his role more and more and may in fact one day be called upon as a main.  So I turn to the shaman community once again for advice, direction and help.  I read, and read, and read, and as such I have more and more and more questions.   Please, your advice is very much appreciated...<br />
<br />
1.  What specific role does Hobo play, other than that of buffer and slower?  <br />
<br />
2.  Hobo has heard (and read) that he can be nearly as effective as an enchanter in terms of crowd control.  How does this work?  Hobo's friend has heard the term &quot;ghetto chanter&quot; used in reference to Hobo, but Hobo lives in the railroad yard, not the ghetto.  What gives?<br />
<br />
3.  Hobo's monk friend told him that Acumen, next to haste, is a monks best friend.  What, exactly, makes Acumen so good?  A simple STA regen doesn't improve DPS nor HP, so what good is Acumen?  Are there any lower level versions of Acumen for the middle age shaman?  Hobo can't seem to find one.<br />
<br />
4.  Hobo's goal is to reach level 50 with a week, as Hobo's monk friend has lots of free time between now and then to help PL Hobo.  What advice would you give Hobo's friend to help Hobo?<br />
<br />
5.  What statistical goals (wis, sta, str, etc., etc.) and skills should Hobo strive for as he quickly gains levels?<br />
<br />
6. Can Hobo expect to level faster if he simply solo's instead of relying on his monk friend to feign the xp to him? <br />
<br />
7.  Where can Hobo go to learn which types of dots stack with each other to effectively solo or increase the rate of kills in groups?<br />
<br />
<br />
As always, thanks for your input!</div></div><hr />

A lot of wisdom on this thread.<br />
<br />
1&gt;    many roles - depends on situation.  see above thread<br />
2.     see &quot;Root park&quot;<br />
3.     ??? you got me on that one.  invigor will restore STA - is that a problem for a monk?  I use acumen for see invis/UV for blind races.  is your monk night blind?<br />
4.     ugh.  check the hunting grounds forums.<br />
5.     I like ac and hp, myself.   regen is most important, period.<br />
6.     with the monk's help you will kill faster, therfore level faster.<br />
7.     all of our dot's stack with each other.  and with the same dot from another shaman/necro.  but you cannot stack two of the identical dot - that is, you cannot stack two Tainted Breath cast by one shaman.  But you could stack tainted breath, envenomed breath, EBolt and Bane of Nife.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do the same dots from DIFFERENT shamans stack?  In other words if I was grouped with another shaman could we both cast the same dots and they would both stack, or would one over write the other?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

Yes, as of a patch several months ago.  Not before then though.</div></div><hr />
