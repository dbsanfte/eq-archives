<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>wickibet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello everyone-<br />
<br />
I am a 39 Shaman, new to EQ(this is my first charachter) and I would like to know how I can increase my piercing(92).  I know I have to fight to do it, but I was wondering if I should go against a ton of greens for a few hours/day that can't really hurt me but I can just stand there and melee til the sun comes up, or do I have to take on LB or DB mobs for it to increase?<br />
<br />
Many thanks for he help.<br />

<br />
There's a school of thought that says the higher the mob, the more likely a skill increase, but I'm not sure how true that is.<br />
<br />
It shouldn't be too hard to increase skill on mobs if you're grouped though, or if you tank-solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hi there,<br />
<br />
Actually you are just about the perfect level to max out both your weapon skills and your defense (which is often overlooked and slow to raise).  The reason is the mobs still dont hit too hard compared to your level.<br />
<br />
Now, I very rarely suggest soloing because I think it is a bit boring and lacking in social interaction. But.......for the next 2 levels you should take puppy and hit the blue mobs in Overthere.  Just avoid the tigers - tigeress is fine. The best mobs are the cacti and the chickens<br />
<br />
You are the tank, puppy chews at the mob. No need to slow since the more hits you take the faster your defense skill will rise.  Make sure you keep dex strength and agi on you because they help raise weapon skills and defense.  This will teach you a few things which are invaluable:<br />
<br />
1)how to pull singles<br />
2)how to keep puppy alive<br />
3)how to park puppy and spam pet back off (lol)<br />
4)how to cast spells when you are in the face<br />
5)how to root park if you screw up<br />
6)how to appreciate a fast pulling group because this will seem a bit slow<br />
<br />
etc.etc.<br />
<br />
This may not seem to be that important to you now, but trust me these are the situations where you learn to be a good shaman and it carries over to grouping.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Onte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Weapons skills do actually raise on greens, but it's SO not worth the time.  Keep a dex and a haste on and just p0x0r in xp groups when you're able.  A friend recommended to me once that I find a high con guard in a city near a zone, poke on him a bit and zone when necessary.  The object is to not kill the thing, only poke on a yellow or red for the skill.  This works too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Skadi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">what i always did was in groups, debuff, dot whatever your doing in the group and then melee with the rest.  a week or so of that should have your melee skills maxed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hyperd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Use the guards in NL, they are still DB. Cripple them, have a high dex and regen on. Slow em too, melee away. Raised piercing from 0 (!) to 100 at 38.<br />
<br />
Easy, close to PoK, near zone, and easy to single pull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">HGs are good if you can fear kite them.  They gotta be snared too though.  Duo with an SK or necro.  You will get skill ups and make some nice pp at the same time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Max your DEX to increase your weapon skills faster.<br />
<br />
Max your AGI to increase defense faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Also use the lowest delay weapon you can get your hands on.  The smaller the delay the more times you’ll attack and the more chances you’ll have for a skill up.  If you are soloing and actually trying to kill the mob, you may have to balance delay with damage, but if you’re in a willing group or soloing something just for skill, don’t worry about the damage.  In fact, the less damage you do the longer the mob lives and the more practice you get.  <br />
<br />
At 61 I’m still trying to max out my weapon skills.  Offence and defense are both maxed, as is 1H blunt, but 2H blunt and piercing still need work.  I have a nice little camp of DB mobs I can solo with my puppy.  The xp isn’t great and the loot is even worst, but since I’m tanking my weapon skills are slowly improving.  So don’t sweat it too much if you don’t manage to max out your weapon skills every level.  Do so if you can, but its not going to hurt you that much if you don’t.  <br />
<br />
The main combat skill you need to worry about is your defense.  You may or may not spend a lot of time later on beating mobs about the head and shoulders with your weapon of choice.  But I can guarantee that you will have to deal with mobs in your fact while you’re trying to cast a spell.  The higher your defensive skill the better the chance that you’ll get that spell off.  So get up close and personal with those mobs whenever you get the chance and let them beat on you.  It’ll help toughen you up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">About the best weapon you can get to increase your piercing is a rune etched icewurm fang (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=25059).  In addition to the fast delay time, the weapon has a nice cold based DD that starts working at level 14.  They go for about 3k to 8k on my server.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rune etched icewurm fang doesn't proc at 14.  It procs at iether 30 or 35.  Shaman just get the spell Spirit Strike at 14.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>wickibet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hyperd mentioned going to NL to pester guards.  Do you mean Nethurbian lair?  Thanks to everyone else for the info.<br />
<br />
I am going to look into the icewurm fang. Anyone have any tips?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>wickibet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I am also wondering what you mean by cripple them?  Do you mean slow?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I am also wondering what you mean by cripple them?  Do you mean slow?<br />
<br />
cripple is a level 53 shaman spell that lowers ac, str, dex, agi by a large number.<br />
<br />
At level 44 you get incapacitate which is a lower version of the spell.<br />
<br />
These lower the damage dealt by a mob, you really don't want to be slowing them if you are simply out for the skill ups (as long as you can keep up with the healing) because you will be slowing the amount of chances you get per minute of a skill up occuring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Juff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Cripple as in our Disempower line, which culminates with Cripple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The disempower line wickibet, icon is a red cross swords.  At your level you probably have &lt;a href = &quot;http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=162&amp;source=Live&quot;&gt;Listless Power&lt;/a&gt;  That is commonly referred to as the Cripple line since Cripple is the top end spell.<br />
<br />
To raise piercing only, just solo for an hour or two a night using the &quot;in teh face&quot; method.  That will actually raise your defense as well, although not quite as fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">If you want to save a few plat get an Owlbear Feathered Spear  (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=11435)  instead of the REIF.  Delay is worse by 2 but still fast at 21 and won't break the bank.  Under 200pp on most servers and will get the job done nicely.<br />
<br />
The REIF is much better long term but since this is your first character plat is probably at a premium.<br />
<br />
If you have your Sonic Wolf Bane Spear (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=22562)  that would be even better for skill-ups since you can poke all day with that thing and not even scratch the mob.  (4/21 ratio as a reward for a 30 level tradeskill quest?  :eek:  What were they thinking? :mad: )</div></div><hr />
