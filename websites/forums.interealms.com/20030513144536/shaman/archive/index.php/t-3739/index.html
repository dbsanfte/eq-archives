<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Here's what I'm working with currently:<br />
<br />
http://ree.the-mad.net/ui_mods/cakaris/ui7-25-02.jpg <br />
<br />
A friend of mine fixed up the inventory to shrink it down a lot.  I messed around with the target and group windows (top right) to get rid of the headers, and the invite/follow/disband/decline buttons.  Downloaded the small effects window (also very handy).<br />
<br />
My next plans are to do something with the AA window (it's ungodly huge), and something with the spellbook.  Though if I can squeeze out some room, I'd really like to give Yzzy's spellbook UI a try, it looks awesome.  Ideally I'd like to be able to fit all 3 in the middle of the screen easily (1152 resolution).  Probably don't need the 2nd chat for melee (mine is slow / rare anyways).  Also thinking about splitting the spell bank to 2 columns instead of 1, that's gonna take a lot of getting used to.<br />
<br />
Spell icons are another thing I'd like to work on, I really don't like a lot of the new ones (though I'm sure I'll get used to it eventually).  Way too many hearts for my taste =)<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyone else have any interesting setups to show off?  Or some nice mods they know of / have written?  For anyone who hasn't seen, http://www.eqinterface.com has a decent selection of mods, and it'll only get better I'm sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>kowalsky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">on the same URL you provide you can find a smaller spellbook and also a 2 row spellgems.. this will save some more space :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Care to share your groupbox file?  I was trying to modify the default one to get rid of the buttons, but ended up crashing due to an xml error. ;)  Thought I got rid of all references to those pesky buttons, but missed one somewhere...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kudadan_MT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I definately like the inventory mod, your Player window is similar to the one I've done, and I did my own small buff window thing, same effect as that one though. Next up is that spell book. I've seen one mod that stripped out all the background crap and the buttons, will probably check that one out. Looks like you could eliminate a nice chunk of the AA window just by making the title column smaller. That's a lot of wasted space.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Could it be possible to put the spell bar horizontally over the main chat window? :)<br />
<br />
Might be faster than having it all the way down in the left corner if you are using the mouse.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">thats prtty cool, though I'd like to get rid of the header on my chat box 1 =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah headers on the chat box are next to go, I still haven't decided completely on spells, I never cast with the mouse.  Not a bad idea moving it horizontally over the chat window though....<br />
<br />
The groupwindow file is here (http://ree.the-mad.net/ui_mods/cakaris/trimmed_down/EQUI_GroupWindow.xml) .<br />
<br />
The odd thing about that, is if I removed the buttons, it crashed, so I just set them all to 0, 0 and made the size 0, then moved the bottom up.  Shoddy way of doing it, but functional =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hmm, yeah.  That's the problem I've been having with the buttons... first thought was simply to remove all reference to them, and it'd be ok.  Then I crashed (twice), and found out about the ui(charname).ini files that keep loading the same crashing skin. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Has anyone got a mod to mem all the spells on a page in one sitting?<br />
<br />
I saw a spell book with a mem all spells button a few days ago but, I can't seem to find it now. I've checked www.eqinterface.com (http://www.eqinterface.com/) but it's not there as far as I can see.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ulver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Last I heard, its a feature that is planning to be implemented, but it isn't yet. Some people have made buttons in anticipation of this feature.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I ran into the same problem with the Invite / Disband buttons.  Ended up logging into the world, but the UI crashed.  Yay 1018 for the next 15 minutes.  If I can figure it out, I'll post a fix.  Also, if someone is bored and artistic, please make a set of spell and buff icons that looks just like the old ones.  The new icons are way too overdone and cutesy.  Can't tell what is what anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Are you guys using note pad? I'm also trying to figure out how to get the HP and Mana % to appear numerically.</div></div><hr />

Both are really nice, I particularly like the % of health for targets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I was playing with it some too. Personally I made a customer playerwindow that had your hps and mana like usual but replaced the sta bar with the spell casting bar and added hp numbers below them. <br />
<br />
I ran into that same UI error issue when i tried to delete the pet health from my window. I think that it is some sort of inheritance issue but not 100% sure yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Wildaar, I used the chat window from this example from the ranger board, no header!  Headers are the devil.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I personally use JEdit as my text editor, because I can use it at work too.  Sometimes I use vi (gvim on Windows).  There's also a nice port of emacs to Windows, but I never got into the habit of using that one.  Notepad blows, and there are plenty of free alternatives, although you will pay with a slight learning curve.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Here is my Green Theme Druid UI. I also have the Health, Mana, STA, Exp. and Alt Exp bars showing. I staggered the Spell Gems, might change that back to horizontal. If you look closely you can even see my cool little sword pointer. <br />
<br />
My Bard and Shaman have different set ups. The Bard has a Vertical 4x4 Spell stack that makes twisting easier with the mouse. I hope to get a Blue Theme for the Bard and a Brown one for the Shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Humm, isn't showing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Jilariz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Removing the title bar off chat windows is very very easy.<br />
<br />
Find the file &quot;EQUI_ChatWindows.xml&quot;.<br />
<br />
Scroll down to the bottom till you find this line:<br />
<br />
&lt;Style_Titlebar&gt;true&lt;/Style_Titlebar&gt;<br />
<br />
And change it to this:<br />
<br />
&lt;!--&lt;Style_Titlebar&gt;true&lt;/Style_Titlebar&gt; --&gt;<br />
<br />
Basically comments that line out.  You can do this for any window, just have to find the right file.<br />
<br />
Note: Don't modify the file in the default directory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>guice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Changing it to 'False' works just as well and possiably would be the preffered way. That way some odd bug doesn't flank you up cause that line's missing.</div></div><hr />
