<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bloogbloog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just to give a little update on fanfaire during the the discussion for spells and aa's.<br />
<br />
Was quite intresting.. group avatar is a definte no go. Stat buffs are being looked into, mainly raising cap. Shaman healing is pretty much where they want it to be.<br />
<br />
Some things I thought were funny, that other classes brought up. Clerics and paladins wanting invis. SK's wanting rez...Chanters complaining on a lot of stuff from focus overwriting shield of maelin to amount of spell gems they have. and rogues wanting more dps and utility.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyways round 2 for the spells and aa's is tommorow...so we'll see what else comes up and what they have answers too. It was kinda interesting to hear their responce to a lot of the questions being asked.<br />
<br />
I was gonna ask a few questions but they ended the session before i had a chance...hopefully I'll get  a go tommorow..<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;UPDATE from APR 3rd discussions...<br />
<br />
Well I missed round 2 of the spells and aa's session cause I was too freakin drunk last night to remember how I got home, so I didnt know where my car was. I did manage to corner a few shamans and asked what was mentioned for us....<br />
<br />
Seems a group version of Q or torpor was asked about and that was said that was gonna be a no go.<br />
<br />
Slow was asked about too and Ryan Barker (Ryltan) said that shamans still have the best slow and that 5% makes a huge difference in amount of DPS. Dont think he was aware that almost everything mitigates slow...<br />
<br />
Talisman of alacrity may be increased to 60% to match SLTW. As all other grp buffs of a single target arent usually less than the original spell. I honestly dont give a crap about this one..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">So group avatar is overpowering and 3 hour KEI is not?<br />
<br />
Uh huh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bloogbloog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yup they dont like grp avatar for the amount of dps it would provide.<br />
<br />
The head guy for spells and aa's is also not very happy or thrilled with the amount of dps chanters can do via charm. so its interesting to what that will lead too..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Was quite intresting.. group avatar is a definte no go. Stat buffs are being looked into, mainly raising cap. Shaman healing is pretty much where they want it to be.<br />
<br />
<br />
The sheer amount of stupidity that SoE is capable of never stops to amaze me.<br />
Stat buffs? Do they really think that is what we want?<br />
Stats buffs do nothing (except sta) and even if they did something who has the room for them or the need for them.<br />
<br />
And our healing is where they want it to be?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I could go for SK's getting a rez, I would like to see a non reagent version(no EE) for them.<br />
I myself do not have either, but it would be nice to have another rezzing class.( I still don't consider necro's a rezzing class since they need a 300-1k reagent per rez)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bloogbloog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">hell the sk I grp with gets pissed whn i cast sta cause it takes a buff slot =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Not only do some groan when they get buffs they don't want (mainly from mgb's on raids), I even get some people upset because I buff too fast after they are rezzed.  I can care less for their personal setup, while in a fast-paced GoD trial or even an LDoN adventure.  I don't have time to dilly dally around with buffs when mobs are incoming and need to be slowed.<br />
<br />
Condense the buffs to lessen slots needed, if SOE is thinking of raising the stat caps.  I can't even cast FA on raids that much anymore due to melees having/or near max buffs; they need at least one open slot for any hot heals.  And come up with a more detailed scare of importance with the stat numbers.  Does having 305 dex truely really make a difference compared to 260 dex, besides perhaps procing a couple more times?<br />
<br />
I don't think most shaman here created one to be a buff bot as much as some didn't create one for being a main healer.  Casting lots of buffs=yawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>enokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">So in essence, the ppl in charge are clueless what its like to play this class on a daily basis. Hmm, ok nothing shocking there, I buy it :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Pretty grim man. I try to be positive and hopeful and not &quot;whine&quot; or bitch, but SoE has no reasoning behind what theya re doing to us other then making us a useless and weak class.<br />
<br />
Stat buffs are being looked into? Try making them useful to begin with. What they going to do, introduce more AA so we can cap at 375 or something? Whoopey.<br />
<br />
Group avatar as much as i liked the idea, it is a pretty big deal and i can see why they wouldnt want to impliment it. KEI is a spell that in a offhand way, corrects a issue with the game. KEI is the answer to EQ having too much down time, so again, i can see atleast logic to this.<br />
<br />
Our healing is where they want it ?  what ****ing crack are these guys smoking. You know, i am now solidly convinced no one there plays a shaman or gets feedback from any shaman playing the content they put out. You know what solifies it for me? Remember when brenlo spouted out proudly that he had a level 50 shaman ? I seriously think thats the extent of knowledge this company holds about shaman. Either that or 1 or 2 have a kunark era shaman and went Whoa, this is too much power then never went back to see how things progressed and just kept that mindset.<br />
<br />
ugh im ranting again....<br />
<br />
<br />
Sad as it is, i have to give up on hoping for change. This is such a fun class to be, its a shame that its ruined by lack of understanding of it by its maintainers. It ends up infuriating you.  Sadly i guess its time to embrace a new phrase fully and whole hearted and for all humor to leave this phrase, which is ofcourse &quot; cant wait till wow&quot;.<br />
<br />
On a lighter note did anyone see this MMORFG where you play super hero's? I think its coming out in a few months and the beta is going on right now, it was on X-Play. It actualy looked kinda fun.  Wish i could remember more about it for you :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">So far, early Fan Faire reports further lean toward my use of the &quot;End Billing&quot; button... will be interesting to see all the reports when it's all said and done.<br />
<br />
Since obviously the EQ devs have no clue what they're doing, nor seem to give anybody but Beastlords and Rogues the time of day any more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to my shop, an_EQ_dev01. You look like you could use a Class on Game Design and listening to the people who pay your exorbitant salary for the pile of crap you hand us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Me? Bitter? Nah... It's too bad they obviously haven't been listening, let alone responding. Not to mention, think some things, if added, would be broken, but have things currently, that are broken (new engine, anyone?) and won't be changing more than likely (Virtue, Aego, Temperance, KEI, swarm-kiting bards, charm-kiting anybody, ...)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I heard something about that City of Heroes game (I think that's what it's called), and it sounded kinda cool actually. They actually *gasp* had a testing environment/department, and if you reported a bug, they'd actually... I know this may come as a shock... look into it, and ... RESPOND!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yea thats the game City of Heros. You can make up your own justice league of friends and fight super villians lol.<br />
<br />
They were even talking about implimenting playable super villians. How cool would that be?<br />
<br />
Seriously though, i mean all online RPG's seem to center around dragons and knights and stuff, not alll but its defiently a prevaliant theme. I think it would be interesting to play in a gotham type enviroment. The graphics looked sweet to boot also.<br />

The thing i liked about it too was that you can pick from SO many options, you can make your toon look like anyone and wear any clothes, its up to you. I hate it when i run across EQ and find a close of me. Though i have to admit EQ has gotten better with so much different armour and dye these days.<br />
<br />
Basicly the game, from the review i watched, is very much like a standard RPG. You have &quot;tanks&quot; and &quot;casters&quot;  or i guess you can call them range or missle ?  Anyway, its kinda the same cast of players, but superfriends style. Wish i could remember more, damn this short term memory loss :(<br />

See, that would imply someone at SOE actually stopping the &quot;shaman radio silence&quot; and saying something. We all know what happened the last time they started talking... then stopped.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I have never really flamed SoE before...<br />
<br />
but that is even half true, the people who said it are complete and utter morons.  The fact that they are still shocked that charm is very powerful in the high dps/low hit point mob model that they introduced THREE EXPANSIONS AGO is proof enough of that. Any 8 year old of average inteligence could have told you that would happen.  But nobody that smart is making decisions at SoE.  <br />
<br />
To say nothing of the utter ignorance of our class.  They have made a game where the only things that matter are fast damage, fast healing and tanking, and we suck at all three.  We have heals that are a joke against current mob damage, a slow is mitigated to worthlessness if it even lands, and dots that are worthless because the fights are over in 30 seconds.  Their solution?  Another strength buff.  YIPPEE!<br />
<br />
MORE WORTHLESS ATTRIBUTE BUFFS? HELLO, EVERY SINGLE PLAYER WITH A CLUE HAS KNOWN SINCE PRE-KUNARK THAT ATTRIBUTES DO EXACTLY JACK AND @^%$ IN THIS GAME, HELLO, MCFLY HAVE YOU EVER PLAYED YOUR OWN DAMN GAME?   They can shove that extra strength buff up their ass, except there is no room in that orifice because their heads are so far up it.<br />
<br />
PS Avatar is a freaking joke of an effect compared to haste, why doesn't haste have that tedious recast?  Who the hell thought &quot;tedious rebuffing&quot; was a great dynamic to go with for this GAME in the first place?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">They just won't care.<br />
<br />
Until they are made to care. If every shaman on the board that was disgusted with the class balanceing and relastionship that SoE has with us would quit and cancle tomorrow then maybe just maybe we might get &quot;Looked at&quot;. <br />
<br />
But that is not going to happen. Nothing will happen till there are viable competitors to EQ and a criticle number of people leave the game. <br />
<br />
When one leader or good friend leaves it affects many people. The days get a little colder when you log on and Someone that made the game fun is no longer logging on. With just a few of these key people leaving the effect dominoes. <br />
<br />
This is what needs to happen. But Verant did it's job very well. We are all attached to the charecters. We do not want the story to end. So even if we don't log on anymore alot keep paying so they have a chance later to log on and say hello. <br />
<br />
They have had 5 fan faires an yet nothing ever gets really said. They have nothing concrete to say because it would be detrimental to thier jobs to promise or actually do anything. They are not creators. They are maintainers. They are not around for thier ability to blaze trails, but instead to be the caretakers of others ideas. And that sucks, for them and for us, cause we do not get anything fresh or new because they are too constrained by what has come before them and the whole house of cards is teetering now. <br />
<br />
Oh and City of Heros will be released Late April. And yes it looks that good, And runs well. A friend got into Beta and well. Lets just say he hasnt logged on EQ since. Is it going to be the perfect game? Nah. But too be honest anything would be better than being ignored and decieved by people I pay a monthly fee to. <br />
<br />
I have already pre ordered it and will be playing soon. And guess what. When that happens Snoww could very well finally get the rest she deserves. <br />
<br />
SoE doesnt care about you. And they do not care about shaman Issues. I am still logging on due to the fun I had years ago and the friends I made years ago, and it is getting old trusting in these folks who lie like politicians while taking my money and laughing at me behind my back.<br />
<br />
Yeah I am bitter. I used to get home and couldnt wait for what the adventures on EQ would bring me, not I activly look for reasons to not log on to EQ anymore and the reasons are getting easier to find. In game and out.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jaeydee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I ended my billing.<br />

I don't know what that means.  My subscription is up in a month.  I may renew it but I don't know.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with the bitterness and sentiment. Except, I don't even need a reason to not login anymore. Everybody I know is too busy raiding wherever to even give me the time of day anymore, so, depending on what the rest of the weekend brings... they may not even have to worry about it anymore, as this prophet, with over 3 years of EQ experience under his belt (and could probably design content a LOT better than the current devs, with my eyes closed), will hang up his spear, along with the bard attached, that will hang up his Mystical Lute Body he's had since December 2002. (Why haven't I finished it? Why should I?)<br />
<br />
The two people I've known for a long time, almost since the beginning, that even give me the time of day anymore... are too busy to even play themselves, and when they do have time, they don't even bother logging in for much of anything anymore except to PL wife/friends, because by the time they get their groups together, by the time they have to leave, they've gotten so little in return, they don't bother. (This is the same reason I haven't really touched it either, but I figured Fan Faire might give some sort of insight as to what's coming, not feed us with more of the same...)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Ciele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Sad. Sad. Sad.<br />
<br />
As it is it appears from parses that extremely high attack does jack and **** against most mobs.  Even Ferine Avatar a buff they call &quot;overpowered&quot; is just situational for alot of us.  <br />
<br />
Have the retards on the dev team actually checked to see if extra attack past 1800 does anything for melee?<br />
<br />
The parses I've seen on PoP mobs have shown extra damage for 1800 ATK + as well within the MOE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Serbitar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Not making a group avatar because it is overpowering...but it's already possible to keep it on at LEAST 5 other people in its current form...in effect doing the exact same thing that a group avatar would.<br />
<br />
If they are worried about it being MGBed just code it where it is not possible to do so?? And make it recast time 11 minutes or so, so that to /tgb it would still mean that only 1 shaman could keep it up on only one group (not necessarily his or her own)??  Hell don't even make it /tgb-able at all if that's what they are worried about.  And as others have said, I HIGHLY doubt that a group avatar would raise a groups dps by 1700 (roughly a charmed pooka) so...<br />
<br />
At any rate, it would probably take some innovative coding on Sony's part to work this in, and I have long realized that they are incapable of doing anything of the sort.<br />
<br />
About the healing, I can heal fine in like, earth, but I think what most people are complaining about is GoD, where I would pay money to see a shaman heal for an entire succesful Tipt run.  We suck at fast healing, period and from what was said in the first post don't expect that to change, ever.<br />
<br />
The reason I have a problem with charm is this: it single handedly turned enchanters into a) the most dps for a group; b) the most desirable (read: some people won't do GoD without one) class for a group; and c) made slow even more worthless.  Not only are enchanters a) with charm, but they also increase the dps of existing group members arguably more than any other class (voq for casters means more nukes, best haste for melee means more swings).<br />
<br />
So anyways, bottom line is Sony never cared anything about this game, or else they would at least make the developers play the game once in a while to see how the classes interact with each other and the mobs.  I find it hard to believe that these people are stupid, because in this job market you don't see many stupid people getting hired for these jobs - which only leaves the choices of either they just don't care about the player base, or, more likely, their corporate superiors don't care, and they are forced to churn out expansions in pursuit of the almighty buck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So well said.<br />
<br />
I'm fairly sure that the release of WoW or the email that I'm accepted to beta is the death of my EQ characters.  I won't be coming back for more.  I won't be giving it another chance.  Because I've finally lost hope that SoE will magically understand the game they're producing.  The expansions really are getting worse and worse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Fark, wish I could go to get all my own questions ignored as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
  Have they addressed the idea of NON STAT buffing at all?  I mean come on, let us buff mitigation, or hitrate or strikethrough... something USEFUL!<br />
<br />
<br />
   And since they are takin out slow, why don't they take BLIND and change it from a fear spell when mobs are not anywhere near anyone, to an actual blind like in any other RPG... lowers thier FARKING HIT RATE.   At least then we would have something new and maybe useful to look at using.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
  Healing where it belongs is a nice one.   So I guess they also think that spell drop rates are where they belong and the automatic /rewind function is the best thing since they learned how to write (that was a couple days ago, we are still amazed it happened).<br />
<br />
PS:  For Chrissake, SOMEONE ask if they intend to ever read or maybe even POST on thier fargin class boards.  OTHER than the rogue one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">If anyone at the faire can talk to a developer please ask this:<br />
<br />
We have been told the healing ratio of 100 (cleric) / 65 (druid) / 45 (shaman) is the intended ratio. Does such an intended ratio exist for mana regeneration, nuke DPS and DoT DPS? If so what are the numbers? If not, why not?</div></div><hr />

<br />
i been saying for ages that SoE know crap about their game and i canx my account ages ago, unfortunately for me it manage to sneak in the next billing cycle so i had another 3 month to play. ends soon though. and unless something for shaman change i probably wont renew.<br />
<br />
stats hahahahahhahahahahahhahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahhahahahha... etc<br />
<br />
yes thats it increase stats that will fix shaman ... not<br />
<br />
pls express to them to play the dam game and smell the crap.. or politely express that shaman dont want no more stupid stats buffs, we want buffs that actuaally help:)  and heals and dps. not great but good everything should be good, to make a shaman great. and help groups<br />
<br />
on a side note, i am amazed they they manage to break shamans. (well near as damit for god hard ldon and elementals)<br />
<br />
oh and fan faire isnt for us , its for then to slap each others back and say how great there are, and what they can do to keep poeple playing but without doing anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Saramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Raising stat caps well whoopee how much im now drooling with unadulterated excitement.<br />
<br />
How much do you think SOE would raise it by....<br />
Hmm whats the betting not more than 20pts or it would become &quot;Too Overpowering&quot;.<br />
So instead of Fot7 being just a 500hp buff it would be a 500hp buff and 20 to str,dex,agi.<br />
Well thats not too bad some of you may say.....<br />
Perhaps not but how many people who are currently at the stat cap are in fact way over the current cap so raising it would still be totally pointless from a buffing pov.<br />
Why is group FA a no no ?Can anyone actually answer why it would be &quot;Too Overpowereing&quot;....<br />

In reply to number 2, I've actually designed, programmed, and tested, my own turn-based strategy game, from the ground. Once you know all the numbers, granted, you don't want to play since you really know all the &quot;secrets&quot;. However, to anybody with common sense, they realize that their customers pay their wages, and actually listen to them and try to keep them happy, or they'll be unemployed.<br />
<br />
Obviously SOE is more worried about your credit card getting dinged each month. I'm sure the devs/testers/etc want to try to make everybody happy, but someone in management is preventing it because of the almighty dollar.<br />
<br />
They aren't getting 12.95/month out of me anymore. Since communicating with SOE via &quot;recommended means&quot; doesn't work, try talking with your bank account... I bet they'll listen then.<br />
<br />
If you think the devs/management have no clue... don't pay them. Simple as that.</div></div><hr />

Making EQ more fun would involve making sure that something, at some point, would not involve the killing of anything... and you could make it from 1-65 doing so. Won't happen.<br />
<br />
Now... adding a few non-cookie cutter LDoN zones, returning the experience back to early release state, returning the vendor fodder to pre-Gates state, and make the dungeons less about DPS and more about skill... and maybe some of the &quot;fun&quot; will return.<br />
<br />
Why should 1 hour in BoT, safely pulling 1 mob at a time to where everybody sits in the same place, give better rewards than 1 hour in a dungeon, where you have the potential for more than 1, and are constantly moving?<br />
<br />
... and don't get me going on the point scale either ... that needs tuning too. Ignore Gates of Discord, how about the rest of the player base that has nothing of interest there?<br />
<br />
Guess that makes too much sense, my bad.<br />
<br />
Could I do better, in EQ's present state? Even a 4 year old could, at least then there might be something fun (or at least funny).<br />
<br />
Changes I'd make... raising LDoN experience (returning it to early release state), evening out the LDoN point scale (instead of this 1 point at 20, 45 at 63, 51 at 65 BS), raising the amount of vendor fodder (since, it seems to be less and less an occurrence anymore...), and wiping out Taelosia entirely, throwing Abysmal, as is (and with Translocators, no boat required), as a freebie zone for everybody, giving anyone who bought Gates of Discord, a refund.<br />
<br />
Note: This is common sense, something SOE has proven time and time again, it doesn't have. Maybe the whole &quot;wiping out Gates of Discord and Abysmal as a free zone&quot; wouldn't be done because of PHB... but the rest should require no more than 3 hours of work, tops, by one person.  If it came down to everybody forking out like a nickel (not even) to pay for the 3 hours of work... I don't think anybody would complain if the 3 hours were used for content fixes to make them worthwhile/fun.<br />
<br />
But... they don't care, why should I?</div></div><hr />

Yea, there are people who feel you should be able to tradeskill to 65.  And the times I have sat for hours in the nexus buffing newbies for the hell of it I felt like I should be gaining experience for some dumb reason, but still not quite getting what your trying to say I think.<br />

You find those who get up the fastest are those who burn out the fastest and aren't haveing as much fun total imo.

This doesnt shock me, it would be a bit overpowered as a spell. However, as an AA similar to SotW or something, it might have merit. Add in some Mana Regen (after all, even BLs get Paragon, sheesh) and we might be on to something, a small something, but hey. <br />
<br />
Slow was asked about too and Ryan Barker (Ryltan) said that shamans still have the best slow and that 5% makes a huge difference in amount of DPS. Dont think he was aware that almost everything mitigates slow.....<br />
<br />
Again, no big revelation. Do they even understand the concept of mitigation? How 5% becomes a LOT less pretty fast, and how in a 25-30 second fight, casting a debuff then the slow is fairly worthless, and that slow will rarely land without? Sheesh. <br />
<br />
Talisman of alacrity may be increased to 60% to match SLTW. As all other grp buffs of a single target arent usually less than the original spell. I honestly dont give a crap about this one..<br />
<br />
Gee, thanks . . . for nothing. How about making it closer to the Chanter version, you know, as close as THEIR slow is to our. Bah, this gets more and more fustrating every day. <br />
<br />
Well I missed round 2 of the spells and aa's session cause I was too freakin drunk last night to remember how I got home, so I didnt know where my car was. I did manage to corner a few shamans and asked what was mentioned for us......<br />
<br />
By far the best part of your update. Honestly, find out who the dev's are, and get THEM drunk with you! LOL.<br />
<br />
Glad to see your having fun man. Thanks for the updates. <br />
<br />
My opinion is we arent going to get squat. SOE looks at the power of a Shaman vs 95% of the current content, and says &quot;Wow, they are super strong&quot;. Yes, Giac, I know. I am with you. Please do not jump down my throat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Group haste finally maybe being made useful is convinient but does not change class balance in the slightest.<br />
<br />
What I would like to know is how a 5% lead in a highly mitigated ability that also suffers from the short fights of the last 3 expansions can be considered a &quot;huge difference&quot; when clerics having a lead of well over 100% on shaman healing and a lead of close to 50% on druid healing is &quot;as intended&quot;.<br />
<br />
He would be right if he was saying that 5% of a boss's DPS negated is a huge difference. Of course every boss is either unslowable or mitigates our slow advantage down to less then 2%.<br />
<br />
And that statement is downright ridiculous when talking about grouping, especially in current content. It is as if he assumes every MOB entering a shaman's line of sight is automatically slowed, at no loss of time or mana and without aggro.<br />
<br />
In a lot of situations I am not even sure if slowing is a good use of my time. If I actually had to pay mana for my slow or if I had even druid heals I would end up reserving slow for adds or offtanked MOBs.<br />
<br />
And yet our 5% lead, not slow itself, but our tiny lead over enchanters gets labeled as a &quot;huge difference&quot;. Scary.<br />
 :eek:</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
As it is, this is how I do LDoN Normal. I almost never bothering to slow the first mob the MA targets. It just dies too fast, and one Q can heal the damage he took more than a slow will prevent him from taking.</div></div><hr />

I would not mind getting a group heal. I would not mind not getting a group heal - I am fine with getting my single target heals upgraded. But not giving it to shaman because it would be overpowering for us to have a healing ability that beastlords get is, well, silly.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">You know, I've always read/heard about how much difference that 5% makes.  To be honest, I've just never seen it.  I've been healer in groups with enchanter slowing, and I've been in groups with myself slowing/healing.  After the slow hits, I just cant tell any difference.  I think the perception that shaman slow is better is simply because we tend to cast it on incoming, expecting to get hit.  Tash aggro is high enough that enchanters tend to delay their tash/slow while aggro builds.  The 'extra' healing it takes on enchanter slowed mobs is purely in the first 15 seconds.</div></div><hr />

I wish they'd actually acknowledge what they've done to us with slow mitigation/immunities and high end players being 100-200 over the stat cap from items alone. That seriously lowers our utility.

At this level of the game everyone has slow in their group in some form or the other in 98% or more groups. So if a slow is in a group for a druid and cleric, when why are we HUGELY penalized for it.

I rarely have problems with buff slots, players are just capped and whine because of it. This usually coming from players that have 5 buffs on (Virtue, KEI, SD, Focus, Haste). Buffing stuff like diaku, agility, primal essence, and acumen on raids then I would agree.<br />
<br />
As it stands now I think we'd only benefit from Ferine Avatar being a group version that goes overcap. Raising the cap will not help the problem, the next expansion would break it.<br />

oh god, i give up the devs and espeicially ryan seem to have no clue what so ever, 5%? make a hyge difference? i think not and even worse with mitigation and fast fights. <br />
can someone tell me how slow works? 75%? that means if somin has a 10 sec swing it will then take it 17.5 sec right? so 70% would be 17.0? not sure how slow really work? with a faster swing its alot less?<br />
<br />
anyhow what i do know is on raid it make no difference (mainly cos the mob dead before i can slow it, and in group it general dead a not long after i slowed it) except on the named whether a slow or not and quite offten the named are really hard to sow.</div></div><hr />

When you all understand this, so maybe you will the true vision of the shaman in SoE Dev's eyes...<br />
<br />
Just a question... Was it the 1st april ???<br />
<br />
<br />

PS : Before someone quote me, i'm sarcastic (sp?) and too tired to see something valuable coming from SoE... except our so loved statts buffs...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">I was at the FF and got to ask a few questions. They sauid they would look into a gruop FA, or a FA aa skill, but I wont hold my breath.<br />
<br />
As for healing, I brought up the absurdity of the 47/100 shaman/cleric healing ratio. I asked if we could get this ratio looked into, as fixed % increases arent healthy to the game. I then asked about upping our dots to be the same as our original ratios. Ice comet 1120/400 (2.8 dpm), E Bolt 1132/320 (3.54 dpm). Curent Strike of Solusek 2740/640 (4.28dp), Blood of Saryrn 2240/535 (4.18 dpm). SOOOOO based off of % increases, our mana efficiency on Blood of Saryrn should be about 5.41, and the damage should be 2770 with a mana cost of about 512. I wont even go into mana regen % increases.  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Following this up, I addressed the shaman nerf through content, and how we suck at short fights. He pointed out no one likes long fights anymore, so I countered by asking when all our dots were going to be changed to be like bane or shorter. I also brought up how much weaker a 20% increase on a dot or heal over time was vs a direct blast nuke or heal, considering the latter can be chain cast for a much greater impact (especially in a raid environment). The devs then went on to say how great slow was, and how it scaled vs mob dps, and other bull****. He looked pretty stupid when it was noted that direct heals prevent more damage than slow does on short fights. Overall, the design team came off as having their heads up their asses on how the game breaks apart for the slow moving classes at high levels, and admitted we lost a popularity contest (speed kills vs efficient ones), but has no plans to rectify it. So theres something to put a little piss in your Monday morning Cheerios.<br />
<br />
On the plus side, I came up ahead on gambling and got sufficiently tore up, so the weekend wasnt a total waste. Just reinforces what we all knew. Level your berserker, and wait for their class defining aa's to make them better at everything than everyone. Unless WoW comes out first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Walknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">Bah!<br />

SOE would love nothing better then for the Shaman of EQ to pull out and call it quits.  Then they could finally give FoS/Fo7 to BL's and never have to listen to us again.  I mean, thats what the BL's were designed for right?<br />
<br />
I guess they could give FoS and Fo7 to Zerkers....I mean at their current ability lvl at 65 they dont have much to offer cept Warrior DPS. Heh.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">I missed the first 20 min of the second day and all of the first day AA/spell discussion, so the only shaman question that I heard was the part asking if we were being looked at for mgb heals and it was said &quot;No&quot;.  I was the one that spoke to the dev about this during beta and posted that results on it beforehand.  It was never said that we weren't getting a group heal, just that we weren't getting a mgb-able one.  <br />
<br />
Really wish that I would have caught the first day's questions.  I wanted to ask a few questions about dot agro and especially crit dot agro, as well as possible shaman buffs like the avoidance and dmg mitigation possibilies, but we ran out of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">Edit:  Sorry the tables look like crap.  In too big a hurry to fix it.<br />
<br />
Here is the lowdown on that 5% difference.  You be the judge of just how &quot;huge&quot; it is.  Please note that I am making NO concessions to mitigation.  I am assuming that the mob in question is FULLY slowable, which I realize is NOT usually the case in GoD fights.  But just to try to find out why we keep hearing about this huge 5%, I'm trying to put the best face possible on it.<br />
<br />
<br />
First, compute the DPS of a mob when slow lands.<br />
<br />
	Mob DPS--&gt;				<br />
Slow %	300	500	700	1000	1500<br />
=======================================<br />
75	75	125	175	250	375<br />
70	90	150	210	300	450<br />
65	105	175	245	350	525<br />
<br />
					<br />
So, now we have to talk about the fight.  Typically a GoD fight is over in 30 seconds.  Of that, the first 10 seconds of the fight are needed for a Shaman to land Malos + Slow.  So for the first 10 seconds, that mob is doing un-slowed DPS.  The damage the mob causes is below.<br />
<br />
First 10 secs					<br />
	3000	5000	7000	10000	15000<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, after slow lands, damage is mitigated over the final 20 seconds of the fight, giving damage as follows.<br />
<br />
Last 20 secs					<br />
75	1500	2500	3500	5000	7500<br />
70	1800	3000	4200	6000	9000<br />
65	2100	3500	4900	7000	10500<br />
					<br />
<br />
And for the whole fight, mobs do the following damage<br />
<br />
Total Fight					<br />
75	4500	7500	10500	15000	22500<br />
70	4800	8000	11200	16000	24000<br />
65	5100	8500	11900	17000	25500<br />
<br />
<br />
So, the 5% difference between a Shaman slow and a Chanter slow, with a mob doing 1500 DPS is a whopping 1500 HP's . . . basically one cast of Tnargs.  Even the difference between a Shaman and his bastard child the BL is only 3000 HP's.<br />
<br />
In light of the fact that we're talking about 22500/24000/25500 HP's I'd say the 5% and even the 10% is just a drop in the bucket.<br />
<br />
All this assuming that Slow is not mitigated at all.  Mitigation would shrink the difference even further.<br />
<br />
Please spell guy, explain to me again how &quot;huge&quot; that 5% difference is.</div></div><hr />

From the new graphics engine forum:<br />
There are no current plans to redo any graphics in the old world, player models, or animations. Currently any new graphics will only be found in new expansions.<br />
<br />

<br />
I have seen the light, 5% is a huge difference in DPS a mob does when slowed.<br />
<br />
Then I have 1 small question that remains.<br />
<br />
Why is it that my lvl65 slow (the spell I pay such a high price for) only slows for 60% and a BST can slow for 65%?<br />
<br />
Or maybe they really have no clue and just act like politicians, speak a lot and say nothing</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u86"><b>Shere Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p86">To throw around some new numbers. Here are some comparisons of a standard mob dps which compares damage with different levels of slow.<br />
<br />
So the relative damage taken is as follows given the following assumption: slow sticks first go no debuffs necessary and no slow mitigation.<br />
<br />
unslowed<br />
5,000   10,000   15,000   20,000   25,000  30,000<br />
<br />
65% slowed<br />
5,000   6,750     8,500    10,250    12,000   13,750<br />
<br />
70% slowed<br />
5,000   6,500     8,000    9,500     11,000    12,500<br />
<br />
75% Slowed<br />
5,000   6,250     7,500    8,750      10,000   11,250<br />
<br />
The ratio breakdown of this is as follows: <br />
75% slow to unslowed is 37.5%<br />
75% slow to 65% slow is 81%.<br />
75% slow to 70% slow is 90%.<br />
<br />
Now lets factor mitigation in at mostly level. So the relative damage taken is as follows given the following assumption: slow sticks first go no debuffs necessary and 25% mitigation of slow.<br />
<br />
unslowed<br />
5,000   10,000   15,000   20,000   25,000  30,000<br />
<br />
65% slowed<br />
5,000   7,563    10,126  12,689    15,252   17,815<br />
<br />
70% slowed<br />
5,000   7,375     9,750    12,125    14,500   16,875<br />
<br />
75% Slowed<br />
5,000   7,188     9,376    11,564    13,752   15,940<br />
<br />
The ratio breakdown of this is as follows: <br />
75% slow to unslowed is 53.1%<br />
75% slow to 65% slow is 89.5%.<br />
75% slow to 70% slow is 94.5%.<br />
<br />
Before I start making comments let me do partial. So the relative damage taken is as follows given the following assumption: slow sticks first go no debuffs necessary and 50% mitigation of slow.<br />
<br />
unslowed<br />
5,000   10,000   15,000   20,000   25,000  30,000<br />
<br />
65% slowed<br />
5,000   8,375    11,750  15,125    18,500   21,875<br />
<br />
70% slowed<br />
5,000   8,250    11,500   14,750   18,000  21,250<br />
<br />
75% Slowed<br />
5,000   8,125    11,250   14,375   17,500   20,625<br />
<br />
The ratio breakdown of this is as follows: <br />
75% slow to unslowed is 68.8%<br />
75% slow to 65% slow is 94.3%.<br />
75% slow to 70% slow is 97.1%.<br />
<br />
Now one last test to bring more realism to this. 10 seconds is a reasonable average time to slow mobs for all classes. beastlords need mroe attempts, chanters debuff and slow but need time for agro to build and shamans to debuff then slow.<br />
<br />
So the relative damage taken is as follows given the following assumption: slow sticks after 10 seconds and 50% mitigation of slow.<br />
<br />
unslowed<br />
5,000   10,000   15,000   20,000   25,000  30,000<br />
<br />
65% slowed<br />
5,000   10,000   13,375  16,750    20,125   23,500<br />
<br />
70% slowed<br />
5,000   10,000   13,250   16,500   19,750  23,000<br />
<br />
75% Slowed<br />
5,000   10,000   13,125   16,250   19,375  22,500<br />
<br />
The ratio breakdown of this is as follows: <br />
75% slow to unslowed is 75%<br />
75% slow to 65% slow is 95.7%.<br />
75% slow to 70% slow is 97.8%.<br />
<br />
OK conclusions:<br />
<br />
1) The cleric/shaman healing ratio is valid when you look at cleric healing an unslowed mob with no mitigation. Basically anything PoP teir 2/3 and below usually. SO I agree with SOE, yes we are balanced in PoV as a healer if the cleric has no slower in the group.<br />
<br />
2) Elemental and above you are starting to look at a serious short fall where slowing a mob gives drastically diminishing returns with mitigation. Given everything in PoP elemental and GoD is mostly mitigation minimum and quite often partial their is a substantial disparity in healing/slow ratio and if a cleric has a slower the disparity in damage is next to nothing even with a beastlord slowing.<br />
<br />
3) if you are fighting partial mitigation mobs slow is less efficient than adding an extra 25% dps to the group. Sucks to be a slower in this case with little dps to offer.<br />
<br />
4) SOE have no idea what they are talking about and have not even considered the bigger picture here. Assuming a group is smart and have a slower when fighting mobs with no slow mitigation then both druid and cleric are far ahead of the shaman for healing ability. As soon as mitigation comes into it. We fall behind in the priest stakes even including our &quot;massive 5%&quot; bonus in slow.<br />
<br />
In short if you couldn't be bothered reading I'll sum this up with 1 line:<br />
<br />
What a crock of sh*t.<br />

  GoD expansion is such a lousy excuse for an expansion from what I've read. The magic and exploration fun are gone from EQ and will never return. The new team is just not in tune with anything RPG'ish at all. They create lifeless soulless things that have about as much magic and creativity as reality based television shows and every other copycat show on TV these days. My poor Shaman has been reduced to my left hand on the laptop buffing my melee twinks. SoE has ended EQ as far as the lore and storyline goes. Some of the names of the new zones in GoD really made me laugh. *** are they thinking when they{probably let some random name generator}create those stupid names with 2 or 3 consonants in a row? I am just playing now due to online aquaintances and just comfort and familiarity of EQ. I hope a new game comes along and does it right because poor EQ is in the hands of people with no feeling and vision. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u92"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p92">Things I personally asked about on Day 1:<br />
-He didn't know shaman (wolf) pets can't be shrunk.  That should be looked into.<br />
-Advanced Spirit Call pets not enraging should be looked into.<br />
-Advanced Spirit Call may be looked into to see if we can get Spirit Call 3 on a separate hotkey with the same timer as ASC so we can use one or the other situationally.<br />
-Group Avatar is a possibility.  They have to look into the mana cost vs benefit it will give, especially when you would be able to mass group buff it.<br />
-Shaman healing is probably not going to be touched, but all healing in general is always being watched.<br />
-No chance for any other classes to get any type of resurrection (like even a 0% res for druid/shaman).  Also related it sounds like any and ever item that casts res in the game no longer drops (I asked specificly about res goo in DN, but I think he mentioned Vox Stick as another example too).<br />
-Talisman of Alacrity doesn't look like it will be increased to 60% haste to match SLTW.  I don't know why, but he seemed fairly adamant that it wasn't going to, even though I pointed out every other group spell in the game was as good or better than the single target versions.<br />
<br />
That's all I can think of.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u93"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p93">I guess making our 60% haste group castable instead of individually castable, combined with our incredibly powerful 5%  extra slowing ability, would put beastlords and enchanters permanently out of their jobs.</div></div><hr />

That is incorrect.<br />
Talisman of the Serpent (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=1582&amp;source=Live) is the group version of Charisma (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=156&amp;source=Live)<br />
Both are 40 charisma bonus.<br />
Unfailing Reverence (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=1597&amp;source=Live) is the upgrade we get later on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u96"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p96">Oh, so it isn't that the group is less than the single, it's just that we never got a final group version?   Oh well, no big loss there.</div></div><hr />

Shamans could be perfect, but GoD would still suck.<br />

EQ is just dead, killed by 3 consecutive worthless expansions.  GoD is completely devoid of any fun; playing it doesn't even feel like EQ.... <br />
