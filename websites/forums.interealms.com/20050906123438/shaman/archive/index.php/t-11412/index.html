<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fungik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello All,<br />
<br />
I recently decided to take advantage of the free month of play that sony has been offering me periodically since I quit playing a while ago. Much to my surprise my characters were all still around, including my 15th lvl Troll Shaman. <br />
<br />
I apparently gave away all my money and gear except for my bloodforge hammer, so it has been a bit of an adventure figuring out where I can play without dying constantly. <br />
<br />
I have a couple of basic questions that I hope will not be much trouble to answer.  If this is not the proper forum for these questions please let me know.<br />
<br />
1. What armor should I be looking to acquire and where should I be looking?<br />
<br />
2. Is the bloodforge a good weapon for a shaman or should I be on the lookout for something else?<br />
<br />
I'm sure that I will have more questions as things progress. Thanks in advance for your help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">well, the game's changed too much since i've been away, but banded is an easy start if you're naked.  <br />
<br />
the bloodforge hammer is a poor choice, there's so many cheap 1hb and spears out there that are a ton better.  hit up the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I’m still new at playing a shaman, as I’ve been soloing all this time and doing little else, and I’m terrible at recommending gear, but I’ll suggest what I can.  First off you should spend some time in the bazaar.  Sort by troll and shaman and look at the different options per slot.  The bazaar is a true godsend.  I remember all the items being shouted out in the tunnel in EC and not having ANY idea what they were.  With the bazaar you can see the stats on every item for sell simple by right clicking on the item in the search window.  Thank you Sony.  <br />
<br />
If you need some cash you can sell spiderling silks, spider silks and lion, wolf and bear skins in the bazaar.  They don’t sell for as much as they did the first few months after the bazaar opened, but you can still make some good money that way.  Just check out the prices on your server and price your wares accordingly.  <br />
<br />
And if you’re looking for a place to level and like to group, you might try hunting in Paludal Caverns, which is reached off of Shadowhaven.  The zone tends to be crowded and often populated with not so nice players, but the XP bonus in very good and most people level very quickly.  The atmosphere rather reminds me of what Oasis used to be like.  I’m told you can reach level 25 in Paludal if you want to stick around that long.  <br />
<br />
Best of luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Another good sell is bone chips.  If you are an iksar you have kurns tower right there with an endless supply.  They sell for 1pp each on the tribunal.</div></div><hr />
