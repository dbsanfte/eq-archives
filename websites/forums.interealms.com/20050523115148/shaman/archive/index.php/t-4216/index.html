<br />
But, well, after a god comes by and hands you the last item in your quest... there isn't too much further you should expect the quest to go. <br />
<br />
Sorry folks. We're glad you liked the quests, but there aren't any plans to add to that series. It had a definite end, and we reached it. <br />
<br />
We'll just have to make new cool stuff for you in Planes of Power.<br />

this really upsets me .. <br />
<br />
im not here to make another flame VI thread .. these boards have seen too many in that last week <br />
<br />
i worked so long and hard on these... i just wanted to see 10 shawls as there are 10 rings ... <br />
<br />
would people be wearing the ring if it stopped at the 8th ? no</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I kinda like it.  It means that more people in my guild will finish those damn quests and we can finally stop hoarding Dain faction and kill him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Will people wear the ring if it stopped at 8..<br />
<br />
<br />
HELL YES. The 8th ring is great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vinas Solamnus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">well look how much better the 8th shawl is compared to the 8th ring.<br />
Then look at the Jump in power from 8 to 9, and then again from 9 to 10.<br />
<br />
You realize how good those shoulders would have to be? They would put vex thal items to shame to fit the same pattern, so they just decided to end it there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gikk the Unholy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">&quot;Will people wear the ring if it stopped at 8..&quot;<br />
<br />
no.<br />
<br />
Ceno, where did that passage come from?  Anyone who's done this quest and read the text involved knows that the 8th is NOT a definate end.  At least as far as the storyline goes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Actually i think the 8th ring is alot less appealing than the 8th shawl. The 8th ring lacks any raw hps which is one of the biggest thing alot of people are looking for in the end game and the effect isn't that great either.<br />
<br />
The 9th where it adds 50hps and sta is where it really starts becoming worth wearing for most people and the 10th where it gets a new effect and the 100hps is when it really becomes a nice ring.<br />
<br />
The 8th shawl is definitely much better than the 8th ring. Having both 50hps and mana and 8 sta on it in addition to a more useful effect than the 8th ring. I would still like to see the 9th and 10th shawls made and I wouldn't rule it out compleately at this point. Verant has gone back and forth on this several times and gave in to public presure when it put in the 8th. Nothing is set in stone, especially at verant.<br />
<br />
I personally would be happy seeing all the stats go up by 1, the hp/mana go up by 25 and the effect staying the same for both the 9th and 10th shawls. It would be nice if they would make the effect work with group buffs tho.</div></div><hr />

http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=19251.topic&amp;start=41&amp;stop=51 was on castersrealm last week<br />
<br />
ya i just wanted a 10th shawl with 10ac 10 all stats and saves 100hps/mana + effect ......<br />
<br />
long ago i remeber VI saying that there would be 10 of each .. <br />
<br />
curious what the original designer had planned for the final 3 shawls, too bad he quit,or got fired or what ever happened to him /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Arisai/Miser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">also forgetting you can wear both as a shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">While most of us would not wear an 8th ring, most of us still like the right click effect for AE dispel mobs. So, if the quest stopped at 8, I bet a lot of us would still do it, just for the instant buff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The 8th ring doesn't compare well to the 8th shawl, but neither do their quests.<br />
<br />
Getting an 8th ring can be done in one day, most of it solo...with 2-3 other people at worst.<br />
<br />
Just getting the required tradeskills to attempt the 8th shawl can take MONTHS. 160+ in Brewing, Pottery, Jewelcraft, Tailoring, and Smithing. That doesn't include the vast amount of farming that you need to do for components. Really expensive, too...ever looked at the ingrediants for the royal engraved velium armor? Rubies, Sapphires, Fire Emeralds don't come cheap. Most people spend several weeks in Siren's just collecting pieces for the 6th shawl attempt (and from reading threads on the subject at EQTrader, a 160 tailoring skill gives about 25% success on 6th shawls). Then there is the Iceclad portion of the 8th shawl itself, which takes 3-4 good groups.<br />
<br />
So please, do not go comparing the 8th ring to the 8th shawl.</div></div><hr />

Definitely alot easier. Up to 8th ring may be doable with the right luck on the rare spawns but definitely still alot less than the shawls.<br />

<br />
Actually the cost for the 8th shawl assuming you camp all the dropped peices your self is only velium temper which can be mde for only 10pp a pop or so. The sapphires, diamonds and such you need for the armor is a special one dropped by the shimmering geonids not the standard store bought stuff.<br />
<br />
So please, do not go comparing the 8th ring to the 8th shawl.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Perhaps I imagined it but I thought I read somewhere that 8 became no.10 to all intents and purposes, they did a smiliar thing with the Cudgel quests with the final one getting a big increase in stats compared to the previous quests results because they had decided not to/didnt have time to include more beyond that point<br />
<br />
If they'd planned to implement up to 10 then 8 wouldnt be anywhere near as nice as it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">hmm, when they don't have a the uber 10th shawl, they should at least allowing us to stack 2 of them like the rings. Make it usable in shoulder nad neck slot for example.<br />
And reset WW - there are no velios hounds left!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">And reset WW - there are no velios hounds left!<br />
- Kill their placeholders.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Agrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Sorry but the moment I saw the 8th shawl quest and stats I knew it was finished....  ifin you cant take that then well... dont do the quests... <br />
Is the 8th shawl as good as the 10th ring? maybe not, but its definetly better then the 9th ring.  I plan on finishing the 8th shawl reguardless  ...dispite failing the 7th twice now, but my smithing is my highest trade so Ill breeze threw number 8.</div></div><hr />
