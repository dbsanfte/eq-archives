<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Surus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My abjuration is around 160 or so.  Many of my abj spells fizzle about once or twice when I cast them so it's no biggie.  When I try to cast this one, I have fizzled 12+ times and my mana gets eat up.<br />
<br />
Does anyone else have this problem?  Is my abjuration skill so too low for this group buff?<br />
<br />
Surus -- 52 shaman</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shizbiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes, even with your skill maxed though you will see alot of fizzles on it at level 52.  A few more levels cause the fizzle to decrease though.<br />
<br />
Cast Inner Fire (level 1 abjuration) over and over again while waiting on ports/spires/bazaar/etc to practice.  Chain casting it in your 50s almost uses zero mana (and if you have c3 you wont loose any mana) and it stacks with just about everything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Same problem, and my  Abj is maxed.  Really bugs me.  Guess Ill just have to get more levels (which was my goal anyway, so that works out nicely)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Surus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Could this spell be bugged then?  I was in a raid where a druid had some nice group buffs - circle of winter (save vs fire) and circle of summer (save vs cold) and had no fizzles. <br />
<br />
Whenever I cast it eats about half my mana bar (sometimes more) - almost makes me rather just single cast resist disease.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well 160 abjuration isn't enough then. 235 is max, you should work toward that using Inner Fire and Fleeting Fury.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Push it to 235 -- its not fun, but its necessary.  Also, use your rage/voice of the berserker line.  Aside from being useful in and of itself, it will help you raise your abjuration when your in experience groups.  Talisman of Jasinth does fizzle more than other spells; its like a speedbump, really.  The only time you will really cast it is on a raid, so fizzling it is fairly harmless and it tells you that you need to work on your skills.</div></div><hr />
