	<!-- message -->
	<p>I've been lurking on this message board for several weeks and decided it was time to add some of my own observations. After probably a year and a half absence, I recently decided to return to EQ and give playing it another try. I'm taking the time to make this post mainly as an exercise in playing the game. As I learned from earlier experiences, there seems to be as much to playing EQ outside the virtual realm as there is when in-game. My first experience with EQ was fun up to a certain point, and then I decided that the game simply wasn't worth it anymore. My primary reasons for leaving, and what I've found so far, follows.<br />
<br />
1) SOE - In the past, these were a bunch of semi-obnoxious yahoos that felt that customer service is passe because they have the best product in town. A number of things lead me to this conclusion, but there were two incidents that broke the camel's back. The first was when Shadows of Luclin was due to be released. Its hardware requirements were such that I would have had to buy a whole new PC to run it. I'd already had to significantly upgrade my PC to run EQ up to the SoV expansion. Yes, technology advances, and one eventually has to keep up or become stagnant, but buying a new PC was not going to happen at that particular time. The second thing was that an entire guild had been banned on my server because they had found a pathing problem in one of the high level zones and was exploiting it despite warnings from GMs to not do it. I can understand the nature of "fair play" and whatnot, but this was an extremely anti-customer solution to an engineering problem. As a long-time engineer myself, I would be fired if I took this type of attitude towards any of my company's customers. So has anything changed?<br />
<br />
	a) I recently bought a new, state-of-the-art PC with all the trimmings. No more tech issues with running the game in all its expansions. However, I bought a Radeon 9700 Pro graphics card, the pinnacle in graphics these days, but I've sinced learned that EQ appears to be tuned for GeForce cards <sigh>. However, the game runs well. My only complaint is that the sound is messed up, but that post belongs in another topic area.<br />
<br />
	b) I haven't yet encountered any obvious SOE obnoxious attitude problems, although I've heard of plenty of them. Most have to do with high levels and uber guilds trying to make their ways through the PoP progressions or with game nerfs that shouldn't have happened. I'm a LONG way from PoP, and nerfs don't bother me, so no worries here as yet.<br />
<br />
	c) I'd also encountered a number of interesting technical issues with the game that I thought could be fixed, but as yet still haven't been. Mobs aggroing and then walking through walls and buildings in outdoor zones is one. Not quite sure what the issue is here, and I know it's been discussed ad nauseum. Various mob pathing problems still remain - such as walking over trees and other similar obstacles instead of around them. And the tendency to break things with each patch remains, despite having a live test server. Guess I'll still have to live with this stuff.<br />
<br />
2) The game was a tremendous timesink, and I'm not "dedicated" to the game the way many people are. This is not meant to be judgmental, but I don't multi-box, have alts running all over place, etc. I had, and have now, one toon - a Barb Shammy. My previous toon was a Dwarf Pally that I got to level 37, and a LOT of time was spent just getting to places, getting bound, getting sowed, etc. Sometimes half my playing time was devoted to simply getting to a zone and setting up so a CR wouldn't take hours. I eventually reached a frustration level that was hard to overcome. My Barb Shaman is much more suited to going places. The PoK and its portals has to be the best in-game addition I've seen. The Soulbinders are fabulous, even though I don't need them. Experience seems to come faster, partly because of new zones like PC, and also because of my different char. And dying doesn't seem to cost as large an exp penalty as it once did. Plat also seems to be easier to get at the lower levels, but it will be quite some time before I can even think to approach the levels needed for many items.<br />
<br />
	a) Unfortunately, I still think EQ is a large timesink with lots of bottlenecks, or challenges if you prefer that point of view. That's the way SOE set up the game. There aren't any winners or losers in the classic sense, where the game ends and some sort of resolution is reached. There are only things to do, tasks to complete, etc. And many of these require cooperation among many players - players that would normally have a competitive mindset in any other game. The only viable business model (for this type of game, IMO) is to keep people playing for long periods of time. They have to make sure there are challenges and queues all over the place to insure that the core group of subscribers stays with the game. That's the purpose of the PoP expansion. Keep the longest term subscribers (i.e., the highest levels and uber guilds) happy with new things to do - whether you call them challenges or bottlenecks. But for now I've found that the major timesink and bottleneck elements that so frustrated me at one time have been minimalized, so the game has become fun once again. <br />
<br />
3) Ugly peeps. Not too many ways of saying it nicely, but you run across all sorts of jerks and other nasty types of people in the game. Sort of like real life, which was unfortunate, because for me the game was a way to escape. The things that drove me away here were of basically two origins. The first was a problem with guilds. I went through 4 different guilds, and never found one that seemed to follow its own guidelines and principles concerning raids, loot, etc. Basically, they all seemed to have a core group of folks that had some sort of real life tie (friends, spouses, relatives, etc) or other history with roots outside the game. This core group ran everything as they pleased without too much of a thought to the others in the guild. This was very frustrating, especially when one tries to live up to being a good member and follows the "rules." The second problem was with encountering many people that seemed to live for the game. Loot, plat, levels, etc., was the name of the game, and it didn't matter what they did or how they did it, so long as they got what they wanted. Too much like real life to me. Has this changed any?<br />
<br />
	a) I doubt it. The above issues seem endemic to the game, and I doubt there's much one can do about it. I've already encountered these issues in game again. How about a level 63 in Befallen, just jumping in front of you to kill mobs with one blow, and then threatening to AE the dungeon and drag them to you? Or a lvl 17 monk in PC with 2148 HPs looking for enough heals to get back to full health? And I particularly like the single-digit level twinks with enough uber-gear to survive mid-level dungeons solo. Just a few examples. However, there are also plenty of nice people who understand courtesy. I think I'd just reached a threshold with my previous char, or perhaps was on a server with an exceptional number of jerks. But so far I haven't come across too many people issues as yet. <br />
<br />
	b) My way of dealing with it then was to play solo as much as I could, which I found to be difficult. This was partly because I was playing a Dwarf Pally. They can do some things solo, but don't really solo well. My Barb Shammy is working out much nicer in terms of soloing. He's only level 25 right now, and I've yet to encounter any real issues with soloing. In fact, the level 24 spells have given a whole new meaning to what I can solo. Whites and certain yellows fall to my spells, something the Dwarf Pally couldn't realize even in his dreams. This has made the game a LOT more fun for me and the playing style I like.<br />
<br />
There are some newer things in the game that are quite a difference from when I first played:<br />
<br />
A) The bazaar is really cool, and I can just "park" my Shammy there if and when I have anything worth while to buy and sell. No market mules for me. I think the use of a market mule is somewhat of an abuse, but if there are peeps out there that want to do it, then it's up to SOE to set the guidelines. However, I do miss the open-cry hustle of EC. I suspect as the market mule abuse becomes more and more obvious the open-cry auctions will increase in many zones.<br />
<br />
B) Many zones that used to be super-crowded, especially in the "old world," are nearly empty, so I can wander around and see and do things I couldn't before. And with my new PC, Luclin is absolutely gorgeous. The first time I saw Norrath rising was fabulous. Maybe the PoP zones are overcrowded, and some perma-camps still exist, but the world seems more accomodating now.<br />
<br />
C) It's good to see some new mobs in well-known zones, and also good to find that plat comes easier at the lower levels. Or at least is seems to to me. I've already gone through several hundred plat in buying spells and some upgraded equipment. I know for my previous char it was very difficult getting plat. I'm not saying that plat just lies around for the taking these days, but it's there if you want to spend a little time getting it. Note that at level 25 I'm not talking about uber-plat for the high levels, but maybe making 40-50 plat in an average 3-4 hour session.<br />
<br />
	1) As a side note, the downside is that many of the simpler plat-making schemes seem to be well-used on Karana. HQ pelts don't seem to sell well. There always seems to be plenty of potions and basic materials for sale in the bazaar. I checked for leather padding the other night and found over 400 pieces for sale. One market mule had 160 pieces for sale at 40pp each! The others were selling for about 20pp each, but with this many it appears that the market is saturated.<br />
<br />
All-in-all the game seems to be fun again, at least for me. I doubt I'll be able to reach the levels needed for plane raiding, buying horses, getting PoP flags, and whatnot. I think it will take an amount of time I won't be willing to give. And I know SWG will capture my attention if and when SOE lets it go live. But that's just me. So if you see a Barb Shammy named Lorredar wandering around on Karana, say hello. But don't be too put off if I refuse to group or join your guild. Maybe one day... But for now, I'm just going to enjoy myself, wander around, kill mobs, and not get too caught up in any drama.<br />
<br />
BTW - For all you experts out there I have a couple of n00b questions. 1) Is there a way to open a door with a keystroke instead of a mouse point and click? I recall being able to do that, but don't recall how. 2) Is there any website that has a list, catalogue, or whatnot that provides ALL of the line commands. I have an old list, which seems to be the same one SOE has at the EQLive site. 3) I also need a list and some explanation of the various chat channels. This seems to also be a new feature that wasn't present when I last played. There were basic ways to limit who saw your messages (tell, guildsay, etc), but this seems to have been generalized into a full-fledged channel-based chat system.<br />
<br />
PS - Sorry this was so long. I can get very wordy sometimes.</p>

<br />
CHat Commands<br />
<br />
/chat set - Makes you a member of all of the channels listed. You will be joined to those channels in the order listed (see /join below for details on what 'joining' a channel means). This will remove you from all previously joined channels. If you just want to join a new channel, use the /join command. <br />
<br />
/join - Allows you to join the channel or channels listed. If the channel does not yet exist it will create the channel and you will be added as a moderator for the channel (see below for moderator commands). Note: You may use spaces when creating a channel. But when the channel is created those spaces will be removed. So if you "/join fluffy bunny" the channel created will be "fluffybunny". <br />
<br />
/leave - This will remove you from the channel. Note: You must specify a channel, either by name or by number, or the command will fail. <br />
<br />
/leaveall - Removes you from all channels. <br />
<br />
/list [channel] - Using this command without the [channel] parameter will list all of the channels that you are joined to, the channel number, and will give a numeric value for the number of people in that channel. The channel number is specific to individual users, so two people in the same channel may not have the same channel number for that channel. Using the command with a [channel] parameter will list the members of the channel by name. <br />
<br />
/announce [on | off] - Toggles on and off the announcements heard when people join or leave channels. This is set OFF by default. <br />
<br />
/chat # - Sends the message to the channel named. You must have the # symbol, that is not a hint to use a number. <br />
<br />
/<1..10> - Sends the message to the chat channel number listed. You can discover the number of the channels you are joined to by using /list. If no channel number is specified the message will be sent to you first chat channel (whichever is your channel number 1). <br />
<br />
/chat help - Displays a list of chat channel commands. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
30.2 Appendix E - Channel Moderator Command List <br />
/chat invite [channel] - Sends an invitation to the specified character to join a the chat channel. If no channel is specified the character will be invited to join your first channel (whichever channel is your channel number 1). The invitation arrives as a text message. If the channel is password protected, the invited person can enter the channel only once without a password. <br />
<br />
/chat grant [channel] - Grants moderator privileges in the channel specified to the character named. If no channel is specified the character will be given moderator privileges to your first channel (whichever channel is your channel number 1). <br />
<br />
/chat password [channel] - Sets the password for the channel specified. If no channel is specified the password will be applied to your first channel (whichever channel is your channel number 1). Note: A password protected channel is the only type of channel that is semi-permanent. Such a channel will disappear after it has been empty for 24 hours. All other channels cease to exist once they are empty. <br />
<br />
/chat kick [channel] - Kicks the character named off of the chat channel listed. If no channel is specified the character will be kicked our of your first channel (whichever channel is your channel number 1). <br />
<br />
/chat moderate [channel] - Sets the specified channel to 'moderated' mode. This means that only those given 'voice' in the channel will be able to speak in that channel. If no channel is specified your first channel (whichever channel is your channel number 1) will be set into moderated mode. This is a toggle command, so if you execute this command a second time the channel will return to unmoderated status. <br />
<br />
/chat voice [channel] - Give the named character the ability to speak in a moderated channel. If no channel is specified the character will be allowed voice in your first channel (whichever channel is your channel number 1). <br />
<br />
<br />
Note: A password protected channel is the only type of channel that is semi-permanent. Such a channel will disappear after it has been empty for 24 hours. All other channels cease to exist once they are empty. <br />
<br />
Note for advanced users: /chat and / can be replaced with a semicolon ( ; ) in most cases</p>
