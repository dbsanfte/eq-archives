<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xabaras Soulsreaper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im starting this thread hoping some EQ GM is reading our board as GM's do with Ranja Glade and Safehouse etc etc and mostly since i cannot find in EQ site a forum where to post which new and sensed improvements could be made.<br />
<br />
Here is my proposte:<br />
<br />
Be able to cast shrink/grow outside grp having a window popping and asking ya if u want to be shrunk or not (something like the wizzy's TL/bind).<br />
<br />
And another my personal thought...why there is no aa ability bout DoT's but only for DD's?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i'm pretty sure sunmoon doesnt want threads directed at SOE/verant on his boards.  I would suggest the feedback feature or sony's own personal boards for these ideas :)</div></div><hr />

Absor reads Rangers Glade? (and we are Rangers, not Ranja; show us the respect we''ve earned)  The only forum I know he reads and posts on is the Mage one.</div></div><hr />
