<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Meowlin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Where? Dulak's Harbor in LoY. I started there last friday EQWing my shaman monk combo both 43rd level averaging 4 hours a night weekdays and about 8 on weekends. I parked Meow at zonein from the Gulf (one you zone in, look to your right, there is a angled corner, park shaman there) There are 5 static spawns near zonein with at least 2 roamers that walk close to the zoneline. Then there is a yard full of trash beyond. Also close to zoneline in some houses are the drunken pirates needed for the Stoticism quest.<br />
<br />
Ive made about 10k in plat drops, gem/jewelry drops. Plus occationally there is a shout of something rotting which you could use. Monky has a new pair of boots because of this.<br />
<br />
The boats are normally camped, once I get to 48th on entrance mobs i'll try my luck there. I hear regular and blue diamonds drop on the boats.<br />
<br />
You will see (alot) mantle of stealth's drop off yard trash. way too common, 2 charge invis with decient stats. Lore, you wont make any cash of these.<br />
<br />
I wont go into tactics here, if you solo or 2box(eqw) this zone rocks.<br />
<br />
Normally what I do is pull 2, dog dog attacks one, monky attacks other, slow monky's mob (who btw is at 50% life already) then slow dog dog's. Stoticism dog dog if needed. The finish up with monky. I use a mount so im always medding and ive never used KEI.<br />
<br />
Occationally you'll get free heals and buffs from new peeps coming in zone... at least on povar you do.<br />
<br />
Thats all i can think of atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I dou'ed ther with my shammy and ranger team mostly on the dandolaks run, did 2 levels in 2 weeks of casual play from 51-53 for shammy and 53-55 for ranger. Made about 20kpp, woulda made alot more if i had left and hadn't destroyed tons of weapons. I basically zoned in and never left until I made those 2 levels, i know I should go back but have been dreading living there again like i did last time.</div></div><hr />
