<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Toshizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">While reading this thread &quot;End Game Eq, ANNOYING&quot; It dawned apon me that I didn't know anything in regard to rampage enrage or anything like that.<br />
<br />
So I figure while I am still a midbie I should learn about this in case I am thrust into a situation that requires me knowing this.<br />
<br />
<br />
So fellow shaman lay it all on me everything I need to know about rampage and enrage and all the other stuff.<br />

<br />
Thanks for the help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shubert TZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">enrage-mob is low life and will reposte on all frontal attacks.  can be taxing for the unprepared.<br />
<br />
rampage- mobs hits mt and a few others who are high on agro list.  will need to watch heals on people who get on rampage. <br />
<br />
Both are generally from high level mobs 55+ maybe for rampage 58+ for enrage.  Not sure about levels though</div></div><hr />

I dont have time to explain it now, im sure someone else will anyway, but that is wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Aye, as Krakster indicates, the rampage description is wrong, as I understand it to work.  You could be last on the aggro list, but be on the top of the rampage list.<br />
<br />
Rampage is based solely on the order people first hit the mob, and the only way the 3rd person on the list moves up to 2nd place is if the 2nd person dies.  For this reason, on incoming, you always have designated rampage tanks shoot the mob with an arrow or something to get themselves on the list, before any sort of healing or debuffing gets the casters on this list.<br />
<br />
...at least I'm pretty sure that's correct - my little family-friendly guild is just getting into the types of encounters where this is a real issue, but I've been reading up on it so we don't all die. ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Agree.. read the thread above. It covers and explains it very well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">To add to this, rampage it not based on the order in which you hit the mob but the order in which you get on the hate list.  As easily demonstrated when you heal the rampage tank to early ;) (what gets you in as his replacement when he goes down).<br />
The first important &quot;rampage management&quot; fight a guild goes through is usually AL in Ssra.  Vindi is also a rampaging mob, but a topor shaman can survive it on his own (usually getting on the rampage list by slowing the incoming guardians, what transfers aggro to Vindi).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">And you missed one that will become important to you:  FLURRY<br />
<br />
A flurry mob is one that gets an extra melee turn on whomever he's attacking, when the flurry happens.  Often times, his flurry will come automatically at the begining of his attack, which means that you can get 6 - 8 hits on you in one melee round.  Flurry = one flat bear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">While the last post on page of that link is a good explanation to how Rampage works, like always it's missing a few crucial points, which is tied to some very frequent misconceptions.  <br />
The Rampage list is NOT static. <br />
You can get off Rampage without dieing, moving out of range or whatever. <br />
There's more to how Rampage exactly works, too. You will find out. Take a Rampaging mob(Mobs like the Creator in Ssra are best suited for it, since they are slowable), make people call out when they are getting hit by Rampage and log the fight. Analyze it and you will draw the right conclusions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">lol Giac.<br />
<br />
I dont know why but I found your post hilarious, like learning about Rampage is some inner voyage.<br />
<br />
As a shaman you're going to run into rampage two ways most commonly. First, the Cleric CH wheel is vulnerable to rampage if rampage tanks are not designated, smart and fast. If a cleric gets on the rampage list they likely have two options, take the beating for the whole fight, or get killed. You as a patch healer will one day be given the responsibility (or have it pushed upon you) to keep that cleric alive because one rampage tank didn't do his job.<br />
<br />
The other way you'll run into it is throwing out a malo(s) or slow too soon on a slowable mob. You hit the mob before a rampage tank does and you're on the rampage list, and are left with the same situation the cleric above has.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">OK Giac, you now have me dying of curiosity.  What do you know about rampage that they do not?  I think that rampage is something important to understand, and had in fact learned most of what I know from that thread that is linked above.  Please do not be mysterious, it would be a big help to me, and to the original poster if you would explain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hmm, ok.<br />
<br />
As most know there is a &quot;Hate list&quot; and a &quot;Rampage list&quot;. The Rampage list is a pretty short one(3 or 4 positions). These 4 people will stay on the Rampage list for the whole fight, unless they die and stay out of Rampage range for a certain amount of time(Rampage list doesn't forget you as easily as the &quot;Hate list&quot; and you can die and get rezzed back in and get Rampaged on, if you try hard enough). <br />
However, and here is the key point, the positions on the Rampage lists aren't static. Despite what most people think, the hate generated does have an impact on the Rampage list. The person with the most hate on the Rampage list(anyone else doesn't matter) will be on &quot;Rampage&quot; and get Rampaged on.<br />
This makes you want to put a classes on it that can control aggro at will. Preferably a hybrid tank and 3 monks as they can FD the Rampage on the SK/Pally best.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />

Best I can say is this is wrong. Rampage list is static. My experience tells me that the rampage list is static and doesn't change. The only possible exception would be feign's ability to compleately remove you from the hate list entirely.<br />
<br />
Even tho I'm a shaman I have played rampage tank for a large number of the easier mobs we're done that rampage. Primarily in Vex thal. I've rampage tanked everything in there up to and including aten ha ra herself. I can assure you I'm doing absolutely NOTHING to maintain aggro but I will hold rampage the entire fight.<br />
<br />
I also beleive that the 2 lists is a common fallacy to explain the way things behave altho isn't actually the way its done. Having done a bit of programing in my time, altho choosing not to do it as a living, I'd bet that they are using a what's called a linked list. It's a very common programing technique and is taught in most of your early programing classes.<br />
<br />
The basic idea is simple. On computers accessing memory is SLOW. Processors currently range up to 3ghz (ie 3000mhz). Fast memory is 400mhz. Thats about 1 8th the speed of the processor. To make things worse memory access usually takes multiple cycles to access the memory making access even slower. As such programers commonly try to minimize access to memory when possible.<br />
<br />
What a linked list does is add an extra field to the list that points to a line in that same list. For example take the 2 following lists.<br />
<br />
first name   last name    weight<br />
john           doe            200<br />
jane           doe            120<br />
homer         simpson      300<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
first name   last name    weight        link<br />
john           doe            200            1<br />
jane           doe            120            2<br />
homer         simpson      300            3<br />
<br />
<br />
To sort the first list you have to copy around 3 peices of information per line. It's even worse because you have to read all the info on each line and then write it to someplace new.<br />
<br />
The second list can be sorted simply by changing the link in the 4th field. So if you wanted to sort by weight it would look something like this for heaviest to lightest<br />
<br />
<br />
first name   last name    weight        link<br />
john           doe            200            3<br />
jane           doe            120            1<br />
homer         simpson      300            2<br />
<br />
To get the heaviest person you would go to line 1 to the link field, follow it to the 3rd line and get homer simpson.<br />
To get the lightest you would go to line 3 and check the link and get line 2 jane doe.<br />
<br />
I expect the hate list is the same type of thing. The normal aggro rules follow the links to get who has generated the most hate while the rampage just follows the list in order and doesn't follow the links. <br />
<br />
The only way to get off the rampage list is to get off the aggro list compleately. Dying doesn't seem to get you off the list. A mem wipe seems to be the only way to get off the list compleately.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Taraddar - interesting thought.<br />
<br />
If I underdstand correctly, you are suggesting that the hate list is implemented as a linked list, and that the rampage list is merely the nodes in the list *in order of creation*. Depening on how you implement the linked list, finding the nodes in creation order could be easy (if you allocate nodes from an array) or impossible (if you allocate new nodes as they are created from an arbitrary heap)..<br />
<br />
Nice idea though, I love it when people think up meta-theories about EQ :)</div></div><hr />

I could post how i think the Hate and Rampage lists look like and work, but since we can't even agree on the Rampage list NOT being static, it would be a waste of time.<br />
<br />
So in your experience with Rampage mobs you have never had Rampage jump from 1 mage to the other and back to the first ?(Chose mages because they don't have any means to lower their hate or remove it totally).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've seen it jump from warrior to warrior, but it was a function of one warrior not being in rampage range.  <br />
<br />
I've seen it jump from an SK to a warrior, then back to the SK when he stood up after feigning.<br />
<br />
I've seen it jump from a monk to the cleric that healed him when the monk FD'd.  The cleric healed the monk on inc and was first on the rampage list.<br />
<br />
A few things I've noticed:<br />
<br />
If you use multiple monks to tag pulls, all of those monks will be on the rampage list, but only the ones in range will be affected.  So if you have 3 monks feigned out of range, and one feigned in range, only the monk in range will be affected by the rampage list if he/she stands up.  If the first monk in the chain comes into agro range, he/she is going to get rampage.  If the first and second monks in the chain come back, the first monk will get rampage until a.)he/she feigns, or b.)he/she dies.  It will then switch to the second monk.  (Insert any feign class in place of the monk and it works the same)<br />
<br />
Every mob has a different rampage range.  Vindi, for example, has a fairly small rampage range (just outside of melee range works).  Rumblecrush, however, has a fairly large rampage range. (About 2-3 times his normal max melee range)  Getting off rampage, but not off the list is just a matter of moving out of rampage range.  As soon as you move back into range, you're back on rampage.  This is why it appears rampage jumps from person to person.  Here's an example:<br />
<br />
Monk pulls Vindi.  Cleric heals monk.  Monk feigns. Warrior_1 tags Vindi and engages. Warrior_2 shoots a few arrows at Vindi just after Warrior_1 tags. Now, the rampage list looks like this:<br />
<br />
1.  Monk<br />
2.  Cleric<br />
3.  Warrior_1<br />
4.  Warrior_2<br />
<br />
Now, with the monk feigned, the cleric is the highest on the rampage list and will start to take rampage damage.  If the cleric backs out of range, the rampage damage will pass to warrior_2.  <br />
<br />
If the monk stands up, rampage will pass to the monk and stop hitting warrior_2.<br />
<br />
If the cleric comes back in range while the monk is feigned, rampage will pass to the cleric and stop hitting warrior_2.<br />
<br />
Rampage has nothing to do with the amount of agro a person has.  If the monk only does 1 point of damage while pulling Vindi with a shruiken and feigns in Vindi's rampage range, he/she will still take rampage if they stand up right at the end of the fight, even after being feigned the entire time.  (Monks like faction hits too!)<br />
<br />
In the mage example, mage_1 did something to get on the rampage list and simply backed out of rampage range or died.  Ie: Mage_1 nukes, Mage_2 nukes.  Mage_1 starts taking rampage for whatever reason (like all the folks above him/her on the rampage list died or moved out of range) To have mage_1 switch off rampage to mage_2, the mob was either physically moved out of range of mage_1 while mage_2 was still in range, mage_1 physically backed up leaving mage_2 to get rampaged, or mage_1 died leaving mage_2 next on the list.  As soon as mage_1 moves back in range, he/she will be back to getting rampaged.<br />
<br />
Death doesn't alter your standing on the rampage list either.  If you die from rampage, are rezzed back in, and move back into rampage range, you'll start taking rampage again.<br />
<br />
edit: on a side note, if you really want to figure out how rampage works for yourself, take a group to the warrens and engage Mugglewump.  He's a high 20's mob and rampages.  He's pretty useful for testing out theories on rampage.  I've used him to test out the above theories and they've all been sound across the spectrum, either on Mugglewump, Vindi, or in Ntov/Ssra.<br />
<br />
Of course, this has nothing to do with AoE rampage, which is a completely different animal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's a Z-axis issue.  If you're on a different Z-axis, you're effectively out of range in the ice caves.  I know when we used to do Dain, we'd pull him down through the ice floor into the pits below.  The Z-axis there was terrible.  Levitate your rampage tank next time you do Dain and watch the fun ensue =/<br />
<br />
edit:  Same thing happened when we fought him on his throne.  he's a little higher up than the rest of the room there and it screws with the Z-axis.  I know healers had a hard time landing heals because they kept getting the &quot;your target is out of range&quot; when trying to land on the MA.  We didn't have any problems with rampage here though, because the SA was the rampage tank and was right next to Dain the whole time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Nevvyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Everyone's dealing with Rampage, and since all I have on Rampage are my own perceptions as (very often) rampage tank..  Which are bound to be a little skewed by being so close to the situation.<br />
<br />
Soooo, Enrage!<br />
<br />
Before changes made recently, pretty much every 55+ critter would enrage when they reached low health.  It lasts about 10-15 seconds.  During that time, as mentioned previously, the critter ripostes all frontal attacks.  Mostly the 'tank' type critters did this, but occasionally the other types as well from what I remember<br />
<br />
A fairly recent change made this no longer true.  In Bastion of Thunder, for instance, there are many post 55 critters that do NOT enrage.  They changed this in most of the PoP zones.  Still unsure why..  Either way, now it's just specific critters in PoP that do it.  Oreen, by way of example, DOES enrage, but the 63rd Militis doesn't.<br />
<br />
I will add that there is a warrior AA, in the POP AA stuff that allows you to bypass innate defenses of critters.  ((Parry/Block/Dodge/Riposte etc)).  With three levels of this I seem to be able to bypass Enrage about one of four or five attacks.  Not that you should actively TRY to attack (frontally) through enrage.. but sometimes you just have to test those AA's out.<br />

It's hard to believe that you have never had Rampage jump back and forth without anyone dieing hiding or anything. It has happened nuerous times and seeing as in a lot of situations there was no way to explain it with OOR or Z-axis issues, i came to realize that the list isn't static.<br />
<br />
Regarding the Warren mob you are talking about, i have never killed it myself, but it's possible that his list only holds 1 Ramp spot, thus making it impossible to jump from one to another.</div></div><hr />

It's hard to believe that you have never had Rampage jump back and forth without anyone dieing hiding or anything. It has happened nuerous times and seeing as in a lot of situations there was no way to explain it with OOR or Z-axis issues, i came to realize that the list isn't static.<br />
<br />
Regarding the Warren mob you are talking about, i have never killed it myself, but it's possible that his list only holds 1 Ramp spot, thus making it impossible to jump from one to another.<br />

Mugglewump has a 4 person ramp list it seems.</div></div><hr />

Get on Ramp with the shaman and then try having somebody on the Ramp list building huge aggro and see if you will still mantain the rampage. If the list holds more than 1 spot and the person actively building aggro is on it, you will see he will take the Rampage instead of you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>throxis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I ramp tanked Vindi the other night with my 56 paladin and here is what I observed.<br />
<br />
On pull, MT shot Vindi to tag off FD'd monk. Before CH landed on MT but after MT shot Vindi, I hit Vindi with a fast 1 hander to put myself near the top of the ramp list. I then stood inside rampage range (purportedly slightly smaller than melee range but I was teabaggin the whole fight to make sure I didn't get out of rampage range so I didn't test it) and waited with the rest of the raid for the MT to call assist. I ate several rampages while waiting for assist. With just under 1300AC and at level 56 with no defensive AA's Vindi's best rampage was about 2K damage. He did back to back rampages a number of times during the fight so if you plan on ramp tanking Vindi make sure you are at or near 5K HPs. I had 4853 HPs and after one particularly nasty set of 2 rampages in a row actually got low health aggro, I layed hands and it saved me. We had a couple CH druids keeping me alive and other than the close call after a double ramp they had little difficulty keeping up.<br />
<br />
I was the only person to get rampaged the entire fight so I am inclined to believe that the rampage list is static, at least with Vindi. I know for certain that our double BSing rogues and our monks were easily doing triple the damage I was so I do not think damage aggro has an effect on Vindi's rampage list in any way. I have ramp tanked him on several attempts our guild has made and have seen the same exact rampage circumstances each time.</div></div><hr />

Let me dig out some of my Vindi &amp; Rumblecrush logs.  Rampage doesn't change unless you're dead or out of range.. A shaman that slows Rumblecrush on Inc will ALWAYS stay on the rampage list no matter what, regardless of how much agro somebody else has.  Unless, of course, they move out of rampage range or they die and don't get rezzed.</div></div><hr />

It's not about damage aggro but aggro in general. Next time stop doing anything, somebody that isn't on the list can never steal Ramp off you, no matter how much aggro he generates, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">My experience tells me that the rampage list is static. As I said originally I've presonally rampage tanked pretty much every mob in vt that rampages including aten ha ra herself. I know with out a doubt in my mind that I can hold rampage the entire fight doing nothing other than cast malos and recast turgurs every 5 minutes. Slows might be a fair bit of aggro but 1 slow every 5 minutes isn't gonna hold aggro over anything.<br />
<br />
Heck I could do it by simply casting malos from my experience. I learned the hard way after maloing mobs like vindi and tormax on inc that I would hold rampage untill i died or zone with out ever casting another spell. As any shaman know malo has about as little aggro a is possible for any spell. Anyone doing anything at all is going to have more aggro than me having just cast malo. Heck my roommate, who plays a warrior btw, got and held rampage for an entire tormax fight with out ever attacking him. He was sitting down ahead of everyone else and so got on the aggro list early and he never even engaged yet he had rampage the entire fight.<br />
<br />
The reason rampage LOOKS random is because alot of people don't understand that there are alot of other ways to get on the aggro list besides just attacking. Heck getting to close to the mob and being kos can get you on the aggro list. Add people moving in and out of range, feigning, dying and you've generally got a pretty hectic situation. There's also the fact that it doesn't give you a nice little msg that says x performs a rampage on y. So people have to rely on looking for the msg and looking for some hits. You can have melee's who get reposted right when the rampage happens and think they got rampage when they didn't. Or a round where the mob attacks less and misses them all and since alot of people seem to play with misses off they think they've lost rampage.<br />
<br />
When people don't understand rampage and how it works it can easily bounce all over the place but once you realize how it works it quite clearly is static. Most of the time in VT it's very easy to control the order of aggro and very easy to see this in operation. If you doubt beleive it's static go out and play with the frog people mentioned or the giant in GD for the crown of farlankin quest. When you have an easy encounter like those you can control it and see that it is definitely static.</div></div><hr />
