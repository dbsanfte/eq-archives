<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fulaq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Attached is a graph showing just the percentage slows for both Enc and Shm,<br />
<br />
Interesting reading, it's only at lvl 39 we actually get any better at slowing really.  Again just talking about percentages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Eoin MacManus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's an interesting dance. The slows are eventually very comparable:<br />
<br />
Turgur's<br />
Slow for between 66% (L51) to 75% (L60)<br />
Mana Required: 250<br />
Spell Duration: 6 seconds (L1) to 360 seconds (L60)<br />
Duration Formula: 7<br />
Casting Time: 3.0 seconds<br />
Spell Recovery: 2.25 seconds<br />

<br />
Forlorn Deeds<br />

The difference has always been cooperation and durability. If an enchanter slows in addition to mezzing, it takes longer to get mobs slowed. A shaman slowing can do so while the chanter handles mezzes. Also, we can have much higher AC than an enchanter, allowing us to handle the slow aggro better. They get their share from Tash and mez/charm already. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Also, our slow casts faster, which can be significant.<br />
<br />
You don't list the recast delay on the chanter spell, does that mean that there isn't one?  8.25 seconds cast to cast versus 11.25 for ours?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Weissblau,<br />
<br />
Enchanter's recast delay is instant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>oldlurk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Can someone confirm the duration on forlorn deeds ? <br />
6 minutes ? i always thought it was more like 3 minutes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ogrym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">put it this way.  Last night i got summoned across the zone by a bug and enchanter had to slow.  He died 3 times in that fight slowing.  I've slowed same mob and never even lost a bub of health.  That's the difference between shaman and enchanter slows.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe i am blind, but i couldn't read what the difference between shamans and enchanter slows is out of your post.<br />
Are you one of the people advocating the &quot;we shamans can take a beat and chanters can't&quot; ?<br />
<br />
Just curious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Our slow lasts longer as well.  That is actually the key since you often have a lot of mobs queued up to be killed, it is a nice safety buffer to have the mobs locked down with slow for long durations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gikk the Unholy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Its a lesser slow, longer cast time, shorter duration, and shaman are more equiped to deal with the aggro it generates.  Besides that Forlorn Deeds = Turgurs Insects!</div></div><hr />
