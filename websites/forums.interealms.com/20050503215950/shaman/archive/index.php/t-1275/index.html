<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>scooch74</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After another extended break from EQ, I'm contemplating a return (insert appropriate lack of will power quip here :rolleyes: ). I'm slowly learning the new aspects of the interface (/hitsmode among others) but I'm still unclear on the channel thing. I hear people referring to using different channels and such and I have to admit I know little about what they are referring to or how to take advantage of it. Does anyone know of a guide to break it down for me or can someone sum it up for this less than bright barbarian?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think they mean the chat channels features that was recently added. You can create chat channels in the game now, similiar to guild channels, which most people now use for raids instead of the old /ooc or /shout spam.<br />
<br />
You can join up to ten chat channels at a time, and they are given a number 1 through 10. Each time a message is displayed from a certain channel it will show you the name and channel number of that channel. <br />
<br />
The manual says you can substitute the channel number for the channel name in most cases, but I've noticed that it doesnt work with the /leave command. You need to use the name of the channel when you type /leave.<br />
<br />
To speak on a channel just type: /(channel number) (message)<br />
<br />
To join or create a chat channel: /join (channel name)<br />
<br />
If there is a password, or you want to add one: /join (channel name) : (password)<br />
<br />
Some other commands;<br />
<br />
/leave (channel)<br />
<br />
/leaveall<br />
<br />
/list (channel) - shows you all people in the channel<br />
<br />
/announce on/off<br />
<br />
/chat invite (character) (channel)<br />
<br />
/chat grant (character) (channel) - gives a player moderator powers<br />
<br />
/chat kick (character) (channel) - kicks a person out of channel<br />
<br />
/chat moderate (channel name) - silences the channel to all but moderators and those with voice<br />
<br />
/chat voice (character) (channel) - gives a person ability to speak on a moderated channel, or removes voice if issued a second time<br />
<br />
/autojoin (channel) - sets you to join a channel automatically each time you log into game on that PC<br />
<br />
To autojoin multiple channels: /autojoin (channel),(channel),(channel)<br />
<br />
EDIT: Just a word of warning about the /autojoin feature, however; it is a permanent command. There is no way to remove the autojoin once you issue it, except to issue it again with a new channel. It is also tied to your PC, not your character or even your account. You will autojoin the channel no matter what character or account you log onto.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>scooch74</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks Rathelon - your response was exactly what I was looking for. I think I understand a little bit better now. Ok, a couple of more questions...first, how do you know what chat channels are available and how might you create one? For instance, is there an auction channel on each server to facilitate trading and if so, how do you find it? Or is there a shaman only channel for example? Second, when you join a channel and talk and receive messages in it, do the messages appear in your normal chat window, or is there a separate window for chats similar to /hitsmode?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">A couple additions to Rathelon's information:<br />
<br />
/list if done without specifying a channel gives you a list of what channels you are currently in and their numbers.<br />
<br />
/autojoin is stored in your eqclient.ini file. You can change it in there if you wish.<br />
<br />
/leave does work with channel numbers. I do it that way all the time.<br />
<br />
How do you find out what channels are around? Primarily by asking other players on your server. Most (if not all) servers have some sort of auction chat channel by now. The name varies. auction, market, trade, etc...  Either ask other players or try random names until you find the right one. <br />
<br />
The messages appear in your normal chat window.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, if you want to change the colors of the channels they are UserColor 36 through 45 (for channels 1 through 10 respectively), and messages about the channels themselves (things like you joining, leaveing, listing members, etc) is color 35.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you join a channel that doesn't exist, it is automatically created.  That's how you start your own.  If you want it password protected, you would use /join channel:password.<br />
