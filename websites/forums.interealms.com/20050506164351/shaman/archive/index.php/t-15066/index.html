<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jyphant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone else having problems with patch server? And can this be fixed.  Or is it sony problem?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grogla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Having same problem..im assuming its something Sony is doing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I tried to connect several times to the patch server this morning. Sometimes it would download a file or two and then give me a cannot connect message, and other times it would just give me the message right off.<br />
<br />
That, to me, means it's a problem on Sony's end.<br />
<br />
Also, I could browse every website I tried, except EverquestLive, so maybe there's some connection issues between me and Sony's computers. Maybe it's just busy on their end, with all the users trying to download the new files.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">They put up a new patcher with the ability to download LDoN files.  I'd imagine that's causing a ruckus somewhere in the patch system.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Larsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Aye patchers is completely hosed for me.<br />
<br />
Lost all luclin models, UI, and get &quot;string not found&quot; text instead of option button.<br />
<br />
I bought LDoN...prob caused all the problem.<br />
<br />
BTW I tried to zone into KC and gated to the Nexxus.<br />
<br />
Strange<br />
