<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Trying to figure out what has me jaded about playing right now.  Been stuck at level 47 with my warrior for some time now, and to be honest, I haven't looked forward to logging in each night.  Maybe it's the current state of the warrior, I dunno.  Maybe with some love in a patch, I'll want to play him more again.  I have a hunter and a rogue alt, but to be honest, I don't want to join the legions that already play these classes.  I tend to at least try to pick the lesser common classes or races in these games and not go for the flavor of the month.<br />
<br />
Anyway, we have a crew of me (47 warrior), my wife (51 priest), and my 2 RL brothers (51 shaman and USED to be a 49 shaman).  Well, one of the shaman decided to re-roll as a rogue, so now he is levelling up and our adventuring has stalled.  I have 14/17 quests in my log right now that are ELITE.  Uldaman, Zul'Farruk, and a few random ones (maybe Hinterlands stuff, can't remember). [EDIT: forgot Mauradon, that's the other main one)<br />
<br />
All the other quests just are getting sort of old for me.  Example... Un'Goro crater, collecting power crystals and soil samples... ughhh... I guess I had a preview from other people that show the rewards are just... lame... xp and not even great xp really.  And dodging the 50' raptors that hit me for 500 a pop is just annoying.  <br />
<br />
I dunno... have others banged into a similar wall like this?  What do you do to keep things fresh?  I think many will say PvP but on an RP server, the PvP battles (as I've outlined before) are not that fun... it's like playing red rover red rover, and as soon as someone gets out of their line to try and attack, they get mobbed by 20 people and wait for another to try.  It's not very compelling to me.<br />
<br />
Are there some good quests coming up (Horde, btw)?  Should I just farm SM or something? LOL<br />
<br />
Dunno, just rambling now... hehe<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I feel the same, that is why I have so many alts. PvVP certainly is not boring, heh, but we are outnumbered and it just seems where there is one, there is a dozen, so even that gets old.<br />
<br />
Should be able to do real well with warrior/shammy/priest in a dungeon, just might need a few extra levels over a 5 man group.<br />
<br />
Just treat it like it is, a game, and enjoy it, I get too caught up in worrying about advancing too, but hell, just kick back with a beer and do something stupid, like solo a lower level dungeon, something weird.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Start an alt of the opposing faction. When I get tired/bored and start feeling like my Hunter is a repetative grind, that's when I go play my Tauren Hunter or Shaman.<br />
<br />
At least in the lower game the environments are considerably different and the quests aren't the same ones I did as a young Night Elf Hunter.<br />
<br />
Variety. It's one of the core elements of successful MMO's, and WoW has plenty of it to go around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the suggestions.<br />
<br />
I do have alliance alts, but I just haven't been very motivated on them.  The quests are different, yeah, but ultimately follow the same pattern.  Go there and kill a few things, go there and kill more things, go there and collect things, go there and kill the boss and oh yeah he's elite, go there and talk to someone, then come back and talk to me and maybe you'll be done.  I know there are exceptions to this, but still.  I suppose alliance would be different up to oh... the ashenvale levels then stranglethorn, where they seem to be similar, if not the exact same (not sure).<br />
<br />
But yeah, good adice Mill... i guess i'll just take it easy and not worry about it.  I find myself watching TV more than playing now though.  I did start lifting weights again recently, so maybe this is good hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Try a druid, They're still a pretty uncommon class and with the improvements to dire bear form you can have variety and still tank quite decently from what I understand. <br />
<br />
That's what I intend to do if I manage to get my hands on an account.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ughh.<br />
<br />
Druids at high lvel are versatile, but they are a pain in the ass to level, compared to other classes, I have a  20 tauren druid, gave him up long ago. But, they made changes to bear form since then, might be better now.<br />
<br />
Shammy going strong, made 20, and just about 225 engineering, love that dynamite and exploding sheep!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Played a tauren druid up to 20 during one of the stress tests and had a blast. From what I've seen on the wow boards people either love it or hate it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I am playing a Night Elf druid on Earthen Ring. Named Srathor. I play him when my main group isn't on for me to play Feather.<br />
<br />
It is a extremly versitle class, but it is a major love or hate thing. So far I am really liking the ability to chose what to effect. Be it healing Tanking or some damage. Sure I do not do nearly the damage of the thief. Not even when in cat form. But I do enough to get by. And the ability to swap out and heal, or pop into bear and taunt that add just adds alot to the class.<br />
<br />
Much like a shaman in EQ before the narrowed class roles were set into the grouping mindset. The druid can do it all. Just not fast. <br />
<br />
As for leveling, bear form + swipe + damage sheild + the talent spec that helps ignore damage for healing cast times means you cna get stuck into 2-3  level appropriate monsters and beat them to death while swapping out to heal when need be. It helps alot on the xp front killing 2-3 at a time and makes it aweful exciting fight wise.  <br />
