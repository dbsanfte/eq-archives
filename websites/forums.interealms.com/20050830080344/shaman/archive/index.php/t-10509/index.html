<br />
I just purchased the cheapy tan horse to use for mana regen while casting / reduced agro.  I use OLD models and have horse models turned OFF.<br />
<br />
I have no idea how it works.  I have put it in ammo spot and cast right click.  I get an icon for the horse.  But - my mana does not go up as though I am medding while i am standing / mounted on horse.<br />
<br />
What is up with this?  How should it work?  Do I need to turn horse models on?  Thanks for the help!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>mool</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Being on a horse using the old models, you don't see the mana regen on your client but you are indeed getting it on the server.  You just have to cast to get a proper update (I think using a clicky item will make your client update also).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mootski</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">So the trick is to disable horse models then?  Are there any other tricks that make battling on a horse easier?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>hamani101</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">you have to disable all models<br />
<br />
and what the previous poster said, if you have models off, you have to either cast a spell or cast yer epic and interupt it, something to force a mana refresh on your side</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Baldkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just clicking the bridle again refreshes it (and gives you the &quot;you are already mounted on a horse) - also SoW boots are another popular clicky :)<br />
<br />
But, you must turn *all* models off to use a horse, as far as I know - NOT just the race of your character.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Go to eqinterface.com and download the &quot;3tabpet&quot; mod for the pet window.  On the &quot;pet&quot; tab, your AMMO slot item is always visible.  Right-click on the bridle in the AMMO slot any time you want to see your current mana level.<br />
<br />
Cannibalizing works, too, of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tumamor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Why not just cast shrink on yourself a couple times after you are on your horse and then you don't have any of those problems.<br />
<br />
When I use my laptop sometimes with the shaman and horse and I find it a pain not having the models turned on, so I just turned that one on.  One Horse model is not going to kill your system, just turn off some other useless model.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The biggest reason people want the models off and no horse showing is that you are able to interupt your spells using duck which you can not do when you have a horse showing.  Also you dont get the slow acceleration and will run at sow speed with sow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It was at one time very easy to not have the horse.  You could have all the new models but just not show horse.<br />
<br />
SOE changed this in an atempt to keep people from exploiting the benifits of the horse without the consequenses, but people figured out that if you turn all the new models off then you can still make it work.<br />
<br />
I would just recomend shrinking.<br />
<br />
When you need to get around fast just click the horse off and run... then click the horse back on when the situation permits.<br />
<br />
This works fine with a couple of shrinks and you will know that you are not doing somthing dishonest.<br />
<br />
You do not need to shrink after each recast of the horse buff.<br />
<br />
Safe Travels</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Anomalos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Shrink takes care of the horse's head, but there's no possible way I can deal with not being able to interrupt a spell.  Hell, I couldn't even handle the fact that I move around alot, and that slow down speed up crap is annoying.  No thanks, i'll keep the old models (I like them better anyways).</div></div><hr />
