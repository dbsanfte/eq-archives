<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Yecna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wondering how fast everyone else is getting AA xp. At 60 in the bear pits i can get about 4 blues per hour solo- its gonna be a long time to EQ/AM3 :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I am not getting AAXP atm but I was told that in higher lvl planes AA's come in at about 1 per 2-3 hours</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lauralei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">In PoD grouped I get about one every 3 hours, a little less if it is the castle camp, or if we are pulling two of the courtyards.  <br />
<br />
Soloing the rats at zin while waiting for groups is roughly 2% aaxp per kill.  There aren't enough of these (druids charm them all the time for pets) to make this a real viable method of xp'ing.<br />
<br />
I haven't solo'd too much in PoJ so I'm not sure on those mobs.<br />
<br />
Anyone have a good solo spot for aaxp at 60 (old world or otherwise) that competes with the teir one planes?  A change of scenery once in awhile would be nice, and LFG for an hour or two gets old.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kalvarian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Bastion of Thunder: 2 per 3 hours (unless we keep getting distracted by named giants)<br />
Plane of Storms: 1-1.5 per 3 hours (unless we get distracted by named giants...see a trend ;) )<br />
Plane of Valor duo or trio with chanter: 3 per 3 hours<br />
Plane of Nightmare: Too slow to deal with now that I've gotten BoT flagged</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Holy mother ****er, those AA's come fast in BoT and Valor (with a chanter)<br />
<br />
because I can here are the new calcs in terms of how many hours to go from no AA's to EQ + AM3<br />
<br />
<br />
at 2 AA's / 3 hours in BoT 45 AA's would take 67.5 hours<br />
at  1.5 AA's / 3 hours in PoS 45 AA's would tak 90 hours<br />
at 1 AA per hour w/ a chanter in Valor 45 AA's would take 45 hours<br />
<br />
just for comparisons sake say we play 3 hours / day  Mon-Thurs, Fri-Sun we play 5 hours/day, thats 27 hours/week<br />
<br />
that means;<br />
2 weeks to get EQ + AM3 in Valor w/ the chanter<br />
2-3 weeks to get EQ + AM3 in BoT (more towards 3)<br />
a little over 3 weeks to get EQ + AM3 in storms<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
sorry but I am just BLOWN AWAY by that, then again you need to be 65 with EQ + AM3 to get into these groups right? nice paradox</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Yecna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">How about solo AA in Pop, without EQ/AM3? Whats the xp on PoJ guards/ rats compared to bear pits?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Karloss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Had my first real taste of uber xp this weekend in PoV.<br />
<br />
Me (60 RNG), 64 ENC, 58 RNG , (plus swapped between a 64 DRU and 64 CLR)<br />
<br />
We were at WW (I think thats what ppl are calling it) doing the crystaline gollies and spiders (arrghhh at the spiders!).<br />
<br />
It went something like:<br />
Zone into PoV 5% towards 61 (my small buffer while I get EQ/AM3)<br />
Take 2 steps out of GY, 4 skellies pop and slay me (hitting for 500+)<br />
Now 5% from 60 =(<br />
Re enter, leave corpse (waiting for 64 CLR to replace DRU) head to camp.<br />
Kill 4 things and im at 99% and about to re-ding 60 - get a spider add (unsnarable/rootable) and I go down FAST. Now at only 92% in =(<br />
Re enter, get both corpses rezed and Im at 15% towards 61 :)<br />
<br />
Then spend another 1.5 hours in a group of 4 helping chanter and manage to net an entire AA - I was blown away. Most was conning yellow to me as well so was getting an XP bonus over the level 64s :)<br />
<br />
So in just over 2 hours I bagged an entire AA and 10% towards lvl 61 and that included 2 deaths (96% rezzes).<br />
<br />
All with the guild though, haven't found a pickup group yet although (oddly) I have been asked twice now if I was BoT flagged (which I am not :( ) =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Barogio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Chanter groups are awesome when you have a good crew, get in the groove and don't have 6 adds at once as your shaman is canni5'ing :) <br />
<br />
If your safe, you do stuff right you can get an AA as fast as they say but it's not like you can log on and get grouped.. people take xp spots etc, people are late online whatever.. so working it out as you did isnt perhaps so =) <br />
<br />
However if you have 3-4 hours to grind and a group like that it is amazing what you achieve.</div></div><hr />
