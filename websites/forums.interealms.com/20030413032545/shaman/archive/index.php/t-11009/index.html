<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Styks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A fellow kitty in guild was telling me about a quest called sonic wolf bane.  Its a series of quests where the rewards are a dagger and cloak.  He was saying you have to do tradeskills to do the quest.  I have yet to find any information on this from alakazams and was wondering if any of you fellow cats knew anything about this.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's the main Vah Shir quest that starts when you hand in your newbie note and then gain citizenship.  <br />
<br />
It's long and the weapon is dissappointing at best but it leads to some very nice cloaks.  I've heard the last one has Flowing Thought 5 on it but will require an Acrylia Caverns raid to get.  I've yet to actually see one though.  <br />
<br />
It requires the assistance of other Vah Shir of each classs to complete due to the no drop tool needed to complete each of the five parts.<br />
<br />
Warriors smith a porous dagger blade<br />
Bards throw(pottery) ceramic sleeves<br />
Rogues bake sonic wolfbane poison<br />
Beastlords tailor toughened sinew lashings<br />
Shaman brew reactive sealant soak<br />
<br />
You need to have all five parts and one other ingredient that will be given to you when you reach that point in your questing.  All the parts need the appropriate tradeskill to be around 135 for a decent success rate on the combines.<br />
<br />
Shaman get a 4/21 +3 bane to Sonic Wolves spear instead of a dagger.  Beastlords get claws, the other three classes get a dagger.  You will also receive a clicky earring that gives you immunity to Owlbear Screech during the quest<br />
<br />
If you just continue with the quest your guildmaster gave you when you started out you will eventually get to the weapons and the cloaks.  If you don't remember what you were supposed to do EQTraders.com has a nice write up in their quest section covering the first parts of this quest.<br />
<br />
Hope I didn't ramble too much.</div></div><hr />
