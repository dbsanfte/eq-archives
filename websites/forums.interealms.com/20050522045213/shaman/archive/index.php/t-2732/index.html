<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ryasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sorry I am new and couldn't seem to find out my question by viewing the forums. Perhaps it has been answered and I apologize for making extra posts if that is the case. But, as a kitty, do I do the epic just like the barbarian? Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hey! I like the blue font!<br />
<br />
Yep, vah shir shaman can do the shaman epic, I would guess you would start it in OOT like a barbarian.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ryasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ahhh, a redhead answered. Makes it all better ;) I got a thing for redheads. Like the sig too, except your information is not at the link(guild link in your name). It is all left unanswered :( You seem to be a major person on this board from what I have read so far. Thanks for the quick and curtious response!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Inqubus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">As a kitty Shaman who has completed the first part (the most boring part), I started the epic by killing the iksar marauder in Field of Bone.  There are several ways to start the epic, just check out EQ Shaman (http://www.eqshaman.com )  and look at their epic walkthrough there.  When the spirit in Freeport asks which you follow, I chose Barbarian as someone else who had done it previously responded with that and got their epic just fine.  Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Khaline</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ive Finished my Epic on Terris Thule, and i did mine starting with the guy in Butcher Block and i Used Justice as my answer..i hope this helps you<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There are jump off points for the epic in OOT, Rathe, FoB, and mebe even in Luclin.  It does not matter which one you start at and all will respond the same to keywords.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I believe because Kitties are Agnostic you can pretty much say anything in the dialogue to trigger the quest. You can tell the Greater Spirit that you follow Justice, War, Fear, or Hate...I don't think it matters in the case of Vah' Shir. Correct me if I'm wrong.</div></div><hr />
