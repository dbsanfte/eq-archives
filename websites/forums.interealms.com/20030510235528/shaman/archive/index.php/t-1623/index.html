<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Karnn Sathir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Aright, heres the deal. <br />
Our guild had a dueling event today in Lake Rathe Arena. Much fun, beer, combat, beer, etc, beer... Anyway, the only person there of about my lvl (41) was a 43 ranger. <br />
Ok, so I slap on all my buffs, I mean all off em, resists etc. Sow, haste, talisman pet and get ready, first try a quick blind to test his MR, bounced, tried a VoS, bounced, hey wheres my pet? Ok, he killed my pet within 10 seconds after the start of the duel, not kidding. He then proceeds to wack me with his two Ykeshas, he seems to proc on about every swing (starting to suspect a dex buff there), so I throw in a disspell magic, it lands, no idea what I disspelled. Next I cast slow, it stick after 2 tries, good, he still continues beating me up like he never heard of the word &quot;slow&quot;, rest of the spells I tried got all bounced... I did not try a disease spell though, I know thats a tuff resist to get up, but I did not expect his huge resists to slow poison etc, so didnt have a disease spell memd...<br />
We were forced to stay on the square in the  middle of the Arena so I did not have much room to run around in.<br />
<br />
Ok, I know he was 2 lvls higher and i know he had very  good stuff (atleast in the resists compartement), but he beat me withing 2 mins. I don't mind to loose a dual, but this was pure carnage.<br />
Please, any advice for future duals (payback muahaha)?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">try a malise type spell?<br />
<br />
if he goes after your pets you can sick dots and slows on him pretty fast.<br />
<br />
a poisen nuke might do the trick too......Try debuffing his resists, that could help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Karnn Sathir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Aye, I tried Malisement and it bounced twice. <br />
He killed my pet so fast that I seriously did not have any time to actually finish casting any spell (well, maybe blind, but he would've resisted prob). The pet was dead within 5 sec or so. People were asking in /ooc where my pet ran too, didn't even notice it getting killed :/.<br />
I asked him later how he got the pet down so fast, he said with damage shield an reposts.<br />
Come to think of it, there's a good chance one of the chanters gave him VoG and a druid gave him a high lvl DS. I should have rematch later on where I am sure he's not buffed by anyone else ;).<br />
Btw, I did not have a poison nuke loaded, but as VoS bounced about 3 times in a row, I think it wouldn't have done me much good either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">if he was only 2 levels higher then you i find it amazing that even poisen spells bounced.<br />
<br />
i can land poisen dots on reds in OT, but spells w/ magic resistance checks bounce(unless i malise, and that only holds on some mobs).  <br />
<br />
Make sure his MR isnt buffed before the fight, and try to stick a mal_ on him.  if it holds then slow, dot or whatever.  Try dispelling his sow, so you can run around.  His archery shouldnt do THAT much dmg at that level...<br />
<br />
i dont have much experiance dueling v. rangers...so i cant help ya much.  if FoL bounced then his MR must be amazing, and it was probably buffed...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">In most PvP encounters people try to max resists, but in particular magic resist. If he managed to get good posion resist it was beacause he would have known that he was gonna fight a shaman and did his homework...poison is where most smart shaman pin their PvP hopes, although the very smart patient ones go with disease.<br />
<br />
Basically, magic resist is usually highest, so if you cast Flash of light and it doesnt stick in the first 2 or 3 casts forget magic based spells - no slow, no root, no malo, etc. Go with poison or disease. Disease is actually better because your disease resist debuffer is disease based rather than poison debuffer that is magic based.<br />
<br />
Use cancel/annul magic as much as possible - he will have plenty of buffs, with his crappy buffs stacked first. If he has any sense he will put SoW near the end of his buffs, so keep clearing his buffs until you clear SoW (better hope he isnt super smart and has 2 insta-cast R clickable items). If you can get rid of his SoW your chances got a heap better! Remember you will have chloro happening and he wont (unless he is super smart and paid a shaman to make him a regen potion in advance). So, if you have SoW and he doesnt you should be able to run around and regen damage while he will be unable to get to within melee range. Note, it is a fine line between being in his melee range and being in his bowkiting range - ouch<br />
<br />
Bottom line is that rangers are one of the tougher PvP classes to beat. And even 2 levels difference is a real difference. Essentially, and perhaps sadly, A lot of PvP boils down to gear. Ok, a poorly equipped smart player is able to be able to beat a well equiped no-brainer, but really, if 2 competent smart players of similar level go PvP, the one with the better gear will win... <br />
<br />
Also, in my opinion, classes go through phases where they are relatively weak and relatively strong compared to other classes. For shaman, levels 20-23 and 30-33 are relatively weak, levels 24, 25, 34, 35 are quite strong. Level 41 is a relatively weak level. You do not get a strong level now until 49 - that is a huge power surge - level up some and then kick his ass</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Not being able to move around seriously limits your options. Hmmm, about the only thing not mentioned so far is to get some of the high powered DS potions from an older shaman and if you can afford it a stinging wort or two and let him pincushion himself to death on you, the damage he can do to himself with two Yaks should be prety impressive. Conserv your mana to self healing if you can't get anything to stick on him. If he is using DS get the biggest slowest hardest hitting weapon you can lay hands on so the damage HIS damage shield does to you is minimized while doing max damage to him. Procing weapons are MUCH harder to resist, if you can get your hands on a procing weapon go for it. This is really almost a no win situation, but you can make him pay for it. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ok... here's what I would do. Of course if nothing sticks then you're screwed and dead, but gotta try, right?<br />
<br />
Spells to have up:<br />
Mal___<br />
Slow<br />
Dispell<br />
Disease dot<br />
Nuke (sometimes you have to think unconventional, he probably won't have good MR, DR, AND CR)<br />
Heal<br />
Root<br />
Blind<br />
<br />
Buff up first of all, every buff you have. Also buff your dog with everything you have. I know it takes forever, but it's worth it. Also, in 3 levels you get summon companion, so you can park your pet away from you and summon him as you start your duel, which is unnerving for someone who didn't know you had a pet up, as it kinda causes some confusion in their plan. May or may not be possible there, I have never been to the arena so I haven't seen the layout.<br />
<br />
Open with dispells. Dispell the heck outta him while he goes after your pet. As a general rule, anyone who's dumb enough to kill the pet first will lose to a well played shaman.<br />
<br />
Don't panic and try and run all the time, just attempt to channel through his hits if he turns on you while you're casting.<br />
<br />
Dispell at least twice, I'm thinking you should do it more like 4 times IF you have time. Then hit him with blind, if it doesn't stick then try malisement, blind again, strafe out of his melee range and behind him (or elsewhere) and then slow him, then dot him.<br />
<br />
If you can get a DS potion before this he will have done some of your work in advance for you, because at lvl 41, you'll be doing something like 21 or 22 in damage for every one of his hits, even if he just hits for 1. <br />
<br />
Back off a little, and heal yourself as needed (you don't wanna let him get close and not be able to channel a heal, you don't need to be FULL health, but you don't want to be at 40% either) and land your disease dot on him. Depending on mana situation, chain nuke or canni some... if your nukes are resisted at all don't bother and just be patient with your disease dot. Keep him blinded, and sit down and swap out your nuke with poison dot at this point really fast if the nuke is resisted. It's very unlikely that he has resists high in CR, DR, MR, AND PR. Apply this dot, let your pet beat on him, if he is kickin your pets butt, recall it... <br />
<br />
Don't get in melee range unless he's not hitting hard vs your damage shield potion. if you're doing more damage to him with it than he's doing to you, he'll kill himself. Otherwise, stay out of melee range.<br />
<br />
Try this, it works well. If he breaks out the bow, you are going to have to learn (really fast) how to stay in between melee range and bow range.<br />
<br />
You may wanna get a couple stinging wort potions, it's a 300hp instant heal, gives you a 2nd chance almost...<br />
<br />
They key to winning duels for shamans is to be patient. We aren't wizards, we can't make the kill instant. The key is to simply shoot for outlasting the enemy. If you keep yourself alive till he has no more arrows and no more mana, then all he has is melee to kill you. Root him, rot him, and sit back while he tries to med and you hit him with your 5 point nuke every time he sits down to make it so he can't med.<br />
<br />
Keep him blind and he can't even find you ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Karnn Sathir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks for all the great input guys, I will surely try to organise a rematch some time and prepare myself the best I can. <br />
The space limit in the last duel was one of the things that killed me, as was the fact he was probably enchanter buffed.<br />
Judging of some reaction, FoL/BL should be pretty hard to resist? I used blinding luminance on him, it has the same cast time, costs bit  more mana (which is still next to zero) and usually sticks longer then FoL. Maybe theres something I do not know about them, like one having an advantage over the other in PvP, etc?<br />
Another question: stinging word potions are shaman made or vendor bought? I have not been keeping my skill up as much as I should have been, but the money resources are allowing another sow potion surge soon :).<br />
<br />
Cheers,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Stinging Wort is Shaman made from Ice Giant Toes and a Balm Leaf. They are trivial at the 150'ish range so even if you were maxed out for your level you probably couldn't make em. Ice Giant Toes go for several hunderd plat off vendors. I have no idea how much they sell to vendors for but you might want to find out and head to Everfrost and buy some from the IG farmers. The Balm Leaf comes from Gypsie Vendors is such places as the Oasis of Marr. If you go to an older Shaman with the ingredients in hand and offer to let him keep a few for himself they will probably be more than happy to help out. Good hunting.</div></div><hr />
