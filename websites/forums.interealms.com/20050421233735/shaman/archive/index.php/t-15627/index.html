<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mitor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sorry this doesn't relate to hunting grounds as much:-\ just the only forum i know that will respond before my next log on.<br />
<br />
Sorta died in KD just past the see invis mobs infront of arena.. lvl 51 now was 52. Was wondering if theres a easy way i could get my body.. i was thinkin about makin dog distract the 2 see invis mobs while i blast scale of the wolf and just try to drag it far enough to be able to invis up again later and just drag that corpse safely. <br />
<br />
:-\ recently bought tae ew gear so i'm literally broke and no necro wants to go to KD .. waste money on a coffin just to summon for me.<br />
<br />
Anything would help. thx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You won't be able to cast sow indoors, so what you come in with is what you get.  The dog distraction sounds like a good idea.  Maybe try binding at a safe area near zone-in so in case you gate out you don't have to run far or zone.  Full Buff your pet and place him near the corner of the turn before the 2 guards.  Try and get both guards to agro on the dog, if one doesn't try rooting it.  Get and pull body closer to you, decide to gate or make a run for it.  The key thing is don't do any  damage to either giants yourself as they will summon.  Be careful of wandering arena guards on the otherside.<br />
<br />
It would be a great idea to get an aego or virtue before you head out! <br />
<br />
I have a hotkey called corpse.  It's commands are /corpse and /loc, that way if you lose contact with your corpse you know where it is, as in some hilly terrain can make dragging difficult.<br />
<br />
Good luck and let us know how it turns out!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>mitor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hehe thanks for the tips.. i was gettin ready to try to pull thing off, then got a OOC asking if i needed a rez:-\ hehe sorry didn't turn out so interesting. <br />
<br />
i did see the cleric just run by the guards dragg'ed body to WL line w/o much trouble:_\ i probably owuldn't have been able to make it look that easy tho<br />
<br />
again thanks alot for the info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Great to hear it when by so un eventful =D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>VXThis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Glad you got your body already, but I think even at the Arena you are safe if you make a Rallos Zek mule, they are non-KoS... I run MQs for Coldain Bracer with a wood elf bard that way.    Im pretty sure Vindi will smack you down though, so watch out.<br />
<br />
I have heard you can also consent an alternate character then log them on.  Whether this is true or not, who knows?<br />
<br />
Also, if you will wait for spirit of cheetah to pop up, that is always a little extra boost in speed when ya need it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>mitor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i was thinking about that before i got my corpse, i believe someone told me of the mule drags a corpse he becomes kos or something along those lines^^ thanks again for ur guy's concern!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well yes you can consent some one not logged on at the time of consent so you can consent an alt if needed.  Second point is thta Keal, Thurgard, and Skyshine all have Anti corpse dragging code.  If you are seen dragging a body of a person KOS to them you become KOS till you Zone, Log, or Die.  As with most places if you know your way you can just out hoof them to zone spamming your corpse button.  Or bind just out of zone if your not KOS and start casting your gate at about 1 sec to completion click a hot button created in your Actions menu to drag the body to you at the last moment.  Run back to the body and repeat till its out of agro range of the see invis mobs.  Then just invis up and drag it to zone.  People always love to make things harder then they have to be.  Worse comes to worse bind a level 1-10 newbie charactor in Keal that follows Rallos Zek.  Run up start spamming your drag corpse button you'll make it 5-10 steps and die but no lose of exp and just take you little longer.<br />
<br />
P.S.  I realize you got your body back but just thought I would put bit info down here for the future.  Or for someone else trying to figure out how the #@$% thier going to get thier body out of some mess they had gotten themselves into.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>mgbaron2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Don't know if this applies or not, but another possibility is to make a halfling rogue.  They get hide &amp; sneak at level 1 and all rogues have a message that lets them know if the skill worked (unlike dark elves, etc).  I don't know how the see invis giants react to hidden/sneaky rogues but it's a possibility.  I know I pulled my ranger out of Icewell keep with this technique.  And yes, I can verify that you can consent an alt to drag your corpse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Discordja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The easiest way to do something like that is just to ask a non kos monk to drag you.  You can FD then /corpse and you don't generate agro.  So target, fd, /corpse ad infinitum and it's completely safe.  Necros can also do as well.  Also, those giants are pretty slow and relatively low level so you can just get some high level something to drag with run3 and they'll be at zone line in no time at all with minimal damage if something like that ever happens again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Foramorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">IMO the easiest way to do a CR here is to do one of three things:<br />
<br />
Get a necro to summon from EW side.<br />
<br />
Get a monk to drag.<br />
<br />
Or find a cleric or enchanter to pacify the see invis mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Larsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I was able to consent my level 18 rogue alt (keep him around for just this reason..scouting is good), give him a 10 dose Sow potion (always keep these and IVU potions in shared bank), did a sneak/hide with Sow and drug my body out with np..<br />
<br />
Rogue alts can be very useful, even at 18 I rarely have sneak/hide drop.<br />
