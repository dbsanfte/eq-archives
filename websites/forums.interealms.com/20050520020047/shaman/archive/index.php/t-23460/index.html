<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>haruuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">it just hit me. rather than lynching Rytan, threatening to quit EQ, etc, all of you who are dissatisfied with EQ to the point of being angry should petition to have a new server created. one with your own full time team of 200+ devs and programmers for same-week implementation of all of the suggestions you make. further...all of the dissatisfied non-shams would go there, as well.<br />
<br />
a server run by the (angry) people, for the (angry) people! we could call it Utopia.<br />
<br />
<br />
i can see it now...<br />
<br />
day 1. shammies whine the loudest, demand bigger heals NOW! noooo problem! at Utopia, they NEVER say no, because YOU know best! wheeeeee!!!! all of the sudden, that 1k/tick heal over time is implemented, as well as a 2k version of the 3.75 second heal! WHEEEEE!!!!<br />
<br />
day 2. druids now complain more loudly, and are given (drumroll) a 1.1k per tick heal over time!!!! same day, SKs complain about not having any clicky defense! NOOO PROBLEMS!!! pallies and SKs are given an 11 second version of Furious, and a 3 second shorter version of Stonewall! same day, Beastlords, unhappy that their heals are so far behind shamans, receive Tnarg's and Quiessence! Mages get a 3k nuke!<br />
<br />
day 3. wizards get pets! shamans now realize that they are now behind again since druids still have bigger 10 second heals and heal over time! WE DEMAND MORE HEALING!!! the arms race has begun! shamans receive a 5500 point 10 second heal, and a new OoW version of the 1k per tick heal over time, which takes it up to 1200/tick! clerics, seeing the gap closing, demand More Massive Heals, and are now gifted with Complete Heal--AND THEN SOME! (actual name of spell!) which not only completely heals the target, it throws a 2k rune and spell shield on top of their max hps! WOA, nELLY!!!<br />
<br />
day 4. mages get kite and root, beastlords get mending of Kragg, warriors, having griped about the knights getting clicky defense, are now given an innate ability that ensures a 25% crit rate, as well as innate 5% melee mitigation, and their hp table is expanded! bards receive root and the duration of their songs are increased so they are now able to spin up to as many as 8 songs at once!!! monks, unhappy with JUST fd for pulling, are now given a massive AOE pacify, and mez (for when they dont' feel like using FD). Rangers receive an aa that DOUBLES their crit dmg using a bow, and are now seen competing with wizards for the highest dps. witness accounts have uber rangers hitting crits around 7k. <br />
<br />
day 5. REVENGE OF THE ROGUES!!! &quot;FLURRY OF BACKSTAB&quot; ability!!!! new weapons!!! druids and shamans turn in simultaneous requests for a 3k quick heal, 7k 10 second heal, and 1500/tick heal over time for each of their classes, and they...BOTH...receive them! majority of clerics follow through with suicide pact and vanish...the remaining 3 demand (and receive) 80% slow!<br />
<br />
day 6. recognizing a trend in how often they are getting screwed over, EVERY CLASS simultaneously demands max abilities in all categories, and there are now no differentiations between classes except for the name!<br />
<br />
template: <br />
max hp table.<br />
any armor<br />
any weapon<br />
innate crits with melee<br />
complete heal, 5k quick heal, 2500/tick heal over time<br />
8k nukes<br />
archery mastery becomes innate<br />
flurry of backstab/&quot;constant backstab&quot; abilities make it so that on every successful backstab check, the character rips out 10 consecutive backstabs for minimum damage of 2k each.<br />
clicky defense with 30 second duration that makes the character *completely* invincible during that time.<br />
evac and TL for all<br />
new Elemental Warders!!! now it's a FIRE TIGER rawr!!! 8k unbuffed hps, max dmg of 150 per hit, inherent 56 point dmg shield, 200/tick innate regen, 750 point dd/stun that works on any mob in the game, period.<br />
innate invis<br />
innate coth (mana free, baby! of course...now that innate invis is active and works on undead and animals automatically, as well as having a set 3 hour duration, this is totally useless except for dragging your other 5 characters around)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
week 3...first recorded Quarm solo.<br />
following day...Time is made into a solo instanced zone. same day, 3,000 more people solo Quarm.<br />
<br />
ahhh...so nice.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
i would hope my point is painfully obvious.<br />

&quot;June 2004&quot;  says it all.<br />
<br />
Being angry or dissatisfied has nothing to do with the difficulty of the game nor does satisfiying your player base need to lead to a softer game.<br />
<br />
And btw, haruug, they basically do everything you mentioned already.  At some point content is made easier to fit the player base, whether it's through additional levels (spells) or the encounters simply made easier.  I can promise you the guilds that kill The Rathe or the Squid now have a much easier time doing it then when my guild made the attempts.</div></div><hr />

Whining about whiners is tre' chic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">haruuq, you're an idiot.  Chances are you have no idea what the upper game is like, and chances are you don't even play a shaman as your main if you have such low opinions of those of us who have been driven from the game by blatantly horrid class balancing of shamans.  I didn't care to abandon my character I worked on for the last FIVE years just because it wasn't a valid choice for the game all my friends were playing and level/gear/AA up a new character JUST TO FIT IN.  <br />
I guess that makes me a whiner.  Well then I'll wear that title as a badge of honor.  <br />
<br />
I'm so freakin retired.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I agree with Landragoran. Whining is when one cries &quot;why feathers on my spear are light red, while on his/her spear they're dark red! this makes my DPS lesser!&quot; - that's whining. Bringing out the issues with the class, which has been forgotten and ignored since Velious expansion is not whining, only clueless moron would say that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>haruuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">you're right, i'm a complete idiot. <br />
<br />
my main isn't the 65 shammy i play every day. it's either the 23 beastlord i logged onto once last month or the level 20 mage i played four a couple days 2 months ago. still deciding.<br />
<br />
my iq is measured in decimal places, not round numbers.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
i am going to eat my chair now, because i am so stupid that it looks like a big steak. yummy. i like steak. steaks are so juicy. i just hate the seeds.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
pfft.<br />
<br />
snapdragn--this wasn't a complaint about complaining. it was a statement :) i respect your right to disagree with me, though. <br />
<br />
now i'm going to go log onto my &quot;alt&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Whining about whiners is tre' chic.<br />
<br />
Whining about whiners whining about whiners whining is even more so  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>tewdogs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Ah, but the fallacy is that you are using shaman as the starting point for this fast forwarded nightmare scenerio, when in fact it has already happened and we are simply the castoffs.<br />
If warriors hadn't gotten so hard to kill then we wouldn't have mobs that dice every non tank class into a virtual puree. The balance between fully slowable mobs and challenging content wouldn't be broken, so as non specialists, we wouldn't have to wait until the end of each expansion to play a meaningful part. <br />
Why are warriors so hard to kill? Because pallys were owning them and they had no other skill increase  apart from tanking to compensate. <br />
Why did pallys start owning warriors? etc etc etc.......<br />
There are endless permutations and the whole thing becomes the chicken and the egg.<br />
One thing I will say is that &quot;shammies whine the loudest, demand bigger heals&quot; is way past &quot;day 1&quot; of the horror mudflation story.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">solution for all the angry and dissatisfied... <br />
<br />
How about a server for the whiners that love to whine about whining (Sic?) or for that matter live in a world with rose colored glasses.   Then these players can all go play and &quot;never - ever&quot; complain or comment about any problems because EQ is perfect in its current state.<br />
<br />
Along with a new server, why not create a new board so this community can post comments on how great things are and how much they love their Kunark era abilities.   <br />
<br />
Balance (of course) is the answer but some can't see the forest for the trees ... on both sides.   Both prespectives are too polar for reality.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Haruuq, don't feel bad man.  Most of these people that peruse through here looking for another item they can get upset about (that they never would have even thought of if they hadn't been reading these boards) are too completely bored of the game to just play it for its own sake.<br />
<br />
I maintain that 99% of the bitchers and moaners on this board, and I'm talking about the people like Landragoran etc., that complain about EVERYTHING and ANYTHING they can POSSIBLY complain about, would be happier people vis a vis the &quot;state of the shaman class&quot; (gimme a break) if they would either quit reading the Shaman's Whinible (tm) or at least put no stock in the 50% of the posts that are bitching and moaning.<br />
<br />
You guys talk to Haruuq like he's incapable of seeing &quot;the bigger picture&quot;, he can't &quot;see the forest for the trees&quot;... guess what folks -- the forest is that this is a god damn game.  The trees are all the nitpicky little details etc etc.  There's a thread on this board trying to get a guy fired from his current position because you don't like the way he makes spells in a video game.  There is something WRONG with that.  <br />
<br />
If you're not having fun, hang up the god damn spear and walk away.  If you've got &quot;too much invested&quot; to walk away, or don't want to &quot;give up the ghost&quot; on making the class you love playing a better one, then go ahead.  But don't try to drag every single tiny pitiable little issue like shaman mana regen (gimme a break) that are annoying game play mechanics and act like you're going to cancel your account over it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
fascaser--again, what i did wasn't whining. social commentary. again, doesn't matter which it was, though. i had something to say, so i said it. it's out there for people so applaud or bash as they see fit. <br />

trollers are trolling, encouragers are encouraging. isn't it nice to be able to go someplace where everyone feels like they're in their natural habitat?<br />
