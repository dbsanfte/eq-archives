What is the best stategy for dueling a necro?</div></div><hr />

At level 60, the only thing they can do is gate</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Huh? He'll get his ass handed to him by an experienced PVP necro. His pet would walk through your pet and his dots would quickly drop you as the pet disrupts your casts of Torpor.<br />
<br />
Here's what I'd do:<br />
<br />
A. Buff Order. Buff in this order: inner fire, cold resist, fire resist, sow booties, stamina, agi, dr, mr, focus, pr, regrowth. When done buffing, click off the first two slots so that his dots don't end up at the end of your buff list, or Pyrocuror will make short work of you.<br />
<br />
B. Spells Lineup.... <br />
1. annul magic (in addition to the pumice that you're going to buy, you need this spell memmed)<br />
<br />
2. malo (for his pet so that you can root it, for him so that you can land your dots)<br />
<br />
3, 4, 5. nife, ebolt, venom of snake (sound counterintuitive against a necro, right? But here's the trick.  His PR is going to be high becuase he'll buff DMF, but alas, it's only a buff. Necros get real cocky vs. shaman because they think that DMF renders them immune. The nice thing about DMF is that it's a VISUAL buff -- if he's got it he'll float, so right out the gate you'll dispell his ass until he's no longer floating. Then you malo, then you start stacking your poison dots on him.<br />
<br />
6. immobilize (you need that pet off of you fast and with an offensive strategy the fight won't last that long)<br />
<br />
7. torpor<br />
<br />
8. chloroblast (you need a quick heal -- if you get below two bubs he can life-tap you down real fast).<br />
<br />
C. Fight ... The poison strategy is pretty offensive. If after you've dispelled DMF and landed malo you're still not landing anything, go defensive and run him out of mana. You can dispell EVERY SINGLE one of his dots while retaining yours so long as you are religious about spamming your booties after you dispell each time. <br />
<br />
D. Dirty tricks. These are fun, if a bit cheap. See if you can convince him to fight you while the two of you are grouped. If he falls for this, you can torpor his pet right off the bat (it's an unresistable snare, remember?) That's often REALLY confusing to the necro because the pet isn't rooted, which is what he expected. While grouped with him, you can also INVIS him at a critical moment -- his pet will poof. Also, while grouped with him you can ALWAYS target him much more easily by hitting F2 -- this allows you to click his pet, root, then get back to your main target very quickly. Another dirty trick -- summon your pet before the fight then HIDE it somewhere in the fight zone. If you're in the bazaar, you can park your pet in the bank, buff it with Focus, Stamina, Resist Magic and Resist Poison long before the fight and then use &quot;summon companion&quot; at a critical moment to surprise the hell out of him. Your pet can make a real difference, but usually it'll get blasted down pretty quick by his pet if it's nearby at the beginning of the fight. And finally, you can invis yourself -- he probably wont' have a see-invis item because he's relying on DMF to provide see-invis. Once you're invis you can move around behind him and possibly get a spear dot on him or just plain melee him.<br />
<br />
Oh, and one more tip: make sure it's 2/3 or 3/5 fights to declare a win. That way he can't just manaburn you and declare himself winner for all time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ganthok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hiya shammy board, I have a 44 shaman and have been lurking here for awhile. My main is a 60 necro on Rallos Zek.<br />
<br />
As far as fighting a necro goes... imo on a carebare server in a duel, if you fight a typical bluebie necro you'll slap him into next week.<br />
<br />
If he's really experienced... well this being your first duel just about any experienced PvPer of any class will hand your ass to you.<br />
<br />
On a PVP server basically if you're against a 60 necro... well you'll probably lose because he's a 60 necro on a PVP server and you don't get to 60 on one of the zeks being a horrible PKer. <br />
<br />
As a necro I never go down to other casters unless I&quot;m hit out of nowhere, by overwhelming force (like 3 mages sicking pets and nuking me at same time, manaburn et cetra.) Lvl 60 nec can hit you with a 750dmg unresistable nuke (which is also a lifetap) has better dots than you (not by much) his pet is vicious... We also get a 338 3 sec casting low mana lifetap as well. They also have two spells that give them 18 seconds of complete invulnerability (one of them also heals the nec during the invulnerability time.) I don't know what kind of strategy you can come up with on beating a necro on a PvP server I've yet to down a single necro with my shammy =(. But 50+ on Rallos uber-twinked melees own everyone and that's basically the way it is.<br />
<br />
And of course on PvP server you have to hope this guy doesn't have lifeburn cause if he does you're corpse is his.<br />
<br />
Necs *can* be bitches but most necs that play on bluebie servers are bad PvPers from what I've seen with my monk who plays on Quellious... you'll probably do well against a 60 nec. =)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>cepheusRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The key to fighting necros until a couple patches ago was unnerfed pumice.  Now, I guess the slower dispells will be your only hope.  If you're using pets, the first thing I'd do is use a fast casting debuff on it and park it.  You'll probably have a dot or two on you by then so you'll have to dispell it away.  Then you might have time to toss a malo on the necro and try to dot him.  Regardless, you're gonna want to outheal his lifetaps and hopefully win the managame in the end.  This is really tough when you're trying to switch between targetting yourself, the necro and his pet, but it can be done.  In my opinion, on Rallos, a well played necro is still one of the toughest spell casting classes to beat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">start with valium and if that doesn't settle you down then get out the hard liquor cause you'll need it.<br />
<br />
The first duel will get your blood pumpin.  Hell, the first 10 will.  You'll forget most of this when it starts.  Just try to keep the dots off ya and keep yourself alive.  if he's got funeral pyre you'll have to do some serious healin.  It's like 1430hp in 42 seconds in PVP and at 60 a necro can cast that 7-8 times without counting in spell casting AA's, specialitazion or meditating.<br />
<br />
don't totally rely on torpor either.  Once I duel'd a 60 shaman for a key corpse (well i casted back THIS time) for howling stones.  He had to torpor twice after i died and blast twice due to the last few ticks of splurt taking him below 200hp more than once.<br />
<br />
so even if you get him to fall... don't celebrate till you're clear of all the dots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i wouldn't bother dispelling unless you can get it off before the fight. dispell has a long cast time and a very long recast time, and the necro will of course not have DMF in top slot vs. a shaman. like you, he will have crap buffs up.<br />
<br />
ps: zek players crack me up. so l33t</div></div><hr />
