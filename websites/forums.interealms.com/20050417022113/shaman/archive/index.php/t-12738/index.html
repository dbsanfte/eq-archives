<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Toxox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What is the xp like here for a mid to high 50s group. Any class that is a must here? ie chanter. Any suggestions on strategy there would be most welcome. Going to go camp a JBB and some spells down there. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vadmir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The xp sucks compared to PoP.  Would recommend a chanter (though I have done it without) and you HAVE to have a rogue as the crypt is locked.  With a full group and the chanter and all it will actually bore you unless you go farther in.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If it wasn't for the PoP expansion, this would be considered good experience at that level.  and it is still decenent experience for 60 and below.  At 61 the regular exp seems to vanish, and the AA exp (set at 100% AA) crawls (3 to 5 kills for one % to show on the bar).<br />
<br />
Go there for the loot, but don't expect a lot of loot.  It is decent cash and gems, but the lesser loot there is no longer very valuable in game (cane of the tranquil, club of ykesha, box of nil space).  The cloak and the bracer are still great loot.<br />
<br />
As long as you have your rogue, you need to swing over and kill the Blood/Emp room.  The Emp drops spells, with the potential for a rare spell (Torpor/Malo/Pox/Sunstrike/EoT are all possibilities - but all very rare).<br />
<br />
chanter is not required.  slowing and healing are needed, and enough dps to break the spawn on the two Crypt Guardians, who like to CH each other.  The rogue to open the doors guarantees you some decent dps, though.</div></div><hr />

At 61 i can stand just inside the door and pull 1 Guadian (with malosini)  without agroing the other.. you can then pull it out of 4r to a spot where the other wont CH it. This makes it much easier. I havent tried it, but my guess is you could also pull it into one of the rooms too once the spwan is broken.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Toxox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Will a level 53 chanter have problems here? I am a 55 shaman very well equipped. Will have a 55+ warrior, 55+ rogue, 55+ cleric, 53 wizard. With debuffs will the wizard be able to nuke? And can the chanter mez at that level?<br />

Yeah, this is totally correct.<br />
<br />
If you ain't got a chanter then you definitely need to split the guardians, otherwise it's gonna be a long fight.</div></div><hr />
