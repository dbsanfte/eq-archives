<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fedayeen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, I am Level18 at the moment, and I have done nothing but leveling as fast as possible, sometimes fun, but I have had a lot of dull moments.<br />
SO, what to do, I want to go out and have some fun, does that have to wait untill high levels? I am open for sugestions, any L20 quests for a Shaman, in L20 zones?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The various totemic quests should be doable for a shaman in the 20s.  Some are easy, but some are very hard and/or will not be able to be completed until you're a little higher.  If you had any friends or guildmates to help it shouldn't be that bad though.</div></div><hr />
