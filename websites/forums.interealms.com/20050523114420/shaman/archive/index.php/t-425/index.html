<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Angelet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can it? I am wondering should I use it myself or sell it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you have 2, yes you can.  There is an old vendor trick to recharge itmes.  I cant remember how its done but I am sure someone knows the skinny.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Daeneil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There is NO legal way to recharge the staf form Vox or items like old pumice stones, however should you want to there is a not so legal way.<br />
<br />
You must have 2 items of the same thing. IE:2 vox sticks.<br />
<br />
1 must be fully charged and one ofcourse will be empty.<br />
<br />
it will cost ya a bunch of plat but who cares bout that.<br />
<br />
find an unused vendor or wait for servor outtage (normally weekly on bristlebane)<br />
<br />
you MUST find a nice clean vendor to use for this btw.<br />
<br />
sell the used up staff first to the vendor, THEN sell the full staff to the vendor.<br />
<br />
turn around and reclick on this vendor and buy back both staffs fully charged.<br />
<br />
can be used on old pumice stones as well.<br />
<br />
Just do not let many people know what your doing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If I remember right- you'll need two staves (meaning you and a friend with one will need to do this together.)<br />
<br />
You sell your empty staff to a vendor.<br />
He sells his fully charged staff to the same vendor.<br />
Now you both buy them back.  <br />
<br />
Both staves will have full charges (the vendors only keep charge info for one of each type of item in their inventory.)  This is technically an exploit, but it's been public knowledge (and widely used) for a very long time.<br />
<br />
Note- bring plat.  The vendor is probably going to rape you (buy from you for 10 pp, sell back for some ungodly amount.)  Also, try to find an &quot;empty&quot; vendor- otherwise you might have to buy a bunch of the crap they're selling to get your staff to appear in the window.<br />
<br />
As for use vs sell... I don't know the value of a Forbidden Rites staff- I know that it was being used to get into PoM for awhile (monk FD's his way past the baddies, resurrects a mage- in effect summoning him to that spot- then the mage CoH's the rest of the party.  Nice way to skip content.)<br />
<br />
Hmmmm... maybe you could offer your fully charged staff as a service for recharging other people's empty ones.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You are doing it backwards.  You sell the FULL charged staff FIRST.  Then the spent staff, the full charge staff will show up in the vendor's inventory first, then when you sell the spent one it stacks with the first full charged one,  then you buy both back.  With good faction and cha it costs 2500pp per staff.<br />
<br />
And its not really an exploit, Verant knows it is done and has chosen not to fix it.  In fact instead of raising the prices to insane prices to stop it they chose to raise it to reasonable levels to use it as a money sink.   It will cost you 5kpp to get 10 charges or 500pp per rez, hardly cheap.   They recently increased the price of the Locket of Escape to 22kpp to buy back.  So they definately know its being done and chose not to change it.  If they wanted it gone they would make the buy back be 500kpp and be done with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I suggest you try it with another, less valuable, item before you use the staves.  Just to make sure you know the procedure.<br />
<br />
Given Verants track record on preserving time sinks it is surprising they didn't nerf it.  Can't tell you how many times a rez stick has saved hours of CR downtime.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Angelet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Can I recharge some 10 does gate potions using the same method?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You could but its cheaper to just buy/make new potions.  The buy back on a single 10 charge is more than the cost to make them.  Using this method you have to buy back 2 10 charges just to get 1 10 charge refreshed.  So you will be paying 3-4 times the cost you could have bought/made it for.</div></div><hr />
