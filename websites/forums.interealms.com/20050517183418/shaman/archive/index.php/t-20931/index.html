<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shrewd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Asked on the monk boards but I am not convinced yet to any answers.<br />
<br />
Here is the situation...<br />
<br />
I play semi rarely and when I have time to play a duel box a 55 monk 56 shaman. Recently A friend quit the game and tossed me his cash. I have a ton of characters... in addition to the above 2. I have a 49 paladin, 39 ranger (up and comming)<br />
<br />
I have 80k to spend....I know I want to spend it either on upgraded weapons or upgraded regen.<br />
<br />
Weapons monk is currently using are Copper hammer of striking and adamantine club, IFS 2hb, has 3 regen AA already and that 1 regen ring, and a soulscream belt. The rest of his stuff is the usual 2-4k equipment stuff.<br />
<br />
I know I have the cash to buy either a fungi ... or a SOFW or comparible 2hb... the fungi would be nice since I could also drop it on the shaman or other characters but I don't know what I will be able to actually camp to get upgrades since I haven't played in a while.<br />
<br />
Basically I want to get the best bang for my buck whether it is a lesser buy that can be shared across many characters... or a greater buy that is so good it will allow me to progress much faster on my mains to allow camping of other cool stuff for the other alts.<br />
<br />
Would the fungi help me more?<br />
<br />
One more thing if it matters... the monk is iksar and gets arounnd 30hp regen already w shaman regrowth. Lastly will the regen from the fungi on the monk, free up enough mana to toss a BoN in to the fray a fight negating the advantage of getting the most expensive uber weapon...??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hail,<br />
<br />
Post Magelos for both characters (monk/shaman) please.<br />
Hard to give sound advice when we're mostly in the dark as to what you have equipped.  Fungi's are nice, but after level 60 your shaman won't really *need* it.  An extra 15hp every six seconds won't be a huge deal for your monk either when mobs are hitting for several hundred a whack.  Don't get me wrong, a Fungi is an awesome tool (especially for twinking from scratch), but since it will likely wipe out almost ALL of your cash windfall I wouldn't jump to get one right away.<br />
<br />
If you don't have a mount for your shaman yet, I'd make that your first purchase. ~8499pp for the cheapest rope bridle.  Show us the Magelos and we can probably find at least a dozen items that are all/all (or close to it) that could be traded across using shared bank space among multiple characters.   That would probably serve you better in the long run.<br />
<br />
Also keep in mind Tribute points.  If you are a careful bazaar shopper, you can buy items for 2-3kpp that are worth 24k or more in Tribute.  24k in tribute buys an awful lot of Regen X (+10hp/tick) for ANY character. ;)  I'm not saying you should do that necessarily, but it is an option that you may not have thought about. :cool: <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shrewd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">got you.. ok I will work on majelo's later... what is a tribute point? If it is from GoD I have no clue what it is...since i don't have that expansion yet and haven't played much in the last 4 months</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I going to agree with Frekkels here.  While the Fungi is nice, the level that your characters are at now is really the end of the effectiveness of the fungi as a tool.  Its still good for healing up during downtime, but no longer will it keep you at full health while nasties wail on you like it would if you were say, 30.  <br />
<br />
Your shaman should have a mount.  Horse if you want cheap, or spend about 1K more and get a drogmor.  Same movement speed, but the drogmor's head wont obscure 50% of your screen.<br />
<br />
If you plan on playing your shaman awhile, set some cash aside for spells.  Torpor usually runs about 12K-30K depending on server, quiscience is a little more (but level 65).  The spells that you need for you late 50's can get pricey because many people skip the content that generates those spells.  Watch the Bazaar and pick them up cheap when you can.<br />
<br />
Other than that it is hard to say what to spend you cash on without knowing what you have now. Generally, high hp/focus effect items for the shaman are good, while anyting with hp/ac/stat items are good for  the monk.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd go for the fungi.  It's the best item your shaman can wear till he gets torpor or quiessence, despite the low AC and terrible stats.  And your monk can wear it too, and it's also fantastic for him.  I have my own monk and shaman, and they were both 60 for a long time.  I used to switch the tunic back and forth between them to help on healing!  Things got easier when I got torpor(this was back in the olden days).<br />
<br />
Shamans are kings of doing things the slow way.  The DPS you put out almost doesn't matter as long as you can survive with you and your monk.  Your DPS is already fine.  Live long enough, and the mobs will die.  But a fungi would help with your survivability and healing quite a bit.  <br />
<br />
The two things you would want most in a shaman/melee duo at your level are regen and haste.  Get the very best haste you can get and the very best regen, even if you have virtually nothing else, and work from there.<br />
<br />
By the way, there are charts on monkly-business.com for regen.  As I recall, at 60 the regen is something like 18 or so? or something like that anyway.  So adding a fungi's 15 more points is not at all a small thing to you.<br />
<br />
It can come in extremely handy, too, for you monk when FD'd during difficult pulls and splits.  Sometimes you can't come out of FD without enough hitpoints or you'll die, but if you don't, you'll miss the chance to really make the split.  As a duo, you'll be trying some tricky, borderline things as a matter of course, if you're adventurous like I was.  Regen will give you the chance to handle difficult pulls better.<br />
<br />
You will probably regret not having regen on your monk if you play with a fungi for a while and then give up the fungi.  You'll miss it on your shaman if you have it before you get torpor/Q then give it up.  It's really a huge item.<br />
<br />
Get a fungi then a cloak of flames when you have more money, I would say.  The rest is trivial in comparison.</div></div><hr />

I strongly disagree.  I have never had mana problems with the shaman or health problems with the monk that fungi regen would fix in the 55+ game.  <br />

<br />
I two box because I hate waiting for the shaman DoTs to do their thing.  Monks are there for DPS, so give him some DPS.  Dump that club like it's diseased and get a waning light katar for your MAIN hand (~15k depending on your server.  check my magelo to see one).  CHoS goes off-hand, despite its lower delay.<br />
<br />
The SoFW will be nice once you hit 60 and get triple attack, but until then, two good 1-handers will be better.  If your 2h blunt skill needs work, get a fast one (wu's quivering staff or peacebringer are good  for this) and group with some folks until you're over 200.<br />
<br />

<br />
No.  Fungi regen is great for the 30-50 game.  Regen is going to become irrelevant -very- soon: mobs will hit too hard for it to help the monk and the shaman, frankly, doesn't need it.  I never have and have ground my way to 62 on each with zero problems relatively quickly.  I have NEVER said to myself, &quot;boy, if only i had better regen.&quot;  The only thing I ever say is &quot;I NEED DPS!!! NOW!!!!&quot;.  I hate spending 2 minutes killing a 15k hp mob.  I want it dead now so I can get another one.<br />
<br />
Let me put it this way: <br />
<br />
The monk/shaman pair is essentially a Beastlord broken in two (or a beastlord is the two fused together).  The monk is there for DPS, DPS and more DPS.  The shaman is there for slows, heals and dots.  <br />
<br />
you need to maximize the monks DPS --- haste and weapons<br />
you need to maximize the shaman's mana/hp pool --- +mana/hp items.<br />
<br />
A side note:  AC should be ~1100 for the monk and ~1000 for the shaman when you hit 60.   Both should be pushing for at least 2500 hps unbuffed (don't follow my shaman's example here.  his hp pool is terrible.).  <br />
<br />
It can come in extremely handy, too, for you monk when FD'd during difficult pulls and splits.  Sometimes you can't come out of FD without enough hitpoints or you'll die, but if you don't, you'll miss the chance to really make the split.  As a duo, you'll be trying some tricky, borderline things as a matter of course, if you're adventurous like I was.  Regen will give you the chance to handle difficult pulls better.<br />
<br />
Get a fungi then a cloak of flames when you have more money, I would say.  The rest is trivial in comparison.<br />
<br />
Regen is nice during tough splits, but those don't happen very often -- hopefully once or twice per camp when you break the spawn and 50-100k for a purely situational item is not worth it.  In general practice you won't miss the regen much.<br />
<br />
DO NOT GET A CLOAK OF FLAMES!!! It's is NOT worth the money at all.  the haste is good, but there are better haste items out there: spiked seahorse belt - 34% and custom cowl of mortality - 36% are examples.<br />
<br />
Once you get to 60, start hitting LDoN's hard for both:<br />
<br />
Shaman -- butcherblock for Anathema (lvl 50-something), then East Commons for Bane (lvl 64)<br />
Monk -- Everfrost (15/20 1h blunt), East Commons (16/19 h2h) and North Ro (+2 dmg augment for each of the previous weapons) == 18/19 main hand and 17/20 off-hand.  Add 31% belt, shaman haste, alpha pet and dots and your little duo will be pushing 180dps or more.<br />
<br />
Last couple things:  <br />
Shaman --- If you can't afford Torpor when you hit 60, go buy LoY and do the Stoicism quest.  It will help your mana pool so much more than 15/tick regen.<br />
Monk --- Buy (MQ), or go get, a Thurgadin quested leather bracer for your monk -- it will summon you a weightless bag of 80 shurikens which is HUGE for pulling.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I strongly doubt you even played that game then.  Sorry.  You're trying to make a point of some kind obviously, but clearly you've overstated things to try to get there.  Much like I just did when I said you never even played the game at that level.  It's okay to make a point, but you haven't made that point yet, nor can you, so you can't take it literally.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fungi regen is great for the 30-50 game.&quot;<br />
<br />
This much is obvious.<br />
<br />
However, it's great for much more too, equally obviously.  <br />
<br />
Let me give an example.  I could give dozens, but there's no need.  <br />
<br />
When I was 59, I wore my fungi on my shaman even though I had a significant upgrade, the HoT velious quest BP(wolfcaller I guess, I don't remember) in the bank.  With it, I could be primary healer for my entire group AND...tank for it while a rogue backstabbed.  I would keep root on, controlling the aggro, and everyone else just DPS.  Adding in group regen on everyone, and I was able to keep mobs slowed and everyone healed fine.  That meant a group with five melees in it was good for an incredible kill rate and great experience.<br />
<br />
A more general example -- when my SK (and he's 65 now) or my monk (left him at 60 a year or two ago) do nothing but pull while I root/rot mobs, they don't need AC or hitpoints or anything else.  Having the fungi on them means there need be zero attention given to healing them even if they do get hit.  For my SK, his skelly form, which drains hitpoints, doesn't drain them when he wears the fungi.  Not bad!<br />
<br />
Really, if you could never benefit from HP regen, especially at the levels this fellow is talking about, either you're doing nothing or not being honest.  Maybe you're one of the lazy shamans who never canni's?  I've seen dozens of them.  If so, that's not a good idea.<br />
<br />
The remark about tough pulls being rare?  Depends where you go and what the consequences are for bad pulls.  As a duo, you're able and likely to do a lot of exploring and trying fun and interesting things.  I made 600k this week doing just that.  For those that never try anything difficult, you have fewer worries than some of us, but fewer rewards too.  It all depends on how you play.  Most people, in my experience, are not very adventurous.  I am, though.<br />
<br />
As to not buying cloak of flames -- for a monk, yes, the cowl of mortality(doesn't have to be &quot;custom&quot; cowl, that's just the same cowl with a different look) is better.  But, it is also twice the price or more on my server.  If money is important, I an item which is generally far rarer and more expensive is no solution.  Maybe your server has cowls of mortality really cheap for some reason?  It's never been that way on my server; the COF's are just far more common and useable and good for more classes. <br />
<br />
The other haste choice you have, the belt, has less haste.  Can't recommend less haste over more haste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Foramorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I would work on getting both guys AT LEAST 2,000 HP unbuffed.<br />
<br />
You seem to be focusing more on items with stats, rather than ones with raw HP/MP.  For your monk, every piece of equipment should have at least 30 raw HP on it.  Same for the shaman. <br />
<br />
Take a look at the equipment section, and look for some equipment checks by people that have similar levels (50-60)<br />
<br />
Take care</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aemon Talishan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">To Shrewd:<br />
<br />
I agree completely with the previous post: convert to HP gear on both ASAP.  The biggest assets to your duo are your HP pool (both monk and shaman), mana pool and DPS.  A goal I set for myself (it sounds like our playtime similarly restricted) was 2500hps and 1100ac unbuffed on my monk at 60.  My shaman I shot for 1000ac and 2000hps by 60, but missed that one because of cash-flow problems :)<br />
<br />
Weapon-wise:<br />
I would recommend dumping your 15/25 club and spending 15k on a waning light katar.  Put WLK in primary, CHoS in secondary, despite the delays.  That combo will serve you well for a long while.<br />
<br />
The SoFW will be nice once you hit 60 and get triple attack, but until then, two good 1-handers will be better. If your 2h blunt skill needs work, get a fast one (wu's quivering staff or peacebringer are good for this) and group with some folks until you're over 200.<br />
<br />
<br />
To BlargX:<br />
<br />

Much like I just did when I said you never even played the game at that level.  It's okay to make a point, but you haven't made that point yet, nor can you, so you can't take it literally.<br />
<br />
groan.  i'm not sure how much more clear I could make the point: the fungal tunic is not worth it.<br />
<br />
i was not overstating anything.   I said I strongly disagree with you because I do.  15/tick hp regen would lend very little to his game, if anything, especially as he progresses.  He's reaching the point where regen isn't that important.  All that's going to happen is he's (a) going to get more and more hps and (b) fight mobs that hit harder and harder.  <br />
<br />
The marginal benefit of the fungi is certainly not enough to cover the exorbitant cost of one compared to what the same 100k+ would buy in other equipment.  I rarely come close to running out of mana, even with my small mana pool: I slow, dot, heal, haste and sic on my pet.  <br />
<br />
my gear is, at best, average bazaar-class gear: the most expensive item I have, by far, is my haste belt at ~25k.  Virtually everything else can be had for much less than 4k.  I run ~4800hps on my monk and ~3800hps on my shaman buffed.  15hps is ~1/4% of my monks hitpoint pool.  The mobs I fight hit for 150+/swing.  How is 15hps every 6 seconds going to make a noticeable difference one way or another?  It doesn't.  I couldn't really tell the difference between regrowth and no regrowth before I got replenishment.  Replenishment can be useful in some cases, but even then, it's not a gamebreaker by any stretch: it's nice to have, but not 100k nice to have.  The 2 most useful regens I have are my 6 minute mend timer and stoicism.<br />
<br />
A more general example -- when my SK (and he's 65 now) or my monk (left him at 60 a year or two ago) do nothing but pull while I root/rot mobs, they don't need AC or hitpoints or anything else.  Having the fungi on them means there need be zero attention given to healing them even if they do get hit.  For my SK, his skelly form, which drains hitpoints, doesn't drain them when he wears the fungi.  Not bad!<br />
<br />
That's a waste of perfectly good melee classes in my opinion.  Root rot?  with an SK or monk?  why?  all you're doing is slowing yourself down.  I typically pull with my shaman when I am grinding to let the monk finish off the previous mob.  In a good xp camp the monk is probably on auto-attack 95+% of the time, killing as fast as i can pull them.<br />
<br />
Really, if you could never benefit from HP regen, especially at the levels this fellow is talking about, either you're doing nothing or not being honest.  Maybe you're one of the lazy shamans who never canni's?  I've seen dozens of them.  If so, that's not a good idea.<br />
<br />
I appreciate the conclusions you've jumped to.  My template spell set: (1) tnarg's (2) turgur's (4) instill (6) canni 4 (8) stoicism.<br />
<br />
The remark about tough pulls being rare?  Depends where you go and what the consequences are for bad pulls.

I am, though.<br />
<br />
I have no problem trying new things; I do all the time, that's why I play a monk/shaman duo: it gives me a lot of flexibility.  but there's a difference between exploring and grinding out XP/AA.  As i said before, the fungi is a nice situational tool: exploring, breaking a tough spawn, etc, not for everyday xp grinding.  If you have 100k of spare cash, sure.  You made 600k in a week, that's a bit different than this guy who has a one-time infusion of 80k.  That money would be MUCH better spent on other items.<br />
<br />
As to not buying cloak of flames -- for a monk, yes, the cowl of mortality(doesn't have to be &quot;custom&quot; cowl, that's just the same cowl with a different look) is better.  But, it is also twice the price or more on my server.  If money is important, I an item which is generally far rarer and more expensive is no solution.

<br />
The other haste choice you have, the belt, has less haste.  Can't recommend less haste over more haste.<br />
<br />
I have no problem recommending less haste over more haste: <br />
someone who doesn't have lots of pp inflow, like Shrewd.  Soulscream is fantastic bang for your buck at ~25k for 31% haste.  The extra 70k for a CoF would be better spent elsewhere than the increase from 31% to 36% haste.  If someone handed me 100k right now, there is no way I would bump my haste to 36% or waste it on a regen tunic.  I'd be all over valorium rings, bloodmetal earrings, kingly boots, etc.  All of those provide so much more benefit than a little more haste or a little more regen.<br />
<br />
<br />
Look at the situation --- This guy got a one-time gift of 80k that he's looking to maximize.  He plays semi-rarely, which I take to mean (a) he doesn't have the time to generate lots of plat and (b) when he can log in, he wants to make the most of the time he does have.  I'm in very much the same situation.  There are many other things out there that would be a far better use of 80k than a tunic with poor stats and some regen.<br />
<br />
As for his other toons, a high level shaman is all the regen he'll need to level those alts up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">No, what you said was &quot;I have never had mana problems with the shaman or health problems with the monk that fungi regen would fix in the 55+ game.&quot;<br />
<br />
If your shaman and monk have had neither hitpoint problems nor mana problems, I can't imagine what you're doing besides sitting in the bazaar.  You even said you don't notice the difference when casting regrowth and not casting it.  Sweet lord.  It's bad enough you're trying to tell me, but you're trying to tell a guy in his 50's that not just 15 regen per tick with a fungi tunic would NOT help, or 15 regen from spell, but that 15 regen worn plus 15 regen from a spell = 30 REGEN would not help a melee toon?  In his 50's?  Please. :P  How absurd.  Even a level 65 would love an extra 15 or 30 regen if they could get it.<br />
<br />
I've given a few illustrations as to how the fungi helps quite a bit.  Why would I need to?  There's nothing about the fungi helping that is not obvious.  To say a fungi is not worth it on a monk or shaman is just bizarre, sorry.  If you don't like the simple logic or the examples, I really can't help you anymore.<br />
<br />
As to wasting a melee toon by root rotting, I was giving a simple example, meant to be nothing else.  With a 52 warrior, 60 monk, and 65 SK, I've done plenty of duoing with my melee toons.  What would make you think differently -- besides just being obstinate maybe?  <br />
<br />
However, sometimes I do root rot nameds that hit for quite a lot.  I didn't make that 600k fighting yard trash in Karnors castle.  In certain instances, it's just easier to root rot and far safer.  If you don't know what mobs I'm fighting, why are you making judgments about my tactics against them?  You don't have even the shadow of a leg to stand on there.<br />
<br />
And now onto more versus less haste.<br />
<br />
Haste is godly to melees.  Having leveled a few with and without help from my shaman, I'll just give one example.  Since you apparently haven't done the exact thing I'm talking about, please don't just go about pretend it didn't happen or that my argument couldn't have any validity, as you have done before.<br />
<br />
Scarlet Desert zone.  My monk soloing, low 50's.  He has on a RBG (27% haste).  He has a hard time.  I buy him a RBB instead (31% haste). Hey, the mobs that were coming extremely close to killing him or even doing it (FD doesn't always work) are far less hard now.  They just don't last as long, so they don't do as much damage.  Total turn-around in his performance!  And I can apply that higher performance against every mob I fight, no matter which weapon or type of weapon I'm holding.  Nice!  Few levels later I get him a cowl of mortality(custom, even!).  Now he has 36% haste.  Know what?  Same thing happens, of course.  He has moved up just a hair in the level of mobs he can solo, and they've become tougher again.  Again, the struggle becomes less frightening when he gets better haste, and he doesn't come as near dying when he gets a bad run of luck or just a tough mob.<br />
<br />
Please, this is not conjecture or anything nutty; it's just solid fact that's both sensible on its face and in my own lived (well, EQ type of lived) experience.<br />
<br />
Haste matters.  Quite a lot.  Whether you use your haste in groups, solo, raids, whatever -- it's a major part of how much damage you do.  This guy's in a duo with a partner who is a low DPS toon -- a shaman.  You want DPS?  Get better haste.<br />
<br />
It does look like prices are quite different on our servers.  Fungi's haven't been 100k on my server in ages.  And cowls of mortality are much more expensive still than fungis are.<br />
<br />
I was almost serious when I said it hardly matters what you have until you get regen and haste taken care of.  If he has 80k, buy a 36% haste as soon as you can, but buy a fungi first, because the fungi is a godly piece on a monk and sure doesn't hurt on a shaman either.  Switch it from one toon to the other if you like.  <br />
<br />
Monk weapons are cheap and getting cheaper every day.  Don't bother busting your wallet for them, as they keep careening down in price every month, and there are a staggering number of them.  Quite a few no-drop ones come into the game every week, too.  Because of that, monk weapons are also very hard to resell when you upgrade from them at anything like the price you bought them.  Fungis and COF's and cowl or mortality(COM) hold their value pretty well, on the other hand.  A COF or COM add DPS in a way you can keep no matter what weapon you use, and most people wind up keeping their good haste for a long, long time compared to the many weapons they swap in and out.  The leap from 36% haste to 41% haste is for most people a very significant one, and one that many never make it up to.  Get your DPS out of your haste, and know that you'll be glad you made that buying decision for a very long time.  And that you can apply that haste to EVERY weapon you own.  Weapons -- you'll go through them like candy in comparison.<br />
<br />
And I still feel that it's survivability in a duo that makes the difference.  It doesn't matter if the mob dies if you die too.  A little extra DPS is fantastic for fun and glory, but it's the slows and debuffs, the worn regen and the spell-cast regen, and the slow steady healing of the shaman that will help you succeed most.   Given enough time, you can work wonders.  That's about the healing much more than the DPS.  With enough healing you can fight multiple mobs at a time; no amount of DPS will make that anything but a crapshoot.  <br />
<br />
With enough healing, my shaman and my regrowthed, fungi'd monk and I regularly duo'd mobs that whole groups failed on or were frightened of.  Time and time and time again.  Would it have been possible without the fungi?  Probably not.  Did he have all the best weapons?  Sometimes he had some of the best bazaar weapons, sometimes not.  He never had a single no-drop weapon.  It rarely mattered though.  The mobs died just fine.  If they didn't, we were simply outclassed, and no incremental DPS would have done a thing to change that.<br />
<br />
A mid 50's, fungi'd, regrowthed, 36% hasted monk is a very strong character.  Save up your money until you can get him that way.  Worry about secondary things...well...secondarily.<br />
<br />
80k not enough?  Go camp spider silks in East Karana.  If your monk is an iksar, forage tea leaves for brewers while you're at it.  You should easily be able to get around 100 silks an hour, which on my server sell for 10 to 20pp each.  That's 1 to 2k an hour for mid-50's toons -- you'll have those nice items pretty darn quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I just skimmed the other responses (gotta act like I'm working some today  :p ), but about the fungi...<br />
<br />
I 2 box a warrior/shaman combo (now 65 and 61), and even at 61 I still use the fungi most of the time (I do keep a Tae Ew equivalent bagged for those rare occasions when I expect to get agro a lot.)  I keep agro with the warrior and having the fungi plus a regen spell means I don't have to worry too much about healing my shaman even though I canni most of the time.<br />
<br />
Note:  I don't have torpor yet and probably never will, so that definitely impacts my situation...I can't see ponying up 15k for T when I'll get Q at 65 for 30k (or for free via a drop.)  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I dual box a shaman and SK (65 SHM and 40+ SK):<br />
<br />

SHM: http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=470926<br />
<br />
SK is still just lvl 40 for now, but when I have time to play I group him with Karsan off to the side, or just straight PL him.<br />
<br />
I do NOT recommend buying a fungi tunic.  Granted, at 65 with Q and Torpor I'm in a different situation than your shaman at 56, but just stick it out a few more levels and that fungi will be a moot point.<br />
<br />
I recommend the LDoN idea.  Get Bane, get Anathemae.  Get some weapons there WHILE you gain experience, augments, and get LDoN points.<br />
<br />
Save that money for hard to find spells.  The biggest spell to focus on would be Quiescience.  I'm not sure if you want to try and stick it out from 60 - 65 without Torpor, or how much you play vs. how soon you plan to burn through 60 - 65, but Torpor is only good for 5 levels... but those 5 levels it's a Godsend.  If you can pick it up for cheap - get it, but focus more on getting / finding Q for yourself and the monk and don't worry about the Fungi.  It's not going to do enough to help - and with regen + iksar regen, it's not going to be &quot;that&quot; great of a boon.  You can go do the LoY Stoicism quest now for free as well and use it until you get Torpor, or just keep using Stoicism to 65 and get Q.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Aemon Talishan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Blarg,<br />
<br />
I think this is getting beaten to death, but here's my last reponse:<br />
<br />
No, what you said was &quot;I have never had mana problems with the shaman or health problems with the monk that fungi regen would fix in the 55+ game.&quot;<br />
<br />
If your shaman and monk have had neither hitpoint problems nor mana problems, I can't imagine what you're doing besides sitting in the bazaar.  You even said you don't notice the difference when casting regrowth and not casting it.<br />
<br />
I never said I didn't have hp/mana problems, I said the fungi wouldn't fix the ones I do have.  150 hp/min isn't much against PoP mobs.<br />
 <br />
Sweet lord.  It's bad enough you're trying to tell me, but you're trying to tell a guy in his 50's that not just 15 regen per tick with a fungi tunic would NOT help, or 15 regen from spell, but that 15 regen worn plus 15 regen from a spell = 30 REGEN would not help a melee toon?  In his 50's?  Please. :P  How absurd.  Even a level 65 would love an extra 15 or 30 regen if they could get it.<br />
<br />
He's not going to be in his mid-50s for long and the mobs he's going to fight will be hitting for substantially more as he levels.  Even mobs that hit in the low 100s will obviate the need for regen as hps will drop too fast for the effect to be felt before a heal is cast.  It may delay a blast heal by a swing if the RNG is particularly kind for a few ticks.  <br />
<br />
Moreover, 150hp/min (15/tick) is a drop in the bucket compared to even tier 1 PoP mobs.  30 from a spell+fungi isn't bad, but I fail to see why 1/2 of that 30 is worth 100k (or wherever fungis are on your server, maybe 50-75k).<br />
<br />
I've given a few illustrations as to how the fungi helps quite a bit.  Why would I need to?  There's nothing about the fungi helping that is not obvious.  To say a fungi is not worth it on a monk or shaman is just bizarre, sorry.  If you don't like the simple logic or the examples, I really can't help you anymore.<br />
<br />
What’s obvious about the help a 2.5dps reduction in mob DPS will do?  It’s obvious that when fighting low-DPS mobs, the fungi can help a lot.  Subtract 2.5dps from a hard-hitting mob and you’ve still got a hard-hitting mob.<br />
<br />
As to wasting a melee toon by root rotting, I was giving a simple example, meant to be nothing else.  With a 52 warrior, 60 monk, and 65 SK, I've done plenty of duoing with my melee toons.  What would make you think differently -- besides just being obstinate maybe?<br />
<br />
However, sometimes I do root rot nameds that hit for quite a lot.  I didn't make that 600k fighting yard trash in Karnors castle.  In certain instances, it's just easier to root rot and far safer.  If you don't know what mobs I'm fighting, why are you making judgments about my tactics against them?  You don't have even the shadow of a leg to stand on there.<br />
<br />
Sure, in some cases it makes sense to root rot.  Nameds are a good example.  I read your post to mean your normal course of business to be root rotting and using your melee as a puller.  If that's not what you meant, then I'll retract.<br />
<br />
Haste is godly to melees.  Having leveled a few with and without help from my shaman, I'll just give one example.  Since you apparently haven't done the exact thing I'm talking about, please don't just go about pretend it didn't happen or that my argument couldn't have any validity, as you have done before.<br />
<br />
*snip* soloing examples *snip*<br />
<br />
We're not talking about someone who will be soloing for xp if he's asking about shaman/monk two-boxing.<br />
<br />
Haste matters.  Quite a lot.  Whether you use your haste in groups, solo, raids, whatever -- it's a major part of how much damage you do.  This guy's in a duo with a partner who is a low DPS toon -- a shaman.  You want DPS?  Get better haste.<br />
<br />
Haste does matter a lot.  I have no quarrel with that.  A melee's first major purchase should be worn haste and should be gotten ASAP.<br />
<br />
Now, let me explain why jumping from 31% haste to 36% haste for another 75k for someone with limited cash flow and regularly two-boxing a shaman makes no real sense when there are other needs to be tended to:<br />
<br />
55 monk solo<br />
55 monk with 31% haste item and no spells -- total haste = 31%<br />
55 monk with 36% haste item and no spells -- total haste = 36%<br />
<br />
55 monk w/ 56 shaman partner<br />
55 monk with 31% haste item and 50% spell haste -- total haste = 81%<br />
55 monk with 36% haste item and 50% spell haste -- total haste = 86%<br />
<br />
The raw difference is in haste percentages in both cases, spell and no spell is 5%.  The 5% in the no-spell-haste hypo is far more important than the 5% in the spell-haste hypo.  The law of diminishing returns goes into action.<br />
<br />
I won't argue that there won't be a difference; there clearly is one.  My point is that the gain accrued from that 5%, especially for the poster who will be grouping with a shaman (i.e. spell haste) most of the time, isn't as big a deal as other sorely needed equipment, such as HP gear.  It certainly isn't worth an outlay of 70k+ when that money could be used to stack on another 400-500 of unbuffed hit points.<br />
<br />
An example that is more familiar with the shaman community is the current debate raging over narrow gap in slowing abilities between Shamans, Enchanters and Beastlords.  Oddly, the raw percentage differences there are also 5%.<br />
<br />
Get your DPS out of your haste, and know that you'll be glad you made that buying decision for a very long time.  And that you can apply that haste to EVERY weapon you own.  Weapons - you'll go through them like candy in comparison.<br />
<br />
Absolutely get haste.  There was a post on the monk boards by a level 65 monk who refused to buy a worn haste item because it would cost him ~80hps.  He got absolutely shredded by the community and the guild he was applying to, and rightly so.  Haste is very important, but again, the incremental difference between two haste items is more attenuated the high haste values involved.<br />
<br />
There’s a reason every monk out there doesn’t have a CoF: the haste they have is sufficient until they can get the rest of their gear up to speed, then go get bigger haste.<br />
<br />
As for 41% haste being a big step, yes it is a big step.  Why?  Partly because of the DPS, but also because (a) getting a 41% haste item is tough as they are all no-drop from difficult encounters and (b) because 41% is the best worn haste in the game, barring a couple PoTime drops that have 46%.<br />
<br />
The only weapon upgrade I made was to trade my scepter of mastery out for an architect’s scepter which had better stats, but same dmg/delay rating.  Otherwise, I’ve been using the same weapons since level 55 when I bought my WLK.  Weapons are expensive and don’t retain their value, as you said, so why would you be going through them like candy?  That’s a bad investment.  Get the best you can afford, then don’t touch them until you have to.<br />
<br />
And I still feel that it's survivability in a duo that makes the difference.  It doesn't matter if the mob dies if you die too.  A little extra DPS is fantastic for fun and glory, but it's the slows and debuffs, the worn regen and the spell-cast regen, and the slow steady healing of the shaman that will help you succeed most.   Given enough time, you can work wonders.  That's about the healing much more than the DPS.  With enough healing you can fight multiple mobs at a time; no amount of DPS will make that anything but a crapshoot.<br />
<br />
DPS will reduces damage taken more than a fungi will, especially 55+ and ESPECIALLY in PoP.  Shorten a fight against a tier 1 mob by 1 hit in a 2 minute fight and you've already made up for the regen your tunic would have given you in the same period.  Make the fight 1:30 instead of 2 minutes and you've probably saved your self 2-3 fungi's worth of regen.  Regen against hard-hitting mobs is not what's going to save you.  Killing the mob quickly will, which comes from quality weapons and good haste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Beafly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I think I would vote no on obtaining a fungi tunic. You'd be far better off saving the cash for Torpor when you hit 60. I'd say the same goes for your Ceremonial Iksar BP too. It too is reaching the end of it's usefulness.<br />
<br />
I was able to borrow a fungi for awhile in my late 40's and early 50's and with that and my spell regen it was useful. Along come canni IV and Kragg's and a fungi tunic just wasn't worth the loss of ac/hp stats. As described so well in the posts above the fungi doesn't really help monk or shaman while in combat against the mobs you'll be fighting 55+. A single kragg's (or torpor in a few more levels) negates most of the benefit you saw from your fungi earlier durring your downtime.<br />
<br />
I'd suggest that you keep in mind that your monk is only going to be tanking for your duo for a few more levels. At some point you'll probably find it more efficent to stack dots for agro and torpor/Q your shaman for heals while monky and dogdog just pound on the mob's backside. That in mind, pump up your shaman's HP/AC and after you hit canni V push those defensive AA's.</div></div><hr />

I haven't been shopping in a while.. and for about 12k I could pick up around 250-300 hps, and for a bit more up to around 400, while keeping resists ok.

I have 6 accts, and a ton of characters, and rarely do i find that 1 item makes or breaks a character as much as spending the same amount of cash on multiple slots. There are a few exceptions to this, haste is one, melee weapons, and spells/focus for casters. If ya hunt outdoors horse/drogmar is a must IMHO also. Other than that hps hps hps, and when ya get enough hps get a few more and then throw in some ac.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Shakurae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I 2-box 65 Shammy and 65 Monk. A fungi at you level is pratically useless, except for pl'n your other chars. Take it from me, get a SoFW. It will be the best investment you've ever made.

<br />
If a SoFW is still out of reach, look into a Hammer of Corrupted Enchantments (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=24394) . You could get the Hammer for a lot cheaper and still be able to upgrade hps on your shammy.</div></div><hr />
