<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>RansacHyral</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">whers a good place for soloing level 20-45ish?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tathagata</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Do 20 to 32 in Echo Caverns (needlites and Boglings).<br />
Then 32 to 45 in Crystal Caverns (orcs, terrors, spiders, nids).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Taldaas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">EW might also be good for a high 30s.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valorindel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I know once you get into the 40ish range Dawnshroud Peaks can be very nice solo xp. Zelniaks and wolves make for some easy fear kiting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Forestknight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I started in DS at lvl 28.. pulled red zelniaks (most were red to me at time) near SS zone, and fear kited... got 3 - 4% exp per kill, and i got to 30 real fast.. now im lvl 37, and soloing the tribal gatherers near GE for acrylia and get about 1% per kill, which isnt bad...<br />
<br />
i did go to CoM at 36, had a 56 Shammy pull for me to solo in there... and went from 8% into 36 to 8% into 37 in 2 hrs and 16 min... but alot of mobs were blue to me in there at 36, shadows, fog golems, and alot of skeles near entrance, was makin 2 - 3% per kill there doin blues and evens.. and 2-4% doin yellow and reds with Shammy help<br />
<br />
oh forgot to mention... at 32 i started pullin the shrooms out of the big building.. and was getting 2% exp per kill to start, and could take 2 or 3 before needing to rest.. and ya get 2 - 4pp for the fungus shrooms they drop (depends on where ya sell)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>loKase</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Stonebrunt Mountains- Rangers paradise - Panic everything you see and bash them on the hind quarters.  Do the Swiftclaw Sash quest (15% Haste - they sell for approx 1k) and get gems off of the Panda's.  <br />
<br />
Come here around 37 and leave at 43.<br />
<br />
If you are lucking enough to have a Titan pop and a high lvl char in the zone to help you take it down there is some neat loot.<br />
<br />
Very quiet zone - usually was the only one in there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Maghodien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Around 40ish, i suggest trying to find a group in Velks...<br />
<br />
In Velks you should get a little over 1/3rd a blue bar of xp per kill. Its just hard to find a group in there. I leveled from 40 - 44 in 4 days in velks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Spidaaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">20 shouldnt be too tough, go to HH and get to 30 easily, then head to SK gnolls solo spires and inner paw until 35. and then for the best exp EVER hit WL tiger raptors. can start off your ice forged shackle quest here aswell, foragfe yew leaves (50pp a pop). <br />
<br />
WL tiger raptors until 43. have fun</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Xoxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Lake of Ill Omen is good at 20.</div></div><hr />

Your server must be different from mine then, because people under 50 get laughed at when they go to Velks and look for a group.<br />
<br />
Before SoL came out, I went from 20 to 35 in HHK, fighting the goblins, grouped.  I went from 35 to 39 in Thurgadin's mines, soloing.  I went from 39 to 45 doing a combo of grouping at the RyGorr Fort in EW, and both soloing and grouping in CC as well, with the occasional group in Burning Woods.  At45 I went into Karnor's Castle, and stayed there basically until I hit 50 . . . grouping, of course.<br />
<br />
I cannot tell you here to solo to 39 from 20 . . . but going at 39 (after getting all the spells, including lev) to CC is a great idea.  Sure, you're tank soloing, but its a lot more fun than hitting animal butts all day long.</div></div><hr />
