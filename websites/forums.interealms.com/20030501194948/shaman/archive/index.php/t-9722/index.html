<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Crash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I need help trying to figure out what dmg shields stack with each other.  Have read many posts on the crucible and the quests for the chardok ring and coldain ring.  From what I understand the coldain ring will stack with mage and druid dmg shield but not shaman potions.  The chardok ring will stack with shaman potions but not mage/druid dmg shield.  All will stack with 3pt dmg shield from JB BP.  I duo with a mage quite often and would love to be able to stack his dmg shield with a potion and a coldain/chardok ring dmg shield for big stuff like killing lodi, WW dragons and maybe getting my sorry keister thru the PoJ trial hehe.  Doesnt sound possible from what I read.  And at lvl 61 the potion does more damage than the 8dmg from coldain ring so I am less than enthused.   Any input? Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Waredan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Potion + mage DS is ur best shot at high DS I think. <br />
<br />
If you want it a trio though, try makin friends with a bard. They're DS stacks with potion and mage DS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">http://lucy.fnord.net/ is usually pretty good about stacking.<br />
<br />
Looking at things it works like you described. For example http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=1350&amp;source=Test is the 10th dain ring. If you look at the stacking tab you can see that the effect from shaman potions is listed there so the 2 won't stack.<br />
<br />
If you check http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=2018 the effect of the chadok ring you'll see all the assorted mage dmg shields there so they don't stack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Crash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Very helpful information.  Thanks for you help.   Now to decide if I wanna do the work for either quest then to save money on the dmg potions for routine stuff (coldain ring) or work on chardok fashion for when mage/druid not around hehe.</div></div><hr />
