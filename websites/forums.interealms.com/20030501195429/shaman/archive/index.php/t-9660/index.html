<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Solairs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I saw this posted on our guild's forum and I was wondering if there is any truth to it?  In particular #3.  Has any one been able to successfully MQ a tear recently?  I understand both shm's have to have Ally TS faction.  But will Rak drop the scale if shm doing turn in already has The Spear of Fate.<br />
Just searching for some info here.  Please post if you have successfully done an tear MQ post PoP.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
IMPORTANT NOTE : Verant pacthed the shaman Epic in Oct.2002, making that the Tear isn't MD'able anymore. To do so, Verant added those checks on Lord Rak (confirmed to me by several GM, i also saw myself some failed attempts to MQ the Tear since October so those infos are CERTIFIED) :<br />
<br />
1) Only a shaman (and no other classes, like SK before)<br />
2) having enough true spirit faction (at least the same amount as someone who did ALL the previous parts of shaman epic)<br />
3) NOT having already a Spear of Fate<br />
4) Handing in the Tear (no drop)<br />
<br />
Only a shaman matching those conditions can make Lord Rak turns into his epic version, which is the one dropping the Iksar Scale needed to complete the Shaman Epic. This means the Tear isn't MQ'able anymore so i warn you all to avoid a big sadness if you try and just loose the Tear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jorlaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">When i did my epic, i was not high enough lvl to get the tear myself, so i ran a friend's shaman up to fear and the guild doing golems let me have the tear.<br />
<br />
MQ worked fine. It was after pop came out.<br />
<br />
#1 he's a shaman<br />
#2 i made sure he was max ally with true spirit<br />
#3 he has spear of fate<br />
#4 he handed in the tear w/o problem to rak<br />
<br />
I hope that helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Did one in November.<br />
<br />
I'm a shaman.<br />
I still had max ally with true spirit, as did my friend (who did the quest correctly, then did an extra pair of Trial of Wisdom trips).<br />
I have my Spear of Fate.<br />
I handed tear to Rak, who agro'd, and when dead, dropped the scale.<br />
<br />
I no longer have Max faction /sigh.  If I end up getting another Tear I suppose I'll work faction up for another friend.<br />
<br />
BTW, this was done with 3 lev 49 mage fire pets, mages kept FR unbuffed (about 100 FR).  Pets took no AE damage in this instance.</div></div><hr />

Ok I think this is the 50th post on the subject, but I'll answer anyway.<br />
<br />
1. possibly -- depends if other classes are friendly enough with Truespirit. I think some classes start worse than indifferent which may cause their own faction to not be high enough, even at max. I do not know if this is true with all classes other than Shamans. At any rate, has always been the case, nothing new here.<br />
2. Has always been the case, nothing new here.<br />
4. has always been the case, nothing new here.<br />
<br />
3. I seriously doubt it. Since when have NPCs ever checked your entire inventory when you do a turn-in? Never, except the usual check for duplicate lore items.<br />
<br />
The only thing that changed in Oct/Nov is the fact that Truespirit faction is reset back to indifferent upon handing in the Iksar Scale to complete your epic, rather than staying at max ally. But this does not completely prevent such a Shaman from MQing a tear, it only means that Shaman would have to work his faction back up to max ally in order to do so.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If I get another tear, I can do another, as my faction isn't touched.</div></div><hr />
