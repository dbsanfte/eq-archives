Am I odd, and only person? Its been less patches recently for last 2 months now which is kinda good in some ways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">patches suck due to the timing.<br />
<br />
the more patches, the more 1 timezone dominates certain spawns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think this is EQ's longest uptime ever. I wish they would track down the excessively long linkdead timeout error I've seen quite a few times-- I was linkdead for a full half hour before my toon disappeared from the world.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>JoarAddam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you LD, unplug your network cable for 30 seconds then plug it back in.  Clears the 1018 much faster</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Unplugging, turning off and on your system, spinning in circles... nothing helps.  It's on their side not yours.  <br />
<br />
From GMs:<br />
&quot;It's being worked on to limit the time that you will be getting the 1018 error for but it will never be eliminated.  It's there to stop exploits.  Though I agree 30 minutes is too long to be kicked for this error&quot;<br />
<br />
They know about it, &quot;they are working on it&quot; but they will never fix it.  And I /bug this all the time :)</div></div><hr />

I guess I agree with you and was thinking about this the other day. I started EQ shortly after PoP came out. There were so many patches then it was a little much but now there is nothing. Sometimes it makes me feel like the game is not cared about as much anymore. Of course it could mean everything is just perfect and could not get any better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Constan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you really want patches, come play on Test. We generally have 3 or more patches a week. This past Friday, the server was down a little over 24 hours.</div></div><hr />

EQ overall maybe, but on Xev we've had server crashes every few days lately.  I really love taking a loss and losing a good group in LDoN due to a server crash.  (I'm sure others doing more deadly things love these crashes even more.)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bukbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">When Eq came out there was usually at least one patch a week, and they went anywhere from 4-12 hours long.  Entire days were lost due to patching - conveniently alway on my days off.  It was probably like that for the first few months.  When compared to now it was hell and today it's a slice of heaven.  Servers are rarely locked anymore and even more rare is seeing them down.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>shinreineko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">EQ has been operating on a one 'big' patch a month for as long as I can remember, which is fine in my book. I played SW:G for the first couple of months of release, and also a few weeks in beta, during the beta and for the first 2 weeks or so of live, there were nearly daily patches lol.<br />
<br />
I wish EQ would do new features a little more often than once a month, but I guess they do have to have enough time to get everything working well. I'm looking forward to this month's patch, which should be hitting live within a week I think, lots of good things there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
damn we must have had the same work schedule, cause they would ALWAYS patch on my day off...wednesday if Im not mistaken.  And then I would secretely call out sick or take a day off, just to grind out a level or  a totemic (eep) quest piece, and there was always an emergency patch...days off=world coming down..log out now!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">My little beastlord wants to do his epic, can't wait for the next server downtime so the grimling wars get reset....but generally speaking, its nice that things are pretty stable and as someone else says, it helps the spawn times get spread out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Skeeter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">On Test, I've been wishing for the opposite -- less patches please!  heh.<br />
<br />
Need the server to stay up long enough for the Fear golems to spawn so I can go try for an iksar tear -- haven't had a 3 day-straight server uppage for a few weeks now. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">When it comes to them forgetting to include something key or important for a class into a patch, they need to re-patch it in right away.  They do this all the time, and it'll become a month wait to get it in, because they don't want to take down the servers.  Stuff like that can make or break a class, and waiting that long is unacceptable.<br />
<br />
It's too bad that when they do re-patch the same night or next day, it's because of some new exploit of a broken situation, that shouldn't have been broken in the first place.</div></div><hr />
