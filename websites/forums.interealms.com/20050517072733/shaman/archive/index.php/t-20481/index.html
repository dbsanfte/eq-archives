I'm currently trudging through the 12 AA's for Mental Clarity 3 so that I can get Canni V. I understand that Mental Clarity 3 will be useful to me in the long run but why in the name of Marr is it a pre-requisite for Canni V? I would much rather spend my first 12 Archetype AA's on Natural Durability in preparation for Canni V. In fact Mental Clarity is fairly low on my list of AA priorities in general.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well natural durability wasn't even an option originally for Shamans when the AAs first came out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Haha, Beafly!<br />
<br />
I suffered throught those same thoughts (and still do.) The only answer I came up with is SOE's sense of irony. &quot;Make em get 'FT3' before we give them another Canni!&quot;<br />
<br />
I also agree the logical steps would be ND3 before Canni 5. Or, if they are going to have an ironic sense of humor at least do it to all classes. Enchanters require MC3 to get Gather Mana ... consistancy dictates they should have to get ND3 first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Daekar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Didn't bother me, though I agree ND3 might be a more logical pre-req. However as pointed out it wasn't offered before I believe.  In the long run though I'm glade I've got MC3 done now /shrug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">When I was doing these AAs a while ago, I thought it was a bit silly that Mental Clarity has increasing AA cost for a linear ability enhancement. (2aa for MC1, 4aa additional for the same again in MC2 and 6aa for MC3). I still think that's a bit off, to be honest, and there are a lot of AA abilities that scale like that.<br />
<br />
However, if you think of it as 12aa for FT3, it does seem more worthwhile. MC3 does help, it all adds up.</div></div><hr />
