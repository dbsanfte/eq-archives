<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How long would you think it would take the die hards to get to level 70 right after OOW is released?<br />
<br />
Next question:  Do you think it would be raiders or non-raiders who will get to level 70 first?  (Raiders always complain that raiding takes time away from xp'ing, but non-raiders do not have access to the better xp zones, but have more time to xp?)<br />

I also wonder how much of an option PoP zones will be for exp, or if we need to go to GoD/OoW zones to get the best exp...<br />
<br />
Kod'Taz would hopefully still be a good exp zone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No Haagen, you're not.  I just got to 65 and have been enjoying the process of improving my toon through AA's.  I'll probobly bite the bullet and buy OoW and just grind the 5 levels out.  Since I'm not EP flagged, It will be nice to grind out XP somewhere other than BoT/HoH tho.<br />

Just think.. how long after Kunark came out till most people finally hit 60?  I know that level 59 took me a few days of huge grinding to reach 60 before PoP.  Don't get me wrong.. I'm predicting within two weeks most people that try to will ding 70, but I don't think that my guild will be actively trying to let people level unless it becomes hugely necessary (read: slackers not exping when not raiding).</div></div><hr />

Shoot if worse comes to worse, I'll do Hard LDONs with AA exp set to 0%.<br />

Gonna suck being level 70 and using spells from PoP and LoY though.<br />

48 months to get the spells?  That's a tad optimistic.  ;) <br />

<br />
When PoP came out our guild took a week off to XP.  Most were level 65 before that week was over, some after a couple days.<br />
<br />
No clue how much XP is going to be needed for 66-70, but if its anywhere similar to 61-65, those of us already in Kod'Taz and beyond, especially Qvic, it won't take long at all.   Qvic XP is quite amazing with a good group.   Many mobs are level 67+ so they'll be solid xp up till 70.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tidykat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">It's been a few weeks, but I heard rumour (i lost thelink, apologies in advance), but it basically said that most people will likely be 66 shortly after loggin in (yay for having 99% exp banked), but also said that many of the hardcore players (not, not just hardcore raiders, but players in general) may take up to a month(ish) to go from 66 to 67 at 100% EXP.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure how thats possible, unless they make all levels post 65 a hell level x4 or so.. Which would pretty much piss a bunch of folks off, especially those who don't want to grin exp anymore.  Anywho.. just passing the word I had heard, wish I knew where from again &gt;.&lt;</div></div><hr />

Takes about 5 mins to get an AA points that way.<br />

Or you can goto tipt and start faction wars between the mobs there and you can make several aas in 5 mins.<br />

I doubt it will be long before people have level 70.</div></div><hr />

Lame, thought they fixed all the stupid exp cheats but guess not. Why don't they just give everyone max aa's when they log in?</div></div><hr />

<br />
But 60-65 rolled right along. I honestly expect an extension of that, and I fully expect zones with more XP/hour than we have currently in any zone.</div></div><hr />

Fire will be ultra-camped. Can't imagine trying to get a tables group. KT will probably also be busy. Ikkinz trials could be a good place if you can get a balanced group just because you won't have to compete with anyone for spawns.<br />

<br />
There are already level 67's in beta, 3 that I saw this morning.  They said they put a ton of time into xp work, so while its not going to be easy, its not going to take a month for hard core players.<br />
<br />
I give it a week before someone hits 70.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Gorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">If they /betastarted a char on test server it should been 65 with max exp? that means they have become lvl 67, 1 lvl, in 4 days?<br />
<br />
That is pretty massive exp grinding and I bet those 3 peps were hardcore raiders...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Shambler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">i wont level far past 65 unless it is realy going to give me good spells I can easily get or help my guild progress via mudflation.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">They weren't /betabuffed.  They were copied over and were members of a high end raid guild.  Most likely they were max xp in 65 so hit 66 on first kill.  <br />
<br />
Now that I think about it and the comments made, I'm going to say that most hard core xp'ers with access to the best xp zones, probably will hit the levels as follows:<br />
<br />
66 - Instantly<br />
67 - Day 2<br />
68 - Day 5<br />
69 - Day 8<br />
70 - Day 12<br />
<br />
Thats not counting the ones that will be playing in shifts 24/7.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I sorta wonder with theh difficulty of acquiring new spells if this is going to raise a similar dilemma back in the early days of PoP.<br />
<br />
To be specific - leveling to 65 without your spells not only took you out of certain exp zones, but now you were level 65 casting level 60 spells.<br />
<br />
I can function without GoD spells, and I equally expect OOW to be similarly devoid of imagination and craptastic.<br />
<br />
But two expansions in a row with no spells? That will cause me to look VERY seriously at other games.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>temuchintehkhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Just think.. how long after Kunark came out till most people finally hit 60<br />
<br />
<br />
most (and I mean like 90 percent) of people never hit 60 in kunark.  it took me a solid 2 weeks of grinding to get through my first 59 in karnor basement and that was with me 3 boxing running and exp on only one box.<br />
<br />
it's totally inappropriate to compare kunark levels to anything nowadays... it wasn't unheard of for decent players in those days (which would equate to the same skill level uber-level players nowadays) to LOSE net experience on some tough camps during the course of a night's play<br />
<br />
a lot of people quit their characters in frustration or rolled new ones... and simply never hit 60 on their original paladins or whatever, finally hitting 60 deep into SoV<br />
<br />
this might wash off your back as incomprehensible but people literally and seriously in those days PETITIONED that their experience bar was broken because they'd grind for days and not see any movement in their exp bar.  it was largely for that reason a second... blue... bar was added so you could see incremental advancement.  and think of all the legends that use to post on this board or play in the uberguilds of your server who are long gone and never been matched since... these were GOOD players who never hit 60, better than the hacks today<br />
<br />
I'd say 3 days and every server will have a lvl 70 once GoD goes live...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>7ekno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">There were a lot of nights when 1 blue bar of experience was a GOOD night!<br />
<br />
Oooh, the memories ... XPing for hours on end each night, with the aim of 1 level a week .... aiming not to lose XP in tough camps ...<br />
<br />
I remember Sontolak (?sp, sheesh, can't believe I forgot how to spell it) raids where I was the sole Shammy, and I used to line the entire raid up in a single file line and cast Focus of Spirit and Riotous Health on each player, they would camp out (so the buffs would not wear off) and I would be CanDancing with Regen + Can3 and casting buffs as fast as I could ...<br />
<br />
/sigh they were the days ....<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">If they don't extend focus effects to 70, it will take 0, because I will end billing.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, will probably take 2-3 weeks for people who play 20 hours a day and somehow have no jobs or school or ANYTHING to take them out of their virtual world, and about a month and a half for the rest.  I just hope you can exp past 65 in PoP... if they force people to group in instanced zones (which is basically the majority of every expansion that's to come out, it seems), it's going to be a headache.  People say &quot;LDoN exp will scale&quot; but I reply, &quot;There's exp in LDoN's?&quot;<br />
<br />
Problem is, I could get level 70, it would not matter because I wouldn't have any of the spells.  I liked rejoining the game awhile after PoP, because all the spells had time to come into the game in large numbers and became cheaper.  Now everyone and his brother will have a USE for the spells, and they will not go on sale until everyone in the guild of the person who WOULD have been selling it gets one to scribe.  Assuming they'll require you to go to omens zones, and seeing as how omens seems GoDish in difficulty, I think I am pretty screwed.<br />
<br />
Valsuvious, you got from 59 to 60 in a few DAYS, and in pre-PoP era? In Kunark era, on my druid, I played in 6 hour sessions 6 days a week for a month to get from 59 to 60.  I ate one un-res'd death, but the rest was all gravy.  I spent it in skyfire tracking blues and my med time (no sharable long-term mana regen buffs available at the time... no KEI Po9 SD etc) was about 10 minutes from 0 to 100 percent.</div></div><hr />

Pretty close, I expected it to take longer than it did.  If it wasn't for having to work Sept 19-22 I would have hit 70 on Sept 20, so 6 days.  But I put in quite a bit of time, about 12 hours a day or more.</div></div><hr />
