Some good friends and good times.....EQ memories )  compliments of Renalo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nindalf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't know anyone in Winters of Discontent, but what I do remember and it was a long time ago is the first time I saw someone with that guild tag.  I really really liked the 'name' of the guild and told the person just that.  I know its  something small but I never forgot that.<br />
<br />
Winters of Discontent,<br />
<br />
One of my favourite names for a guild. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zaythar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As one of the original members of Winters, I thank you for that compliment, Nindalf.  We poured over tons of name when we reformed our former guild.  We had a vote and everyone but one person voted for Winters.  He wanted something like Avengers Unite.  Just because the guild leader(Renalo is a cleric) looked like Iron Man at the time, did not mean we wanted to be named after a comic book :).<br />
<br />
I would also like to point out newpage 5 of Ren's site (http://renalo.20megsfree.com/newpage5.htm).  There is a great shot of Xunil and Coat :).</div></div><hr />
