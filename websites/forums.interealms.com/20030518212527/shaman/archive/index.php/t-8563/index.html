<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kukgulano</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">With the PoP expansion I have a far greater use of the Worker's Sledgemallet I got during one of my OT quests.<br />
<br />
The mallet is a  Giant 2 handed blunt weapon that procs a gate spell to the shipyards in the OT.  It procs after level 50, so don't bother trying it before then.  For those who don't know about it:  You must raise your faction in the Outpost by handing in the Sarnak braids of the berzerkers in the zone to the Skelly Captain, then when you are &quot;Amiable&quot; you visit the Skelly Foreman and give him 2 pieces of jade.. he will give you the mallet and some exp.<br />
<br />
I carry it everywhere I go now... and if i need some transport all I do is whip it out, slow a target, start wailing on it and Whammo I am in the OT. <br />
<br />
A quick dash over to the PoK port site there at the outpost and I am within moments away from almost everywhere.  Several times I have bound right where my group is hunting and made this trip to the nexus to catch a KEI, and I gate back within a couple minutes.<br />
<br />
In my humble opinion, this hammer should be in the inventory of every Troll and Ogre shaman who seeks easy transport.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>mool</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">you can pick up a spiritstone from your friendly local potter.  Free gate to Innothule or Halas (be sure and get the right one for your race) then a quick jog to the book.  As an ogre who listened to my guild leaders enough that trolls don't like me much, I'd have preferred a Feerott gate (although the troll that stands at the port in point is indifferent anyway so it's no big deal).  But a reliable port is nice to have.<br />
<br />
30 second cast time on the stone tho so the hammer still wins in the &quot;get me out of here please please please&quot; department.</div></div><hr />

<br />
hrm?!  are you saying you can purposely go so negative that it wraps around to non kos? if so do tell!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sowfor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yes, you used to be able to but it was fixed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I still look for ports to WL.<br />
<br />
Geonids drop shimmering gems for engraved royal velium armour, which I like to make. Giants for faction. Dragons to turn in quest things. <br />
<br />
Yeah, I could go to GD, walk through EW, invis through Kael, but I admit it, I'm lazy. 25p for a port is worth it to me to skip all that running and invising through Giant Central.<br />
<br />
Another place I get ports to is CS. Same thing... I don't have a shrine key (been lazy), and again, I am lazy when it comes to running all over velious like that. I'd rather just get a port.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">CS is just about the only place I go that I have to find a port.  Or, EJ to an extent.<br />
<br />
Everything else: PoK port books and run the rest of the way!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Smellious Oderous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">EJ is one zone away from the Cabilis port book. I use that to get to CoM or OS, just lev, after zoning into EJ, run off the cliff, np, you're at the druid port-in loc.<br />
<br />
WL and CS are about the only ports I ask for also...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Taldur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Or you can just bind in PoK =D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">A spiritstone means you can bind wherever you want, whenever you want and never have to worry about being trapped someplace.  For example, for TOV raids sometimes it's really handy to be bound outside the zone.  Not a great thing if you go LD and the raid leaves you! <br />
<br />
I'm currently bound in the Nexus, but I never have to worry about changing the bind spot at my convenience or whim.  I could right where I'm hunting and still end the night back in the Nexus without any stress.</div></div><hr />
