I've got some people I consider friends on here that I'd love to meet face to face and shake their hand but I tell ya, Vader makes me want to meet him just so I can see if his crazy demeanor on here is the same in real life.</div></div><hr />

It was pretty fun to say the least! :) Daggerdave is one you all may know, though he doesn't post in RL much.<br />
<br />
I've also met some old guildies at two RL gatherings. I think it's fascinating to meet the faces behind the words and actions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The rest of everyone, I'd hate to name names and exclude anyone... but I wouldn't mind meeting Vanidar, or my friend/arch-nemesis across multiple boards - Crydee.<br />
<br />
If I were out of town, I'd probably look up whoever was there and meet 'em.   Say, if I were in Texas, I'd visit all my guildies there along with whoever lives there from these boards.  I don't think there's anyone I wouldn't meet (albeit in a public, well-lit setting :D).</div></div><hr />

Hey, I made somebodies list!  Ohh, you probably mean that other Telumehtar.... :)  Oddly enough he and I tend to be on opposite sides of issues, I'd expect a Tolkien afficianado to have more sense. :p<br />
<br />
I don't post here enough, with Tevyn gone no one gets me worked up enough to do so. *shrug*</div></div><hr />

Especially since I am a relative newcomer to the Boards. I like to meet people myself but  i rarely have the chance. That may change as soon as I get to the Florida area though since most of my Guildies  live there. 2 1/2 weeks and counting .... unless I got fired and someone failed to tell me this week. That will cut my estimated departure by another week.</div></div><hr />

Raell, ya I'm sure I'm just a troll, and have a little mini-orgasm every time I'm insulted. Believe it not, I do contribute to debates every once in awhile, and offer a reasonable perspective, but 90% of my posts are mostly light-hearted jokes.</div></div><hr />

I do read quite a bit more than I post.  I just don't understand why someone would spend so much time trying to piss people off and goad them into a arguement.  <br />

It would be so fun to put faces to all the posts I read.  Some of you have actually inspired me to come out of my own little world where news and politics didn't exist to the real world where I was a bit uniformed.  Kulleas for one has gotten me to think alot.</div></div><hr />

Some of us are just REALLY LOUD and hard to overlook. I'm pretty sure everyone here at the Glade has something to teach me.</div></div><hr />

This is exactly why I would rather not name names.  Not to pick on you, Fullerton, but some people are probably seriously disappointed their names aren't on more lists.</div></div><hr />

You really think so?  I didn't think people took it that seriously.  I'm actually surprised my name is on a lot of lists to be honest.  If it weren't, I would'nt think much of it.<br />
<br />
Shoot, I'm like some others that have posted.  If I were to run across someone from the Glade, I'd invite them over for dinner or something.  No matter if they had 5 posts, or 5000.  Common interest and all.</div></div><hr />

Thanks.<br />

I would have to say my answer would be most everyone here. I know, very vague, but true!<br />
<br />
There are a couple I would leave out, but that is mainly due to I just don't think we would have anything in common and it would be somewhat boring for the both of us.<br />
<br />
obvious selections-<br />
Sunmoon<br />
Numbuk<br />
and everyone on my server.</div></div><hr />
