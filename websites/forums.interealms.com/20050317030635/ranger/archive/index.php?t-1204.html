My armor is well...well its crap... I can get my attack to 1030+ easy but my ac is like low 800's buffed, i know sad.  Do you HAVE to be ally to CoV to hunt in WW? im currently Apprehensive and am planning on doing many kael raids for thrug armor so it should go up rather fast.  Should i wait and try and make some cash to buy new equip? would a 51 do well there?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goldeneyes</div><div class="date">04-13-2002, 01:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">51 = EW.  You can kill walruses and Icefang very quickly and fairly safely at 51. with that AC and relatively low level I would think too many fear/snare resists and would die very very quickly if a wolfie got  a hold of ya.  IF you raid KD regularly, then your faction should be fine by the time you get of a level to head out there.  I personally waited till 55 and chloro till i went, but 54, mebbe 53 with skillz could swing it.  One more thing, in wolf form i dropped 2 factions levels out there, max ally to warmly.</div></div><hr />

Walrus r practically all green and lblue.  I lvled the end of 50 there and it was slow then.  Guess i'll go to KC and lvl a bit.  thnx for tips on WW tho</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hawkwind</div><div class="date">04-15-2002, 01:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would not try WW at 51 imo, I would suggest a minimum level of 55 for WW. The animals there have lots of hp and I believe they range from 45-53 (rogue dire wolf I think is reported as 53, velium hounds I believe can go up to 51, not sure though since everything was blue to me when I started at 56 here). Velium hounds I think will resist you too much at your level, heck when I was 59 I had trouble fearing/snaring some if that gives you any idea on their resistances. You definitely should be non kos to CoV imo, makes life a whole lot easier, only have to worry about hounds, ice burrowers and the Guardian. <br />
<br />
I would suggest bats in Sol B or the entrance to the Hole if you are planning to solo. <br />
<br />
Also I suggest you definitely get new armor ;) I think when I was 51 I had AC in the 800s but this was when Kunark was new, much better stuff out there now to eclipse that.</div></div><hr />

Finding the danged animals.  I've been wandering between 2 kiting sites-- DN gorge and TOV gorge... there are times when I will see absolutely no animals on track for literally hours.  At 57 I'm pretty much limited to WW now for fear-kiting.</div></div><hr />
