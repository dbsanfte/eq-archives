<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shamain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I made lvl 24 and have all but 3 of my spells. I was wondering what is the best spell line-up (IYO) to have.<br />
<br />
I currently have.<br />
1) Turtle<br />
2) Str<br />
3) Dex<br />
4) Heal<br />
5) *rotating* SoW - Walking sleep - Shrink<br />
6) Infectious cloud<br />
7) Affliction<br />
8) Frost xxxx<br />
<br />
Any help would be useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You should use whatever works for you, of course, but I only swap out buffs when I need them.  I would probably swap one of those str/dex buffs for root.  Root can be a great tool.<br />
<br />
In addition, 24 marks a very exciting time in a shaman's life, you get regen and cannabalize!  Your days of sitting on your butt like a robe wearing caster are over.<br />
<br />
Keep whatever line up works for you, but I would recommend:<br />
<br />
Heal<br />
Regen (has a very short duration, I like to keep this one memmed in my fighting line up)<br />
Nuke (swap slot for buffs)<br />
Dot (swap slot for buffs)<br />
Root<br />
slow<br />
Swap slot (SoW/gate/serpent sight)<br />
Can<br />
<br />
I never demem heal/root/can/slow unless I'm dead, I use the swap slots for buffs and spells which are not critical.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">1.)Heal<br />
2.)dot<br />
3.)regen<br />
4.)slow<br />
5.)randombuffslot<br />
6.)root<br />
7.)canni<br />
8.)Spirit of Cheetah<br />
<br />
I solo'd 24-32 or so in ill omen, pulling dark blues in the field outside the fort, cheetah saved my butt a few times, much better than gate for an outdoor escape spell<br />
<br />
Apparently I just have all my spells in some strange order, works for me though, just find what works for you and go for it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lyam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I try to keep my spell line up as per below:<br />
<br />
1. SOW (changed to Alacrity since getting Black Fur Boots)<br />
2. Healing spell<br />
3. Debuff spell<br />
4. Slow spell<br />
5. DD<br />
6. Disease DOT<br />
7. Poison DOT<br />
8. Root<br />
<br />
I only use this line up when soloing.<br />
<br />
When Grouped I change to:<br />
1. SOW (Spirit of Bih'Li these days)<br />
2. Healing spell<br />
3. Haste spell<br />
4. Most commonly used Stat Buff<br />
5. Slow Spell<br />
6. Debuff spell<br />
7. DD<br />
8. Root<br />
<br />
Hope this helps, I wasn't specific on the spell names, but you should understand the spell types.<br />
<br />
Cheers and good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Carrieanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">1) Turgurs [hotkey 0]<br />
2) Malosini (hot swap) [hotkey 9]<br />
3) Root (hot swap) [hotkey 8]<br />
4) Cana IV [hotkey 6]<br />
5) Gate (slow swap, eg buffing)<br />
6) Hot swap<br />
7) Kraggs mending (before this used to be a hot swap) [hk 2]<br />
8) Chloroblast [hotkey 1]<br />
<br />
My hot keys are (really messed up lol) &lt;shift+6&gt;:<br />
1) Chlorobast - macro in /group<br />
2) Kraggs mending - macro in /group also states 1950hp 10secs<br />
3) Macro - tank targetting for raiding<br />
4) Macro - tank targetting / assist MT for raiding.<br />
5) /g /1 macro that gets used for SLOWED or MALOSINI message - no casting is linked with this hot key.<br />
&lt;break in ergonomic keyboard&gt;<br />
6) Cana IV<br />
7) Spell book<br />
8) hotswap - normally root (crowd/agro control)<br />
9) hotswap - normally malosini or alacrity<br />
0) Turgurs - does not announce a message.<br />
<br />
I also have:<br />
&lt;shift+7&gt; x - pet controls<br />
&lt;shift+5&gt; 5 - epic<br />
&lt;shift+1&gt; 1 - sow booties or mod rod<br />
&lt;shift+1&gt; 4 - bp (riotious health)<br />
&lt;shift+1&gt; 5 - bracer (infravision)<br />
<br />
There are also other clicks for abolish disease (11secs), counteract disease (5secs), counteract poison (5sec), etc etc.<br />
<br />
I normally keep the same spells in the same slots - so if I mem malosini it is always in slot 2 (hot key 9) and I don't have to search for it..<br />
<br />
I also have a big &quot;FOCUS&quot; button too - it announces to the raid that group leader X's group is getting focus that members of their group should gather around them and that it's 26sec cast time (stops bored tanks wandering off).<br />
<br />
You'll get used to swaping spells in and out for buffing as their duration increases.<br />
Organise your spell book and then use /book &lt;pagenumber&gt;.<br />
I don't have /book hot key macros.<br />
With /book I can hotswap spells between hits with a Turgur'd mob.<br />
<br />
I think you'll find that your'll start swapping more spells at 29 when you get cana and regen.<br />
Cana, slow and heal will become more permenent (along with root), buffs will be swapped in/out for DDs/dots etc.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My lineup throughout levels has pretty much looked like:<br />
<br />
1. Heal<br />
2. Regen<br />
3. SoW or Haste<br />
4. Slow<br />
5. Dot/Debuff/nuke<br />
6. Root<br />
7. Canni<br />
8. Open slot... gate/buff/etc.<br />
<br />
I modify depending on what I'm fighting, who I'm grouped with, raiding, etc.  Nowadays #3 slot is usually Malo and I swap SoW or haste in the #8 slot.  But my &quot;generic&quot; lineup looks like the above.  It's worked from 1-60, pretty much. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm always swapping spells! I keep aggressive spells at the top and beneficial ones towards the bottom<br />
<br />
1. Root (almost always)<br />
2. poison DoT (almost always, sometimes switch to nuke in group)<br />
3. Slow (always)<br />
4. swap spot, often maloxxx, disease dot, nuke or haste. <br />
5. swap spot as with 4, plus I use this for buffs. 2nd best heal if main healer (superior now I have chloro)<br />
6. Heal (always - chloroblast nowadays)<br />
7. Regen (almost always)<br />
8. Canni (always)<br />
<br />
I think its very important to have slow, heal and canni somewhere you can always find them immediately.<br />
<br />
Regen gets its own spot due to short buff duration and I always keep it up on myself and MT<br />
<br />
Root is very useful even with a chanter. I've saved too many lifes with it to sacrifice root for another free slot unless I am very confident in the group or I'm on a raid.<br />
<br />
Others are a bit flexible depending on my role and what mobs we are fighting. I keep my spell book tidy so I know how to find spells quickly. I did set up /book macros but find I never use them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shamain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks for the replies all they have helped in my Hotkey mapping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kargen Krimsonwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">At lv 60, I arrange my spells around the same as I did that lv, with upgrades of course..<br />
<br />
1. Torpor<br />
2. Kragg's Mending<br />
3. Turgurs<br />
4. Root (Hotkey 2)<br />
5. Gate/Focus/sta/agi/shrink/haste/etc Depends on situation<br />
6. Pox/BoP/Icestrike<br />
7. Bane of Nife<br />
8. Cann4 (Hotkey 8)</div></div><hr />
