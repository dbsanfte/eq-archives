SpiritSeeker last spawned on tuesday afternoon.  It is now over 72 hours later and still no respawn.  I have an alt on another account that has been sitting in the safe-hall since then.<br />
<br />
I have zoned in and out multiple times in the mean time with no spawn.  I have gone back and talked again to the cat in Shadeweavers Thicket, who again recognizes that I've done all up to that point, and gives me the quest info for the Nadox mob and the UP mob.<br />
<br />
I have killed and looted the Swarmfiend.  I have killed all the rest of the mobs in the quest, with no problems, have all bits on me at all times.  <br />
<br />
Have filed a /petition, as well as a /bug report.  So far no response on either of them. :( <br />
<br />
Today alone, I have been up, at my pc's and in nadox constantly for the past 12hrs.  Multiple other shaman have zoned in, and out to check on spawn, again with no respawn. <br />
<br />
Please fix this ASAP.</div></div><hr />

Done all turnins up to text from Wunshi to collect ring and talisman.  Have been checking Nadox.  Zoned in and out of the 2 zonelines for Gunthak with no spawn.  Was there for over 2 hours no other shaman killed him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bangor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Nadox was just taken down 30 min ago i'm going to zone in 2 hours and see if what the devs are saying is correct. in the past 5 days though i have zoned in and waited a good amount of time every time and he has yet to spawn when i zone in. he is all i'm missing for epic and fighting 4 shaman for a spawn is silly especially when end geared shm beat us vt equipped ones to spawn with their boxed toon kinda sucks and discouraging. i dunno a shaman on our server that has not /feedback about this guy for not spawning and all the other shaman are missing this one piece so its hard to believe what the devs are saying about if your at this point in quest he'll spawn upon zonein...yeah right can anyone from any server confirm such a statement?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I can confirm. <br />
<br />
Narrs of Erollisi Marr zoned into Nadox tonight and the mob spawned almost immediately. I confirmed with Narrs that he had done each previous step, all dialogue and hand-ins and was ready for Nadox. <br />
<br />
He was kind enough to give him spawn to my guildmate Vany, who appeared to be bugged and had been camping the mob off and on for days. I'm going to give Narrs a tell tomorrow and see if he was able to spawn the mob 2 hours after Vany killed him. What I'm afraid happened is that Vany got Narrs' spawn, and now he will be bugged, we'll see.<br />
<br />
I'll be able to test it myself tomorrow, I'm one sky trip and some dialogue away. Turns out Vany missed one line of dialogue in Freeport. She flipped the q in &quot;Tell me more about Veshtaq&quot; and never got the spirit to respond to her. She skipped the line and went on to &quot;He succeeded?&quot; and the dialogue continued. I don't know how significant it is, but she definitely missed at least that one line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Asml8ed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have completed part 1 and part 2 of the epic.  The elder spirit sent me to Wunshi for more help.  Hailing Wunshi I am told about the gruesome being and second beast and what was stolen.  I then head over to Nadox but he won't spawn for me.  I've had my druid sitting in the zone since 5pm EST on Friday (over 12 hours) and still he hasn't popped.  I've been in and out of this zone for several days and still he hasn't popped.  I am not sure what is meant by having all the appropriate bits, but when you hand in your items to the elder spirit you don't get any bits in return you are just sent to Wunshi, so the only bit you might have is the bag you bought from Wunshi in part 1, but i have the bag and still it doesn't spawn Nadox when I zone in.</div></div><hr />

Ich have done all steps waiting for him to spawn since 4 Days now, I missed him after 3 Days 6 hours because he was taken allready.<br />
<br />
Have now also finished all other steps from Part 4 now becaus I as bored to wait on him. So ist my last bit for Epic now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Interesting - spoke to Narr this morning, Nadox did not spawn for him when he went back 2 hours later. This is possibly how Vany was bugged as well, she said she had run through Nadox several times before camping him...it's possible someone else killed her spawn.<br />
<br />
Narr zones in, spawns Nadox, gives spawn to Vany. Vany kills and loots, now Narr appears &quot;bugged.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vahlar said:<br />
<br />
Once you have completed this portion of the quest, you will not be able to trigger the spawn anymore.<br />
<br />
To me, complete means that you've killed/looted/turned in the quest bit, but what if complete just means killed/looted?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>kronas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">This could very well be the case.  I zoned in yesterday morning, he spawned but some another shaman was there and killed him.  I have gone back 6 hours later and now he wont spawn for me at all.  I can confirm tht no one killed him in that time as a shammy has been there for 4 hours.    Hope they fix this issue soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>kanelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">is the UP mob considered before or after nadox....  camping nadox for 2 hours now... got /log on and /time done....<br />

<br />
i've completed all steps minus the UP mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The quest giver describes the UP mob as the &quot;second beast&quot; so I would say it's after Nadox in the progression.<br />
<br />
About my theory, this is very similar to an issue the druids are having:<br />
<br />
&quot;We're seeing this more and more. During the goblin hider event in Frontier Mountains, one druid starts the event and then has to track to the one hider mobs that drops the piece s/he needs. Unfortunately, more and more, that mob is getting KS'ed by an anon druid looking to skip the work. The original questor then has to recreate the &quot;poor goblin disguise&quot; and start over and run the risk of being KS'ed again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Absor posted to the druid post that he is aware of their issue and is working to resolve it. <br />
<br />
If this IS the issue for the folks bugged at Nadox, it's a pretty big one...there is no way the shaman at the &quot;correct&quot; step in the epic can be at the spawn point the moment Nadox spawns. If there's another shaman camping it at the spawn location, the zoning in shaman runs the risk of being bugged.<br />
<br />
When I do this later today (probably later today), I'm going to have guild members zone in and move to Nadox spawn point, warn any camping shaman that my zoning in will trigger MY Nadox and then make sure we get the kill.<br />
<br />
Still confused what Vahlar means by &quot;appropriate bits&quot; though, as far as I can tell, you don't have anything quest related on you by this step - you've turned everything in!</div></div><hr />

I never missed any dialogue, did it all in order.  And he never spawned for me at all, not even for another shaman since all the shaman I've seen in there when I zoned in are still looking for him.  I got lucky, some nice people who were hanging out in Nadox sent me a tell when they saw the Prophet walk past them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dont get me wrong, I think the fact that they can put this kind of coding into the game is pretty cool that it tracks where you are and that you do all the steps in order, but sheesh the bugs that come from it are horrid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>kyyzshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I had been watching in Crypt of Nadox with another character other than my shaman.  The first time my shaman went to the zone to see if it would spawn it was yesterday after reading your post with information from the dev.  I always have my journal on, so I went through and verified that I have all the responses listed in the guides.  So unless something is missing there, I should have it all.  I had friends go to his room before I zoned into the crypt.  Since this was my first time zoning in with the shaman, I should not be bugged by someone else having gotten my spawn of Nadox.  I tried zoning in by every zone that I know of to the crypt(2 from Gunthak, Torgiran, Hates Fury.)  I then waited around till I had been there for 2 and a half hours and rezoned to make sure someone didn't get a kill in before I arrived.<br />
<br />
I did attempt to kill the Swarmfiend but did not succeed at that.  The only other part I have done, is I did get the dust from the Elite in CoD already.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Asml8ed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">SOE responded to my petition and said that the epic is working as intended folks so either we are bugged to the epic -or- we are not doing the epic the correct way.  I am not sure what the truth is at this point.  SOE customer support will not help in this matter even though the INTENT of the quest is to give the shaman an INSTANT spawn of this npc during the quest.<br />
<br />
Here is something I would like to know.  Do any of the NPC's involved in this quest RESET your progress?  For instance, will talking to Wilslik after the Elder Spirit sends you to Wunshi reset your progress?  Or will re-hailing the Elder Spirit before turning in the talismans reset your progress?  I know they patched the monk epic because something was making progress get reset.  Maybe that is happening to us some how?  I dont know.<br />
<br />
All I do know is that I have completed Part 1 and Part 2.  I have all the collection done except the drop off the elite corrupted knight.  I just need to kill Nadox, Swarmfiend and collect that last item then I am done.  But Nadox is pissing me off.  This was intended to be in-and-out and because I am bugged or something is missing I am stuck waiting on a spawn that I cannot possibly monitor 24x7 for 3-stinking-days.<br />
<br />
MEMO TO SOE: Add a trigger mob to Nadox that will spawn this guy.  Make Wunshi give us an item to do the triggering with and add a trigger spawn and this WHOLE nightmare goes away.  That is how you make something like this work.  You don't rely on the flim-flam you got going on now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">My current post to the guild summit forums, please add any issues you can think of:<br />
<br />
I was really happy to hear your news that Spirit Seeker Nadox is intended to be a triggerable mob, available to &quot;ready&quot; shaman at 2 hour intervals. However, I'm hearing tons and tons of feedback that this is NOT the experience for the majority of shaman. Currently there are 17 shaman in this thread http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=24125 who have completed the epic up to Nadox and can't spawn him.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I think the whole concept of the game &quot;knowing&quot; where you are at the quest is pretty cool, but it seems to be a pretty hit or miss thing. In my opinion, it would be better if Wunshi gave us an item we could turn in at Nadox's spawn point to get him to spawn. The turn in mob could despawn for 2 hours to allow for the 2 hour interval.<br />
<br />
Please help me out with the following!<br />
<br />
Questions about the shaman epic:<br />
<br />
1. You mention that the shaman must have the &quot;appropriate bits&quot; on them. Per the quest, by the time you reach Nadox, you have turned in all quest items, you are bit free.<br />
<br />
2. You state that the quest must be done &quot;in order.&quot; Personally, since the quest begins with a group encounter, I started with some of the gathering steps. I'm not a big fan of getting people involved if I don't intend to follow through with something, so I did every bit of the single person camps (goos, skins, fungus, twig pickups, powder, Torture kill, teeth) BEFORE I did the first group encounter. Is the quest truly intended to be done IN ORDER? That's very anti EQ quest! If the intention is to do the quest in the exact order, the frog in FG and the troll in Twilight Sea shouldn't talk to you until you've completed all previous steps. <br />
<br />
3. Shaman are bugged at Nadox but still able to loot Swarmfiend in UP. Since you have to be at the correct step in order to loot the Swarmfiend, I don't know how the same people can't spawn Nadox.<br />
<br />
4. When a shaman is finished with this portion, they can no longer spawn Nadox. What constitutes being finished with the step. When your spawned Nadox has been killed and the ring looted? When the spawned Nadox has been killed, the ring looted and turned in to quest giver?<br />
<br />
5. Spiritseeker Nadox does not spawn at zone in. If a &quot;non ready&quot; shaman is camping the spawn point and a &quot;ready&quot; shaman zones in, what's to stop the non ready shaman from killing him and looting the ring? If the kill of the spawned Nadox ends the progress for the &quot;ready&quot; shaman, is that shaman now bugged?<br />
<br />
I'm ready for the Nadox portion of the quest. I have both Talismans on me and I'm afraid to turn them in to the Elder Spirit. They are the only proof I've completed the epic up til that point! If I am bugged since I did the TS and FG steps out of order, how can I fix it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Hrendra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Character name: Rionach<br />
Server: E'ci<br />
Have done all of the parts up to Nadox, including all of the text/hails. I have camped the Ukun Skin, Powder, Goo, and Tooth, but have done nothing but kill/camp those mobs and throw the drops in a bag. As far as the quest is concerned, the last hailing I did was Wunshi Kashra in Shadeweaver's, and the 'gruesome being' 'second beast' 'stolen' line of conversation. My two Talismans have been turned into the Elder Spirit; thus, I have no 'bits' on me aside from the Thatched Medicine Bag (empty), which served its purpose for combining the Pulp and Twigs, and is not used in any subsequent steps.<br />
<br />
Have zoned into Nadox multiple times to check. I feel it's very short-sighted for the developers to think that it's normal for a person to zone in, see a mob not up, and have two unimpeded hours to sit there and camp it, particularly when 1) other people are camping the same mob, and 2) many times people act as 'scouts' to see if it's up, and then rally support..so typically, they take a looksee, and if it's not up, they gate out to check later in the day. <br />
<br />
Personally, I went there, saw someone camping the room, and didn't even say more than a howdy-do. I certainly didn't think any sort of spawn was tied to my actions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Damman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Also not getting Nadox to spawn, and I'm sure many Xegony shaman have seen me there in the last 12 days trying to get him to spawn. Just this evening I spent 4 hours clearing the room, zoning out and in, repeat. I've even tried clearing various other rooms on the off chance I can force Prophet Grulwhatever to pop.<br />
<br />
I have gotten the dialogue from Wunshi, and I believe I am also bugged with this. Seriously just create an item the Wunshi gives to you when you hail, turn item in to a npc at zone line who spawns Nadox, and go kill him. Failing that, put something in the wunshi script that resets your ability to spawn Nadox so if you do get bugged you can just run and hail.</div></div><hr />

Another bugged shaman. All of the quest steps done, in order. Got Sky turn-in done last night, went to Freeport and Shadeweavers and did the conversations, and then went immediately to Nadox. He did NOT spawn when I zoned in, and he has NOT spawned at any point since then--roughly 13 hours later. A guildmate of mine has been camping him continuously all night and never saw him. I have been killing the dark blues for what little AAXP you can get from them and waiting, and also zoned in and out several times, and no spawns. <br />
<br />
I petitioned it last night, response this morning was a blowoff, basically. &quot;As far as we can tell, the quest is functioning as it is supposed to. If you feel there is still a problem, please send a bug report.&quot; Which is what I did.<br />

I was in Nadox last night looking around, but a level 70 shaman from another guild was already there. We chatted a bit, and he said he had zoned in two hours after Nadox was last killed ... but at the time I zoned in, he had been in the zone for three hours and no spawn. While I was standing at the door to Nadox's room, I saw the shout spam message from a High Priest something-or-other about it being time to start the prayer. I stuck around, but Nadox never spawned. I came back to the zone four times afterward in about 30-minute increments, and no Nadox. The other shaman said he never spawned and gave up. <br />
<br />
EDIT: Zoned in again, got the same spam message about the prayer ceremony (which may have something to do with the Grand Spiritist's shrine and not Nadox), waited for 2 hours and no troll came up to do any kind of a ceremony or spawn Nadox. Nadox's room was cleared by me just for the hell of it.<br />

<br />
I camped it alternately with another shaman for the 80 hours it took for respawn to happen. We were both up to that point in the epic and I had all the pieces for the final turn-in as well. During the time we were camping several other shaman zoned in who were at different stages of completing the quest including one who had epic, one who had every piece except spiritseer, and one who was up to the nadox spawn but had no further pieces. Since we were alternating camp both of us were zoning in and out at different points during the spawn.<br />
<br />
When Spiritseeker did finally spawn there were three people in zone who had been there for at least 5 hours. From what I understand of Salorma's spawn (she's in my guild) her experience was exactly the same. She kept an alt sitting in the safe hall for 3 days+ and would move there after raids and clear everything, etc.<br />

I saw some people pop in to get that piece for the VP quest.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>redribbit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">This could be a possibility (something that you could try). When you see the message from the high priest, kill him loot the witchdoctor's cudgel, leave and zone back in or zone back in 2 hours later. The High priest spawned for me when i was in the room with the hidden path to a zone. I killed him but never went back to see if Nadox spawned. It could be a cycled event when you zone in as a shaman. <br />
<br />
Although much like how Innoruk works in this zone..you need to keep the high priest alive and kill all other mobs in the room to spawn him. Perhaps the same holds true for Nadox. You may need to have a chanter charm the high priest to nadox's room, kill all the other mobs there uncharm the priest and root him<br />
<br />
perhaps that will trigger the &quot;ceremony&quot; to bring Nadox to life.<br />

just a thought. I am not up to this point yet so I can't give it a shot</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">As far as the mob getting taken by someone else you should be able to avoid that or at least tell by zoning in from the castle zone side of things instead of the lava zone from dulak's. If you zone in threw the castle you go straight ahead, make the first right and just follow it around to the first room and your in spirit seekers nadox's room. It's very close by and no wall climbing to take time. If there was a shaman there waiting for it and you triggered it by zoning in i'd expect you to make it there before they killed him and most likely before they even pulled him unless they had a pretty large force sitting there waiting with them. What happens then is anyones guess but at least you'd have some idea if it spawned or not.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">Yes, but the epic system recognized that you were ready to kill the swarmfiend (because you could loot the quest component).

I've made a few changes that should make this a little easier the next time we get the zones patched.  I'm doing my best to have this change in asap (within a day or so).<br />
<br />
If you are at the correct portion of the quest (have the correct flag), you will be &quot;notified&quot; when you zone into Nadox if you have awakened a nasty spirit thief.  This still functions the same way in that you have to be at the right &quot;spot&quot; in the quest or he will ignore your presence.<br />
<br />
It seemed this didn't work for several of you and I apologize for that.  All should be well when we get this change on the live servers.  I honestly did everything I could to remove bottlenecks from this quest and am very sorry several of you had to endure long camps.<br />
<br />
That said, if you are not at the right spot in the quest, you will have to endure the natural spawn time of Nadox.  That won't change.  Awakening Nadox is a gift to those who are at that point in the story.<br />
<br />
I'm still reading these boards with regularity, so I'll be keeping an eye on the progress.<br />

Vahlar/Holly<br />
<br />
Thank you for your direct response Vahlar however there is still some ambiguity I am hoping you can clear up.  Are you verifying that there is a problem with the quest?  It's great if you get a message when you spawn Nadox but if you cannot spawn Nadox now, how does this help?  I mean.. we've been told that the quest is working as intended and people are not able to spawn this dude.  I am sure you cannot come right out and say that the quest involves xyz, but clearly the shaman quest has been &quot;solved&quot; and the steps taken by those who have the epic are common knowledge now.  Once you get to Wunshi talking about gruesome beings and second creatures that's when you can do Nadox and Swarmfiend.<br />
<br />
I have gone through every single bit of text and turn in from all the npc's and still didnt get nadox to spawn.  Does that mean that I missed a magical npc that was not referred to in the quest?  Or am I, infact, bugged and unable to spawn nadox because my character has become corrupted to the progress on this quest?  As far as I am concerned, I am bugged because the elder spirit accepted my talismans and sent me to Wunshi.  Wunshi sent me after Spiritseeker Nadox and Netherbian Swarmfiend.  That to me is &quot;the right place&quot; in the story.  <br />
<br />
If this is a bug in the quest where Wunshi 'forgot' to mention an intermediate step or something then please be forthcoming -or- if the quest progression has a known bug that causes progress on the quest to get reset/corrupted please be forthcoming with that information.  You don't have to be specific, simply confirm that all these people are simply doing something wrong or that all these people can be assured that they will be able to once again resume this quest once the zones are patched.</div></div><hr />

That means it will be patched onto the live servers in the next few days. That means it is not live yet. That means you will not see the zone-wide emote until the servers are patched. That means that Nadox is still a broken spawn until this goes Live.<br />
<br />
Thank you Vahlar, the communication is welcome and the swift response amazing. Keep it up.<br />

Quest complete up to this point, just zoned in and cleared the room.  I seem some zone emote.  Highpriest shouted that the ceremoney is about to begin, time to pray or some crap.  Thought he was going to summon Nadox but clearing the room still and nada.<br />
<br />
Zoned in and out multiple times.  Been over an hour now<br />

The emote is related to the Grand Spiritist, and I don't think they're related.<br />

I have done very part in order and don all my hails up to he Nadox part. I have spent the last 6 days in Nadox in and out. i parked a baby necro here to see spawns. I have seen other shaman come and go in and out of the zone. I have killed the guy im UP and done everything after that...minus the turn ins and speechs. He was last killed by guildmate excatly 81 hours ago. I have spent the last 9 hours clearing his room over and over with soem other people. in this time 4 other shaman have zoned in to check on camp and he never spawned. He has to be bugged at this point. Thank god Wow is only a month or so away!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u84"><b>Jeis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p84">Personaly would be better for him to spawn on you walking into his room, just in case ppl exp'ing in that area. Or maybe even put an NPC in the room you can hail to spawn him. I can see ppl who bugged camping and someone zoning in and he pops.....Bugged shaman thinks woot Nadox popped lets kill him, the spawner shaman still at Zone and running to room, get there to see bugged shaman looting corpse. Now as he is killed would the spoawner shaman be able to respawn as he was killed? or would he now be bugged.</div></div><hr />

Actually that doesn't help clear up whether or not the people who are stuck right now are bugged or simply not doing the quest right.  Ok great you will get a message when you zone in after the patch, but if you don't get Nadox to spawn right now how will a zone emote help?  GM's have responded to petitions indicating that they found no problem with the quest when done correctly.  So to that end I presume that means that people who are not able to spawn Nadox now will not be able to even after the patch UNLESS they are also going to make a change that will make it completely clear that you are &quot;at the right point&quot; in the quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u86"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p86">According to Vahlar, shaman were not bugged, it was the zone. After the fix, all shaman at the correct step should be able to spawn the Spirit Seeker (there is a 2 hour timer involved).<br />
<br />
Vahlar said in an email:<br />
<br />
I won't get into the boring details, but this trigger wasn't working for<br />
<br />
all shamans. We did a bit of added rigging to make the event a bit<br />
<br />
clearer.  Hopefully it will work for all shamans when we update the servers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u87"><b>Moglyzok Moogleman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p87">Yea it seems like it works, and there should be no trouble with double kills IMO, as you should just have people go in prior and tell them its the triggered spawn.  The trigger that I saw was,<br />
<br />
&quot;Spiritseeker Nadox has been awaked by your presence, and isnt amused.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Is that on live?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hi all,<br />
<br />
Managed to get the change put on live last night.<br />
<br />
Best wishes to all!<br />
<br />

I walked into the zone at about 12:30 a.m. EST on Karana, no emote. I was the only one in the zone, though, so I figured I should check out Nadox's room just in case. As I crossed the threshold into his room, I got &quot;Spiritseeker Nadox has been awaked by your presence, and isnt amused&quot; message. Lo and behold, he spawned on the shrine. Killed him with a group, looted the ring ... and it's on to Umbral Plains after 19 hours of camping.<br />
<br />
:) Thank you Vahlar!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u91"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p91">Worked like a charm.  When I zoned into Nadox, I received the emote, ran to nadox's spawn point, and proceeded to give him the beating of his life, literally :P  Now, I only need NS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u92"><b>Shenen Alquimista</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p92">I also did this last night, zoned into Nadox and got the zone emote the second I zoned in.  Just UP, CoD, and HS left till epic is done!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u93"><b>Mystt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p93">After talking to G over the last couple days and waiting for another shaman to camp his piece out of order, I walked in (insert emote here) and POP.  This fight was so easy, that if I did not have a group here already I would say a shaman can solo him.<br />
<br />
Now, I am pretty well geared and have a few new spells...so--however I think given you are 65 and some time gear...you can load the dots and crush him.<br />
<br />
Worked perfectly, so 1.5 is done and 2.0 is coming :)<br />
