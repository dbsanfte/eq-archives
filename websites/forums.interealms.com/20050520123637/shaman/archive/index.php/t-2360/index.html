<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Since I got torpor I have taken up residence in ME soloin them football dudes. Killed hunters, foragers, shaman (pain in the ass) lookouts and gatherers. Been looking at this tree that has a circle of them spawned around it, but have yet to pull from it fearing the mega train that looks like will follow. I keep hearing about a chieftain that spawns in this area and I am assuming it has something to do with that tree. Can anyone shed some light on this for me?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The chief, along with at least one other named spawns next to that tree. I have killed the chief twice and he dropped Divine Inspiration both times. I have killed the other named twice as well and though its a tough mob it dropped nothing both times. This other named is a caster type (shaman i think). A Spiritseer maybe?<br />
<br />
If you stand up on the hill next to the wall and look down at the tree...the named/placeholder spawn point will appear to be just to the left of the tree. Clear that spot till the named pops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">How do you pull from the tree? There are like 6 spawns right there very very close to each other. Chain agro range is huge on these dudes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Harmony:( I wasnt solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">lol, gotcha, looks like its time to buy luclin for our community druid acct.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You are one lucky SoB.... I've killed the chief 5 times myself and gotten just the beads (crap neck slot but not horrid for int casters).  I PL my bro and my rogue at the chief camp for all the mobs in the area and the &quot;chance&quot; at the DI.<br />
<br />
Anyway the question at hand.... Answer=Be lvl 60.  pure and simple.  lvl 59s will pull a couple adds but a lvl 60 will only pull the look out or semi-named guys.  The Spiritseer, the shaman, the lookout, the hunter, will all come if you pull the mob next to it.  So what you have to do is be lvl 60 and pull the semi-named guy and the gatherers and followers will just stand there.  most of the time if you are smart and pull from the oposite side of the named guys you can even get away with out agroing them.  <br />
<br />
OH and dont worry about pulling a train in ME..... none of the other inconsiderate JACK HOLES do!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Krakster,<br />
<br />
You can pull the tree safely at 60.  First pull all the wanderers and keep track of the named and psudo named at the tree. <br />
<br />
The Psudo named are higher level and will add on other pulls.<br />
<br />
So what do you do?  Pull them first (grin)<br />
<br />
If Multiples come Root and scoot and log. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">At 59 I dont find these guys to be worth the effort to solo...too many hp. I should get 60 next week will go try them again with malo and torpor (yay!). Thanks for the pulling tips:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Wow really? thats surprising considering how large the chain agro is on them. I assumed the whole tree would come lol. Sweet then. Its never camped on my server and the hunters give a full 1/2 blue AAexp per kill (but they probably have 10k hp and hit pretty hard)<br />
<br />
One other question, what are the stats on the Divine Insp?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">ac 15, 15 wis, 15 int, 35 mana, range spot, int and wis casters, no drop<br />
<br />
Solo exp for these in 59 sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I pull the tree single lots, using turgurs, np always single.<br />
<br />
I got the divine inspiration of the first chieftan we killed.  :)<br />
<br />
But since then he seemed to drop it about 1 in 5 times or so I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Geal Icehammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The other psudo named that spawns around the tree is the Spiritseer. He isn't a shaman but a cleric however. With the new AI changes he doesn't CH as much but instead he nukes for 925 pts, so keep your magic resist up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">What tree are you guys talking about?  Is it the one near the DSP zoneline?  There's a circle of Goranga's on the same wall as the Akheva zone too.  I've killed those a few times, but never noticed anything interesting spawn.  ME is a complete toilet on my server though, so I tend to avoid it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It's the one to the left of the DawnShroud Peaks zone.  Very nice hunting.<br />
<br />
And ME on Bristlebane tends to be either vacant or ruined by morons that don't quite grasp the fact that folks sitting at the zone would actually LIKE to know that they're about to be visited by half a dozen of the Coterie and some stray drudges and Xi that happened glom on to the passing festivities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Sitting at a zone line is like stoping your car on train tracks.  I am sure you can figure out the result.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I agree Colal. <br />
People sitting or camping at a well travelled zone deserve whatever they get in the way of trains.<br />
<br />
That goes for me too.  I stay the hell away from zonelines as much as possible, and it's an unwritten rule among those with more experience in dungeons that you just don't camp zones.  <br />
<br />
Like a couple days ago, I was campin freeti in solb with a lvl 49 monk.  She was a bit low and managed to pull a train and die.  I had tried to manage the train, so I had aggro. . . mobs in there are way resistant tho and I was running out of hps and mana.  Hps got to 20% and I made a dash for the exit.  I made it too, thanks to run3.  Best 3 points I ever spent!  I pity the fewls at the zone tho.  Whatta train!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Think I might rather use a Talisman of Benevolence, but the DI is a nice item for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Aye, never the wisest choice.  There's safer places to sit in Maiden's Eye.<br />
<br />
But if you consider &quot;sitting at the zone line&quot; to include such minor things as<br />
-  Folks getting rezzes from somebody in Dawnshroud who didn't want to travel more than 3&quot; from the zone,<br />
-  Folks just zoning in (visible or not) to find themselves stunned and lifetapped by a pair of the Coterie,<br />
-  Folks just too lazy (or too young to have the courage) to go anywhere else in the zone to drum up business (my 9 yr old falls in this category--he's worried 'bout getting lost and dead in a new zone)<br />
<br />
There was one poor schmuck who kept ketting offed just after getting rezzed.  /boggle.  Makes ya wonder why they stay there, when folks repeatedly train the place.<br />
<br />
Folks who camp zone lines don't have the intestinal fortitude for the Tribunal (or me) to care about.  I still, however, give a shout stating that there's a train to a certain zone, and move it or lose it.  Common courtesy, primarily to ressurectees and folks just zoning in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Jenoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Has anyone else had a problem with mobs sticking to the zoneline forever after the person that aggroed them zoned?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">In Maiden's Eye, yes.<br />
<br />
Camping the &quot;4 arms&quot; and toilers at the Akheva Ruins zone line (oh, wait, I shouldn't have said that based upon the previous conversations, hehe!) there was one time that someone zoned two of the Xi Thall Centiens (&quot;4 arms&quot;) at AR.  They wouldn't leave, no matter what!<br />
<br />
I'd never seen that before and I can't say that I remember seeing it anywhere else, but I've seen it happen here at least 2 or 3 times and as far as I remember just with those types of mobs.  It really sucks, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Bloogbloog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Whatching the amount and types of trains going to Dawnshrouds is pretty humorous...I always give my hotkey train button a hit though before I start jamming..like someone said above me...just to give warning to people zoning in and or getting rezzed...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Aye, there's one Goranga (spawns right by the ME/DS stairs) that won't walk back to his spot if he's left near that zone, and a couple of the Centiens will camp Akheva, since it's close to their spawns, too.  I'm not sure if the ones further out will stay there once dragged</div></div><hr />
