<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a Coldain Military Wristguard that now has BAIII on it.  I'm level 55 and am using EB and Plague, still.  OK, before the item was changed to BAIII, EB would do 146 every tick.  Last night, it was doing anywhere from 151 to 173 per tick.  Am I to assume that BAIII has some type of resistance check since I'm not getting the full effect all the time?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">From what people have been saying, it's a random 5% to 20% bonus per tick of the dot, so it's not being resisted, it's just the random bonus in action.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">( Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Abani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah, and just to clarify, it varies on *each tick*-- so for the same cast, you get different amts of damage on different ticks.<br />
--Abani</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">And your bracer glows on each tick. Gets a bit spammy after you lay a few dots down :) <br />
<br />
Still, its a great change and I applaud SOE for it, although of course I wish it was a steady 20% boost and not so random :/ Can't have everything I suppose!</div></div><hr />

The DD spells that are effected by Focus Items do the same amount of random damage.  They probably have to make BA do random damage otherwise everybody would start winning about how come they don't have it so good.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Each and every other damage focus effect in the game works exactly the same way.  There are none that provide a constant boost by a certain percent, it is always a range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Sure, but they could have calculated the boost once when the spell went into effect.  That would retain the randomnicity while reducing the spam level.<br />
<br />
i.e. THIS cast you get +5%, NEXT cast you get +12%, etc.<br />
<br />
It's really not worth the mana to overwrite your own DOT just because the bonus is low.</div></div><hr />
