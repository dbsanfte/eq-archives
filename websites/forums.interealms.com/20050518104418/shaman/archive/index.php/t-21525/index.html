Sony would probably say it will make us to overpowered or some such crap.<br />

<br />
LOL... An ogre shaman using the ability &quot;Slam&quot; for 1 point of damage... vs. a halfling cleric using bash for 32+ points.... <br />
<br />
That seems really overpowering... at least on a roleplaying level that makes really sense... /sarcasm off<br />
<br />
Remind me not to try to understand the logic there... damn ogres...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">overpoweredness (is that a word?) aside - if we wanted a &quot;realistic&quot; game there would be no non-ogre/troll fighting classes. You simply cannot compete with someone two times your height and reach and ten times your weight in combat. That should never be the base for a class or race getting an ability. If the ability can fit and be appropriate power-wise that is fine. If it cannot I would prefer a balanced game to a realistic game.<br />
<br />
Anyways, complaining about lack of realism in a game where clockwork ships take you from the continent where dark elves and ogres live to the land of giants, dwarves and dragons seems a little silly to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dirtnap</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I thought that slam had a higher chance of a spell interupt then a bash.  Is that true?  Slam is a stun were as bash is just DPS.  I would rather interupt a 1000hp dd then deal 32hps dmg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Seeing as I play both classes, I can assure you that Bash is much more effective from a Cleric than a Shaman Slam.  My tanking days are fairly limited as a Shaman, so it is a moot subject with me.  I think it is silly how they have it, but there are bigger fish to fry ATM.<br />

<br />
In a situation like that I would hope that I had speed on my side.  If my opponent was 10 times my weight, I would count on the fact that they would have to overcome ten times more intertia in order to duplicate  my own movement.  As a general rule of thumb, moving more mass takes more time.  More time=more effort=less time before they tire.<br />
<br />
But, thats a real world consideration.  You could overcome superior physicallity with numbers.  If abilities were the same for all the classes. I would say:<br />
<br />
5 gnomes to 1 human<br />
2.5 frogloks to 1 human<br />
2 halflings to 1 human (hah!)<br />
1 dark elf to 1 human<br />
1 high elf to 1 human<br />
1 woodelf to 1 human<br />
1.5 humans to 1 barbarian<br />
1.5 humans to 1 vah shir<br />
3 humans to 1 troll<br />
4 humans to 1 ogre<br />
<br />
Conjecture, but fun to think about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Bah, go away hijackers!  I'm Vah Shir and don't have slam and would REALY like something that interupts spell casters.  Oh well, at last I have a safefall skill of 50 . . . /sigh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Don't kitties also get sneak? I would trade my slam for sneak in a heartbeat.<br />
<br />
That is not to say I would mind getting bash or a stun ability. I just think arguing that we should get it because of roleplay or realism or race  considerations is the wrong approach.</div></div><hr />

To everyone who hasnt realised yet this post is SARCASM.<br />
Why the hell we dont get bash god only knows but Sonys usual answer is (as in Group FA and Group ToA) it would be too overpowering although 2.5 hr Virtue and KEI is not.<br />
