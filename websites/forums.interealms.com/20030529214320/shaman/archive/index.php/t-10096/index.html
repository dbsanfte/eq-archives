I emailed SOE with a major complaint about game cards and not being able to purchase the addon from the game cards point of view. We dont have CC's in our house to pay for those addons, and we refuse to get them.  <br />
<br />
It is fraud to supply a game in stores allowing the Game Cards to play the game, but take apart of the game away after selling the goods?<br />
Some dont realize it takes 3 months service to play the 1 month free. The cost is alittle more then CC users. NOT! alot more.<br />
<br />
Infact good question to be able to return all goods for full credit. I bought a new Gold box just before release of the addon statement, another purchase of 3 months for a game card. Basically told that this is the first of many addons via download only. CC users would have to be used online to purchase the download. To me it sounded like game cards where going to be pulled from stores. Didnt the statement sound like that to you guys?<br />
<br />
Anyway i hope they figure out a very good method for us and allow us GC users to continue on after 4 years of play.<br />
<br />
&quot;Debt is good but Bad Debt = EQ&quot;.<br />

<br />
Most (if not all) banks offer Visa/MasterCard checkcards that debit any purchase directly from your checking account. I cut up every single credit card I had, but still use my checkcard daily. It literally is &quot;plastic money&quot;. I don't like buying things on credit either, but paying for them with plastic that debits directly from my checking account is cool by me, and just like paying cash for everything, only you have the benefits of a credit card (consumer purchase protection and such). I use mine for auto/airline reservations as well. I'd die without my checkcard. :)<br />
<br />
You *do*, at least, have a checking account, don't you? If not you (dunno how old you are) I'm sure mumzies and dadzies have one, no? :)<br />
<br />
Just a thought/opinion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh, I must've missed the part where they were removing stuff from the game...  Damn you, Sony!  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">casters realm reports that a cd version will be available &quot;sometime&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Numzan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">whats a check card, val? is that something like a debit card by chance?<br />
<br />
I dont think i live in the same country as you :)<br />
<br />
I should look into that with my bank for purchases, it maybe USA only though? Good idea glad you brought that up, because it could make purchases easier for Phone, Internet buys etc...<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
Numzan</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeh, I'm in the US, so not sure what's offered in other countries. However, I'm sure since Visa is accepted almost everywhere (world wide) that a major bank in your area would have something similar.<br />
<br />
For more info check out:<br />

That's not my bank and it's only info for Texas (you can choose other states if you want), but it'll give you an idea of what it is and how it works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Morrighan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">:rolleyes: Think you should look up the definition of &quot;fraud&quot;. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">FYI...recently added to the FAQ section on the LoY site:<br />
<br />
7) Can I buy The Legacy of Ykesha extension at retail?<br />
<br />
In order to better serve our Game Card customers, we have recently decided to make a relatively small number of Legacy of Ykesha CD's available for purchase by retailers. The CD will not be available at retail until shortly after the live date, and may not be available everywhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Numzan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Here ya go Morrighan i dont think you did.<br />
<br />
Main Entry: fraud <br />
Pronunciation: 'frod<br />
Function: noun<br />
Etymology: Middle English fraude, from Middle French, from Latin fraud-, fraus<br />
Date: 14th century<br />
1 a : DECEIT, TRICKERY; specifically : intentional perversion of truth in order to induce another to part with something of value or to surrender a legal right b : an act of deceiving or misrepresenting : TRICK<br />
2 a : a person who is not what he or she pretends to be : IMPOSTOR; also : one who defrauds : CHEAT b : one that is not what it seems or is represented to be<br />
synonym see DECEPTION, IMPOSTURE <br />
<br />
Maybe your idea of fraud is something totally different but i see it as trickery to offer game cards and game boxes 1 week prior to announcement of the addon then turn around and say you cant get the download without a CC. Thats trickery!! Misrep. of everything they promoted.<br />
<br />
But care to batter words? ill do it again =D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Numzan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">aye think they got a few posts about it, not just myself. Glad to see they still see us as good customers :)</div></div><hr />
