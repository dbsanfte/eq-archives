<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">In this holiday season, please think about the less fortunate ... the monks!<br />
(okay okay, awfully corny start)<br />
<br />
<br />
Disclosure:  My second highest character is a 55 monk on the same account as Barm.  I created my monk for the purposes of raid pulling when the leader and main puller of my guild quit the game.  Sadly, that guild fell apart but I continued to play my monk and fell in love with splitting and pulling mobs.  I think you can all appreciate the diversion of playing a class that can’t cast a damn buff on anyone.<br />
<br />
In early October, the EQ dev team nerfed the mitigation of the monk class.  Monk AC, while numerically unchanged, suffered a reduced benefit in armor and equipment earned by the player.  <br />
<br />
http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/articles.jsp?id=52118<br />
<br />
The moderators at Monkly Business created a forum to discuss this change.  It topped 10,000 posts before it was shut down.  I’ve read comments ranging from ‘the change has no tangible effect’ to ‘the class is utterly destroyed’.  I can only relate my personal experience – that the nerf is pretty harsh.  Mobs hit close to max damage every time.  Soloing and being primary melee in duos are no longer viable options and pulling mobs and corpses has become very difficult.  <br />
<br />
Scott Hartsman has commented that, while they might tweak it someday, they are basically satisfied with the change.          <br />
<br />
I have 167 days played as a shaman since September 10, 2000.  I mention this because I feel my view of the situation, while biased, is not hugely biased.  I have been struggling for an objective viewpoint that would explain why monks now need to tank worse than rogues.  I cannot find one.  Yes, it was a capable class but not an overpowered one.  It was an enjoyable class.  <br />
<br />
This fundamental change, three years into the game, was completely wrong.  No one is having more fun now that monks are weakened.  The game was not improved.  Encountered are not more balanced.  Much of the versatility of the class is lost and monks have to do all their “non-situational” damage standing next to rogues.    <br />
        <br />
We shaman tend to favor AC over wisdom gear and solo by tanking slowed mobs.  I ask you to imagine every creature that swung at you suddenly connecting for full damage.  Okay, I mean outside of PoP. <br />
<br />
Monks are not always loved -- it’s one of those classes that attracts juvenile punks.  But we’re not just talking about that idiot who trained you in Lower Guk or who made an fool of himself /OOC’ing in Dreadlands.  We’re also talking about that cheerfully spastic lizard who pulled Rak’s reaver for your epic or the quiet guy who dragged everyone’s corpses out of Kael Arena.<br />
<br />
In contrast, we shaman usually are loved and we have a long history as the monk's best friend.  I am asking Crucible members to voice their support in this thread.  It’s my hope that comments from outside the monk community may carry more weight with the developers.  Thank you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Nerf was lenient, so I'd be careful in suggesting SOE look too close.  Monks wear pajamas and should tank more like druids than Rangers.  The nerf only took monks down from plate to chain equivalent instead of the cloth of the original vision.  Yes, monks were supposed to mitigate to make up SOME of the balance, but they were never meant to replace the true tanks as damage takers.  In damage dealing, monks were meant to be between Rangers and Rogues, but in many cases have started to overshadow even Rogues in damage output.<br />
<br />
IMHO - monks do and take more damage than they should right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My friends 61 monk tanks almost exactly the same post patch as he did before.  We split tank stuff between my 61 warrior and him constantly, and he holds his own very well still.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what kinda crack you guys are smoking, but this nerf didn't do enough.  He often takes less damage than my warrior when split tanking mobs, AND kills his mob faster.  I'm not sure what other test needs to be done....standing side by side with a similarly equipped warrior you see the difference, and the difference is negligible, which is wrong.  There is still zero reason monks should tank as well as they do.<br />
<br />
The mind plays tricks on you...if you're told you can no longer tank things that you could before, chances are, you're going to think you can't.  I personally don't believe any of that crap, because I have firsthand experience with a decently equipped monk who does just fine tanking whatever he wants to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The nurf hit the wrong people. Your average monk felt it bad but your uber guild monks barely noticed it. Already been posted about before and there was no agrement on the board.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dragonsfyre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you have very good equipment, the nerf didn't hit you too hard most likely.  The problem with the nerf is that it's effect on lower level and less well equipped Monks was far more significant than the effect on the better equipped.  I thought I read at one point that they had planned on seeing if they could retune it a bit to not affect the other Monks as much, but I never heard if that happened.  It doesn't seem to have happened.<br />
<br />
I levelled a Monk up to 48, and have barely touched him since the nerf.  Now that I have time to get back to my twinks somewhat, I'll definitely concentrate on my Rogue or Warrior.  No reason to PL up another basically less useful Monk.  There are way too many wandering around unable to find groups these days as it is...I don't need to add to the list.<br />

Funny thing is my shaman's birthdate is same as the monk nerf.  I had very average gear on my monk, and was able to solo low dk blues pretty well, but since the change I have had a few close calls with the same mobs, occasionally having to FD/BW to finish em off.<br />

Now my monk can &quot;solo&quot; again, all I need to do is find the rooted/slowed/incappacitated mob my shammy left for him.<br />

<br />
However.<br />
I've always believe it is important that charity starts in the home.  If you wish to champion a cause, well I would suggest championing the fixing of slow mitigation.</div></div><hr />

As far as monks go, i havent noticed too much.  Sure i dont play a monk, but noone really bitches about it anymore, atleast not to me, or in /gu.  Monks arent supposed to tank.  Sure they always have been, but a ranger should tank better then a leather wearing class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Varyss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The monk nerf is the worst possible kind of nerf-- the kind that doesn't even solve a problem.  the problem is that high end monks have access to better armor than virtually any other class in addition to inherent defensive bonuses in the form of innate avoidance and very high defensive skills.<br />
<br />
The nerf change the effectiveness of all monks without changing the type of equipment available to high end monks.  Therefore, to get them &quot;just right,&quot; everyone else is knocked down far too much.<br />
<br />
Monks were definitely too good of tanks, but for them to think that they got it right with one sweeping change to undo years of gear inflation on the high end... is dumb.  Sadly, I doubt it will be corrected in my lifetime.</div></div><hr />

I did notice a significant difference. However, the nerf is not the main reason I retired him, it had more to do with new PoP content and my desire to Uber up my Shaman rather than working on another class, I dont have the play time to do both.<br />

I have been duoing the basement of PoJ recently with a monk guildie and we have handled up to 4 mobs at once, so I wouldn't say the monk nerf ruined the class. <br />

<br />
I lost interest after the great nerf.  It does make a big difference to monks with only decent (~900 ac unbuffed) equipment.<br />
<br />
I don't think it would be so wrong to have a pure melee class who can solo (until PoP).<br />
<br />
I would support any effort to restore the old glory of twinked (non uber) monks.  If uber monks are still tanking fine, then fine, leave them be.<br />
<br />
As always, high end equipped players of any class are doing just fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">My bro quit eq for a few months after the patch and barely plays now. He used to be able to solo gimp mobs like LDC's with a few buffs and now he can't even do that. <br />
<br />
Personally I think its crap. I haven't played my monk once since the nerf. My bro felt like SoE completely screwed him over after all the time he put into his character.<br />
<br />
I personally don't blame him. Everyone should be able to solo to some extent when they can't get a group (which he has a hell of a time doing now as well. No one wants a monk anymore if there are other classes available).<br />
<br />
When you can't even solo gimp mobs from the original eq thats pretty sad really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Petercorbin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I remember the first melee i grouped with that had over 1000 ac was a 51 human monk wearing a dress (this was way before velious).  At the same time, my 50 warrior friend was sitting there with 800 ac.. mostly plate class type armor.   A guy in a dress and a couple of leather wrist bands shouldnt have a higher AC than a guy wearing like 50 pounds of metal.  (granted the monk had a lot higher caliber of gear, and I know about the absorbtion and avoidance components of Armor class)<br />
<br />
of the non-casting melees (war, rog, mnk) the ONLY ones i EVER EVER EVER saw soloing past 56 or so were monks (before PoP this is).  I saw monks soloing in the grey, etc.  Technically a rogue can solo to 58 or 60, using the right poisons and toys but its a lot harder and costs a good deal of cash.. vs. just hitting FD once in a while and regening w/a fungi and mend.<br />
<br />
These two examples are just a few of why in my opinion monks had their damage mitigation toned down.  Yea monks aren't as cool to go out and solo from 1-45 and (if theyre not twinked hard) then start worrying about groups.  Monks IMHO should be considered an asset to a group, not a soloing melee class and -not- as a main tank in a group.   Can they play either of these roles in some situations? sure... nothing is absolute.<br />
<br />
Sometimes when I find myself in a group where the only melee type is a rogue for example, ill hold aggro with root and dots so he/she can backstab.. but a 61+ rogue can tank just as well (if not better) than a 61+ shaman although we do have torpor and dont mind having it cast on ourselves and it wasnt necessary, just for us to kill stuff faster.  If I have to hold aggro for a monk in a similiar situation I will and wont mind doing it.   <br />
<br />
Your class got changed... adapt and re-learn your class or start a diff char or quit.  I highly doubt SoE is going to change much to monks at this point, with EQ2 on the horizon... just as I'm not holding my breath for a major upgrade to alchemy, or clockwork armor that my gnome rogue can wear, or cultural barbarian tailoring /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>stashin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">to those who are saying &quot; adapt and live with it&quot; - i would give my left nut to see your face if SOE would nerf shaman slow for example to work only in groups, or nerf your avaliable armor or dmg mitigation to that of an enchanter.and then i would say &quot; the game is evolving, adapt and stop bitching&quot;. people complain less because they have stopped playing their monks or have quit EQ entirely, SOE made an issue out of something that wasnt even a problem - guilds who have monks with 1.4kac can sure as hell provide MT for a fight that monk could handle.and in the best ways of the lack of creativity they made a big fat swing with a nerfbat, hitting monks who had no access to the equipment that would allow them to tank(thus reducing then to rogues who dont  do nearly as much damage)....aaaand missing the higher end monks[targets] alltogether.so please think before you say monks desereved that nerf.soloing lightblues is something that every class can do.</div></div><hr />

I think we might want to close this thread now.  The Lurkers are coming out of the shadows again, and the thread is spiraling into negativity.<br />
<br />
I'd much rather see a rally cry for a Slow Mitigation fix than Monk armor mitigation.<br />
<br />
I duo with monks frequently.  Since I'm tanking (in teh face) much of the time, I haven't seen the damage mitigation affect my (non-uber) monk friends all that much.  However I feel bad for any class that gets with a nerf, whether small or huge.<br />

Take care,</div></div><hr />

Warriors come much closer to monk damage than monks do to Rogue damage.<br />

This nerf has made it come down to one thing:<br />
Why would any group want a monk.<br />

Answer: In a non-raid situation, they wouldn't. ever.<br />
<br />
We can't take damage, get a warrior/pal/sk for that.<br />
<br />
We do decent damage, but Rogue's, Wizards, Rangers, Mages, and BL's all outdmg us, some by rather large margins (Mages do insane damage, and their 60+ pets tank better than 60+ monks too....)<br />
<br />
The monks niche? Pulling right? Well, anyone can pull in PoP, as I'm sure a lot of you shamen have realized, as you've done it yourself.<br />
<br />
I decline to pull in PoP.... mob hits me in the back, I come back half dead to camp and its a waste of mana.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Bozarkia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Why would any group want a monk.  <br />
<br />
This is exactly why I had a problem with my OWN class bitching for the need of a niche.  I've seen that monks are still highly desired in groups, as are shamans.<br />
<br />
The fact remains that every SINGLE class has desirability in a group.  Granted there are now other classes who can do almost as well as any other class does in a group, as long as there is diversity.  <br />
<br />
This to me is a GOOD thing.  Before the nerf, there were warriors saying, &quot;why get a warrior, when a monk can tank just as well, AND do more damage, have mend and feign death?  Now we have 3 plate tank classes to chose from when forming a group, we have 5 damage classes to chose from; monk, rogue, mage, wizard, rangers. we have 2 sometimes 3 valid classes to chose for effective crowd control, enchanters, bards and sometimes necros.  We have 3 choices for slowers, shamans, enchanters, and beastlords.  We have 6 snaring classes to chose from, druid, ranger, necro, shadowknight, bard, wizard.  With pacify and new harmony we have alternatives to fd pulling for controlling pulls using an enchanter, cleric, druid or ranger.  Heals have been upgraded so every group DOESN&quot;T have to rely on a cleric.<br />
<br />
I don't know about you, but I just want to play the game.  I like knowing I have alternatives in grouping rather than sitting around for hours waiting for the perfect class to become available.<br />
<br />
Boohoo, your armor class and mitigation got nerfed to what it should have been all along.  Monks still rock in spite of it, and those of you have decided to whine and bitch or give up your character rather than overcomming and adjusting and proving your worth, are a shame.  Hell I'm  a chain class in decent gear, and monks a flimsy leather class could mitigatate and got higher ac with the same level of gear available.  Most still beat me on this, despite the fact that I can wear a heartier armor.<br />
<br />
<br />
Try being a mage or necro or wizard trying to find a group in the old days?  Hell even druids had a hard time.  Now everyone has a little something to offer.  THIS IS A GOOD THING.<br />
<br />
I for one do not advocate SOE making any class a god class again, including my own class.<br />
<br />
Oh and a newsflash, MONKS STILL ARE HIGHLY DESIRED.  When I've been in pickup groups lately, and we're seeking a replacement for a general damage slot, monks are generally on the top of the list. followed by rogues, mages, rangers, necros, wizards.  <br />
<br />
Seems to me like wizards have the most to bitch about if anyone.  I rarely see any group taking a wizard unless there's just asbolutely no one else lfg. With most of the zones being outdoors, snare and evac aren't quite as important, that leaves the wizard as pure damage.  And while a wizard has the big booms, their forte isn't really sustained dps, like monks, rogues, rangers, mages, necros.....<br />
<br />
But to me the bottom line is the way it should be imo.  The classes don't make the group, the players do.  If you can't get a group as a  monk, my question is, do you just suck at being a monk?  Because I often look for monks in grouping and duoing, and I know who sucks and avoid them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Tagra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I have to say Monks were too good at tanking before.   They became super popular to play because of their versatility and they were way too good at too many things.  Now there's a glut on the monk market as you've generally can't fill up a group with monks like you could before.   Unfortunately their popularity also meant there is now a ton of bad monks out there. <br />
<br />
I think what SOE should do is keep your damage avoidance the same as it is now and use AA's to give you ways to do more damage mitigation. <br />
<br />
But I don't think, in general, monks are all that bad off right now.  I've had monks tank for me in PoV and found it worked fine... up until the mob enrages.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I have a 61 Monk with 22 AA's. AC is around 1100, HP's I can't remember off the top of my head. Basically a lot of old world stuff as I have never been in a NTOV capable guild. <br />
<br />
The nerf hurt. It was noticeable.  Now I spent 5 AA's and got part of my ability to not be a mana sponge back.  But the lasting effects are still there. I don't play my Monk as much anymore for the two reasons already listed:<br />
<br />
1) It's not as much fun, even when duoing (I rarely soloed)<br />
2) The fact that SoE would capriciously and for no reason except ONE (*) (elaborated on below) affect a major change to a class shows that:<br />
<br />
a) They don't play their own game<br />
b) They don't understand their own game<br />
c) They don't care about the people who play or the time invested<br />
d) They are making decisions - MAJOR decisions based on one factor only (*) and that is the following:<br />
<br />
(*) A constant and continual whine by furor on his boards to &quot; NERF MONKS&quot; was finally acted on.  There was no hard research then, and certainly I have seen none by any of the &quot;pro-nerf&quot; crowd on this thread.<br />
<br />
Sure my defensive skills fired more often - they SHOULD fire more often. I'm wearing pajamas where you are  a guy wearing like 50 pounds of metal <br />
<br />
So NOW, not only do I STILL get hit hard, I get hit more often too. Or vice versa. Or both.<br />
<br />
Anybody making comments about Monks who hasn't played one post 51 needs to have a tall glass of S.T.F.U.<br />
<br />
Anybody thinking this is a good thing, needs to not only have a tall glass of S.T.F.U - but when the nerf bat swings for you - don't expect any sympathy in this corner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Bozarkia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">AC is around 1100 <br />
<br />
I'm a POST NTOV GUILD and my ac is UNDER 1100 , 1076 to be exact. and I'm  &quot;wearing 50lbs of metal&quot; eh more like 80lbs of metal but whatever.<br />
<br />
So please, once again, no sympathy there.  By your rationale that because you have a lower ac then you should have higher mitigation, lets have druid tanks, and enchanters, mages and wizards!!  Since they are a lower ac class they should be able to mitigate more than us metal wearing classes /sarcasm off.<br />
<br />
MONKS ARE NOT BROKEN!  You may not be a god anymore,  but that's hardly room to bitch and moan.<br />
<br />
You're not tanks, you were never intended to be.  It was a nice thing to have when verant screwed up and made you more powerful than you ever should have been.<br />
<br />
One last edit,  you do realize that monks were given the bonuses in mitigation to compensate for the fact that the gear available to them was poor?  Since Velious onward, the gear choices for monks in the ac department have GREATLY  improved.  They now had higher ac items easily available to them.  Barbed dragonscale boots, spirit wracked cord, phase spider carapeice are some examples of nice ac items that you dont need a end-level guild to get, so the argument that only the uber monks are still okay is moot in my eyes.  All the nerf did was take away the BONUSES you got for having less than ideal gear choices available for you, when the gear was made available.  If you're still wearing wu's armor the blame for you sucking is not the nerf's fualt its the fact that you haven't gotten off your ass in search of improvements.  The fact that a leather class in a non-raiding guild can easily beat the ac of a chain class in a raiding guild should at least say something to you.<br />
<br />
Why should you get a bonus because you're a monk when the rest of us didn't get them when the gear you can wear is just as good as the gear that most of us can wear?  Why should an 1100 ac leather class tank just as effectively as a 1300 ac plate class?  They shouldn't.  So sir, you can kindly **** about it as well.<br />
<br />

You sir, need to research your own nerf.  When they lowered mitigation (actually lowered is a bad term) when they took away your mitigation bonus, at the same time they gave you an avoidance bonus.</div></div><hr />

Some first hand.  Some empirical.  Some unexpectedly shallow.  I am not going to debate any statements here.  I will ask you to consider one common theme though.  The folks gaming with uber monks saw nothing.  Apparently, their AC went from softcap+200 to softcap+50.  Those of you who play with lower level monks have noticed the difference.  As someone else stated, these lower level, non-insanely geared monks were not the problem, yet they were the ones nerfed.  The problem monks completely dodged it.  <br />

Quote'd from a reply by Verant to Lenardo of monkly-business.  Monks are streaky but not that streaky.  Show me instances where this statement holds true, and i'll start posting everywhere praising the monk change.  This is the kind of information VI is generating in order to help make sure monks are balanced.  If you care to read their reply @ monkly-business, they even admit they missed their target.<br />
<br />
I have 4k hp's unbuffed, and over 1300ac, it is out of balance when I join an xp group and they'd rather have the shaman tank.  I'm sorry but thats just not right.  All pure melle classes should be a more optimal choice of tank over a shaman.  You could exclude rogues from that, as itd better serve your group to have them doing their DPS from behind, BUT if the group so wanted, the rogue should be a more optimal tank.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have a 52 monk.  He used to be able to solo.  Now he can not.  He's twinked in a pretty sick way too.  He's tied to being able to find an exp group once again.  He does pretty well in a group tho, seems to fill his role.  Problem is, all soloing ability went out the window unless he gets some really truly uber gear somehow.  My guild doesn't do NToV anymore.  As a result, I've kind of retired him and haven't played him in months.   Since the nerf actually.  <br />
I think the nerf was badly implemented.  There needed to be a balancing, but it should have capped the AC, or scaled more over levels . . . as it is, it just hosed anyone who wasn't uber already.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 * Monk Defense.  Finally, the issue of defensive ability needs to be addressed with respect to Monks.  Monks in EverQuest were originally intended to be a class with excellent offensive potential, both with and without equipment.  This ability came at the expense of having only passable defensive abilities, partially in the form of an extremely small, restrictive selection of equipment from which to choose.  <br />
<br />
This, of course, caused its own series of problems of how to adequately reward the person behind the character.  It did not take long for universally equippable items (ALL/ALL items) to be considered by and large as &quot;Monk Loot,&quot; as far back as before the launch of Kunark.<br />
<br />
Over time, Monks' defensive abilities had been tuned up to correct a perceived weakness.  This, taken in combination with a few years of universally equippable, low-weight, high powered items entering the game, slowly transformed Monks into what is arguably the strongest defensive class in the game.  Monks get hit less than any other class, and due to the tuning over time, no longer take appreciably more damage when they do get hit.<br />
<br />
This imbalance between the classes does need to be addressed in order for the Plate-wearing classes in the game to have their proper relative power.  The Plate-wearing classes in the game take a serious penalty to their offensive abilities in order to defend as well as they can, and we cannot fix this problem solely by inflating their defensive abilities to compensate for this.  Again, that type of change would harm EverQuest as a whole much more than altering the one class.  Likewise, we have no desire to retroactively alter all of the equipment in the game that is contributing to this problem.  <br />
<br />
Monk defense will be altered somewhat.  It is no secret that in EverQuest, a character's Armor Class does not compare equally across different classes.  (A Wizard with 1000 AC defends differently than a Warrior with 1000AC, for example.)  It's not the most optimal system, for sure, but it is the one that many people have had much time to get used to.  As such, Monk defense will be altered such that they may continue wearing the same equipment, however, they will get a decreased benefit to their overall ability to take damage.<br />
<br />
Again, we have no desire to make monks unable to take any type of punishment -- far from it.  What we are primarily striving for is maintaining the defensive order of the Plate classes being able to take the most punishment, followed by the Chain classes and Monks.  The latter being technically a Leather wearing class who will continue to make up the difference by being able to avoid more blows than the rest.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Heh I guess I'm bit irritated at being told to s.t.f.u by a monk who came to MY class message boards, asking for help (not bram), when he didn't like my opinions.  So I decided to make it easier on him to read the balanceing statement so he can come back and make a logical non-inflamatory argument as to why I should support him.  Because to me, this balance was  everything it should have been.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Baldkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">1) Comparing shaman mitigation to monk mitigation is just stupid.<br />
<br />
2) Saying monks were never intended to tank is also, just stupid.<br />
<br />
It would be like going out, buying a car, brand new, wonderful V8 engine, the works. You love it. Driving it for three years, and then suddenly  having the car company show up at your door, and replace your engine with an engine out of a Geo Metro. <br />
<br />
0 to 60 in 3 years, you know the type.<br />
<br />
When you ask why they replaced it, they simply say, &quot;This is the way the car was meant to be.&quot;<br />
<br />
No facts, no emperical data, just &quot;because we said so.&quot;<br />
<br />
Once again, I ask, why group a monk.<br />
<br />
You say a monk is on the top of your list of &quot;to gets&quot; when you're looking for damage dealers, I say you must be stupid to think that a monk does more damage than a Rogue, Mage or Wizard.<br />
<br />
You may say you look for monks, but that doesn't happen on my server... Monks regularly will go LFG for hours in the planes, while every Rogue/Ranger/Wizard/Mage gets gobbled up.<br />
<br />
The word is out, we're the necro's of a year ago.<br />
<br />
I tank worse than a Rogue now, I've tested it. I've watched Rogue's take 2 CH's per Jugg, while I was taking 3-4.<br />
<br />
Rogue's also do way more dmg than I do, and these days, with their Windblades, Warriors are doing as much damage as me.<br />
<br />
The nerf, flat out, was made because of high end all/all equipment, and guess who it didn't effect: the monks in the high end all/all equipment.<br />
<br />
Also, about AC, your AC is lower than mine because my avoidance AC is much, much higher. Block, Dodge both over 200.<br />
<br />
Still, I guarantee if we both tanked mobs, using all our skills, you'd take a *bit* less damage then me, after casting your 75% slow.<br />
<br />
As for soloing, Monks could solo 50+ because of their epic, and its clickable 40% haste - which stacks with item haste. <br />
I don't know if people don't realize this or what... but fighting a mob at 62 or 70 or 81% haste kills stuff MUCH faster than fighting stuff at 22, 30 or 41% haste.<br />
<br />
Take a 60 monk and don't let him equip his epic and see how well he solo's... once again, its a gear thing.<br />

<br />
Nerfing another class does not make you better.  (unless dr00ds in which case we all celebrate and point and laugh. Not gonna happen tho, I figure those tree humpers have incriminating pictures or something...but I digress)<br />
<br />
To re-iterate for the &quot;reading-challenged&quot;<br />
<br />
1) This nerf did NOT hurt top end Monks who can STILL tank just as well as they did before.<br />
<br />
2) Nerfing or &quot; changing &quot; a class does not make you better.<br />
<br />
Now to the counterpoints<br />
<br />
 By your rationale that because you have a lower ac then you should have higher mitigation, lets have druid tanks, and enchanters, mages and wizards!! Since they are a lower ac class they should be able to mitigate more than us metal wearing classes <br />
<br />
Nope, never said that. Wouldn't be &quot; balanced &quot; (to use your words) and they aren't melee classes.  Feel free to interject sarcasm posing as truth again.<br />
<br />
 Since Velious onward, the gear choices for monks in the ac department have GREATLY improved <br />
<br />
And that's a BAD thing why? Why should a class which is barely the number 1 melee damage dealer have the survivability of David Duke at a Nation of Islam meeting?<br />
<br />
Using your &quot; logic &quot; Warriors weapons choices have incredibly improved as well - so where is the balance for that?<br />
<br />
The silence is deafening......<br />
<br />
 Barbed dragonscale boots, spirit wracked cord, phase spider carapeice are some examples of nice ac items that you dont need a end-level guild to get, so the argument that only the uber monks are still okay is moot in my eyes.  <br />
<br />
You obviously have ZERO clue concerning Monk gear. If you think that those items are worn by top end Monks, please unplug from the fantasy machine. * I * wear Barbed Dragonscale. SO I KNOW they're no longer Uber. (If they ever were)<br />
<br />
 If you're still wearing wu's armor the blame for you sucking is not the nerf's fualt its the fact that you haven't gotten off your ass in search of improvements. <br />
<br />
Ahh way to hide the meat of your argument.<br />
<br />
Let's see....I'm in a POST-NTOV guild , so I rule. You are wearing Wu's so you do NOT rule. Fek all that your choices are friggin limited - I'm in a POST-NTOV Guild and I fekkign rule. You fekking n00bs with your Jasarth and Totemic - we PWN this zone. I wouldn't be caught dead wearing those Jaundiced arms you so proudly buff with cuz I'm in a POST-NTOV guild.<br />
<br />
Think I'm exagerating?<br />
<br />
 The fact that a leather class in a non-raiding guild can easily beat the ac of a chain class in a raiding guild should at least say something to you <br />
<br />
It  tells me your an elitist wanna-be. Never confuse the fact that you can have 1476 AC and that means JACK and SQUAT to this argument.<br />
<br />
 Why should an 1100 ac leather class tank just as effectively as a 1300 ac plate class? They shouldn't <br />
<br />
PROVE THEY DO. Go worship like a good fan boy at the alter of furor and post some logs. Guess what? THERE AREN'T ANY. Because it's NOT true.<br />
<br />
Why?<br />
<br />
One word - Defensive.<br />
<br />
So yeah - do I as a level  61  Monk fighting blue Frogs in Sebilis get hit about the same as a level 55 Warrior with 1200 AC? From my experience - yes. <br />
<br />
But I'll tell you what - when it comes to anything that is raid or better  - I watch my aggro like late night Cinemax. Cuz while Said 1200 AC Ogre tank can take a Flurry or Enrage - I can't. <br />
<br />
  Heh I guess I'm bit irritated at being told to s.t.f.u by a monk who came to MY class message boards, <br />
<br />
Hey sparky - read my fekking signature. Prove me wrong by telling me you've played a Monk to 52, like I've played a Shaman.<br />
<br />
Oh and it's S.T.F.U.  You need to put periods in between the letters.<br />

It just didn't seem right that I always had ac of at least 100pts higher (usually closer to 200) than the plate wearers. Imo, monk soloing wasn't a problem but it did show how they were overpowered compared to the other melees. <br />
<br />
I do think the nerf went way too far, at least for the lvl 55+ non-uber monks I group with. The really high end monks don't seem to have a problem though. A monk really should tank better than a ranger, all chain vs. leather arguements aside, if  for no other reason than balance.</div></div><hr />

However this thread is pointless. Everything SoE has said indicates they are more or less happy with the outcome of this nerf. There is no point in stirring up other class boards, many of whom have no love for monks to start with, on an issue SoE considers to be closed.<br />

Well calling me stupid in your first remark, doesn't support this.  If you want to whine and flame take it to your own classes boards.<br />
<br />
As for picking apart your argument..<br />
<br />
1) Comparing shaman mitigation to monk mitigation is just stupid <br />
<br />
No its not.   Hence where the removal of the bonus first came into play.  Comparing mitigation by the classes of armor is exactly what SOE is, and in my opinion SHOULD be doing.<br />
<br />
Quote from SOE:<br />
<br />
What we are primarily striving for is maintaining the defensive order of the Plate classes being able to take the most punishment, followed by the Chain classes and Monks. <br />
<br />
Next point:<br />
<br />
<br />
2) Saying monks were never intended to tank is also, just stupid.  <br />
<br />
Once again I'll refer to SOE, since it appears you didn't take the time to read and understand what they were saying when they removed your bonuses:<br />
<br />
SOE says:<br />
<br />
* Monk Defense. Finally, the issue of defensive ability needs to be addressed with respect to Monks. Monks in EverQuest were originally intended to be a class with excellent offensive potential, both with and without equipment. This ability came at the expense of having only passable defensive abilities, partially in the form of an extremely small, restrictive selection of equipment from which to choose.  <br />
<br />
Notice where it said at the &quot;expense of having only passable defensive abilities?  I for sure did.  So no you were not intented to be tanks.<br />
<br />
You obviously have ZERO clue concerning Monk gear. If you think that those items are worn by top end Monks, please unplug from the fantasy machine. * I * wear Barbed Dragonscale. SO I KNOW they're no longer Uber. (If they ever were)  <br />
<br />
You obviously have ZERO ability to read, I never once claimed that this gear was what top end monks wear.  I said its easily obtainable and even monks in non raiding guilds can obtain nice ac gear. <br />
<br />
 It tells me your an elitist wanna-be. Never confuse the fact that you can have 1476 AC and that means JACK and SQUAT to this argument PROVE THEY DO. Go worship like a good fan boy at the alter of furor and post some logs. Guess what? THERE AREN'T ANY. Because it's NOT true <br />
<br />
It's not elitist the fact that I play the game differently than you that my gear should be better.  Its common sense. I raid 6-8 hours a day for my guild, the time I  have invested should equal the quality of gear choices that I have available to me.  I've played the game for over 2 years, and yes I've played a monk, pure melee just bore the crap out of me.<br />
<br />
You're missing the point entirely.  So I'll say it in caps.<br />
<br />
YOU WERE GIVEN BONUSES TO MAKE UP FOR LACK IN GEAR CHOICES.  THEN YOU GOT THE GEAR AND THE BONUSES WERE NO LONGER NEEDED.  <br />
<br />
<br />
The bonuses were given back in the old world days and kunark, Not velious plus.  There are several options that a monk in even a non-raiding guild can have that are MUCH higher in ac than the gear that was available when these bonuses were set in place.  We're talking about 2 ac boots and 6 ac tunics at this time.  Not 19 ac boots and 26 ac tunics like I pointed out in my examples.<br />
<br />
I'm not even going to justify the warrior comment with a remark since that is just stupid and off-topic.<br />
<br />
So you have a shaman who's 52?  Want a cookie?  This forum is for shaman issues, not monk whining.</div></div><hr />

Hi. My main is a rogue.. and solo'ing past 20 was pretty much just suicide... unless you were some uber twink...<br />

then at 44, I was able to solo the 1st 3 dogs in Sol B, or the 2 around window room, as long as a shaman didn't pop.<br />

No solo-ability with non-twink rogues. I did poisons and all they did was waste my money, the poisons take a huge ass ammount of money to make, before you can even get a skill good enough for a usefull poison, and then you have to carry around a ton of potions, cause they don't stack.<br />
<br />
My guess is warriors can't solo very well either unless twinked with regen/haste.<br />

This whole discussion is useless. OF COURSE a monk thinks he is destined to tank as well as a warrior because he always could. The reality that he is a damage dealer and no tank doesnt matter. <br />
<br />
But please, kind monks, could you live out your delusions on your own boards?<br />

This board is more for us Shaman that want to heal as good as a cleric because we are a priest class. For balancing reasons Clerics have to be able to outheal us because we bring other things to the group as well.

You get my support when your Damage Dealing abilities are nerfed. You get my support when your pulling abilities are nerfed (like Landragorons idea, increased damage avoidance from the back). You dont get my support for being greedy, just as I wouldnt get your support for wanting to nuke as hard as a wizard or healing as efficient as a cleric.<br />

Not in a NToV capable guild, so I'm stuck with whatever I can save up and buy. Weapons can get a bit better but nothing earth shattering.<br />
<br />
Self buffed I come in around 1120AC and 2850hp. 71% haste, a 37/36 2hb and around 1200atk. Also have a Fungi and such.<br />
<br />
Solo against mobs in Velks I pull in around 75dps. That's really not a lot. I lost ~40-60% of my life per fight toe-to-toe (little over a minute). Warriors/Rogues out solo me handily. Yay for slow procs.<br />
<br />
An Alpha'd 61 pet (seen is parsed at 50+ dps) and epic dot can sometimes KS me. Any other pet class's 60+ pet easily KSes me when ever it feels like it. What's more, pets = unlimited sustained damage... just like me.<br />
<br />
My shortest LFG time in PoP is 3 hours. Few days of that and you'll hurl yourself off something to be back to 60 too.<br />
<br />
I can no longer solo effectively (1.5 to 2 hours for a yellow of AA) and can no longer find groups. The only invites I ever get are &quot;Want to get flagged?&quot; for PoJ trials and the odd &quot;Can you pull this?&quot; stuff.<br />
<br />
If I didn't pull so much for my guild I'd quit and make a druid.<br />
<br />
If anyone deserves a nerf it's Shaman. You tank better than most melee. You have the 2nd most powerful spell in the game (right after charm). Your pet is buggy to hell in that you can almost triple it's DPS by giving it weapons. Single highest mana regeneration of any class in the game coupled with the highest DPS dots. You're guaranteed uberness with a single level 51 spell that you buy from a store. It's not Torpor/Malo that makes you uber... it's Tugurs, everything else just makes the cake that much sweeter.<br />
<br />
And for roleplay reason... why shouldn't a monk tank better than a plate class? Don't you people read or watch TV? Haven't you seen it happen time and time again when BigGuy01 picks a fight with KungFuMaster03 and gets beaten to a pulp? Your typical Wudan/Shaolin/whatever monk moves faster, hits harder, dodges everything and is generally the peak of physical performance in every possible way. Where's my innate Run3? Why can't I jump higher? Where's my innate increased haste cap? Go watch &quot;Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon&quot; or something and then tell me those guys couldn't beat up Bob the uber tank.<br />
<br />
Me losing 30% of my mitigation is like you having slow capped at 50% ala Plane of Storms... and we all know how you loved that. &quot;Oh no! Now BSTs/Enchanters can all slow as good as me!&quot; Welcome to my world... except I share it with BSTs, Rangers, Rogues, Warriors, Mages, Wizards, Druids, Necromancers and even the odd Enchanter.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Drysst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">I play a lvl 39 shaman with my girlfriend who is a 39 iksar monk. With the change our duo has survived but just barely. We were doing very well before they nerfed monks but now i find myself dead alot! we dont have time to get a guild or alot of times even group. We thought that the monk /shammy combo would be the answer and it was until the nerf. Monks arent broken as far as a class goes but i do think that the little guy is the only one suffering.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">I've been avoiding touching this thread because personally I think the monk nerf was the most laughably overblown joke going, a monk wielding a tunare snare stick pre nerf was an obscenely good tank, far more so than any warrior/knight I've seen.  The difference now in my eyes is that said monk tank suffers from streakier mitigation when the avoidance doesnt kick in.   Add in the fact that pop stuff hits like a freight train compared to stuff you'd typically monk/sham duo before hand and yes, monks are going to look like the suck, before you carry on crying, look at a warrior/knight tanking the same mob, and watch how they get eaten alive too.  The majority of the monks in our guild whinged about this nerf for all of a week or 2, tbh I don't think anyone of them really seems to care about it now.  And no not all of them are kitted out in North stuff.<br />
<br />
An Alpha'd 61 pet (seen is parsed at 50+ dps) and epic dot can sometimes KS me.<br />
<br />
Damn, I distinctly remember ~40dps being the norm, epic dot is definately not 35dps alone over a minute.<br />
<br />
Any other pet class's 60+ pet easily KSes me when ever it feels like it. What's more, pets = unlimited sustained damage... just like me.<br />
<br />
Cool, I'll ask Jibantik to pull next time I'm xping and save the monk's spot for a rogue instead.<br />
<br />
My shortest LFG time in PoP is 3 hours. Few days of that and you'll hurl yourself off something to be back to 60 too.<br />
<br />
Damn, I've seen my GM (Nicely equiped ranger, highly AA'd am3/primal bow etc) go lfg for 4 hours plus and as long as the mobs are not stuck in a wall, he puts out more sustained dps than any similarly equiped rogue/wizard could ever dream of, I've gone LFG for long periods, heck, one of the main reasons I stopped taking my warrior seriously was because unless I delved in KC, I was lfg for hours without fail unless some guildies snapped me up, unless your an ench/cleric thats simply the way it is, its not because of your class, its because theres too many of your class about, especially so with warriors, it happens, deal with it.<br />
<br />
I can no longer solo effectively (1.5 to 2 hours for a yellow of AA) and can no longer find groups.<br />
<br />
You know my most frequent xp group consists of Warrior/warrior/bard/sham/necro/cleric, we don't stick by this because we are uber dps/ungodly powerful orwhatever because we are not, we group up like so because we are friends, we would probably still do so if we were 6 bsts, get regular groups going with your friends, it makes xping so much more enjoyable.<br />
<br />
The only invites I ever get are &quot;Want to get flagged?&quot; for PoJ trials and the odd &quot;Can you pull this?&quot; stuff.<br />
<br />
Are you flagged for pov/pos?  If I'm not misreading your post and you are indead 60, it sounds like you are not.  Get flagged already.<br />
<br />
If anyone deserves a nerf it's Shaman.<br />
<br />
Hi slow mitigation/large volume of immune mobs/junk pop spell line up.  I'm choaking on a big slice of nerf pie already thanks =)<br />
<br />
You tank better than most melee.<br />
<br />
That statement is such dross its almost funny, the only REAL advantage I have over another melee is that I can guarantee I'm not going to die to enrage =P  Otherwise, any similarly equiped/AA'd melee tanks better than a shaman, end of story, the only reason we appear to tank good is because of Torpor.<br />
<br />
You have the 2nd most powerful spell in the game<br />
<br />
Until I see a 'your target is immune to changes in its health' spell, I think I'll quite safely say that CH is by far the most powerful spell in the game thx.<br />
<br />
Your pet is buggy to hell in that you can almost triple it's DPS by giving it weapons.[quote]<br />
<br />
You are kidding me right?  parse your dps against a mob, then parse your dps against an identical mob whilst holding a shield, did your dps drop to 1/3rd of what it was previously?  No, get a clue on how dual wield works, its about a 30% to 40% dps increase unless the owner is prepared to splash out on decent proccing weapons.<br />
<br />
[quote]Single highest mana regeneration of any class in the game coupled with the highest DPS dots.<br />
<br />
Suddenly I feel comfortable knowing that cann4 is the uberest mana regen going, now if only I could find time to endlessly cast it in between practically chaincasting junk heals.  Yes we are ahead, but unless there is downtime, we are not as far ahead as many think.<br />
<br />
You're guaranteed uberness with a single level 51 spell<br />
<br />
I'll remember to use that as a retort next time another stealth immune to slow flagged mob beats me into the ground.  'Ye shall not slay me, for I am guaranteed uber!'<br />
<br />
And for roleplay reason... why shouldn't a monk tank better than a plate class?<br />
<br />
This isnt a budget far easten action flick, this is EQ, wake up and smell the coffee.  Just think for a moment as to what the point of the warrior class is, if you want to take hits better than anyone else, reroll a warrior.<br />
<br />
Me losing 30% of my mitigation is like you having slow capped at 50% ala Plane of Storms...<br />
<br />
Sorry, I guess I was mistaken when I thought the warriors were listed as being the ultimate pure tank, monks are guaranteed DPS, monks are fantastic pullers, you see plenty of immune to random_nuke_or_dot_type01 mobs, I'm yet to see an immune to non situational melee mob that xp groups fight.<br />
<br />
In closing, get your tail out of velks already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Temuchin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">This whole discussion is useless. OF COURSE a monk thinks he is destined to tank as well as a warrior because he always could. The reality that he is a damage dealer and no tank doesnt matter. <br />
<br />
 Repeat after me: Warriors are Tanks, Monks are Damage Dealers <br />
<br />
the sheer ignorance and simplicity<br />
<br />
on principle this is wrong... since beta (which I was in), early launch (where I had a 50 monk by late summer of 99) and through a 60 monk and 60 shaman on druzzil in 01 and now a new shaman/sk combo on bertox, this has never been a full or accurate breakdown.<br />
<br />
monks have always been tanks, in fact before crafted and warrior enhancements of which you are most likely only dimly aware (if that) monks were BETTER tanks than warriors... just a  DIFFERENT -- avoidance-- type of tank<br />
<br />
your blanket assertion about tanks and damage dealers is clearly based on nothing more than some simpleton and vague view of the classes from the distance of never having played or had actual experience<br />
<br />
frankly, that adds nothing to the discussion, sorry to be blunt.  it's better off if you hold your tongue because broad stroke assertions (never mind innacurate) are too general to do any good in a thread like this<br />
<br />
fact of the matter is, even if the classes were singularly redefined after 3+ years of gaming and testing to be &quot;warriors are tanks&quot; and &quot;monks damage dealers&quot;  it's destructive to the structure of the classes to LESSEN monk tank ability and at the same time LESSEN base monk damage dealing ability and also INCREASE the DPS of pure tanks and tank melees through easy to obtain and TWINKABLE drops<br />
<br />
coming and going you're wrong<br />
<br />
look I say this on all the boards whose classes i have played and maxed... YOUR OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE DOES NOT DEFINE THE GAME OR YOUR CLASS.  assume that other people know a little something.  when the best monks on several servers up and quit over a change like this, there are reasons.  these are people who love their characters as much as you<br />
<br />
to come and dispute basic facts with broadminded generalizations just makes you look obstinate and worse an ignoramus</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">TYPING IN CAPS MAKES ME RIGHT!! SO I WILL TYPE IN ALL CAPS!! THAT WILL MAKE ME WIN THIS ARGUMENT!!<br />
<br />
MONKS WERE FIXED NOT NERFED. SEE ALL CAPS I AM RIGHT, YOU ARE WRONG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Enkebesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Bzzt, wrong Temuchin!<br />
<br />
As you are listing your fabulous credentials, beside my Shaman (arguably the only character I really care about) I have both a Warrior and a Monk. I just dont care for them enough to lurk the message boards for those classes. In fact all my alts beside my Shaman are Tanks or Hybrids, because I dont like to play Robe Casters and other priest classes.<br />
<br />
And there is a difference between assumed roles (by the playerbase) and intended roles (by Verant). Especially somebody who was in beta should have realized that. There is nothing like the right to do something because you always did it!<br />
<br />
&quot;My Shaman had Charm in Beta, so by right I should be able to Charm mobs, because it was intended to be so!&quot; Is that the argument you want to base your standpoint on?<br />
<br />
Your own personal experience does not matter as well, you know? Not one iota more than mine! What matters is what SOE does to the classes and how they reason it. From what the developers said after the Monk corrections (or Monk nerfs if you so please) is they didnt intend Monks to tank that good.<br />
<br />
You can write rants 10 pages long on every board you know, that doesnt change the fact that the BLOODY DEVELOPERS OF THIS GAME said monks are not meant as tanks. From this point on your past perception is worth NOTHING AT ALL (see, I can press Caps Lock as well :)).<br />
<br />
Monks are not meant to be tanks. Monks are meant to be able to survive pulling and then deal damage. If you dont believe me, believe what Verant (or Sony) says.<br />
<br />
This is about opinions. The problem is that my opinion is the same opinion the creators of the game have on this case, and your opinion, as valid as it may sound to you, is a ghetto opinion.<br />
<br />
The monks that quit their character never played monks as they were intended and now cant adapt. Great BOOOH! If I would have quit my Shaman every time his role in the game changed, I would not waste my time on Everquest anymore. You played a Shaman from Level 1 to Level 60. Tell me with a straight face he plays the same over 60 levels and from beta to now.<br />
<br />
Because a topic does concern you doesnt make your opinion right by default. And attacking other people doesnt give more credibility to your cause either.<br />
<br />
If the changes make it impossible for Monks to pull, there is something wrong and something needs to be changed. Present your ideas to SOE how they can reenable you to do pulls without  <br />
enhancing your tankability beyond that of plate tanks.<br />
<br />
If your damage is too low to compete with other damage dealers, bring that issue up with the developers.<br />
<br />
I dont see how your &quot;We want to tank, we must be able to tank, we were always destined to tank&quot; stance helps you, neither do I see how attacking me helps you either. If this statement adds nothing to your discussion, Im terribly sorry for you. If the truth hurts you that much, maybe you should sit in a corner, cover your ears and begin to rock slightly while you humm in a low voice or pronounce &quot; Nanana, I dont hear you. Nanana, I cant hear you!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">The change to the tanking abilities that monk had was only needed for the game.<br />
Maybe a lot of monks had to adapt to it but that is all.<br />
<br />
PS Aint the monk class the fine set of individuals that got the AA regen for the iksar/troll nerfed with that nice whining that the human monks did? (no love for you here if you are wondering)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">I started this thread.<br />
<br />
I am a shaman.<br />
<br />
I posted this because, with my monk alt, I saw how SoE hobbled the monk class.  Monks have been great partners for shaman for the last three years.  I thought maybe enough time had passed since the nerf for us all to really comprehend it.  I only posted it here. <br />
<br />
In a nutshell, monks lost options of play.  They lost variety.  The class collasped into simply providing sub-rogue DPS in a group while a plate class tanks.  That means if you want do anything other than trade skills, you need a tank and a healer.<br />
<br />
Before you respond, please think about what it would feel like if your shaman suddenly lost slow and heal.  Sure, you could do DoT's or DD's in a group.  I bet you would freak if someone told you to quit whining and just deal with it.<br />
<br />
No, I'm not asking for shaman to get nerfed.  I don't want anyone to get nerfed.  Yes, I know about slow mitigation in PoP and it sucks.  I resent every single mob flagged unslowable since Verant invented that little &quot;feature&quot; in Fall of 2001.  <br />
<br />
All I wanted, much like the paladin who came here and drummed up support for Slay Undead, was for my brother and sister shaman to agree that nerfing another class to it's very foundation is kinda rotten.<br />
<br />
It didn't work out.<br />
<br />
An honestly non-sarcastic 'Happy Holidays' to all of you.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">I created a monk,  gave him nice gear, and played him up to level 54.  He got smaked hard with the Nurf bat and I just gave all my equipment away and left EQ.  I could no longer solo and that was the prime reason I had created a monk.  It may not be how SOE wanted a monk to be played but that is how I like to play.<br />
<br />
Now I am very happy to be back to playing my shaman who I solo almost all the time.  The dear friend I had given my equipment to gave me back the bulk of it and my shaman is now in reasonbly good shape and my monk is all but naked.<br />
<br />
My expectation when I created a monk was that I would be able to solo if I worked hard on gear / quests / skills and it was true.  When SOE Nurfed ac mitigation,  they took away all the work I had put into my monk and that was very painfull.   Overall,  the game may benifit from enforcing relative tanking ability between the mele classes but any such balancing that fundamentaly changes the way a class can be played is going to banish a lot of people who got kicked in the nads.<br />
<br />
I solo my shaman all the time, and I do it with tanking for my pet / high ac / and a big 2hb hammer.  ( omg I want a JBB again ).   This is the way I like to play and I picked my race / equipment / and aaxp skills to fit my play style.  Lots of people have said that shaman should be nurfed because some uber shamans can solo high end mobs.  If SOE Nurfs Shamans in such a way that it where to not only make it much harder to solo glory mobs, but also forced the rest of the shamans in Norath to root rot or pet kite,  then shamans would understand what monks are experiencing now.<br />

Merry Christmas *burp*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">I'm not on a campaign to nerf Shaman or anything. I think you're fine exactly where you are. Classes just shouldn't be nerfed, but if you don't think you're slightly ahead of the curve you're deluding yourself. I was just trying to defend &quot;Monks totally deserved to be nerfed!&quot; which was spewing out of everyone.<br />
<br />
I am flagged. Been there. Done that. Sac'd back to 60 so I actually have something to do. 3 hours is my shortest LFG time. My longest was 2 days without a group. I couldn't even find a guild group. How many of you have ever had to wait 3 hours for a group in your entire lives? How many of you could just wander around for 2 days with absolutely nothing to do (yay for the gamecube)? That uber Ranger should've just up and gone to Tier1 for a while to solo stuff. At least it's something to do. Come back in an hour and see if there's a group. If I can't find one I may aswell log off. I don't play in prime-time US either so my group numbers are even more limited. I've literally heard people say &quot;I group with monks because I feel bad for them.&quot;<br />
<br />
I have personally seen a 61 Alpha'd pet pull sustained 50dps against stuff in PoJ (which is a nice little solo spot for low 60's). At the same time my monk can pull around 70dps (often low 60s). I seriously doubt the quadding effect is &quot;working as intended&quot; and not everyone knows about it. Almost all the pets I see are &quot;biting.&quot; If the Mages/Necros/BSTs catch wind in any sort of big fashion it'll probably be toyed with though... which is a pity.<br />
<br />
I like my Monk, but she's just not good for anything &quot;on the fly&quot; like finding an exp group anymore. Gimme some more static spawns or something. If my uber class defining ability is FD, let me use it for something other than raid pulling and CRing (which doesn't happen anymore).<br />
<br />
I don't want to tank. I've never cared for it. My job is the tank the mob for about 5-10 seconds while it goes from PointA to PointB. However, if they're going to make me tank like a Rogue I want to be doing more damage than a Warrior. I never realised I had to have NToV gear to get an exp group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Enkebesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">I always was under the impression Monkdamage is the best together with Roguedamage. <br />
<br />
If thats not the case, there really has to be some adjustments.<br />
<br />
70dps (in PoP) really is not that good. The parsed damage outputs for PoS last week for our group were:<br />
<br />
Rogue 107 to 124dps<br />
Ranger 62 to 103dps<br />
Shadowknight 42 to 62dps<br />
Shm and Enc Pet: 30 to 40dps<br />
<br />
With single-group attainable gear, so no NtoV weapons. But no Primal Avatar either, which you seem to be needing for 50dps Pets (apart from carrying around weapons all the time, which gets annoying).<br />
<br />
So, if Monks dont fall between Rangers and Rogues (which I always thought they did), there really is a problem. And, of course, they should survive pulls.<br />
<br />
But thats what I meant. You should be targetting for Rogue/Ranger dps if you dont have it already, which is something Verant would likely grant you if proven its no longer the case.</div></div><hr />
