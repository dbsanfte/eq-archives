<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>MadWarper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This all started a last week while playing my monk in HK...<br />
I was in an ok group, but the cleric, whom I shall refer to as Mr. Happypants, apparently didnt like to buff.<br />
We constantly asked for mana checks, but Mr Happypants gave none.<br />
Our leader disbanded Mr. Happypants, when another cleric popped up LFG.<br />
Mr. Happypants sent me a tell asking why he got the boot, I sided with the the groups leader and told him he was not responsive and would not buff.<br />
<br />
Mr. Happypants took this as an insult to his/her ego and decided to try to blacklist my monk from HK groups.<br />
<br />
Last night, I logged on as my monk.<br />
Shouted LFG a few times, got nothing.<br />
Saw Mr. Happypants was in the zone, when WR's train ran through the bank area (he was in the WR).<br />
A random high lvl Paly was killing guards made a comment that he was shocked that Mr. Happypants could run, after all Mr. Happypants likes to loot more than his/her share.<br />
<br />
Any ways, back to my revenge...<br />
Seeing he was in the zone, I knew I wouldnt have a chance to find a group, so I logged on as my equal lvl SK.<br />
Shout LFG, shout back &quot;Come to WR&quot;<br />
I get down there, enter group chat, first thing I saw: &quot;We shoulda gotten that monk&quot;<br />
I ask what they spoke of, playing stupid of course (something I do quite well)<br />
They told me they chose a cleric over the monk and the cleric said not to get the monk.<br />
The cleric turned out to be a 5 star arse, and they blacklisted him.<br />
I asked them if the cleric was Mr. Happypants, wouldn't you know it, it was Mr. Happypants!<br />
I asked the group if they wanted the monk, they said yes.<br />
I told them that they could eigther have the monk or the SK, they chose both.<br />
Then I laid the bombshell, I was both =P<br />
<br />
Could revenge be any sweeter?<br />
<br />
The moral of the story is.... Dont be a Mr. Happypants!<br />

&quot;The only thing a Ranger knows more about than where he is going, is how he is going to get there.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Siriath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Talking about something along those lines. I was helping a friend of mine (Shaman) with Black Dire in Castle Mistmoore. We have Me, Him, A Druid, Rogue, Cleric, and Paladin. Paladin was tanking, and low and behold, I was puller. I pull Black Dire, other wolves miraculously don't aggro, at first, and Black Dire comes solo. We are fighting him, next thing I know, the Druid is dead. Never got hit by Black Dire. <br />
<br />
The Shaman, not knowing the wolves were still up there because he never hunted in Mistmoore, went too far up the Hill, and aggroed them. So, Fabulous, Druid down, I take the aggro of the wolves, saving the Cleric by pulling something out of my ass, I admit it. Next thing, I'm down froim the four wolves that I cannot fear kite because half the mobs in MM Castle can con blue. <br />
<br />
Paladin next goes LD and dies while LD. All in all being a bad day. Shaman dies, and then Cleric. Rogue lives and kills Black Dire.  Shaman loots the pelt. Then blames me for the deaths.<br />
<br />
Now, The Paladin and I are the only members of this group NOT in his Guild. Paladin comes back and says &quot;No, only Black Dire was following him in the beginning.&quot; Paladin is both of our friends, and I met this Shaman through him.<br />
<br />
Cleric goes, &quot;No, he had a single pull. Wolves came from nowhere.&quot;<br />
<br />
Druid goes, &quot;No, you pulled them (Meaning Shaman) when you went up the hill.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rogue says &quot;Druid is right man. No need to blame anyone either. That's rude.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cleric now offers a free rez. I decline, saying that now that this is over, there is nothing for me with them and basically they can tell I am pissed.<br />
<br />
I get a tell from the Shaman a few days later, &quot;My guild convinced me it was wrong to blame you man. And they are making me apologize.&quot;<br />
<br />
I send back a tell, &quot;If they are forcing you to apologize, you don't mean it anyway. I am keeping you on my friends list though.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shaman, 'Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
Me, &quot;So I know where to avoid. Tell the others I'm not pissed at them. They had nothing to do with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then I sent them tells. Now, the Shaman wasn't deguilded, but they refuse to help him on the rest of his epic. He's screwed because he can't get into a fear raid. Heh.</div></div><hr />
