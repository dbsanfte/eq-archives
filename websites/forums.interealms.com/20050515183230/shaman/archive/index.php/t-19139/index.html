Duh....  Unless there is some nifty new /assist thing coming our for the raiders this seems pretty useless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
EXACTLY what I was thinking.<br />
<br />
What if we had to buy, say, the targeting circle under our characters' feet with AA?  Or the snazzy new Tradeskill window?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>FloppyDisks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Is there a limit to how many group members are required before you can switch on LeaderShip AA pool?<br />

What I mean is if I'm duoing up in Hate with my brother can I turn leadership AA on if it is just two of us?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">/agree Gloriana.<br />
<br />
Neat features, but I don't look forward to the politics of who gets to lead.  Especially if there are non-administrative abilities like mana and health regen, +offense etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">As someone who leads raids 99% of the time I play EQ, this is the most retarted thing I have seen yet.  <br />
<br />
Aside from the obvious problem of arguing over who gets to lead, I have to give up my exp so I can lead monkeys around better?  I already give up enough of my play time to lead raids.  <br />
<br />
Delgate main assist = my boot in someones rear end, works just fine.</div></div><hr />

     hey i have ablity x/y/z let me be leader,<br />
<br />
party member2,<br />
   awww but i wanted to work on this leader ablity and if we make you leader i won't get any points</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Mitrian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I would have to assume that when a leader obtains these abilities, they would then apply to everyone in the raid/group.  In that scenario, at least in terms of guild raiding, I'd want to have the same raid leader at every raid, so he would be accumulating these abilities for his raid.<br />
<br />
It does kind of suck that the RL/GL would have to sacrifice AA exp in order to accumulate, though.  Thankfully a lot of us are at or near max AAs.<br />
<br />
I don't think these should be unpurchased abilities though.  Leadership skills aren't granted, they are earned.<br />
<br />
And last, we don't have a very good understanding of what these abilities actually grant, so it doesn't make sense to complain already.  From my perspective, they seem pretty promising.  I've always been an optomist, though.<br />

<br />
For example, instead of typing &quot;/delegatemainassist warrior_001&quot;, can't you just type &quot;/g warrior_001 is now main assist&quot;????</div></div><hr />

They'll probably nerf /gu and /rs to filter out anything refering to MA so you have to buy their stupid new skills  :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I am guessing the Main Assist thing will put a label over the MA or have him/her glow to make them easier to find or something.  I don't see how that's easier than the ole /tar [name] hotkey.<br />
<br />
If its going to cost exp, then that one guy in your guild that has maxxed his aa's will be the only one who wants to lead :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">This would be way way way way way better if *anyone* could delegate 20 percent of their xp into the pool and buy these abilities.<br />

Only 1 person in a group/raid can earn points at a time?  Retarded.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I know it doesn't seem like it now -- but not everyone is going to want to lead.  Not everyone is going to want a herd of cattle screaming at them for stuff.<br />
<br />
Also, who says you have to be the actual leader of the raid, not just leader in name only?  How it works in planetside if someone wants to accumulate CR (command rank.. leadership points) without actually dragging 10 strangers through a firefight is:  one guy takes the title of squad leader in the group, while the other one does the actual leading.  <br />
<br />
It's not a huge deal.  Sure eventually everyone is going to want their leadership abilities, but it's not like you can't rotate around group leader so everyone can get a shot.<br />
<br />
Also, if one guy is &quot;hogging&quot; the leadership points, everyone can leave the group and reform without him.  If it's in an LDON, then be the bigger man and let him have them.<br />
<br />
This is just a little bit over the top on the pessimism here.  I'm not saying &quot;give sony a chance&quot; by any stretch of the imagination.  You guys are just taking these worst-case scenarios, and acting like they are some insurmountably inescapable foregone conclusions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">This thing kinda had me wondering what it was all about. I figured it'd probably just end up being another leaderboard type thing, like the adventure points leaderboard or who's got the most flags, AA points, etc. Wont have anything to do really with who are good leaders, just who has the most time to play this game. I've been the leader of my guild for 4 years, and lead 90% of our raids so will they grandfather me a bunch of free points? Doubt it. From the looks of those things, I'm not sure I'll care either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Ya know, we better see a HUGE gain in raid exp or those raid leadership AA won't be getting any use for the next 3 years or so if it only takes 20% of your AA gained WHILE LEADING toward this pool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Grimdreg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">eq turning into planetside...where is my flying ship already  :(<br />
<br />
LOL thats the very first thing I thought when I read that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">This is gonna cause some major &quot;arguments&quot; if a person that has been getting leadership points for one guild decides to leave for another competing guild. Just what we need more hostility and mistrust. EQ is such a great game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">how they make the game easier and easier....  :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Tallanas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">This is just nuts... And I can't quite work it out.<br />
<br />
I think it will be good for raids, to have an official RL who actually brings some tangible benefit to a raid, other than just leadership.<br />
<br />
But for groups?? No, no, no! It just seems a way to make Ebayers less apt to kill your group... As group leader, I can now mark the target so the ebayed Wizard doesn't nuke the one the chanter just mezzed...<br />
<br />
Although I like the sound of Group Leader!<br />
<br />
&quot;Group Leader Tallanas reporting for duty, sir!!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Looking at the silver lining, at least now more people will want to form new groups, rather than sit on their asses LFG, which should make for less LFG waiting time for everyone else.  Of course, this still fails to resolve the problem of every group needing a slower (not really a problem for us), crowd control, and a CHer, and since these roles are limited to only one or two classes (shaman, beastlord or enchanter, bard or enchanter, cleric or druid) if none of that class happens to be on, everyone else has to sit around and wait.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Okuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I dont think this will be too bad.  The abilities seem to me like they're just tools for enhancing leadership ability.  Meaning if you frequently lead groups or raids, they would be nice for you to have as they will make your job just a little easier.  If youre a frequent follower, it will be easier to find groups with experienced leaders.  They wont have the kind of impact that AAs do.  Just making being a leader easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I don't think these should be unpurchased abilities though.  Leadership skills aren't granted, they are earned.<br />
<br />
<br />
The best leadership skills are learned.  We've all met plenty of 300AA characters who can't even lead a grp in BoT. :)  <br />
<br />
I agree with you though, if people want these abilities then they should pay for them...I *hope* that most people won't be bothered with them once the initial wow factor wears off.</div></div><hr />

pay 23 platinum or &quot;tribute points&quot; per 10 mins rocks ... hey if you stack its more ~ upwards to uhh maby 1-200 pp/ points i think?</div></div><hr />
