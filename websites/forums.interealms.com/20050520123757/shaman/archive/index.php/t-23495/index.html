apparently they dont like it when they get told whats wrong, especially if it is true. So no change there then.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Dunno Glori - sounds like dark waters run deep here.  They probably wanted a class correspondant &quot;more on board.&quot; (read: quiet and submissive and willing to promote the part line.)<br />

Oh Glori - <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just from reading his post, it seems he caused some kind of drama in July and knew the writing was on the wall.<br />
<br />
Whatever this website thing is may either be related or just what he is assuming to be the catalyst.<br />
<br />
I don't see the big deal. If he was given the opportunity to represent the class and was not interacting well with Brenlo and those guys why shouldn't they remove him? It's not a paid position, it's not a real job. It's an opportunity for a player to have greater access to SoE staff than the average player. It's not, in my mind, a position granted to enable someone to be rude or aggressive to them. If they want to see that they can just come here and randomly click on a post.<br />
<br />
From the post it doesn't look like they are removing the beserker class corr role, just replacing the person. As long as the underlying message gets onto the message boards SoE have setup to read the idea of class reps is a good one. If I was working at SoE and I started being &quot;attacked&quot; over a game I would probably do the same thing.<br />
<br />
So Bara Cuda, perhaps it isn't that Soe don't want to be told what is wrong, perhaps they just didn't like the way they were being told.<br />
Shrug.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seriously, Swampfunk seems an OK guy, but never really struck me as appropriate for a class correspondant.  He was persistant, and willing to call horsepucky, but correspondants shouldn't be long on drama and short on tact.<br />
<br />
Edit: There's also more to this than he's got posted.  It wasn't just over a web site.  Know how we hate it when somebody shows up here and says we don't need any of the stuff we've been asking for?  He did that more than once on the EQ Live boards.  He had a lot of valid points, but could hide them quite handily behind attitude.<br />
<br />
Look at Sudedor.  Even when he's ticked, he still posts clearly and with a minimum of drama.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">So Bara Cuda, perhaps it isn't that Soe don't want to be told what is wrong, perhaps they just didn't like the way they were being told.<br />

<br />
yes could be true, it unlikely we actually ever know exactly what happened. It could also be that the devs/pr own responces incited it, or that he was polite but they just didnt want someone quite so direct. (you can be polite and direct).  but it was them that chose him in the first place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I was under the impression that the correspondents were supposed to be keeping the dev team up to date with issues/problems/suggestions being discussed on the class boards. The were never supposed to be reps. But in many cases they have assumed an activist protagonist role, and I doubt that's what SoE had in mind. I think it was a good idea in concept, but human nature being what it is, was probably not going to work in the way they intended. I have no idea what the issues with this BER are, but from the tone of his post its pretty clear that he was heavily emotionally involved in the position, which is highly suggestive of a hardcore activist role.<br />
<br />
I thought the comment about being being fired on a friday to avoid an incident analogy was sort of odd, its not like the time of day or week makes any difference in an entirely on line relationship.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure why helping a friend with a web site would have been a problem, thats a little bizarre, unless he was supplying confidential information that he might have been privvy to by virtue of his contacts with SoE to the site.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Am I mad?<br />
I was at first, the first reaction was a nejerk reaction, I basically wanted to punch someone in their face. <br />
<br />
Well, at least he's playing the right class. Though, Enchanters like that are always fun :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">There was more to the Swampfunk thing than meets they eye . . . <br />
<br />
I usually agreed with his points, but rarely with his approach.  He is a lot like me . . . 5 or 6 years ago.<br />
<br />
He simply needs to learn how to say what needs saying.<br />
<br />
If your correspondent isn't an active, passionate member of the class, they shouldn't be a correspondent.  Swamp was well within his rights to sound off . . . he just went about it unwisely.</div></div><hr />

Thats why I fully support you Sudedor, I think you HAVE that passion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
slightly off track, but is it possible for you (sudedor) to do a post ever so often saying what you feedback to devs and what they replied? is that possible? or are you bound by soe not to share cetain things?  i just curious, i would like to know dev`s thinking on the class if they give that or anything to do with shaman class and how things going?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">My interaction is not directly with the Devs.  (Which is something I have been really trying to make happen but so far no dice)<br />
<br />
Basically, all we are allowed to do is bring things directly (a lot more directly than general public) to Brenlo and his folks who talk directly (I assume) to the Devs.<br />
<br />
The problem currently seems to be how the responses come back.  The Designers seem unwilling to discuss anything with regards to game design.  Oh, they'll listen, but they may or may not respond, they may or may not take your concerns into consideration.<br />
<br />
That to me is the biggest &quot;Breakdown in Communication&quot; currently in EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">That to me is the biggest &quot;Breakdown in Communication&quot; currently in EQ.<br />
<br />
Hammer meet nail.<br />
<br />
<br />
This right here i believe is the core issue of everything i currently have a problem with. The lack of interaction when we try so very hard to help this game be better is completely brushed aside. I know im not a heavy hitter in the math deparment, or i might not know every spell detail form levle 1 to 70, but i put a lot of time and effort into my ideas and some suck and some dont suck. I think about it at work, i allow it to take up space in my imagination so it can be turned around, upside down and solutions can come of it, cause i love this game. And needless to say there is many people like me and many that are even more passionate then me.<br />
<br />
To take our real life time and toss it away without so much as a reply as to why they dont like it is unforgivable in my eyes. I mean we spent months getting the shaman communication going and it was a tough batle since many of us have different ways to play a shaman, but we agreed on things, came together and offered well thought out plans and blueprints to make this a good class and to even help other classes be better and basicly the whole game better. We post it at SoE forums and its ignored only to have a few flaming posts of &quot; OMG SoE you hate us so much&quot; that were so stupid they should have been deleted, but yet they were replied too and attention was given to them. <br />
<br />
This company needs to address this issue if its going to survive, cause me personaly, i dont care if EQ2 is the most stunning game on the planet cause i would rather play a less developed and less pretty game that has interaction from the makers. It will be 10 tgimes as fun at EQ2 would be cause interaction with us will shape the game to how we wanna play and since we are the ones playing the game, its pretty important i think that we enjoy it.<br />
<br />
Obviously things cant always go our way, somethings people ask for would indeed break the game, but explain that to us, tell us how its wrong, cause even if it is wrong it can grow into something good sometimes. Force feeding us what you think is good is not ... well good.<br />
<br />
<br />
But falling on deaf ears am I.</div></div><hr />

You couldn't be more wrong.  It's an easy mistake to make considering what we see on the crucible today, but MANY shaman sent logs and links and summaries to SoE, to every known email, some of it was even requested by SoE, and they ignored it or have yet to impliment changes based on it.  Make no mistake, they have the facts.  They either cannot interpret the info that they see, have yet to figure out reasonable fixxes, or don't care.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">We can't fool ourselves thinking that SoE isn't changing the sham class because of lack of legit parses or information.  The dev's already know what the game is like, they just chose to think it's the vision.<br />
<br />
I offer this http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=rangerbalance&amp;message.id=8571#M8571<br />
<br />
A ranger complaining about an upgrade from one bow to another, and saying it's a .008% upgrade.  Zajeer kindly steps in and corrects this ranger.  From what i've seen in the past in relation to Zajeer, he tends to know his stuff, so this tells me the dev's are aware of what's actually in the game...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Budana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Tarthug,<br />
I'm not sure how I'm wrong?  I agree they have the facts and figures.  I also agree they have yet to use it.  The only thing they have done is gave us moderate upgrades to pacify us for another expansion, in the hope that they will fix some of our complaints.  This is a time proven method for SOE.  Go back to the release of PoP.  You will find a large amount of complaints about it for the first say 6 months.  Then you will notice a gradual acceptance from the forum of the PoP expansion.  Now take a look at the release of GoD.  You will find another 6 months or so of complaints about the GoD expansion.  Now look at the forums today.  You will find a large majority accepting the expansion.  What can a developer say though when someone has log's showing differences in dps, healing, and slow?  They say nothing and let the community calm down on there own making small changes were absolutely necessary.  This how I think SOE handles the logs and forums, again this is just my opinion and we all know what opinions are like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Tarthug, I think you and Budana were saying about the same thing.<br />
<br />
Whether through persuing message boards or REQUESTING info from the players themselves (this sorta makes me do a Tea'alc  eye brow raise (Character from Stargate SG-1 on Sci-Fi (Amanda Tapping PWNS)))<br />
they have access to the info.<br />
<br />
What they choose to DO with it is another matter entirely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Yup, my appologies Budana, I read:<br />

big difference, my misunderstanding.  I've been moved into an earlier time slot and hadn't finished my coffee when I read your post.  We pretty much said the same damned thing.  Note to self: coffee first, post later.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A sad day indeed when the dev's are afraid to interact with the players because they can no longer dodge their past incorrect statements.  One can only wonder why players might be annoyed with this brick wall.   :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Well said Budana.  Be careful though; logs and parses are not local to The Crucible, they are abundant throughout all class discussion boards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">personally i am now very dubivous of any product SOE has an hand in, the same sort of disregard of customers can now be seen in their star wars game, which bodes badly for any other game they do.<br />
EQ2 would have to be the most perfect, brilliant game in the world for me to be attracted to it, and from what i have read and seen so far , it most certainly isn`t, pretty sure,  but i just cant help having the feeling that they made this game to make their own lives easy (in that they try to remove things from eq one they had problems with, but not always to the improvement of gameplay), rather than for great gameplay, which isnt the way to go.<br />
<br />
and unless the spells change alot between now and release i think i will save my money for some other game, rather than this expansion.</div></div><hr />
