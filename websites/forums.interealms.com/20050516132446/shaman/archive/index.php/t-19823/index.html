<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Seems to me that our biggest complaint is that out Q upgrade is not enough. By this not being upgraded more then it is we become FAR less effective healers in GoD and higher end BoT. We simply cant keep up and get caught in Tnarg cycles.<br />
<br />
My solution.<br />
<br />
Critical AA for HoT's.<br />
<br />
Why not give us a AA that significantly increased the crit heal per tick. Im thinking just off the top of my head, 3 levels at 3/6/9 that give a 20/35/50% chance to land a crit heal on a tick. Make it available at 63/64/65. Granted this might not be the end all solution cause it would make our healing a lil unpredictable like the clerical HoT's but it would also give a boost to a existing preset amount of healing. From my understanding from talking to a cleric their HoT heals in random numers per tick. He was kinda bitching that ours are a set number and his HoT can heal real high then really low. So this will kinda give us a lil more stability then just copy and pasting one of the cleric spells into our spell book.<br />
<br />
Just a thought..</div></div><hr />

I have never heard that before.  How much do you trust that cleric?<br />
<br />
Anyways, I think another solution would be:<br />
<br />
1) Let healing AA work with quiescence (and breath of trushar), allowing both critical ticks and a constant 19% improval, OR add an AA that does these.  If you made it reasonably priced I would definately buy it.<br />
2) A new line of focus effects that work exactly like burning affliction, except for heals instead of dots.  We know they can do it.  (note:  this might be in the game and we just haven't found it yet)<br />
<br />
All I know is that we need a way to increase the magnitude of our heal over times.  As we are now, quiescence will always do 300/tick and there is nothing you can do to make it better.</div></div><hr />

1) i dont think it would be noticeable  (ie no crit msg)<br />
2) its called marrs gift  :p   but i know what you mean heh</div></div><hr />

Any reason the existing healing AA's shouldn't work w/ Q? I fail to see the justification for spending a ton of aa's to improve our one crappy fast heal.<br />

<br />
Nice idea though. If we can crit DoTs why not HoTs...? ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Heh, I had been thinking pretty much the same thing Litgruv; my only beef would be the Q effectively counts as a buff (24sec duration), I wouldn't want to lose the benefit of SCRM to gain 'healing aa' enabled Q ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I was thinking about this in an indirect way-- I was questioning why we got Fury of Magic Mastery instead of something like Critical Affliction Mastery.  I figured, wouldn't it be cool if instead of Fury of Magic Mastery, we got Critical Mastery?  It would be less improvement, but it would affect nukes, crits, and heals over time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, Cleric Heal Over Time Spells heal a set amount every tick, just the same as ours do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seriously though...<br />
<br />
I think something in this neighborhood is a great idea.  It would need to be fine tuned a bit, meaning I'm not sure a normal crit system is the best way to go about it, but something semi-constant healing increase would be great.<br />
<br />
I really like the idea of letting our healing aa effect Q.  I might actually buy them then (ok, I'd buy them in a heartbeat). <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Or... they could've just made Q+ 450/tick for 400 mana and we would've been happy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jormal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I really like this idea but as Jinheim suggested I really think it would make more sense for the AA and focus items we already have to include HoT spells. 358 + 1-20% per tick for Quiescense is certainly not going to be unbalancing and would move Breath of Trushar into the range of potentially actually being useful. I think I'll send a /feedback in on this one.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I've grouped with a cleric who's message read something like &quot;heal over time aa enhanced to 35xx over 6 tics&quot;.  Aside from an annoying message, they definately have some way to increase it.  But, I've not played a cleric enough to know for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>AtommWarbird</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I really like the general idea.  I would be even happier if it was &quot;class AA&quot; for us and no one else.  We *RELY* on our HoT's a lot more than the other priest classes and it would be nice to see us get a measurable increase in healing power from it.  Perhaps it could work like the DD Crits where at max level you get 2x the healing.<br />
<br />
Mobs duoing for 1K is nasty, but assuming you can get the mob slowed you have a change of getting it back with a crit or two.  It would certainly make our patch healing job much better.  I go OOM so fast with Tnarg's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">i do enjoy Breath of Trushar.  Sure, I wouldn't complain it being a higher heal overal, but it is seriously a noticeable upgrade from Q.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;We have been working hard on everyone's feedback to the latest GoD line of AAs and have made a few modifications:<br />
<br />
Clerics and druids can now purchase AAs that will increase the effect and even give a chance to crit their heal over time spells!  Since Druids don’t have a heal over time spell per se they are now going to get &quot;Karana's Kiss= 200 mana for 500 heal per tick with a duration of 4 1/2 minutes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Congratulations Clerics and Druids!<br />
<br />
Oh before we forget Shaman's Spirit Call is being looked into and we are making modifications.  There was a bug and the Pets were not supposed to have 250hp that was way overpowering, now shaman will be able to summon one HUGE snake that has 15hp and hits for 62s!<br />
<br />
Congratulations Shaman!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>kenton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Something like this would be great. Although most shaman would eventually call it a toy and not a usefull upgrade. It appears most the upset shaman are the ones who want competive blast heals, to regain their ability to be the only healer in top end 6 man content and meaningfull heals on raids.<br />
 <br />
If it crit'd too much it would be called overpowring for the heal vs mana, if it didn't crit enough people would complain it was useless because peoples life and death relied on the random number generator. Now I'd get it just because its cool, but it wouldn't address many of the concerns here in 100's of posts.<br />
<br />
A predicactable bigger HoT would be fitting for shaman as an aa or spell. Some kind of limited use spell to help us catch up on a resisted slow or just bigger hitting mobs. I'd prefer an aa because any such big HoT if implemented as a spell would likely end up with a big recast timer. We all know how we'd feel about yet another perma mem'd long recast spell.<br />
<br />
Hmm, maybe an aa with a 15 minute timer or whatever deemed balanced, that doubled or whatever our HoT's and blast heals for the duration its active? That way it could affect are admittedly sorry blast heal and our HoT's? Oh well just rambling stuck in 1017 land:), good idea in some kind of implementation. Sorry if this has been mentioned a thousand times.</div></div><hr />

Regards,<br />
<br />
No reason. I just made a logical leap on how SoE would implement it.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have never heard that before.  How much do you trust that cleric?<br />
<br />
Not alot. I barely know him. I really like the idea of a burning affliction type of this. But again, as a unguilded shaman with not alot of direct contact these days with people, if it was a aug or a item, i would be a lil disapointed cause i would have a heck of a time getting it. I guess that idea comes down to how well its implemented. I kinda like the AA approuch cause it puts it right intot he hands of anyone that can grind out 3/6/9  AA's. Again, i doubt SoE would just extend out exisiting AA to include HoT's. Its just too easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Given that crit nukes are generally stated to be a 7percent increase in damage, I would assume critical regen would offer similar percentage.  This would mean Q would heal an average 321 per tick and trushar 385.  While this is better than 300/360 per tick, I don't think its really going to stop the tnargs cycles.  How much would a heal over time have to heal to mitigate damage from a 1k double hitter with slow mitigation as well.  I do not think this will prevent the so-called tnargs cycles.  Nor would it really be what is needed to put shaman healing in balance.<br />
<br />
I am not sure that looking for AA's to fix any balance issues is the best course of action.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I still think we need a few things. <br />
<br />
1. Group based healing AA Based off Paragon/wood. But with the effect of + strikethrough/Mitagation/attack.<br />
<br />
2. A better Heal over time. 450 a tick 6 tick base duration.<br />
<br />
3. A stopgap Blast heal. 1700 Base <br />
<br />
Give us these and we would be viable healers again.<br />
<br />
The Crit heal on HoT is a logical upgrade and should have been in a long time ago. But oh well SoE doesnt listen. they don't care, and in some cases simple flat out are malicious in thier treatment of some people.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I know what wouldn't be overpowering--- giving us an AA that doubles our regen (blessing of replenishment) strength and duration...</div></div><hr />

No more MGB'able heals, especially manaless one. During the GoD Beta, a dev pretty much came and said just that.<br />
<br />
2. A better Heal over time. 450 a tick 6 tick base duration.<br />
They won't give us better HoT than clerics. <br />
<br />
3. A stopgap Blast heal. 1700 Base  <br />
And they certainly won't give us a fast heal as good as the Druid's. <br />
<br />
Yup, those would help. Hell... any single one of those would. But your suggetion are based on the premise that the developpers see us as Healer.<br />
<br />
They don't. As far as they're concerned, we're slowers with DOTs that also happen to have heals. We probably should count ourselves lucky they gave us some healer AAs. Though I have the sneaky suspicion they did it mosly not to have to think up something that would be shaman-specific.</div></div><hr />
