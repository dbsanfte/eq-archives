<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wytchone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Nothing fancy just a druid and I who wanted to do a 'duke it out'.  Both Time geared no other buffs but self buffs. I had just returned to the game and wanted to fight a foe of equal gear. In fact I believe I had a slight advantage in gear but the Druid really wanted to fight me.  Yes a fair fight you might call it.<br />
<br />
Both open with dispells.  Then I Malo, M. Decay, I land Blood  first cast..OMG!  Druid uses RC3 all debuffs and dot down.  After that it went down hill.  I was unable to land any of the Bane line (Why give us a Curse spell line if they are MR resisted?) In fact I was not able to land any of my dots after the first one landed.   The druid keep his dot line on me the entire fight. <br />
I used Bane, Blood and Pox.   Only One freaking dot landed the entire fight!<br />
<br />
Druid did the following and waxed the floor with me. Dispell, Dot, DD, heal any damage I did.  That's it.   I pet swarmed and I used Dog dog, was countered with Massive Damage shield aa...dead pets.<br />
<br />
Even debuffed I landed one in 8 Dots. We compared notes later so thats how I know the ratio, was a pure shame.<br />
<br />
I mention this because I used to hunt druids none stop before level 60.   Ranger and Druids always gave me some of the best battles and the most fun.  My how times change.  Rangers are not so bad since Archery nerf but 3k DD still hurt. I don't undersand the Archery nerf if you keep 3 to 5k DD in game (note thats with the caster 66% nerf).<br />
<br />
As you can tell the Druid won.  If I dropped the druid below 90% health I would be amazed.  Still it did take take him a bit todrop me since I could heal a lot of damage done to me.  In the end I was at zero mana the druid.... 75%.<br />
<br />
I know EQ is not designed for PVP but notice how it's like the end game for the shaman.  I had no burst DPS to speak of( Bane never landed), dog useless, DD useless,  spells rarely landed.  But hey, I took a pounding like a trooper.<br />
<br />
Fought a Enchanter who was not even EP geared.  I know this because I was asked why attack a 'lowly' enchanter with poor gear. This 'lowly' enchanter enraptured me and ran.   Still when I opened the fight (read I jumped her first) with Malo, then Blood and that was the end of battle.  She just mezzed me and left. Nothing I could do and I had a HUGE advantage in gear on this one. <br />
<br />
In short I could not kill anyone of equal gear and those few of lesser gear I found would just mez and leave.  :confused: <br />
<br />
Just ranting at it all, but it seems to me that  High Burst DPS and Melee with killer resists seem the way to go. Be is Pvp or end game play.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just seems wrong somehow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Druids can hand of ro you then pummel you into the ground with Summer's Flame. your only chance is to let them nuke themselves OOM while you counter the damage with trushar/tnarg's. once they're OOM annul the crap out of them and kill them with your epic DoT and poison nukes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wytchone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Epic dot is resisted now. Did not use to be and I could always count on it landing. Thats not the case now.  Even letting them Nuke themselves silly our mana/heal ratio I think would run me out of mana before he goes OOM.  Remeber both of us had mana saving gear.  Horse, FT15, Po9 (mana/hp regen)   Still its a suggestion I can try and let you know the results.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I am actually amazed that you landed 1 DoT. All damage spells I can usually land is the epic DoT and Tears of Saryrn. <br />
Your only mistake was not to dispell SotW. Of course that's only possible if the Druid isn't well prepared.<br />
<br />
Shamans are hands down the weakest class in dealing damage at the high end of the game. That includes both, PvP and PvE.<br />
<br />
Will we ever see a resist adjust for our DoTs?<br />
<br />
Imo the Curse line should receive a -50 resist adjust, the poison line a -100 and the Disease line a -300.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Epic dot is resisted now. Did not use to be and I could always count on it landing. Thats not the case now.<br />
<br />
The epic DoT will still land 50% of the time at ~400 MR.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Krenk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well duh from the Zeks. The resist changes of a year or two back slaughtered any ability for shaman in PvP. (And for ****'s sake stop trying to use magic based spells on people. Use lower level dots. Have cure poi/dis up, and use your damn HoTs. You still won't win, Druid nukes are faster. The ONLY chance you have is to run him out of mana. Seriously. That's your strength, time.)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">wytchone, there are a few things that needs to be said. I am from a red server, and I dont know anyone that wouldnt be caught dead without 2 instant clickies.   You have your SoW boots, buy the skele necklace, or do that seru earing quest.  your HoT is alot more mana efficient then a druids heal.  Dont understand how you can run out of mana before him.  <br />
<br />
 I also dont know why you even tried useing Bane, when it doesnt even land on regular mobs with no resist.   PoTime shaman vs PoTime druid = hours of being non productive.   I tried it already, only thing we can do for pvp is our DS potions and our procs from our weapons, but since druids have massive DS, all we can do is fool around nukeing each other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">In a duel a druid should be unable to kill you, esp with time gear. I canV in people face while pvping druids, unless I am really low hp theres not much to worry about from one.<br />

druid dots are magic based...pell them off yourself and make the druid cry.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh I have AoN just did not have it on Magelo.  I tried to land all spells. MR, PR and DR based.  My point is the Bane lines should be like a Curse and always land.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Wytchone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">druid dots are magic based...pell them off yourself and make the druid cry.<br />
<br />
Its not this dots that I killed me, those where gone as soon as they landed. It was his Nukes with the fact I could only land a single spell on him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Koridar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hey Welcome back Foolios. and BTW welcome to my life. Hand of ro, Hand of ro, DIE.   and laugh as you try to land a spell</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hmm had an hour duel with a druid once, mainly consisted of me healing myself since I could do very limited things to the druid. About the only things that you can try are Spirit Call, dispell,and velium strike, Spear of torment or tears of saryn. You can also maybe try VP but it likely won't land. I discovered at that time, rabid bear was a bad idea to use on a druid with their massive damage shield.<br />
Yeah pvp is in general messed up. I think to gain any kind of a  balance it would require maybe a -400 dr spell for pvp only. Even then all that would guarantee is at least having a root available by vp, being able to slow melees 40% and land dots by disease.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Wytchone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Well My main point is the Druid dot  landed with my resist and its MR based.  We get Bane line which was supposed to be a CURSE spells but always gets resisted. Bane spells are our 'burst' DPS type Dots.  500/tick for 7 ticks is nice but it NEVER LANDS<br />
<br />
With high resists in the game now  the shaman is USELESS solo in pvp.    Don't get me wrong in a PvP war with a enchanter, bard things change.    Why do we need other classes to do pvp in game? <br />
<br />
Couple this with the melee high damage output with high resists (no slow lands) , lure DD and dots (Necro and Druid,) unresistable mez, and we are useless.  <br />
<br />
If im lucky I can gate at worst Heal till one of us go OOM.   There is no reason that all i should be able to land is a debuff and thats it.  Unless im so much more over-powering then a another player they dont stand a chance.  Wheres the fun in that?<br />

Just ranting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Solo pvp is pretty retarded right now, as allround there is too much defensive powers but not enough offense. Even the sk's are saying you can't take away their HT's or there is no way of killing healers and bards in mass pvp, and I have to agree with them. It has even gotten to the point where many Time+ geared players just ignore both tash and malos since nothing lands on them anyway.<br />
<br />
Get your atk up, find a weapon with a solid -resist modifier dd proc and pretend to be a melee is about the only way of killing high-resist players off. Even then you have no way of finishing them off unless they are dumb.</div></div><hr />

I agree reason why I stopped play a while ago.  I saw the writing on the walls an tried to tell people this 2 years ago but only now has it become so overwhelming everyone is seeing it.    Almost makes me wish i had stayed level 49 but twinks can have massive resists also.</div></div><hr />

Shaman not only have trouble with druids, but also....Clerics, Pally's, Bards, or another Shaman.  None of these classes SHOULD EVER die in PVP versus a Shaman unless they REALLY REALLY Suck!<br />

I don't think Eq was really designed with pvp that strongly in mind. If they did do any changes to balance pvp, it could unbalance certain classes in PvE. So the changes would have to be pvp only. And interestingly to really class balance in pvp, they might have to mishmengle certain class abilities. Then there is the issue of PvE designed Gear and AA...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Rubitt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I think about the only chance a shaman would have on a pvp server would be if they took the idea of the new server and made it limited to velious and earlier (but ditched the perma kill idea).  With current resist capable through PoP and ldon (augs) shaman and a number of other casters have no offensive capabilities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">The only form of damage a shaman can do in pvp(realistically) is via melee and procs. Our epic dot is useless at high levels, it's way too long to cast for a 50% resist rate. Our pet is a joke(but keep him up anyway, he is an annoyance) Spirit call is a decent form of dmg also. Aside from these spells, play complete defensive. A druid can hand of ro you and then nuke ya down hard with summer's flame. Also, they recieve a right click swarming death with time gear, which helps them immensely. And with elemental gloves, their summer's flame spell is almost no mana. Couple this with a high number of AAs, and a druid is harder to kill than a shaman, and they have good dps also.<br />
<br />
So, there really is no way that you will beat a time geared druid, or just about any other time geared class. We have seriously lost our edge in pvp, it now goes towards melees and dps casters.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>smashie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Strats for Shaman PvP:<br />
<br />
Key spells: Nullify Magic, Cancel Magic, Feral Avatar, Haste, Tnargs, Trushar, Spear of Torment, Torrent of Poison, Malos.<br />
<br />
Key equipment: High dmg proc weapon (ex. Hammer of Hours, Sharkspine Club), 40%+ haste item, high resists and HP. Lots of instant clickies (Dain ring, AoN, Sow boots); alternately Symbol of the Planemasters.<br />
<br />
Key AA: Rabid Bear, Spell Crit line, pets aa. <br />
<br />
Most of your DPS will be in the form of melee + procs. If dmg shield, then dispell with both dispells asap. Use clickies as soon as dispelled. Keep haste, FA on self. Cast heals on self as needed. Determine when the druid tends to heal self, typically they try an heal themselves around 50%. Malos before they reach 50%. The second they hit 50% and try to cast heal, sic pets on them and chain rains or spear. Maybe try a VP to interrupt casting if ur lucky.<br />
<br />
If they get heals thru all the pets and nuking, then return to melee + heal self. keep up melee + heal self for 12 minutes then repeat.<br />
<br />
Alternatively you can get a Symbol of the Planemasters and rely on proccing stun, which is disease based. In addition to HoH or Sharkspine Club this is pretty tough to beat. Especially since it takes over 200dps to beat Breath of Trushar + occassional tnargs.<br />
<br />
+Combat Effects helps a lot as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I disagree that a pvp change would have to affect pve balance at all. Right now all resist mods inflicted by a PC is multiplied by 1.5 on the Zeks. That shows there is coding that distinguishes between pve- and pvp-originated spells.<br />
<br />
A very simple way of 'fixing' pvp right now would be to cap pvp resists at 250. If you get hit by a detrimental PC spell and your relevant resist is above 250, it gets set to 250. Debuffs detract from the 250 value.<br />
<br />
Add on the nifty feature of having any and all movement enhancing spells (sow, jboots, horse, selos) instantly vanish whenever you get hit by a detrimental PC spell. This will make pvp bloodier and quicker since there will be less high-speed kiting around. It also has the added advantage of reducing ghosting, since obviously the game engine cannot handle player updates quick enough, at even jboots speed, to be adequate for pvp. Should make it easier to melee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Koridar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Ya but if they cap Detrimental spells like that then  the Very slim chance I currently have to resist spears, Lifetaps and Lures. disappear. A certain SK we both Know wouldn't even Bother to DT anymore. i would get Crit lifetapped to Death. and BTW DT and Lifeburn?? Geez I'm not that hard to Kill. 1 will suffice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I would argue for the Bane line to be unresistable. The spells are limited by the recast time as is.<br />
<br />
The reason for Bane to only receive a -50 resist mod is that it needs to be limited for PvP. The number of classes able to cure curses is too small for it to be landing too reliably.<br />
For PvE, even if every single DoT in the game was made unresistable, it would not be overpowering as there are enough drawbacks to DoTs as is, I agree.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Koridar, while I agree that sk's would become even more powerful on the offense with such a resist change, you also have to consider that the same goes for you.<br />
<br />
What are your chances of killing said sk with todays system? Slim to none at best? None of your spells landing, except the random spear of torment crits for 164 damage sound familiar? With todays system you aren't going to kill anyone who isn't afk, or even that.<br />
<br />
A resist change means you could, after malos, land roots, blinds and even slows again. Enough to gain some control in small scale pvp and be a force to reckon with. In mass pvp you'll once again feel like you're pulling your weight. Malos+tash with a 1.5mod against a 250resist cap is a real threat.<br />
<br />
Shaman have become masters of surviving pvp but accomplishing nothing. All we are good for right now is running around curing guildmates, sowing friendly pets and throwing in the occassional emergency heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Wytchone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I  could support the Resist change as well as the loss of any form of advanced speed changes ( Sow, Selo's, Horse, etc) in Pvp.  I would also suggest DT, LB and MB either be dropped from PvP or reduced to say 50% damage.<br />
<br />
Enforcment of Pve on mez spells in Pvp as well as normal resists on Lull spells.  Hell if they dont change lull then reduce them to say 50%.  It still pretty powerful.  Thats if spells resists stay the same.</div></div><hr />

This change would make PvP enjoyable again.  Our debuffs would actually be usefull and we might be able to land spells in PvP again.  Awesome idea!  Best one I've heard so far.<br />
<br />
As Koridar pointed out, we would be more vulnerable as well.  But really, who cares, we are the absolute worst PvP class currently, so it can't get worse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Koridar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Have you ever tried channeling Velium strike in PVP??  while being bashed and Kicked? shucks. I'm shocked to Death when i'm able to get a Heal off in PVP.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">With the 1.5 pvp modifier your resists would be down to 168 and 172dr after malos and malicious decay respectively. Low enough to land spells quite comfortably. <br />
<br />
Perhaps too comfortably, but that is somewhat balanced by the shamans low dps and the drawback of our debuffs+dots being dispellable/curable. As an aside, pure melees would probably need some form of lower level channeling if a resist revamp such as this went through, as well as some specific spells (snare/blind/slow...) having chances to break upon inflicted dmg due to their overpowered nature in pvp. <br />
<br />
In mass pvp with a chanter you'd drop magic resists down to 92.5 with malos+tash, and all the way down to 70 by adding malosinia. Totally devastating. Every caster will have to work doubleduty making sure people get dispelled, and placing classes with cure poison/radiant cure in every group would become extremely important. <br />
<br />
Shaman and mages would definately see the heat turned up on them once again, but that's what being a threat entails. <br />
<br />
As for channeling velium strike, well, I have barely used that spell in pvp. While VS has a nice mana efficiency spear of torment totally blows it out of the water dps wise, and dps is what it is all about imo. 7.8sec cast time just won't happen in pvp unless you get left alone, and even then players usually have higher cr than pr.<br />
<br />
What I see as a problem is runspeed5 being too fast for pvp, and you can't really 'strip' that off people in pvp.<br />
<br />
Pvp in EQ is too drawn out right now. It needs to get more dangerous for everyone and this is, imo, best achieved by letting spells land again and reducing pvp movement speeds overall. Alot of minor details could also use tweaking, but that's just extra glazing on the pk cake.<br />
<br />
NONE of these changes would need to affect pve if implemented with just a grain of ingenuity. Felt I needed to say that to those who like to de-bump my rep when I open my mouth on pvp issues. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't see this being much of a factor since everyone has access to Run5.  I would see this as a problem if only a few select classes did (Bards/Selo's).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Hmm my reference is to normal servers really, but yeah on pvp I guess it maybe would help. Although, even at 150 resists I think I have chain casted dots on myself before and none of them have landed. But the -30 line of the slow and greater immobilize/petrifying earth should land with a few attempts. Would be useful if Bane was made -30 resist or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Wytchone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Truth be told any resist of 100 will have our dots resisted 60% + of the time.  Hell I resisted 2 of 3 dots with a PR of 50.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Treasure</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Best advice given here was to wait them out. Expect a Druid to do one of 2 things, A, the aforementioned Summers flame route, which is a bitch, or B the same thing with the Curse dot rolled in. Their Curse dot is fire based and has a negative 30 resist check on it, essentially with immolation + hand of ro its something like a total of neg 130-150 fire resist check.<br />
<br />
First thing to do is check their resistances, best way to do this is to do a Mal Decay / VP check, if VP lands then you can land any disease dot as well. 2nd check their Cold / Poison resists respectively, there are a number of ways to do this so I figure you can decide an easy way to do that. 3rd look around your environment. Are you in an open space where they can run around? or are you in a dungeon or otherwise closed environment?<br />
<br />
If your in open space your pretty screwed, they can just run off and heal, and kite any pet you have and or you trying to melee them. Best bet would be to just sit there and take it while using Trushar's and hoping its not dispelled.<br />
<br />
If your in a closed space you have many more options. But you'll want to save those AA pets for later, dont open up with them. First off invest in a PoWater 1hblunt. It has a neg400 resist check to disease and does 400-500dmg. Pretty much its a free 500 dmg every couple seconds. Oh did I mention it proc's a LOT? Get Spell casting fury and they'll be running in no time. The whole time you should be using HoT on yourself. at 50% then lay down the Mal Decay / VP root and unleash those GoD AA pets. Theyll be dead in seconds.</div></div><hr />

Ensnare to me is a great equalizer for most classes particularly Melee, if you can ensnare them then its pretty much easy pickings.</div></div><hr />
