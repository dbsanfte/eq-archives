<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gawgan Zolah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all!<br />
<br />
I've gotten sick of the game but reactivated my account to see if any of my friends wanted to use Gawgan as a bot.<br />
<br />
Turns out they dont, but they i hear of a new clean server. GREAT! I remember the days of being one of the first clerics on Torvinn to be able to Sup heal and CH and such, and that was so fun. In the first 5 or 10 Wizards to be able to port around on Quellious. I been starting new servers for the thrill since i can remember.<br />
<br />
But has it been up too long? Im wondering what lvl the highest are. Had it been up a week? or only a few days.<br />
<br />
Come to think of it, does anyone play on it yet? If so we should get together in the spirit of the crucible!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorgryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">it came out a day or 2 ago... the powerlevelers are out in waves tho... i heard of one person already level 19...<br />
no clue on the average or highest levels tho</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gawgan Zolah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ah cool thanks :D I started a char named Bihg (last name will be Bhoned) Gnome Shadowknight. I know Blohb/Gremie plays on the server also Ssizzor (? is that the name?).. if anyone wants some fun its a nice server to get away from high level stress</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ssizzor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeps, got the name right...<br />
<br />
I was the 3rd person to 20, but I've pretty sick of the high lvl players memem attitudes, so I've restarted...<br />
<br />
Also sick of playing Iksar, as it's about my 10th iksar, and only chose the race to duo with an Iksar Monk friend, who restarted :)<br />
<br />
So now I'm a TRULL... And the name is URGH...<br />
<br />
Never played Troll before, and now I get to use words like BARSH and say me instead of I... awesome...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rumar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">So when are they gonna open char transfers there? Isn't it so that FV and some PvP servers are only ones you can't have this service for?</div></div><hr />
