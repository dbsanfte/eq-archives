<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Stanton Bowmaine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I partner with a 46 druid and am trying to get her up to at least near my level and get her a bit of safe druid training along the way.<br />
<br />
I'm running 100% AAXP atm, but I don't want to steal too much exp nor hunt mountains of light blues if I can help it.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">One thing I've picked up from the messages in the past is avoid grinding aaxp until 55 minimum.  Apparently you get new damage and def tables then. Also, aaxp is easier to grind at higher lvls then in the low 50's.  <br />
<br />
As to where to go, I'm in Velks now w/ a 58 shamen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Stanton Bowmaine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The only reason I'm doing AAXP now is to give a chance for my druid partner to catch up a few more levels and be able to do one more Naggy of Vox raid, otherwise I wouldn't have switched over until 55 or so...<br />
<br />
Honestly, I'm darn tired of looking at Griffon butts in JP and want to find someplace that will stretch her abilities a bit and supply enough regular xp to help her catch up with me fairly quickly if possible.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
Stanton</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kensei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You might be able to find enough blues in DL to duo there, just avoid the Ravishing Drolvargs...<br />
<br />
LGuk will still have lots of blues, and they are relatively easy since they are old world. Still enough to provide a challenge, since you'll get adds at your level.<br />
<br />
SolB Bats will also be decent, all dark blue, about 3k hp but hit like wimps.<br />
<br />
Cyclopses in OOT would also work. Should still be all dark blue to you, 5k hp, hit for 70s max.<br />
<br />
<br />
Until your druid buddy gets to 51 and Sup Heal, you need to take into account their limited healing ability and adjust to that. SD may work, but the stuff there does hit pretty hard for Greater Heal to cover.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Stanton Bowmaine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks much for the ideas! We did try SD a couple times and, provided we stay away from the revenants, we did ok, but had to get pretty deep into the zone before I found many dk blues...<br />
<br />
Thanks again.<br />
Stanton</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I went to SD a few times with some friends to camp the revenants.  Ended up w/ 2 Sun Chalices and a Smiters Grildle.</div></div><hr />
