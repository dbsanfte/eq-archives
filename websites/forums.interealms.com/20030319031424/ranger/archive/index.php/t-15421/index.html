<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Feeldary</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">lvl 62, no EQ/AM3<br />
<br />
impossible to get a group<br />
impossible to solo except green / light blue<br />
<br />
can you say locked ?<br />
<br />
i deleveled myself to 60 in order to get xp for AAs and i m going for EQ / AM 3 despite i hate archery.<br />
<br />
be an archer or quit the game.<br />
<br />
well i almost choose to quit, i'm so sad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Domandred</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Same problem here.  This morning I spent 2 hours LFG in Valor, Storms, Innovation, Nightmare, and Disease.  No dice.  With me were several other rangers LFG.  I'd move to another zone and sure enough the others would show up as well.  Anything I can solo without fear kiting is light blue or green to me now so that's not an option.  Thought about velium hounds and other animals in WW but that was too far to travel only to find out they are also light blue or green....haven't looked yet.  At 60 I could solo the entry frogs in Seb.  They are light blue and green now.  Blood Ravens are still good for me in Nightmares though slow going, but all it takes is 3 groups anywhere near the graveyard and house and it closes down that option completely.<br />
<br />
My usual grouping for exp is 4 hours LFG to 1 Hour of actually having a group.  People keep saying get 65 and your problems will be solved.  That's not correct.  Maybe for larger guilds that have everyone flagged, but for me that's not an option.  I can't level up to 65 cause I am not in an uber guild and currently the furthest ahead in my guild.  If I got to 65 the situation would be even worse.  That would lock me out of even more places for exp.<br />
<br />
Pretty much the reason is because in PoP Rangers are shut down for tanking.  There are a few mobs we can tank against, and a few group make-ups that allow this to happen, but in general without EQ/AM3 we are relegated to the position of a monk or rogue.  If one of them are available rangers aren't getting groups.  I've even had a group disband me when a rogue showed up cause the rogue put out better DPS then I did.<br />
<br />
I hate hearing that it is every class that has this problem.  That's not true at all.  This morning there were 4 rangers spread out across PoP zones LFG.  That was to start.  By the time I logged there were 7.  There were more rangers LFG then there was other classes COMBINED when I gave up and logged out.  I have seen times when each tier 1 and 2 PoP zones would have 4 to 5 rangers LFG.  Thats 24 to 30 rangers LFG.  A freaking RAID SIZED force of rangers LFG at one time.<br />
<br />
It's out of hand.  Get level 65 they say.  No it won't work and just limit my exp like I said before.  And forget about level 63 to 65 spells.  I'm not gonna see the drops anytime soon, and there is no way in hell I am paying 50K for brushfire (serious that's the bazaar price on TM)  The only option is to get EQ/AM3 then some more solo options open up for me.  Problem is that's not gonna happen without getting a group.<br />
<br />
I'm with you Feeldary.  I've been troubled by this as well, but if something doesn't change soon I may hang up my bow as well and go on a long EQ walkabout.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Snowflower</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I totally resent being forced into archery as well.<br />
The term 'alternate advancement' is kinda silly because you really have no choice in the matter it seems.<br />
It just feels like some disguised hybrid xp penalty since everyone percieves it as a requirement to be a ranger.<br />
<br />
The way some people fanatically talk about bows, how rangers are godlike damage dealers and that they should only be doing archery on raids makes me wish for an archery nerf.<br />
<br />
I'll never level past 60 after seeing what a major pain in the butt it is to get a group in PoP, and how everything pre-pop becomes worthless for xp/aaxp.<br />
<br />
I play pretty casually now and leveling past 60 would be the end of EQ for me anyhow, since there is not much you can do when you have an hour or two at a time to play.<br />
<br />
I'll get to 60, then go AA only until I quit the game when its no longer fun at that level I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jalim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I am not level 65, not even level 60. The problem though I see is this. In PoP Tier 1 zones, you are basicly required to have 3 things. A tank, a healer, a slower. In optimal situations, a ranger cannot fill one of those roles. On my server there are tons of folks filling these three roles that are either already in groups or LFG in PoP. <br />
<br />
Basicly that leaves you with three spots open in a group that you can fill....along with a ton of other classes. Pretend that you have a warrior tanking (most likely ideal), then a cleric as the main healer (again most likely ideal), then for sake of best slows a shaman (again ideal). The next thing a lot of exp groups will look for is a mana maker/crowd control (enchanter ideal, bard will work too).<br />
<br />
That leaves 2 slots open. With the classes left: Shadowknight, Rouge, Ranger, Paladin, Beastlord, Druid, Wizard, Mage, Bard (if not taken from above), Monk (did I forget a class here?).<br />
<br />
Obviously I am on the ranger's side here being one. As &quot;general_group_001&quot; though, if all of those classes were left, and 2 slots in the group were left, who would they choose? Not saying what would be the best choice, but who would YOU THINK they would choose. This is just a random &quot;I don't know any folks in zone&quot; type of group, not guildys or friends.<br />
<br />
Pretend we consider Enchanter and bard as taken as one slot, just to eliminate a class. Well, playing devils advocate, you would still need a melee or two, and I think that they would take monk and rouge over us, or a back-up healer if they had no shaman.. Rouge for backstabbing and monk for pulling singles with FD seems to be what I see often.<br />
<br />
In non optimal situations, there are still other classes that can more or less fill the role of one or more of these three. <br />
<br />
Tanks: Besides warriors, Pallys and SK are looked at as the next viable tanks. Heck even monks still. For that matter I don't even want to go into beastlords, I personally know a 63ish BL that has a level 60 pet with around 4800 hp. All I have to do is stand back and plink arrows.<br />
<br />
Healer: Well Shaman, Druids, even Pallys to a certain extent can take either a secondary role in healing or be main healer in a pinch, but the group will still leave a slot open for a cleric for big AC/HP buffs and rezzes when needed.<br />
<br />
Slower: Mobs hit for a ton, and you need a slower. Shaman, Enchanters, and Bards (even beastlords?) can all do this to an extent, along with haste. (Yes, we Rangers can slow with a proc, but not reliably).<br />
<br />
So we rangers are sort of tossed in with the remaining classes, all LFG. I honestly think I add more to a group than DPS, and have a lot to offer, but it takes a lot to convince other people. We all know what rangers can do, but with exp grinding in PoP mainly being based on Tank, Healer, Slower/Haster, it makes it hard for us to get a group. This is nothing THAT new, but with PoP fairly new to all of us still, there is a huge wash of people LFG at any given time, and I see rangers passed up all the time (us non AM3/EQ folks). Do I like it? No. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rounlin Starwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I really have no problem with finding a group /shrug.  Course most of the time I group with guildies, also working on Wood elf Illusion item so that takes time out of xping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fufinski</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I hate to say it, but it really isn't just the rangers LFG. Most int casters are having real trouble getting groups (including Enchanters).  A lot is either down to people really not understanding what classes can offer or trying to max group efficiency (often misguidedly).  I will not LFG for more then 30 mins.  After that I will find something else to do.  Usually I will just start my own group.  All I really need is a healer and a slower, after that any 3 other bodies will do for a group.  I prefer a knight tank if one is available, but will do the job myself if I have to.  I was once grouped with another ranger and even when the shaman went AFK we decided to still try pulls with him using EC and me using Swarmcaller (mutters about hate stone) and we managed to slow the mobs ok.  The other ranger was tanking at the time.  You don't even need a cleric in tier 2.  A good shaman can heal just fine as can a good druid.  They are not as good as a cleric but they get the job done.  The only class I never see having trouble LFG are shaman, and funilly they are one of teh best solo classes out there if they couldent get a group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>ArafysAragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">57 ranger with mediocre gear, Tanked mobs in:<br />
<br />
PoD Castle, Flies<br />
PoN Hedge, Waterfall area.<br />
<br />
All you really need is a slower that's on the ball. In PoD I tanked over a 57 warrior because he couldn't hold agro. Wh had a 54ish shaman, and a 60 druid on heals. 2 monks, and the aforementioned warrior, managed to XP there mostly unmolested for something close 5 hours. <br />
<br />
In PoN I tanked at the hedge for a couple of hours killing banshees and wraiths. Yeah, they hit for 350's, but with a chanter slowing them they don't hit for too often. The cleric just needs to start the CH at 3 bubs of health rather than 2.  <br />
<br />
Although I did notice that night that there seemed to be a rather negative view of me tanking. The group I joined was looking for a tank for like 10 mins, I asked them if I could join them. when the GL asked the group if that would be acceptable, the cleric said &quot;I'm not doing that&quot; and left the group and went lfg again. Later after our cleric went LD, and we had to get another one, we ended up getting 2, and losing the pally that had been tanking to LD. After I died once due to whatever lapse of concentration... One cleric says &quot;Guys, I'm going to disband so you can get a tank, for the good of the group&quot; That kinda pissed me off. <br />
<br />
Meh, I dunno really. Kinda makes me wonder why I still participate in pickup groups...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Feeldary</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">sure we can tank slowed mobs, but our mitigation tables are still way, i mean &lt;b&gt;way&lt;/b&gt; under the knight's and war's. so got to deal damage. so got to get archery dmg</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>ArafysAragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah, our mitigation is low, but it is still possible. Be insane to do it without a slower even with a warrior. So a slower is necessary really, no matter what. <br />
<br />
We can do it. Its just a matter of ridding people of the impression that we can't..<br />
<br />
What's wrong with getting AM3/EQ? They are probably the best AA's in the game. Putting aside the bugs, the damage output is insane. Not to mention never getting AE'd, riposted, sucking down enrage due to a bad spot of lag, not really having to control agro... <br />
<br />
All my career I have wanted to rip out 8 and 900 point bow shots. And the occasional 2000+ crit : )  Its something different than standing up next to the mob and whacking at it. <br />
<br />
Play the game the way you want. You don't have to get AM3/EQ if you don't want to.</div></div><hr />

people are nice on your server, if they group up with non-archer rangers 62+ instead of better tank or better dmg dealer :)<br />
<br />
else soloable mobs without archery are green / light blue at 62</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Uilamin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">EQ/AM3 might help not not much for getting groups... You usually cannot get a group because you cannot slow, cc, heal or tank effectively...<br />

There are just too many classes that are pure damage that the few spaces open for them in a group are taken up fast.</div></div><hr />

Don't say nerf archery, kinda selfish... considering most of us Rangers take this skill to the highest advtange.<br />

I don't have problem finding groups, but then again, I look at 1 a.m. where people are needed. ~</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kensei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Iaq, don't hammer AA at 51, you'll get the AA much faster if you level first. You also can't get any of the cool AA's until 55+, though Run Speed and Regen can be life savers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>ratanis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">at 60 with 7aa atm, i can still get pickup groups in the tier one planes, but ive yet to get into a pickup group in a tier 2 plane that a guildmate or a friend didnt bring me into. the sad reality is that rangers cant pass as an emergency tank for anything in tier 2 and higher stuff in PoP, we dont have the dps of a rogue, even with AM3 (in a log parse, i know we come out higher, but thats extremely circumstancial, and circumstances are not always ideal for archery, IE hills, not being able to step far enough away from your mob due to other mobs being close, etc) and snaring duties can be handles by druid or wizzies. IMO, vi should beef up our damage mitigation AA abilities so at the very least, we could pass as a carboard tank instead of a feather tank if the situation demands it.</div></div><hr />

Well, now there is an alternative.  You can do the EQ/AM3 thing, requiring you to spend 18 points in General/Archetype, and then 27 more in Class AA.  If you don't want to be an archer, you can buy Ambidexterity for 18 points in Archetype, and Ferocity for 9 in PoP skills, and be very effective in melee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Subwen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Interesting post. This got me thinking about the fact that my Cleric is level 60 and my ranger is still level 55. Subwen was my fist char...and I still consider him my main...although My cleric is better equipped and has out levelled my ranger. That alone speaks volumes about the problems we rangers face. <br />
<br />
Dont get me wrong...I Love my ranger AND my cleric...and I have a total blast playing either char. <br />
<br />
I must confess a few things that pertain to PoP however. There is a good buddy of mine in my guild...he is a 60th ranger...and is pretty uber....with hella nice gear and impressive HP/AC for a ranger. I have him tanking faairly regular when I play my cleric.....but there are limists as to where I am willing to have him tanking..and under what circumstances. Keep in mind....my goal is to keep him alive and healthy so as we can get exp instead of spending time rezzing and such. With no slower...the limits are more severe. Granted.....my friend does have his epic(both)....but that is not as reliable as a chanter of shaman.  In PoP zones...the lack of a slower would scare me to death....prolly literally. I wouldnt wanna have Sub tank there at all....and as for my friend....same thing unless we have the best slow available happening. <br />
<br />
On the flip side.....anyone that wouldnt take a ranger to fill out their group has to be totally ignorant of what a ranger has to offer. Archery or Melee.....a Ranger's damage output is impressive...mildy speaking.Add to that snare...AC debuff with immolate spells...we can SOW and take that job off the druid or shammy's hands as well. We can make a groups life a lot easier thru buffs and damage. We can also increase AC and ATK with buffs that stack with cleric and shammy and chanter buffs. Ya see where I am going with this I am sure. Cant say as I would want a ranger tanking in PoP....but I would be glad to have a ranger in my group...cause I know life gets better when there is a ranger there:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Daesun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">With melee using fairly mediocre weapons (Swiftblade of Zek and Swiftwind), Ferocity 1, CF1, I get about 70-90 DPS (depending on mob AC).  I manage about 90-120 DPS with a Twisted Longbow and EQ/AM3.  I could definitely equal my bow damage with some melee AA and some better weapons.  If you can't find a group with 90-100 DPS in melee, perhaps a guild would be a good option.<br />
<br />
I will always group with guildies if possible, especially the uber chanter with Total Domination 3 and the AA rune - he charms HoH and BoT 60+ mobs without a prob, hastes them, and *decimates* the mobs with his new pet.  In these circumstances, having a melee who's quick with a heal (ie: me) can save the chanter from being crushed when his pet breaks charm.  Add in the ranger's ability to harmony mobs and I'm very welcome in guild groups in tier 3 zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Catwalkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I am currently level 59, with 10 aaxp, and bless the fact that I can use aaxp to stay near the same level as my friends.<br />
<br />
I don't intend to leave 60 without getting AM3 and EQ.   I have both Swiftwind and Earthcaller, and put two points into Combat Fury so I could get crit hits.  As things stand right now, my DPS (with either a BFT or a Nightmarewood) goes DOWN when I go straight archery.   Archery is NOT my favorite skill, but it is a valuable one, and I want to maximize it.  If it makes me more attractive to groups, if it makes me more valuable to my guild, I want to get it. <br />
<br />
Sure, folks can try to pressure me to get level 65 all they want to, but ultimately it is my decision; aaxp actually allows me the flexibility to do this on my own schedule.  <br />
<br />
Decide for yourself what is most important.  Weigh the factors.  Play your ranger the way YOU want to play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Xzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I disagree... hunting in CoD at the rats, you really cannot shoot; the experience is great. You don't need archery there, and often I pull, which also makes archery useless. It all depends on where you hunt I suppose..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Roophus Gunthar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Why dont all of you stop whining?  I know of many many rangers who got to 65 without am3/eq in regular pickup groups, your just lazy or somethin.  Sorry to be so harsh, but I've seen many rangers (not in uber guilds) hit 65 within 3 weeks in regular pickup groups, playing average amounts of time each day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Dagar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I have tanked nearly everything in tier 1 and 2 planes. My semi regular group will often go there if our SK or War are not around. I can step in and tank the giants in BoT without much problem, but I wouldn't want to do that on a regular bassis. I consistently equal or out damge our rogue (course i have alot of melee aa's, and a primal longsword) and trash our war's dmg. I often do not use archery even though its a good 30+ dps more than my melee simply because my avatar comes from melee and I like to be in on the action in case of an emergency. Also you would be shocked in the dps added with our new nukes.<br />
<br />
Whats the point of this you ask? Be aware of what you CAN do, how to do it, and where you rank. Fire up a parser in the background, turn on others dmg. See how you compare, the differences are pretty minor, even when tanking. Our biggest problem is a lower total hp than a war, mitigation is less, yeah, but its not that bad. I have 3 boxed giants in PoS with a bot cleric and chanter, and held myself up. Now, if your pickup group cleric can't hold you up, i'd say he was pretty ****ty if I can do it with a 61 bot with pretty lame gear. Keep an itchy trigger finger on weaponshield when you get low. I find that I only get in trouble tanking about once per recycle. Another option is to turn off attack and heal yourself untill the cleric hits ya. No rip dmg and some cele's go along way.<br />
<br />
Or, do what I do when the rogue gets lippy, jolt and make him tank. =-)</div></div><hr />

<br />
And if you're ever on the Zeb server and I'm on send me a tell, I'll group with you, maybe we can go out in a blaze of glory trying to take down AoW or something lolol.</div></div><hr />

Pretend that you have a warrior tanking (most likely ideal)<br />
<br />
I honestly don't know where people get this.<br />
<br />
The optimal tank in PoP xp groups is generally a Paladin or SK. Why? Because a Paladin or SK can get and hold aggro without ever coming in contact with the mob. Why is that important? Well, it allows your chanter or shaman to slow the mob ON THE PULL without worrying about getting raped for it. That decreases the amount of damage taken significantly since Warriors need time to &quot;build aggro&quot; (unless they're uber-equipped).<br />
<br />
Incidentally, how do you think rogues get groups? Considering the fact that there are probably 8916503481354234 of us in PoP zones and we're usually among the first classes to get flagged for PoS/PoV (since folks LOVE stacking their trials groups with multiple rogues)? 99% of the time, when I get a group, it's with friends or people who know me or have grouped with me before. That's how the game goes the higher you get in level. Most people don't know what a good Ranger brings to a group so they fall back on what they do know (or what they're told). It's the same reason people wait in line to do Exe trial when some other trials are easier for the vast majority of people.<br />
<br />
<br />
People who know what a Ranger can bring to a group will seek out Rangers as often as possible. Those are the people you want to group with (when you're not educating the nonbelievers, that is). Several people have said this already but, if you have trouble finding pickup groups, MAKE YOUR OWN. This way, you get to decide what makeup works best for you. <br />
<br />
I dunno, I kinda like the emphasis on archery. It's an area where the Rangers is the NUMBER ONE class in. Nobody can do damage with archery like a Ranger can. And it does indeed have its usefulness in MANY situations.  For anyone who has read any of the Shannara books, I equate Rangers to be like the Elven Hunters that guard the Westland elf city. Silent assassins. Or like the similar guards in the Dragonlance books that guard Qualinost and Silvanost. Death from a distance. I like it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Furian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Maybe it's just me, but I had no problem tanking last night in PoN with a group made up of me (55 ranger), 56 cleric, 52 enchanter, 56 rogue, 53 rogue and 48 monk. I could easily hold aggro, we more or less chain pulled cause cleric was floating at the 60-80 mark the whole time. We were only pulling trees and spiders, but exp was still pretty good for the difficulty.  I had around 3300hp buffed, I have no AA, no epic, but as long as enchanter was getting the slows off early, which he was, we had no problems.  And to top it all off, I was ASKED to come tank for the group. We had a good dmg output with the pair of rogues and monk(although the monk was really to low and apparently was being PL'd a bit by the rest of the group before I got there).  But, the best part was it was FUN for a change. Last time I was tanking something on purpose was when I was trying to give a guild cleric a couple extra seconds to camp out...</div></div><hr />
