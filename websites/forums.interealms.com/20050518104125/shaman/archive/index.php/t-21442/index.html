Been a common complaint for a long time from monks that they have to give up a nice ranged slot for thrown items, or have to switch back and forth for pulls/combat. Hopefully this will alleviate that for them...nice to see that the Devs might actually be listening..../e hold his breath for some real changes. Note this is on Test, but hopefully will make it live soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>DemonMage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Range is too short really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Torp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">/agree Caisha, 50 range is 1/2 of CH range. Mobs would probably agro naturally from that close.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Aye, something that should have been taken care of a long time ago.  Now, for the other 50 million things on the back-order list :p <br />
<br />
Spraggon</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shamad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, aside from being uterly useless as its' short range...it's not even going to go live. It's a skill from the new 'newb tutorial' found on test server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Guntak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Looks like a combat ability... meaning maybe as you get higher in levels the range gets bigger. Monk/65 - Range 300... maybe. I would personally love this for my monk.</div></div><hr />
