<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>UloffBigkev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Out of interest, how many of you guys have done some serious exp groups with 5 other shaman and no other classes in PoP? I've done shaman groups in pretty much every exp zone I'm flagged for and they're all fast with zero downtime.<br />
<br />
In my experience, they're really fun to put together and play in if you can convince people that they're not going to die. ;) (Not only that, non shaman people tend to be amazed we can pull it off.) Anyone heard of any other single class groups that work well? (And either dont have a lot of downtime or rely on luck.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">well.. me and 5 other shamans are going to group kill the statue in Kael if that counts.  Haven't done exping though.  The only real problem I see.. is that our dots stack.. up to a certain number.  I'm wondering if that many shamans all doted the bejesus out of the mob... if you would run out of space hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dimdim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My theory is that classes that can solo would likely make a decent group like this, though you may need to vary the area you hunt depending on class. I'd love to see a full shaman group, just don't argue too much on who is main tank lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lorddaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">a full mage group would rock too. 6 pets to tank, 6 mages nuking...with malo...would be interesting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I did a group in the pits in Tactics with 3 shamans, 2 druids and a ranger. We were root-dotting, so it could have just as easily been 6 shamans.<br />
<br />
It was a lot of fun. We would have 3 or 4 mobs on the go at once, and just had an assembly line of debuffing/dots going.<br />
<br />
The guild was a bit pissed that we were hogging all the slowers though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">/GU Willing to let one of our 6 shaman leave the group for 100kpp, KEI and a BL...<br />
<br />
:lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">On Emarr there is a Mage co-alition that regularly raids mobs mage only.  Their most frequent target is the Dain, but I think I recall them doing other mobs regularly enough.   Not sure how well they would work grouping for exp, but I can imagine they would do quite well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>kiksis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">6 monks are awesome - each in turn tanks, then feigns and mends; mob is getting crushed to pieces real quick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shazzog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">In my experience, they're really fun to put together and play in if you can convince people that they're not going to die. ;) <br />
<br />
Hmmmph, any shaman that is afraid they are gonna die when grouped with 5 other shaman obviously hasn't been playing a shaman long.<br />
<br />
If it was in a zone where we could set up a camp, I'd prolly set up a pull rotation. Each shaman takes turns going out and pulling with a slow. If it's resisted, yell it out and the last person to pull attempts to slow when mob is in range. If that is resisted...screw it, the mob isn't gonna live long with 6 alpha dogs and 6 shamans beating on it anyway. Why even bother with DoT's? (Unless it's a mob with tons and tons of HP)<br />
<br />
A full shaman group wouldn't have the damage output of a full Mage group, but we would also be self healing, unlike the mage group. I think it would balance out.<br />
<br />
Maybe it's just me. I'm used to soloing and solo in the areas most people are screaming they need a group for. If I can solo an area, having 5 other shaman next to me with their pets just made the area trivial.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">One of the most amazing groups I have ever been in was 1 shaman and 5 necroes...  their 6th necro left.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jayzan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I've been a group with 2 other shaman and 2 pallys.  That was sweet group.  They were all 53-55 with one shaman being 58 and had the 1950hp heal.  (PoN)<br />
<br />
As for a full shaman group,  If there was an Ogre there I would have it tank for us cuz they are un-stunnable by melee attack.  I'm a barbarian and I get the crap stunned outta me... It happens in The Grey all the time.  Spin around like a freaking top!!! LOL!  =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I can easily see full shaman or shaman/necro mix root/rot groups being popular when LDoN comes out. Add 1 bard for their DoT damage improvement song...+15% which would stack on top of burning affliction (get a mage to summon you one, if you don't have a normal one), for 16-35% increased damage PER TICK of dots...with 4-5 people running 2-3 dots apiece, stuff will die *fast*. Might not get the heart pumping, but I'd have a lot of fun :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Khrent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Also the bard would bring mana and hp regen with their song.  At 64 its 20 hps and 8 mana per tick.</div></div><hr />
