<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Daekar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The gnomer that sells them is right inside the lighthouse in gunthak.  With max cha I was able to get them down to 9400ish range I believe so there actually a tad more than horses but I dont recall if there was a price diff for colors or not like horses off the top of my head.  Same range though for quality of the mount 9-100kish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Smellious Oderous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">In the lighthouse in Gunthak, there are 2 gnomes behind a table. The left one is a banker (good thing) the right one is the lizard seller. With 149 charisma my lizard cost me 9500pp, same as slowest horse for speed. Speed is differentiated by the size of the drum you buy. Small green drum will get you a slow green lizard. Red, black, and white are the other colors.<br />
<br />
I don't know of any extra features, have had my lizard since LoY came out...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Best investment I ever made.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Urnti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Extra features? Hmm..<br />
1) no horse head in the way (WEEEE)<br />
2) Look cool if you are troll/iksar/ogre (haven't seen many barbs on em)<br />
3) When you run and pan to third person it looks like you are riding a bucking bronco! (I normally cruise around Nexus saying &quot;Woot!  Just passed 8 seconds!!!)<br />
<br />
Oh ya don't forget sitting mana regen while not attacking~</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Lill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The drum is nodrop, and only sold in LoY.<br />

well im on FV, though i havent seen a drum for sale, but i guess its possible? i know bridles are not no drop here, so my guess is drums are not no drop either...maybe there is still hope for me!! i tried a horse once i hated it but since the head isnt there with a lizard id really like to get one of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I assume that you can buy it on FV and click it, but could be wrong :)</div></div><hr />

On the FV server, all items that would normally be No drop, on your average run of the mill server are in fact droppable. And can be sold on.</div></div><hr />

most no drop items on other servers do not have that restriction on FV. yes i believe epics are still no drop, and i believe some quested items are no drop, but i know for a fact bridles are not no drop, because someone who i was grouping with lent it to me one time to summon the horse to help us out. <br />
<br />
and no this isnt a pvp server either, its designated as role playing prefereed, you are only allowed one character (you can reroll, start from level 1 and keep your stuff if you wish), and also a trivial loot code server....meaning mobs wont drop special quest items if they are green to you/do not get xp from the kill - i think thats about right :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Juka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Do all lizards give 150 safe fall skill? If so I think I'm gonna buy LoY, 10k falls happen to me very rarely but they're still annoying as heck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">They upped the &quot;death fall&quot; damage to 20 k (so that furor in full buffs can't jump the kael ramp).  And I think the safe fall does not protect you from those death falls either - you still take some damage with safae fall on, just less.  Plus fall damage is weight dependend, so even where a 150 safe fall monk survives a fatty will go splash.</div></div><hr />

You buy the lizards (Drogmor) in the lighthouse, next to the banker. Wish I could buy one, even the cheap one...I never have any more than a few hundred plat in the bank at any one time. Pretty pathetic huh ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Metadone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Kozul, mez on da FV plane too. If you want, me can go buy you a Dogmor in da LoY zone. Da only tings me ask you is da money to buy it (wish me had enugh to buy on fer me), da time me nned to get dere and da right to click it first. Den da Dogmor be yours. My guild, da Twilight Bastion, has gud reputation on FV and me not pla to scrue it so don't be affraid me steal you, and if you still fear it, you borrow me a 10k item and gib it back to me when me gib you da dogmar drum, dat way you is sure me not steal you. Me know for sure da drum be not no drop has me saw one sold fer 103k yesterday in da Bazaar (don't know whut da owner wuz tinking when he set up da price).<br />
<br />
OOC : you say Dogmor give you a 150 safe fall skill. Do horses give&quot; you this too ? Otherwise, what is the advantage of the horse over Dogmor beside the fact that you don't look like rodeoing when you ride one ?<br />
Thank you for advice.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I have a drogmor, but when I was considering whether to buy it or a horse, I looked into the differences.<br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
- Increased speed (depending on model).<br />
- Medding mana regen without needing to sit (no sit agro).<br />
- Inherent safe fall of 150.<br />
- &quot;Cool&quot; factor (*shrug*)<br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
Both:<br />
- Acceleration/deceleration - it takes a little more time to manoever, which takes some getting used to.<br />
- Harder to target things, particularly things on the ground. You have to kinda sidle up sideways to a corpse so that it's in the corner of your screen, not right in front of you.<br />
- You need to have Luclin models on, at least for your character<br />
- You can't duck to interrupt spells. To interrupt a long cast spell, you have to click the buff icon off then duck.<br />
<br />
Drogmor cons:<br />
- The &quot;bucking bronco&quot; feel while riding it. This is slightly better when shrunk.<br />
Horse cons:<br />
- The head is in front of you at all times - alleviated slightly if shrunk, but makes looting in particular harder.</div></div><hr />
