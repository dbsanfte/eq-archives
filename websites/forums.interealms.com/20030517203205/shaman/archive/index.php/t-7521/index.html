<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jorshaiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well let me start off by saying hello everyone.  Will be doing my Magelo profile soon but here is my problem.<br />
<br />
I currently have an Earring of Solstice and my other earring is a forest loop, what should I replace forest loop with?<br />
<br />
Also current shield is the one from our epic, the Shield of Falsehood.<br />
<br />
Also currently just have the +7 wis rings. I could replace those if you all got any better.<br />
<br />
Also my neck piece, something from sebilis, maybe Sebilis scale neckguard?<br />
<br />
Face, Arctic Wyvern.<br />
<br />
Money no problem, guild isnt doing NToV yet but are doing decent mobs.  We should be trying THO soon so.  Any help be appreciated.<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Replace loop with EBS earring.<br />
<br />
Get a sarnak battle shield. If you have a littile cash... get an OOIV (theyre one of the most popular shaman choices)<br />
<br />
Get one shadel bandit ring, and one velium fire /wintry ring (whichever you can afford)<br />
<br />
A good neck guard would be an EBS neck if you dont need AC... or a tracking wolf collar if you have some money. Shimmering slime(?) is also pretty good. Theres one from pop gonig for 1k nowadays too..large smothmetal torque I think it is.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mask, get Crystal Spider eyes or if you have surplus plat get a deathmask of the elysians or golems jawbone.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope this helped :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KrintixXaneris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Get an earring of twisted leaves if you want some hps, but if you're going to replace your wis rings with a shadel and a velium, thats a loss of 14 wis and if you're not over 200, that can hurt a bit, so you might want to try and get an ivandyr's hoop for good ac and 6 wis.  Go with an SBS as a shield if you're low on cash, or if you have a little more and like to be eccentric like me, you can get a shield of the white dragon and look like a high roller.  For your face you should grab crystal spider eyes or an enshrouded veil.  Neck, just be simple and stick with a ivory collar for resists if you want, or get something with a use, like an amulet of insight, so you can procrastinate on rebuffing for another 5 minutes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Podunk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ok i keep seeing this OOIV, why have i only ever heard of it on this board LOL.  and what is it?
