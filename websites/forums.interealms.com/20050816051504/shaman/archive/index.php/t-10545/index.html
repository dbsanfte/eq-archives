<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Iynna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a level 60 shaman/monk duo that I two box. Both are epic'd.<br />
<br />
Monk is guild main, shaman is not main.  Guild is HoT capable and maybe could do more.  I like the challenge of duoing dungeons where monk needs to control pulls to avoid wipes but lately am spending time mostly on Velk's spiders and Seb necro.<br />
<br />
Shaman has all level 61 and 62 spells, MC1 and is at 99% of level 60.  But no malo, torpor, pox or avantar.  If malo/torpor/avantar drop at guild events, they will likey go to other shaman mains or be banked.<br />
<br />
1) should I stay at level 60 farming cash and AA until I can buy my level 60 spells?  I have been MQing coldain rings, have a non-kos level 8 warrior that scouts for REIF showing in kael manor (gottne 3 REIF's so far)<br />
<br />
2) should I move on to level 61 for pet and regen and move to higher zones?  Note that with 1100ac and 2600hp monk can tank Kunark/Velious/Luclin but not PoP.<br />
<br />
3) I have a couple of the cudgel 8 drops including the one from VS and my human monk is amiable in cabilis and could do the lower level quests and MQ the last. So should I do the Cudgel quests?  How beneficial with this be to a level 60+ non-avantar melee.<br />
<br />
4) Should I level and try to camp Emperor Chottal with a rogue and my monk/shaman duo.  Never been in the Crypt.  With carefull single pulling and a level 55 rogue to let me in, can I march down to the Emperor and kill him with a 61monk, 61 shaman and the 61 True Spirit pet?<br />
<br />
Kinda burned out on getting both toons to 60 and lost my direction.  Guidance plz?<br />
<br />

# 1 - Have fun. Pick up a hobby, read a book, take a break.<br />
<br />
Now frankly I'm sorta suprised your guild didn't &quot;suggest&quot; you level your Monk up. But that's more of an aside. I'm also curious why you can't guild your main, but I'll MYOB.<br />
<br />
The cudgel quests I saw on eqprices were for a Shaman not Monk. <br />
<br />
If you're looking for a decent Monk weapon check out a Waning light Katar.  www.monkly-business.com also has a nice spreadsheet.  You might have better - I am ghetto.<br />
<br />
Now insofar as leveling. (Exp stinks in Seb btw compared to PoP.)<br />
<br />
Check out Blargx's eloquent posts on leveling v not leveling. You also might want to check out PoD and see if you can handle single pulls.  With your slow and 1100+ AC it won't hurt to give it a SHOT.  If so, Pod exp &gt; Seb exp.<br />
<br />
If it's money you want, I always thought Guard had better gem drops.<br />
<br />
Can a 55 Rogue and 60 Shaman handle Emperor? Yes. Will be tricky getting there, and there are threads that talk about that - but see if you can hook up with a group heading down.<br />
<br />
IMO - it doesn't HURT to level to 61. If you still want to hunt Seb Crypt it should still be DB, however possibly not + / - 5 levels.<br />
<br />
If getting Torpor and Malo is more important to you, then see about killing Kunark Dragons also. <br />
<br />
But have fun. Go whack MOBs in Droga / Nurga for faction and the Ring of Bathezid. (I did, I also MQ the 8th Coldain). <br />
<br />
It's a game. Not a way of life and not work. It's supposed to be fun. * IF * you must log on, try a tradeskill. Baking, pottery just for mindless clicking while you talk to your guild.<br />
<br />
Have fun.</div></div><hr />
