<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Codlugarthia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm a bazaar hog on Rodcet Nife and check for shaman spells regularly. <br />
I think I've seen Torpor for sale twice since bazaar started.<br />
Now I've seen it twice on friday (sold for 60k and 75k) and twice on sunday (85k and 100k and still there i think).<br />
That is 4 times during the week-end!!!<br />
<br />
So what is going on?<br />
Are some guilds just clearing out there banks or did something else happen. <br />
Drop rate increased? Sounds to good to be true...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Farina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">it seems to me that someone bought the copies on sale friday and then just jacked up their prices so they could make some plat.  torpor is so rare that some people on xegony are offering 150k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Codlugarthia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You could be right.<br />
The thought never occurred to me that someone could be such an ass to do that...<br />
<br />
I remember the names of the two persons that sold it in the first place and will ask them who they sold it to. I'll check if they are the same that are trying to sell it for higher now. :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Price on torpor will probably drop in the next 6 months as copies of the 65 spell filter down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cateye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Why do you call somebody an ass for buying something and selling it for more?<br />
That is just simple economy, called profit making :p <br />
Don't get me wrong, I don't do such things but only coz i'm too lazy and get most things from guild, not for some moral hazard...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Torpor wasn't for sale for ages, I am glad I snagged mine for 80k. So useful.<br />

Anyway, I'd consider 60k a steal for Torpor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Taldur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You would think torpor would go down in price with the new 58 mini  CH.  Personally I'm trying to get Malo first, more usefull to me being in a raid guild.  I see torpor as a helpful but not necisary spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>glydor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hopefully after the filtering of some higher end spells the morons who dont think twice about us shamans having to pay that much for a dang spell will sell for less. Or at least reduce the drop rate so we can get it the old fashioned way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
What is wrong with buying torpor for 60k and selling it for higher?<br />
<br />
<br />
If you think thats wrong, go live in your care-bear communist country or wherever you want, this is EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Codlugarthia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I buy low sell high myself all the time.<br />
More time than I play my shaman even lately, cause I rarely have more than 1 hour to play in one piece.<br />
Otherwise I wouldn't own a Funghi, Lodi Shield, JBB and horse.<br />
<br />
I have two principles however, I don't haggle down prices on items I intend to sell right again.<br />
And I don't buy low sell high on spells.<br />
You may call be stupid or weak now, but I don't care :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I thought that I could cruise along as a shaman with Kragg's Mending and not sweat having Torpor. I also thought that KM would drop the price of Torpor as well. I am pretty knowledgable about 58 - 60 since I spent 4 months in that range and I can tell you, you cannot compare the two. I got my Torpor from Tolump on an UDB raid last week. And Torpor is a godsend.<br />
<br />
I am a soloing and grouping shaman. I have grouped and solo'd all over Kunark, Velious, Luclin and some PoP. And for the week I have had Torpor I cannot explain how powerful I feel. I swear that one spell has doubled my shamanistic abilities. I am invicible (well I was until those 3 FGs in SolB showed me otherwise. If slow wouldnt have been resisted on the last FG I would have lived.)<br />
<br />
For grouping, KM is a pure tank spell. I can't cast Torpor on them because they get all whiney and the high piercing screeches from their cries hurts my ears. I would never think of casting it on a caster and I have died to low life aggro many a time trying to get the full use of KM. Now with Torpor, I don't even sweat it.<br />
<br />
For soloing, I used to use KM on project alpha while he tanked the Emp in OS and various other summoning mobs. It is a clumsy spell on a pet since sometimes you dont know if your pet will survive the last 2 seconds to land. Now I just Torpor Jabober and everything is right in the world. I would never think of casting it on myself while tanking a mob. I would have to start as soon as I took first damage and hope it hits by the time I die. <br />
<br />
Torpor has made me more confident in my shamanistic abilities. It has even caused the hair to grow back in my bald spots! It is the miracle cure for everything! Well not everything. Malo still hasn't dropped for me. But Malo to me is a raid spell. I have 3 other shamans in guild that Malo so I can do other things like slow the clerics and casters (RZ baby. Sure breaks the boredom). But that is another topic.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, vote Torpor. It is teh god! If you can hold out for it and camp the stuff it does drop off of. It will come eventually.<br />
<br />
P.S. For the people that buy at 60k and sell at 80k, they are the smart pmes. It is the shaman community that is dumb. If you dont pay it, they cant sell it. But we couldn't get the shaman collective (all thousands of us) to stop buying. Or could we?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">less and less guilds are killing the mobs that drop torpor<br />
<br />
id recomend getting to 65 and waiting to see quint for sale <br />
<br />
runes are droping like crazy .. but kunark mobs arnt<br />
<br />
<br />
supply and demand</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Ceno is totally wrong.<br />
<br />
Those mobs still die extremely fast.  Kunark dragons last about 3 minutes on my server.  Overking is killed as much as he ever was.  Probably more now that the cleric epic is so much more obtainable.  Guilds like mine now drop Kunark dragons.  15+ so far, no malo or torpor.  <br />
<br />
I only seen one 65 spell for sale so far - for 150,000pp.  Yah, really dropping like crazy.  <br />
<br />
Guilds that get runes will horde them for twinks, bots and future recruits.  They will dribble into the market very very slowly, except at huge prices.   I understand why they will do it, and I'd probably do the same in their shoes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Heigelyac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Sontalak has regular torpor drops.  Also Malo and Focus of the spirit.

<br />
It is called the Free Market system. Supply and Demand. Might want to look it up.<br />
<br />
If no one buys at 80k, they wont charge the price. If no one buys at 60k, they wont charge the price. You seeing a pattern yet?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Codlugarthia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Well,<br />
if I would need a Porsche to not completely suck as a human being...<br />
and if there were only one or two Porsches in the world that are being sold...<br />

then I for my part would bitch about that person, yes.<br />
<br />
You're right about supply and demand of course. I'm not complaining about that.<br />
I'm complaining about people who use that system to make themselves richer at the expense of others.<br />
<br />
And yes, I know that the existence of these people is a logic conclusion of a Free Market System.<br />

I am still allowed to bitch about them...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Um, proper analogies can be made to EQ. It is based on how things work in real life. Vendors buy and sell. That is real life. Market prices flucuate. That is real life.<br />
<br />
There are very few moral rules that go along with EQ. All things that people do: KS, cheat, give out free plat ae all faces on real life things. People cheat, people are greedy.<br />
<br />
You can bitch as much as you want, but I want you to understand that the only reason prices are as high as they are is because YOU buy them at that price. If there is no Demand at 80k, then there are no prices at 80k.<br />

I bet Mcroc wishes we all lived in a Communist society.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I bought it, yelled &quot;Rape!&quot; and ran away hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">You are still trying to justify buying and selling spells. Real life analogies cannot be applied to eq, there are further complications in rl for example tax blah blah.  Spells actually do not go via demand and supply, its what a person prices it at. Someone will price it at 20k say, wheres the demand and supply in that? its not there. If you buy peoples spells and sell them on more expensive I pity you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Wish we could live in your day dream world. I bet it's nice.<br />
<br />
And EQ does go along with the real world, or you would have nothing to base that it doesn't.<br />
<br />
Economics is real in the world and real inside EQ. If in here economics didn't exist, then there wouldn't be cash, or people wouldn't sell anything. You would just get handed everything your heart desired, or you would hand out any surplus you had. That doesn't work well because there is a limited supply of spells and items. If it worked the way that you liked it then you would be mad because all the spells had been given away before your turn came into line. Or you would be mad because everything was given to you which is boring, imo. Why work towards anything when it will be handed out?<br />
<br />
So since you say there is nothing real about how it works inside EQ then you are wrong.<br />
<br />
McRoc says<br />
&quot;You are still trying to justify buying and selling spells. Real life analogies cannot be applied to eq, there are further complications in rl for example tax blah blah. Spells actually do not go via demand and supply, its what a person prices it at. Someone will price it at 20k say, wheres the demand and supply in that? its not there. If you buy peoples spells and sell them on more expensive I pity you.&quot;<br />
<br />
I want you to explain to me how they don't have supply and demand. Because your argument says that there is supply and demand. Buying and selling = supply and demand.<br />
<br />
And there is a supply and demand with buying a spell and hiking up the price. If no one buys it at the hiked up price, then there is no demand. I will print out the little supply and demand curves here for you if you missed them in Econ class.<br />
<br />
Let's say Joe prices X spell at 20k. He is saying I hope someone purchases my X spell because 20k is what I hope to get for it. If no one buys X spell then he lowers the price until he gets someone to buy it. This is what happened with a lot of spells. If you weren't around when Kunark first came out some spells like Mala were going for 10k. But once the market was flooded with Mala spells, the price dropped.<br />
<br />
Now let's say Joe's X spell is currently half of what the EQ market prices it as. (The EQ market is a real  market because it is where sellers and buyers come to meet.) The first buyer is going to have a large consumer surplus because he is willing to pay 20k (the price the player economy has deemed) but gets it for 10k. Good for him. /pat on back  But let's say in comes Tony who is an enterprising young toon and sees that he can mark up the spell to 20k. He is making profit. Profit drives markets.<br />
<br />
When you, McRoc, sell item Y that dropped for you in Old Sebilis do you price it at the going market rate, below, above? Or do you just set an arbitrary number in the price setting and hope for the best. If you do then I pity you.<br />
<br />
I will agree with you that as a former buyer of Torpor it is messed up to buy a spell that I was going to purchase and raise the price. But since I won't pay 80k for it, then it is no longer my problem. It is the price hikers problem when the buyers band together and say we wont pay.<br />
<br />
I will buy something for half its price and hike it up. If you don't you are a fool and I hope you are a vendor in my Bazaar. If you sell everything for a plat, then I pity you. You should have &quot;Mcroc's Platinum store. Everything's a plat!&quot;<br />
<br />
As I said before the only people we have to blame our ourselves for purchasing it for use at 80k. If no one buys it, then no one would sell it.<br />
<br />
I want you to explain to me how it is not the buyer's fault. Morals mean nothing. There is no EQ heaven. There is no EQ pearly gates.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Morals do exist in eq, most people are great people, but I think its people like you that is just a plain ass. Ok if a spell say torpor was priced at 20k, who would you prefer to buy it, the shaman that NEEDED IT, or the ******* trader who buys it to sell it on at a higher price?<br />
<br />
Question, if you saw torpor for 20k would you buy it, just to sell it on for more?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">And btw I did Economics and got a respectable grade in it, it does not apply here.  I can not deny the mechanism Supply and demand does exist in eq, however there is more than that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Just to clear this a bit, what I am arguing against is people buying spells and pricing them up.  Yes the market mechanism does apply to eq, in terms of demand and supply. However there is no need to buy spells just to overprice them to others this is  greed pure and simple. The people that do this, I very much hate and are generally hated by others. Ever see the post about that *trader* pushed into the arena?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Crash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I was able to buy Torpor for 50k from very nice person who held spell in bank for two days while i sold fungus tunic and JBB.  If ya think I'm a knucklehead for overpaying there was a shaman offering 150k PP in buysell channel for torpor.  BTW the same person said he had two copies of Malo and one pox of bertox from hunting in Veeshan Peak.  Wonder if they changed drop rate there?  Go get em y'all!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I see where you are coming from McRoc but I still disagree with that it is morally wrong. It DOES suck for the person who wants to buy it, but morally wrong? No. Or you would have to say that any middle man in a transaction is morally wrong. JCPenny's, WalMart, any store is a middle man. They mark up prices from clothes, watches, electronics from the manufacturers. Greed drives capitalism. But capitalism works. Show me another system that does.<br />
<br />
This is what I am trying to say. It is a demand driven market.<br />
<br />
Let me give you an example. When the Bazaar first came out I was searching for an Obulus Death Shroud. I found one on the first day for 1k. All the rest were priced at 9k. Obviously this guy meant to sell it at 10k but forgot to add a 0. I snatched it up tootsweet. So now, if it was you, you would have messaged the guy and said &quot;Sir, your wares seem to be priced way below market. I think you should reconsider your price and sell again.&quot;<br />
<br />
But all I have to say is I have a shiny new ODS for a cheap price, and when I turn around to sell it someday, I am sure not going to sell it at the 1k at which I got it.<br />
<br />
Another example, someone was selling a White Scale to a guild bard for 14k, 1/3 the price that they usually go for. If that bard would not have bought it for himself I was right ready to buy it, mark it up, and make a profit.<br />
<br />
So by your argument anyone who tries to make a profit is evil. Well, welcome to communism McRoc. You might be happy in Russia. Oh wait, it didnt work there. Maybe in China. Oh wait, they have capitalism there too.<br />
<br />
Capitalism drives markets. Greed ( making a profit) drives capitalism. If you have neither, you have nothing to sell or buy. You are doled out what you want when you want. I don't know about you but that is boring to me.<br />
<br />
The EQ player market (you and I) have set that Torpor is a spell worth to the other people at 60 - 80k. This is based on the supply of the spells and the demand that is seen for the spell. If you sell at cut-rate prices do not be surprised if a merchant comes in, buys your spell, and marks it up. He is only making a profit. The people that make clothes for WalMart could sell to us directly, but they dont. WalMart is the Torpor snatching villain in your post. They do it to make a profit.<br />
<br />
I remember lots of items that were worth a ton (SSOY anyone?) but now they are worthless because the supply into the market was large and it is not a necessary item like it was back in original EQ days.<br />
<br />
Only when Sony decides to UP the drop rates of Torpor / Malo or the shaman community decides that they will not buy at 60 - 80k, then will you actually see a decrease in the price of the spell. Until then, it is not morally wrong for me to buy a spell low and sell it high. Hell, thousands of people do it every day in the bazaar. Buy low, sell high. Buy spider silks of low levels for 1gp each then sell for 5gp in bazaar. I bet you have done that or something like that. Hey McRoc, you are evil now. MUHAHAHAHA!<br />
<br />
What you want is a price ceiling on the price of Torpor. But if you remember economics that is inefficient for the players and the market.<br />
<br />
For me, if I see Torpor going for 20k in bazaar I will buy it, see if anyone in the guild needs it, and if they dont, well, I am going to go spend my big fat paycheck on Halas Meat Pies. If you don't do this, I hope you enjoy wearing your banded armor around buying rations and water flasks.<br />
<br />
But let's say I do that then WE (the shaman community) decide to only pay 18k for Torpor. Wouldn't that be a kick in the pants. You would exact revenge on me, the evil profit maker. Maybe that is the direction you should head.<br />
<br />
Your ideas are noble and pure, but in a real market (which EQ has) it doesn't work. If you can come up with a better system, I am all ears. Until then it is buy low, sell high.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Good argument MekuDeku, however I still do not agree. In the same way I despise casinos I despise traders who price up spells. Perhaps it is the idea of a full time trader in the bazaar that I am most against. Those people that actually go out and loot the stuff and sell them is more acceptable than someone trolling in the bazaar, seeing an item is underpriced to mark it up. There is an element  of deceit too, to buying an item of a person when you don't need it. <br />
<br />
Although everquest market does have the demand and supply mechanism, it is not like people need to exploit that to make it that.  For information, though you may say I am foolish no doubt. Someone was asking 100pp for a forest loop the other day, I did send them a tell offering them a charisma buff and he made an additional 200pp from that for himself from the merchant. Although I wouldn't if say I saw torpor at a cheap price, send a tell to the merchant to tell him its way underpriced.  If I needed it, I would buy it.<br />
<br />
And yes personally I would favour more of a communist type government, where fairness prevails over greedness and exploiting. This is to say I would not favour a government  that is entirely communist.  A free market system where the richer gets richer and the poorer get poorer is just wrong.  Imagine a low income person, say has some disease which only a high cost can cure, why should the richer person get preferential treatment over the poorer person. Say the poor person died, hey what a system it just cost a life, because the system favoured the rich. <br />
<br />
Although this is a far cry from the fixing price of spells, its example is still relevant. Exploiting people for their own profit because &quot;everyone is doing it&quot; seems to be the philosphy everyone confides to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Arghargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I have zero problems with someone buying spells, including Torpor which I don't have yet, and reselling at a higher price.  Who is to say that my &quot;need&quot; to make some pp isn't sufficiently great that I &quot;need&quot; to resell spells.  The one time I saw torpor for sale cheap (35kpp), I rushed to buy it, but was too late.  I fully intended to put it up for sale again immediately.  If it sold, I made some pp.  If it didn't, I'd have it when I hit 60.<br />
<br />
Supply and demand are in full effect here, its just that the demand is completely inflexible - the demand is exactly one copy of torpor per shaman.  <br />
<br />
The Bazaar, with all the full time trader mules, has, on the whole, improved the EQ economy.  Items are easier to find, are often more available, and prices more often than not have dropped.  Anything that enters the market faster than demand drops in price, often dramatically.  Rare items like Torpor keep their value.  <br />
<br />
The high price on Torpor isn't the fault of the resellers anyway.  It far more that players no longer kill the mobs that drop it.  They're all in PoP now.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>goreldar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Ok im new to this site, but Im on Saryrn server.  I have been lookin for torpor for quite some time now.  I have been tryin to farm it lately, with no luck what so ever.  I was farmin spells straight for 23.5 hours the other day and I got 1 shammy spell tali of the brute.  I got lots of other spells to drop, but only that 1 shammy spell.  I think us shammy need to do some serious bitchin about drop rate of our spells.  Its not just the 60 spells even, I havent gotten a few 59 and others.  It is sad when some 65 shammy dont even have torpor because the drop rate is soo bad they figure they can hold out till the upgrade.  As for torpor for sale on my server, i havent seen it for sale in months.  I have seen it once since bazaar came out.  I know lots that get it just give to friends, guildies, or use themselves but still there should be more around.  The only semi easy spell to get for shammy in 60 is avatar, and maybe malo if u got the cash to drop on it.  But ok I happy now that I vented on how ****ty our spell drop rate is.  Peace out....<br />
 Will update post if i get Torpor to drop to list the # of hours it took.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>iamagator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Ok, I'll tell you what I have personally experienced.  I have been on exactly 2 dragon kills in my entire EQ life (yes, I know I'm not particularly a seasoned veteran).  Both of those kills were in the past 2 weeks.  I have never fought any other mobs that have the potential to ddrop Torpor.  Both dragon kills I have been party to have dropped Torpor (2 out of 2 times).  I have read on this board the horror stories about getting this spell and can certainly sympathize.  Based on what I can see, I have either been really lucky or the drop rate may have been increased.  <br />
<br />
As a side note, I did not receive either of the spells as I am not level 60 yet and probably won't be for some time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>GrishMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I bought Malo for 70K and Torpor for 30K several months back. One of the posts above mentioned Malo, Torpor and Pox dropping off Sontalak.  I have never seen and Kunark spells drop off Velious mobs before.  I have seen Pox drop once off Talendor and seen Malo drop once off the Emporer in Seb.  I do not believe any of these Kunark spells ever dropped in Velious though nor do I understand why someone would lie about it.   I cannot believe in the hundreds of Velious dragon drops I have taken part in not 1 Kunark spell has dropped for any class yet you got all 3 off Sontalak at once.</div></div><hr />

  There are only a couple of velious dragons that drop Kunark spells. Sontalak, Harla Dar, and I think there's one more ...</div></div><hr />

Finally I bought torpor yesterday for 40k I stalked this warrior who had it for a week!. Then with Aego and kei I soloed a guardian wurm for the first time ever. I need to upgrade my gear till I can do it only selfbuffed. The 5 I soloed, got spirit of oak and tigirs, I'm sure the drops were better than when I grouped then.</div></div><hr />
