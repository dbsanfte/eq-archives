<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ughbash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Generally I am a firm believer in level &gt; AA, but then usually I am a melee.  Currently my shaman is 65 and has 14 AA. <br />
Run 3, <br />
Regen 3, <br />
Innate metabolism 3 (Drogmar eat a lot), <br />
Extra spell slot,<br />
Mental clarity 1.<br />
<br />
I either group (WoS or wherever), duo with my monk (level 70, 400 aa, Time flagged Elemental gear), or Solo (Nobles Causeway).  Currently my shaman is 3 flags away from Sol Ro Tower and Earth, 4 from Fire.<br />
Now obvioulsy I want to go with AA until I get Canni 5. My question is should I stay at 65 to get decent duo AA in sol ro tower (or earth) at least long enough to get what I consider the basics, ND3, CA3, CS3, Spell Casting Mastery and possibly lighting reflexes ( I figure 100 to 150 basic AA points), or Push on to level 70 once I get Canni 5.  <br />
<br />
I suspect most of my xp will come from duoing.<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">in your case i would say it is going to have a lot to do with your over all goal with your shaman.  do you want to gear him up, just use him to support your monk, actually group with him or just use him as a bot, ect..<br />
also if you have easy access to his spells up to level 68/69/70 or not.  if you aren't just going to use him for a bot i would say push for 70 as it will overall be more usefull than a few AAs imo.  if you have access to his spells, that will make the shaman way more powerfull than a few AAs. ect.  i am positive you will get better xp/AA bringing him to oow to fight in mpg and RS than you will in EP outside of fire, which you said he wasn't flagged for anyway.  i doubt anyone will let you bring him into the mpg trials at level 65 so getting some of those easy gear upgrades wont be happeneing unless you level him (click ft5 belt is much sexyness.)  also, as i have said in another thread related to this topic, some of the level 70 only AAs are MUST HAVES in terms of unlocking your shaman's power.  group hot and SC will be huge for you i suspect out of the oow spell set (hot isn't 70 btw).<br />
<br />
btw, solo ro xp is crap compared to what you can get in earth duo...with your monk tanking i am sure you would do just fine in earth.</div></div><hr />

Yes, it does get posted alot, and the answers tend to vary depending on the circumstances. Thats why I posted as much information on my situation as I did.<br />
<br />
Thanks Gaelor for your reply, It seems scary to me to go into those levels without what I would consider the requisite AA (I don't want to get the reputation for being a level 70 piece of wet tissue paper), but then perhaps I am biased by having the basics in my main before OOW came out.<br />

P.S. Plans for shaman is to get him to the point I can switch him to my main and have him be able to pull his weight in raiding alliance, while still haveing the monk for when I wish to beat on stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">&quot;I don't want to get the reputation for being a level 70 piece of wet tissue paper&quot;<br />
<br />
everyone starts somewhere /shrug, i consistantly see 3+ level 70 shaman lfg in xegony.  i can't see a 65 compeating with that for groups nomatter now many AAs they have.</div></div><hr />

In your case I would recommend Level him up first. The aa's are very important, however by leveling him up you will gain free Hp's and mana or at least I did. Then you can also use the runes when they drop.<br />
<br />
Being that my main is a 70 shaman Time/Kt geared with just over 300 aa's I know that the aa's are important, but you cant get groups without the spells. Yes you will be a Tissue Paper shaman for a while because he is not your main, but you will have a chance to change that with levels. <br />
<br />
If you plan on swapping him out for your main at that point is when I would focus on aa's.<br />
<br />
Here is the priority I would place on aa's for a raiding shaman. <br />
<br />
Canni 5 ( your not a real shaman until you **** a clerics pants)<br />
MGB (well duh)<br />
Spell casting reinforcement Mastery (need SCR 3 for this)<br />
Radient cure 3 ( get 1 at least to start then work up)<br />
Natural durability ( 10% extra hps does help)<br />
Spell casting sublety 3 (especially if you plan on using the GoD Slow)<br />
<br />
At this point you can pick two routes Healing or defensive. I chose healing AA first, then defensive because I like to be able to keep a tank up when the cleric dies. Healing would be a good route for you if you duo a lot, just keep in mind you will be a paper shaman for a while longer.<br />
<br />
Healing Route: <br />
Healing adept 3<br />
Healing Gift 3<br />
Advance Healing adept 3<br />
Advance Healing Gift 3<br />
Healing Boon 3 ( if you heal much you will love this aa. I can heal for an MPG group without much trouble by useing trushar and blasting when necessary) <br />
<br />
<br />
Defensive Route:<br />
Combat Agility 3<br />
Combat Stability 3<br />
Lightning Reflexes 5<br />
Innate Defense 5<br />
<br />
From there its pretty much open to how you like to play your class. I like to assist healing a lot so i spend a lot aa's on the healing. If you are soloing a lot spend time on getting a piece of gear that will make your dots last longer, it will be a huger mana saver. With the new augs out it shouldn't be a huge problem. <br />

PS<br />
<br />
Critical Affliction 3 is nice but very very expensive aa to have right now. With the new patch out that should change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Im also gonna say level up.  Get the core AA's as fast as you can (finish MC and get canni5).  You're a frog shaman, so you dont suffer from an exp penalty.  You might do as I did and put 90% to reg exp and 10% to aa.  Im currently 67 (10% from 68) and gotten 3 AA since 65 running that way.  Its not much, but its a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm a big fan of levelling up, but here I am at 60% through 68, and I'm grinding AAs, because it feels right.<br />
<br />
I spent the 5 AAs from Epic 1.5 on Ancestral Aid 1 and loved it, so I got AA2. I earned the 5 for AA3, but I can't get it until 69, so I got the first level of Reflexive Mastery instead. In MGP I'm just the one who does malos/slow and maybe a spot heal, but in WoS I'm a fully contributing member, doing DoTs, CC and supplemental heals. If I level up I get one more spell (so far), but XP will come in that much slower. So I plan to get to 99% of 68 and continue working WoS/NC for runes. <br />
<br />
Once I get Yoppa's Mending and Wunshi's Focusing, I'll ding and go play with the grown-ups. At least, that's the current plan.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've always said level &gt; AA, and it's true. In most cases.<br />
<br />
I'm going to say stay where you are level-wise until you have Canni 5, and at least your healing AA's (especially HA and AHA). The idea of going to 70 without Canni 5 just boggles me, and you're going to need that boost in healing. Natural Durability is also a good one, and so is Mnemonic Retention (9th spell slot). Grind those AA out of the way as fast as you can. Then level up, get your spells, and then start grinding AA again.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Now obvioulsy I want to go with AA until I get Canni 5.

There are very few AAs worth giving up levels for. Obviously Canni 5 is one of them. For me the only other AAs worth levels are the extra spell gem (which you have), the AA Rez (which you can not get until 70 anyways) and Virulent Paralysis (especially for soloing and duoing).<br />
<br />
You will get more HPs from leveling then ND3 gives you. You will take less damage if you level then if you get CA3 and CS3 (Going by what other classes experience - I have not tested this myself). You will have more mana from leveling to your new cannibalize then what SCM saves you. And son on . . . <br />
<br />
Basically leveling to 70 gives you ALL of your list and much more on top of that. Those 5 levels are worth at least 200 AAs and that is only if you regard the parts you can duplicate with AAs. AAs can not for example give you less resists on your spells or a +damage modifier for your monk.</div></div><hr />
