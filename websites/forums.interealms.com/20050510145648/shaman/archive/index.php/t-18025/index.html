<br />
scrolling through the new aa list i find 2 that intrest me <br />
Improved Innate Run Speed<br />
Divine Avatar<br />
<br />
and as a gimmic, maybe this is also intrigueing<br />
Enhanced Rabidity</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The battle plans and waypoints seem a little Planet-sidey to me. Guess since PS is such a flop: If you can't bring players to the Planetside, bring the Planetside to the players.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Virulent Plague caught my attention.  Perhaps an AA-based Burning Affliction modifier?  That would be in line with some of the serious suggestions made on this board lately.  Certainly would be an AA in line with our class anyway. <br />
<br />
Divine Avatar . . . an avatar you can cast on someone every 2 hours mana free.  woo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I sure hope I sensed Sarcasm there Landragoran, because the 350 mana sure as heck don't mean jack to me - what would mean something was Hastened Ferine Avatar or something like that, 3 levels each cutting around 20 seconds of the recast, and I'd be one happy camper.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If any class other than us ends up with Spirit Shield I'm going to start feedbacking Sony's idiot naming ideas.<br />
<br />
Spirit Speed = Get me the hell out of here!<br />
<br />
Looks like a couple of interesting ones. The Crowd ones in particular; could they actually be planning AAs for the Bezerker BEFORE people get one to level 60?!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ok...I don't see any improvement to Cannibalization or is that just me?<br />
<br />
Can we agree on raising a huge fit about it as soon as we can say for sure that we have been neglected again?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ok...I don't see any improvement to Cannibalization or is that just me?<br />
<br />

<br />
Consumption of the Soul perhaps?<br />
<br />
Exalted Companion... AA pet, er companion?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>WulfTyger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">No one mentioned Critical Affliction yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The ones that I think apply to Shaman:<br />
Quick Mass Group Buff (obviously)<br />
Fury of Magic Mastery<br />
Critical Affliction<br />
Swarm of Fear (maybe dreaming, but then I do follow Cazic Thule)<br />
Spirit Shield<br />
Hastened Strong Root<br />
Advanced Channeling Focus<br />
Consumption of the Soul<br />
Spirit Speed<br />
Enhanced Rabidity<br />
Exalted Companion<br />
Virulent Plague<br />
Suspend Minion<br />
Consumption (?)<br />
Improved Innate Run Speed<br />
Improved Innate Regen<br />
Improved Lung Capacity<br />
Blessed Focusing (We do cast Focus, but might be a stretch)<br />
<br />
There might be a couple more that we get along with other classes.  Obviously some of the above are for more than one class, and others sound like they are for Shaman only.<br />
<br />
Just my thoughts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Swarm of Fear is already on lucy; it summons a bunch of pets ala Spirit Call. Seems pretty obvious it's the Necromancer equivalent.<br />
http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=4566&amp;source=Test<br />
<br />
Hastened Strong Root - Wizard AA, I think.<br />
Blessed Focusing sounds like a Cleric AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">HAHAHA enhanced rabidity</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Swarm of Fear is already on lucy; it summons a bunch of Necro pets ala Spirit Call.<br />
Actually I think I saw it as a proc on a SK weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hastened Strong Root is a Wizard AA.<br />
<br />
I wish one of these would be an AA that added a resist modifier to our detrimental spells, or at least just the debuffs. Or the ability to toggle the resist checks for certain spells...<br />
<br />
Past expansions have shown me to keep my expectations very low though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Call of the Crowd?  LAME NAME!   Should be<br />
<br />
&quot;Call of the Posse&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Actually I think I saw it as a proc on a SK weapon.<br />
Summon Pets: SwarmPetSoF3 x 1 for 10 sec<br />
;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">What about &quot;Wolf Pack?&quot;  That has to be a shaman AA, doesn't it?  Puzzling to think of what it might do tho.  Best I can come up with is increasing the dog amount from 5 max to 10 max.  That would be kinda cool to have 10 dogs.  11 if you had your own pet up.  Might actually be significant!?<br />
<br />
O, and yes Shumm, that was sarcasm on the Avatar prediction.  Wow that would be an AA almost as useful as Hastened Rabidity and Innate Charisma!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Isn't there already weapons found in the elemental planes for each class that summon pets?  I know I have a Beastlord friend with one that summons 1-3 &quot;sets&quot; of Beastlord epic pets.  Pretty sure I saw a Paladin with one already.<br />
<br />
So Swarm of Fear is more likely to be a Necro swarm pet AA.  Guessing though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Wolf pack sounds more like a Druid AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Yeah, I agree with Giac. Sounds like the swarm pet AA for Druids.<br />
You think pet spam is bad now... just wait!<br />

<br />
How Dare you Landragoran..................<br />
Innate Charisme is so much more usefull then hastened Rabidity</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">O, and yes Shumm, that was sarcasm on the Avatar prediction.  Wow that would be an AA almost as useful as Hastened Rabidity and Innate Charisma!<br />
<br />
Some of the  peeps I know have grabbed Innate charisma for a better chance of DI going off. I don't think I know anyone that got hastened rabidity ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Brothers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Consumption of the Soul sounds like a possible canni upgrade, maybe it is a 3k hp &gt; 2500 mana  :D <br />
<br />
what I would like to see is a group/mass FA with fast refresh</div></div><hr />
