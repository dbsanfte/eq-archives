<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Looking for info on the Earrings of Veracity quests found in katta/seru.  Im espically interested in one with a good faction explination.  Ive tried searching various places with no results.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't think anyone really understands Seru faction.<br />
<br />
The zone is about 1/4 finished, the factions are a hodge-podge of infighting, and nobody EVER hunts there except for Seru himself...now that you just need 1 4th earring to get a whole guild inside the Arx.</div></div><hr />

not the best walk turn but will get you to the first 3earings<br />
reports are a pain .. spent about 12 hours in seru killing and wasnt kos when i was done .. when from ally to friendly lol<br />
<br />
its a dam nice earing .. but one hell of a time sink .. not worth the time in my opinion.. only need 1 for your guild to open the door yet everyone drools over the stats<br />
<br />
i belive for 4th you need to kill 4 dainfrostweaver type mobs (hit for alot and banish high argo list ) ... i belive they are on one week pops .. and i heard the banish point is really far away, maybe even out of coh range...<br />
<br />
as far as faction you start out as a spy(non kos) and slowly get kos  ... although can be done with invis in most cases</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jormal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not out of CoH range. If it was you would run out of tanks pretty quickly as they banish much more often then the Dain does.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bjarni Bludfrost</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I saw this somewhere and it makes sense...<br />
<br />
seru = no evil races allowed, but &quot;goodies&quot; can worship evil gods.<br />
katta = all races allowed, but no worshippers of evil gods.<br />
<br />
an agnostic dark elf is non-kos in katta, but is kos in seru.<br />
a human worshipping Innoruk is non-kos in seru, but is kos in katta. <br />
<br />
fyi,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well for example, im ally with the first person I have to talk to in seru about the quest.  Im doubious to a merchant there that I need to buy something to, so he wont sell to me.   And im kos to the first guy I have to hand something in to in netherbian.  So I need to know how to fix all that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Boss heads for Earring4 are on 2week spawn.<br />
<br />
Reports are the only hard part of quest. And they can all be gotten with 1 group and lots of time.<br />
<br />
Faction wise the 4 houses oppose 1 another. <br />
Hand, Heart, Eye, Shoulder<br />
You can jump between houses killing and never go KOS to any one of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I knew that killing 5,483 katta guards would come around to bite me in the ass some day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">For most people, going after the 3rd earring for stats, don't bother - there is better to be had in Cazic Thule now.  I camped for reports with friends for about 20 hours, we got 1 report total.   If you can get 4th or 5th earring even, thats another story.  :)<br />
<br />
I found that the mobs that drop the reports can be soloed by even a poorly equipped 60 shaman with torpor with moderate difficulty.  I could even do the red ones (Hand I think, it was months ago before I had any velious armor and stuff) but they were a battle.  Pulling was the hardest part for me because the pathing up there in the upper floor is probably the worst pathing I have seen in the game.  Mobs would warp and then come running back with 5 adds.  Gotta watch the roamers and fight in the hallways... <br />
<br />
Switch houses when you start getting KOS.<br />

The phank guide is the best one I've seen around..</div></div><hr />
