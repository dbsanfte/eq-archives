<br />
Now the NDA on OOW has been raised, can somebody tell how LDoN has been adjusted to lvl 70 players? Are the adventures harder and gives more AP's? Any new LDoN armor on the merchants? Any new and better drops?<br />
<br />

<br />
Brekkee - *Bigfan* Since OoW is raising the level cap to 70, will there be harder LDoN adventures giving more points for people level 66 and up? How many LDoN points will a level 70 person get for a regular LDoN? <br />
Prathun - The level 70 LDoN adventures are functionally identical to 65 hard. We have no plans to implement additional level ranges (such as 70 hard) at this time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, with the new solo content, the original goal of LDON to give non-raiders something to do may be thought of as met.  We shall see how the risk / reward from the solo content fairs.  LDON gear was really good for non raiders.  Augment farming either by points or drops may be totally unnecessary now due to the augment overhaul which can soon be made via tradeskills and improved via alchemy and poisonbrewing.<br />

????<br />
<br />
God forbid they actually remember an old expansion. But what is this &quot; for free &quot; stuff ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I do wish they had added some items/variation for the 65-70 crowd for LDON.  It does get a little old having a nice feature added to the game, that will then be neglected for the remainder of the expansion packs from that point forth :(   <br />
<br />
Does anyone have any word on how the new instanced zones work and if they share points with LDON or if there is even a point system?  I barely found out about the Instanced zones before last night and I didn't meet the requirements for starting an &quot;adventure&quot;.  I think it was a too few people requirement, but I was a little too tired to read the message closely.  I could have sworn the guy said that I &quot;needed to have more adventures, and then come see him again&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Whelp, there goes my option of 3-boxing a LDoN in my down time. Between no spells from GoD, and doubtfully any from OoW (still slightly hopeful), not sure I'll even bother trying to level at this point let alone continue playing. <br />
<br />
Fun =/= work, unless your a photographer for Playboy ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">So whats with Ldon? I did one when oow came up dinged 66 on two toons and went to do task system. Still need to buy an aug so went to get one started. Had two people at 65 two at 66 and wont give me one. Not even a high risk mission. <br />
<br />
Says either not enough in group or close enough in levels. Same 4 that do ldon all the time only thing changed was two at lvl 66. Just wondering if this is a bug or intentional.<br />
<br />
Nevermind. I missed the other Ldon post til just now. See if i pick with one of the lvl 65's will work for now.</div></div><hr />
