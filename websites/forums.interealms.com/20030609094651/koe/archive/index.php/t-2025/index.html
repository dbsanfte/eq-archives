<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tempeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well last night 7/23 was a partial success. Congrats to Morgrym who won the roll for the ancient ring when the AC popped rather quickly after we got the camp.<br />
    Unfortunately, he did not pop anymore after that for us until we all got to sleepy and gave up. Also, a rather nasty incident with some camp jumpers who tried their best to KS us. A big thank you to Anuin who provided the firepower they couldn't match, and making them waste their efforts. It was sad to see the display put on by these people. Also thanks to Tangere and Osserelus (sp?) of Obsidian Guard who spent a lot of time there helping and being very unselfish.<br />
     I will try to get the camp again today 7/24. The experience is not bad considering it is actually an item camp. We could use another person or two as it appears to take at least 3 to do it safely. If we get the camp we will try to hold it until all have gotten AC.<br />
