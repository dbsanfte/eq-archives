Only mob I could find on Allakhazam whos name resembled that is A Broken Skull Peer (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=11289). He drops Eroded Chainmail Coif (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=20780) and Steel Wrapped Visor (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=19990). Unfortunately, no spawn point is mentioned in the posts there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Nadox is kind of a weird zone for named.  Some pop upon a corpse death, but these are usually titled mobs.  Others, probably like this one, will pop in place of a normal mob.  The mob's name makes it sound like it is a &quot;live&quot; mob, meaning live troll.  That will narrow the search down some.  I've camped the Sentinel area and never seen this mob.  I know it has never popped in the Furious area.<br />
<br />
That means it's either going to be in the Nautilus area, the chapel/cathedral, or the area right before the open spot with the campfire (there's a room there with several mobs).<br />
<br />
Start/try these spots first.  I've done the nautilus area quite a bit, too, and never seen it there.  So, I'd try the cathedral (by Torrigan), or that room by the outdoor/fire/bridge.<br />
<br />
It doesn't sound like a luggald, so you can leave out camping there.  If it's undead (although I don't believe it is), then you go to the docks area.  I've done a lot of undead there, as well, and never saw it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think the PH for the Peer is the Seer near the Sentinal room, but I'm not sure.  I have hunted in Nadox A LOT, and I mean A WHOLE LOT, and have never seen the Peer.  I have killed every other named mob in Nadox except Inny and Razorfin.  Razorfin is a Deathspawn mob, but the Peer should not be Deathspawn.  Camp the sentinal room or the hallway near the furious blackhands and you'll get some other named while killing the Seer (PH).  In those areas you can get the Cloister Sentinal, Blackhand Veteran, Dulien Gedasi (Nautilis room or just outside it) and the possibility of a few deathspawn as well.  GL.  BTW, you should pick up at least one or two named in there in a couple hours and though their drops aren't great, many of them are very good tribute items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">From camping Blood of Nadox, it does look like the're fighting just outside the nautilus room (other side from furious room).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cirin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">On Allakhazams, the screenshot of them fighting the Seer is that long, greenish  (if youve been there youll know what I mean...hard to describe) hallway bewtween the room with the cloister sentinel and the entrance to where Nadox himself spawns where you start to see acolytes and seekers (Prophet also can pop off any static mob there)<br />
<br />
The big problem I have this the picture though, is that the mob looks undead, which makes me wonder if it was pulled from some other part of Nadox, though if so, I'm not sure why anyone would have pulled it to that hallway, heh.</div></div><hr />
