Slay Undead Change (NO NERF--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
 Over the last day, we've received a great deal of feedback and concern over the proposed Slay Undead change. We've put a lot of thought into the issue, and decided to hold off making any changes to Slay Undead for the foreseeable future.<br />
<br />
Slay Undead will continue to work in exactly the same way, and deal the same damage it does on live servers currently, and remain at that balance through level 65. Damage caused by Slay Undead won't increase post-60, though Paladin melee damage in general will continue to rise as you level up. There will be no defense penalty imposed while using this skill.<br />
<br />
We'd like to apologize for any undue frustration this has caused you, and we appreciate the feedback that was sent in. This change was well-intentioned, but we realized we were focusing too much on the potential of the top 5% of Paladins, and while the solution was reasonable for that sub-group, it wasn't appropriate to apply across the board.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your patience,<br />

Dumathin and I ( Dumathin is my RL hubby whom I have watched build and grow his character since day 1) discussed this a lot yesterday when he saw the PoN boards and he went ballistic..like dwarves have a tendency to do.  Thankfully he had no axe or lance in hand.  :p <br />
<br />
With regard to the 5% comment, I would hope SOE and folks do really realize that the majority of their players who plop down their 12.95 a month are ordinary joes and janes who do not have bot armies, unlimited time to play and an insatiable desire to BEAT the game.<br />
<br />
This is turning into a bit of an editorial I know.  But speaking from the standpoint of a one main, one computer in an average sized guild, any nerfs to my toon are grossly unfair.  Because there is a Sean SpiritArrow or an Iustus out there or whomever that guy is who can perpetually sit on Lodizal is not enough of a reason to remove weapons or methods of offense or defense from the rest of the player base.  It seems a no brainer to me.<br />
<br />
SoV has been out two years.  ST is still not a place to go on a regular basis for thousands of players.  I could care less the Sleeper is no more.  It was never an expectation that I would be able to enter ST and be a part of that.  Heck, I didn't ever think I would get a key to ST and yet finally after nearly 2 years it happened.  <br />
<br />
SoL has been out a year just about and I like many ,many, many, many other players have just begun to reach the aaxp points that are supposed to make our classes more capable and more enjoyable.  <br />
<br />
The timesink is immeasurable and invaluable.  To arbitrarily &quot;nerf&quot;  things that a huge part of their player base looks forward to and sets goals towards is insensitive.  <br />
<br />
So what if the la de da guilds or the one man bot armies acheive things that were not desired results by the game designers.  <br />
<br />
It is not a perfect world and there is no perfect game.  The obvious problems that affect everyone across the board would be the place to go as far as &quot;fixing&quot;  goes.<br />
<br />
Nerfing things takes away hope.  Hope is what keeps a lot of folks logging on.   Take away the hope and well, why bother?  So the end game is made difficult and put much more in line with what the game designers want.  <br />
And to whom does that make such a BIG difference too?  <br />
<br />
Not me.  And most likely not you.</div></div><hr />
