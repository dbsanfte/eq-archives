<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bcarshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am a level 63 shaman now and I sometimes group with guildies for Hard LDoN adventures.  All the other group members are 65.<br />
<br />
My slows are either resisted, at which time, I usually follow with a Malo and then a mitigated slow lands, or the slow is mitigated and lands on first cast.<br />
<br />
My question is, am I being mitigated due to my level? (Ie, are 65 level shaman being mitigated, too)  or can I look forward to less mitigation in hard LDoN's when I finally ding 65?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Mobs are flagged as being mitigated, just as ones are flagged as being immune. Regardless of level mobs are going to mitigate all the same. <br />
<br />
Rule of thumb seems to be , mostly slowed is 75% effective, Partially slowed is 50% and slightly slowed is 25%.<br />
<br />
Sadly, as you get higher in level and hit higher level zones you'll be seeing Mitigation messages more and more. :(</div></div><hr />

Slow mitigation depends only on the mob you're slowing</div></div><hr />

Thanks,<br />
That was the answer that I was guessing, but wanted some verification.<br />
<br />
I appreciate all your help,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Here's a question I don't know I've seen considered:<br />
<br />
Let's take a hypothetical mob, a Dufus Wallbanger.<br />
<br />
So I'm in a zone full of Dufus Wallbangers.  There are other Dufus mobs in the zone, Holediggers, Ceilingpainters, etc.  But we're fighting Wallbangers.<br />
<br />
Now, do all Dufus Wallbangers mitigate to the same level?  Or do some Wallbangers mitigate partial while others mitigate mostly?<br />
<br />
I suppose my question is . . . does the mitigation level change dynamically regardless of mob or is it fixed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I wish I could find the post that someone made about mitigating slows.  They did a parse of the damage of slowed mobs, and then ran a nice regression analysis.  The formula that most fit the facts was something like the following for MITIGATING mobs (ie, just use normal slow percentage for non-mitigating):<br />
<br />
Mob is slowed by (100-(X + ((Y-X)*Y)<br />
where X a mob class (ie, all Dufus Wallbangers) specific amount for which the mob is FULLY slowed, and Y is the percentage slow (75% for shaman, of course).<br />
<br />
The net result being, each mob has an amount for which it is fully slowable.  Let's say the X amount for a Dufus Wallbanger is 50% slowable.<br />
<br />
100 - (50 +((75-50)*.75) = 100 - (50 + (25*.75)) = 100 - (50 + 18.75) = 100 - 68.75.<br />
<br />
Thus, the mob is 68.75% slowed, or moving at 31.25% of it's previous speed.<br />
<br />
I'm probably not explaining this well (it's early for me and I haven't had coffee yet), but the general gist is that each mitigating mob is fully slowable for X percentage.  Then mitigation is applied to the remaining amount of slow over that cap of X.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ok . . . <br />
<br />
So all Dufus Wallbangers, when Slowed by the same person, work out to the same overall effect.  The mobs are in no way individual among the same &quot;species&quot; with regards to Slow.<br />
<br />
Now, I already know that changing zones can blow this up . . . Noc Darklurches in Natimbi don't mitigate, Noc Darklurches in Qinimi mitigate.<br />
<br />
What I considered a &quot;species&quot; isn't really.  A Natimbi Noc Darklurch is different than a Qinimi Noc Darklurch . . . but all Qinimi Noc Darklurches are the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I believe that's correct, yes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">In my experience all of the same types of mobs in the same zone are typically set to the same mitigation level. Same mode type in different zones or different mob types in the same zone or even named of the same mob type in the same zone can and often are different mitigation levels. I'd assume that they actually can set mitigation level per mob so it's probably possible to have same type of mob in the same zone have different mitigation levels but I don't recall ever seeing that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I originally thought as you taraddar . . . but I don't any longer.  I think that each mob has a &quot;template&quot; when it's built and the template includes it's level of mitigation from one to five . . . 1 being fully Slowable and 5 being completely immune.  I don't think that a Qinimi Noc Darklurch can change it's mitigation level.  Named, yea, different story because their template isn't the same.<br />
<br />
Just some more ammo for &quot;Class Definition&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Fandele Longtooth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Now, I know I'm just going to catch holy hell for this, and I've never actually gone out of my way to test it myself, but bear with me for a second...<br />
<br />
I've been told that any mob which mitigates slow will always mitigate to a fixed percentage. In other words, a certain mob may mitigate slows to 50%, beyond which point the caster will get the slightly, partial, or mostly slowed message.<br />
<br />
I remember reading a post some time ago (don't ask me where, I have no idea where I saw it) wherein a shaman and beastlord reported slowing identical mobs at the same camp. The shaman, using Turgur's (75%), reported getting the &quot;partially slowed&quot; message every time, whereas the beastlord, who was using his 50% slow, never once saw a mitigating message. The theory was that the mob was only slowable to something over 50%, but less than 75%<br />
<br />
I know lots of people will come out and say &quot;no, it doesn't work that way because everyone says so&quot;, but I'm wondering if there's anyone out there who's actually tested this in game, either grouped with another slowing class or using lower level slows.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yes, Fandele.  That was the point of the post I was talking about.  Someone did test that.  Go back and read my post above.  If the slow spell cast is a lower percentage than X, then the slow hits for full.  The mitigated part is everything above X.<br />
