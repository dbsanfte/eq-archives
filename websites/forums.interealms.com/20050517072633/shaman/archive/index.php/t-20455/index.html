Your skills are weak and you are not dressed well for battle. Do not return &amp; embarrass yourself further until you have improved yourself.'&quot;. Pet didn't materialise.<br />
<br />
Anybody know what's up with that? No problem on second cast of pet. Wonder if it's like an unstable gate....</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Damn, wish I thought of taking a screenie - never occured to me that people would be dubious. Off to FoB to chain cast pets....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>lokinoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well FoB is the location for part of the Zerker Epic Quest.  Sounds like a bug with casting our pet and getting part of that quest spam.<br />
<br />
Very strange.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm not dubious of it, I just like collecting fun SSs</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Sorry for the mini thread jack, but it's somewhat related.......does anyone own a pair of those chokidai vocal chords from Chardok with the Voice Graft effect? As far as I know, they are the only shaman usable item in the game with that effect. I think it would be fun to mess with people using it hehe. I heard they no longer drp though, was just wondering if anyone has any info about them....thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>illitian icerage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">They still drop, they are just VERY rare.<br />
<br />
They sold for over 700k plat on my server when someone decided to sell one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">ahem, well, sorry to bring up old threads and everything...but this happened to me as well....only difference...I have a SS... :)<br />

feel free to use it as you please...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Wodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Heh, at last I'm not alone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Trollfarceur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">It's odd, your pet's name in pet window is Kibobn, and the one saying you're not ready is Jentik... I'll see if i can reproduce this bug too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Wodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Note that the chat window was scrolled back. He just summoned another pet. <br />
<br />
When it happened to me I had no problem summoning another pet straight after the first one poofed &amp; I got the message.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Magneuss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">The only oddity I have experienced with my pet was about a year or so ago in BoT.  When I cast him up, he didn't have the same odd Jobobn, or whatever name.  His name was So_and_so's warder.  The persons name was another shaman, who was a friend of mine, also in BoT.  I used to have a SS of it, but have since reformatted and no longer have it =(  I have yet to see it happen again, but I know the glitch exists =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Tyck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">There used to be a bug with pets, warders, pet swarms, and wards.<br />
<br />
If you timed it just right you could:<br />
1.  Cast swarm<br />
2.  Cast Ward<br />
3.  Summon pet<br />
<br />
Lag would help.  What would happen would be the warder would instantly appear while your were still welping swarm pets and then the summon pet would tag the last swarm pet as your new real pet.<br />
<br />
We had this happen about once or twice a night on massive swarm based raids.   Six shamans and another dozen or so other swarmers from other classes throwing full swarms into a melee would bring the zone to a crawl.<br />
<br />
Then the pet information started getting royally messed up.  I even had a beastlord cat for a while.</div></div><hr />
