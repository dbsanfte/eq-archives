<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tavokk Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So enchanters, magicians, necromancers and wizards can now research their &quot;hard to find&quot; 50-60 drop spells. I wonder if SOE has any plans to make this type of solution available to the Preist Classes? <br />
<br />
After 3 new expansions and 1 extension, we are still having troubles getting our ultra-rare 50-60 drop spells. I mean we're talking Kunark here. After nearly 3 years it shouldn't be that hard to get these spells. Sony, are you going to offer a solution?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>thevolcanogod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I am guessing after a painfully long faction boosting forray to get Ally with Broken Skull Clan you might find our spells questable with drops from either BFE or the rarest most annoying spawns to camp on all of norrath.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Peonthis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Some time in the near future we plan to introduce recipes for the creation of certain spells for the priest classes. Intelligence casters can use their research skill to create these priest spell scrolls, and priest classes will benefit by having an alternate method for obtaining these spells. This helps out both priests and intelligence casters, and creates a new niche for research as a trade skill.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Stelmach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">On the one hand having an alternate route to getting Malo or Torpor would be great. On the other hand I have the sneaking suspicion that your local INT caster is going to charge as much as the going rate for the dropped spell if they make it. Can only hope a lot do it and drive the price down. Of course they might also just hold the line and instead of one copy of Malo for 50k there will be five. Guess we can only wait and see. The components may be harder to get than the spell drops now for all we know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Is the new researchable Wizard spell Levitation the same as the spell that we could use as well?  Hmmmm...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Serj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Congrats to the new rich INT casters.  Maybe enchanters will be able to research KEI and then will still charge for in all day long in the nexus.<br />
<br />
I'm really dreading the priest class implementation.  Torpor &amp; Malo will be sold for unbelieveable prices.  As for druids and clerics, their spells are a lot more common and cost less than ours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'd do the research for free on karana...<br />
<br />
Unless you're a druid.</div></div><hr />

They'll probably be high at first but the increased availability will bring them down a lot lower than they are now.  And now you can collect the components yourself and bug friends to combine for you.</div></div><hr />

Edit: decided to actually notice the post above that has this link.<br />

Why not now?  Why have inequity for a while?  I don't understand....<br />
<br />
I hope everyone and their mother floods the market with Torpor as soon as this change goes live (if it does, I'm still skeptical).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because they're taking the time NOW to code it PROPERLY instead of it creating bugs tomorrow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Fortunately I play an Enchanter, so I will say this:<br />
<br />
If you supply the components, I will research the spell for any shaman on The Rathe for absolutely nothing.  My enchanter is named Deria.  Her research is 173, which may or may not be enough (we shall have to see).  In any case, send me a tell in-game if you want this done and have the components (assuming this change ever goes live).</div></div><hr />
