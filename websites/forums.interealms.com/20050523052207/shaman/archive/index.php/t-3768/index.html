<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>TwoBrew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm not sure I get it...Why should anyone pay 2k for a Spiritstone when you can just bind yourself at the pots and get to that city?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Because its like a 2nd bind spot, you bind where you going to fight, then you can gate back to the bank, then gate back to your fight spot. Places like velious and luclin take awhile to get to from the pots, but with the stones, you bind, say in velks, then use the stone to go sell/bank in 2 mins, then gate back, while running to thurg would take like 5 mins, and thats a close dungeon, its all about convenice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jowjo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Difference :<br />
<br />
1) Spirit stone : Bind ANYWHERE, StoneGate to home city to sell.<br />
2) Pots : Bind at pots, click to 9? cities.<br />
<br />
Option 1, be in the bazaar, your favorite hunting zone, etc. in 14 seconds.<br />
<br />
Option 2, gate, goto a city, run to where you want, or even worse, wait 15 min. for the Nexus.<br />
<br />
I like #1  =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The reason I got a spiritstone was it allow me to bind in the bazaar.  I can get to:<br />
Antonica via Spiritstone<br />
Kunark via OT Hammer<br />
Velious via Gate Potion<br />
Luclin via Gate<br />
<br />
I am totally self reliant to get to any continent I use.  Ogres and Trolls get the best deal from the spiritstone as Innothule is nice and central in Antonica.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Browu Frostforge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You can bind at the pots now?<br />
<br />
Hm.  Not even sure it is worth it anymore though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">firepots are worthless as a bindpoint for me :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm an iksar, and kos in all places firepots take you.<br />
Being able to bind in bazaar/nexus and go anywhere on luclin easy, plus have ports to nk/gd/dl/odus and then another gate to cabilis is immensely more useful.  Especially with the new bazaar functional.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i actually do bind in the pot room and i love it, i can get most anywhere in about 10 mintes, which is usually faster than waiting for a port on my server or trying to take the spires down. Our guild has no port slaves so this is as close as I get =)<br />
<br />
also faithstones are going for around 6k-8k on our server. really not worth it in my opinion</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Bought my spiritstone yesterday and I luv it!  Nothing like being bound in nexus with a free port to Inno when I want.  The Shadowguys at the hand even have a snack buffet set up for all incoming trolls :) <br />
<br />
Not sure if the barby one is as sexy because it dumps you in BFE, but 3K for an extra port is frikkin cheap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hail,<br />
<br />
I like the Spiritstone of Everfrost's port location. :)<br />
It is the perfect place to farm spiderling silk and LQ pelts for padding production.  Even naked (well, bearformed) you can whack spiderlings and wolves &amp; polar bears forever while waiting for your rez.  I leave my spiritstone in the bank, and click it after death.  Summon a few spirit pouches to hold the junk loots, summon dogdog, and farm away until the rez is incoming.  Better use of my time than trying to finally max divination waiting for rez. :D<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Binding in anything but Luclin is a waste for me, especially the firepots.<br />
I'm raiding in Ssra 90% of all raids I'm on.<br />
The firepots are 3/4 KOS for me to teleport into.  I need invis up first.<br />
If I'm doing xp, it's either in ME helping with shards, Akheva, FG, or the Deep helping with shards.<br />
<br />
My portstone gives me a quick way to get back to Antonica without looking for a porter.<br />
It gives me a quick way to get to upper guk if I need to farm some spider silks for someone for trade skill purposes.<br />
It gives me a quick way to get to lower guk for power levelling purposes.  Lower guk rules for plevelling.<br />
It gives me a quick way to get to Cazic Thule for ultra supreme xp.<br />
<br />
Being able to teleport to more places is awesome.  It's access to a spell we don't have.  Never knock that ability.  You'd be suprised at what certain classes will pay and do to get access to spells that they don't normally have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Isazo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Binding in or Near the nexus provides a mobilization advantage for contested luclin mobs (I guess RC, Doomshade, Itrear Vius, Rhags).<br />
<br />
If one of these mobs pop and your raid force isn't bound in the Nexus, you are at a 8-10 min mobilization disadvantage.<br />
<br />
Further, having most of your raid force bound in the nexus allows convienent collection of people by porters.  Melee grab a (shardless) TL to bind for 25 Plat, and can be picked up and transported anywhere on Norrath or the Moon.<br />
<br />
If they bind in say Thurgadin, they need to run to the spire and then wait for port up.  Or get collected at Great divide portal for non-Luclin raids.<br />
<br />
For a character in an XP oriented phase the pot room may make sense, for a raid-oriented character its just tough to beat binding on Luclin (and therefore having a spiritstone is extremely handy).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Odaya Cliffhopper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">to tell you the truth? i like firepots better. as a barbarian, i am able to go to most cities, and run around safely.  I dont leave the four main continents often, and when i do, i usually can find a TP to where im going, DL or GD, and if not i can take nexus, but still, i cut my travel in half through firepots.  I just wish i was non KOS in Cabilis so that i can use that firepot since their guards see invis.  I dont have that problem anywhere else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">the guards in cabilis do NOT see invis. i invis up and run thru them alllll the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Love the Firepots. Since my system is slooow as molasses running uphill in winter when I hit Luclin, I am darn close to all of &quot;the old world.&quot;<br />
<br />
Velious is semi-tough, usually pots, gfay, beg for port or Tl.<br />
<br />
Luclin is pots, nexus, /afk to avoid gfay beggars.<br />
<br />
Would be nice if the Spires activated faster than once every 15 minutes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Chukzombi Astrocreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">If you arent in a luclin raiding guild or pre-60 id say binding in firepots is the best way to go.<br />
<br />
Anyone can build faction up to non kos in most of Norrath.<br />
I like the everfrost spiritstone as i dont have to make a frost potion anymore for herb runs.<br />
<br />
For me though i need to be 5 minutes away from ssra , VT, Deep or Sseru.<br />
i have no choice but to bind in Nexus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I was bound at Firepots for several weeks, and it was handy as hell getting to EC, Rathe Mtns, etc.  But after a few weeks practically everytime I logged on I did the same thing:  firepot to Erudin, run through Toxx, wait on spire for 4 - 15 minutes, go to Nexus and then run to somewhere on the moon.  So I just rebound myself at the Nexus.  Makes it easy to hit my current zones:  Echo Caves, The Grey, Mons Letais, etc.  <br />
<br />
When I was bound at the Firepots it coincided with me turning into a EC Junkie...I was buying and trading constantly.  But now I'm pretty happy with my gear, only a few slots I 'need' to upgrade (1 earring and my Leg slot).  Plus now that the Bazaar is live I doubt I'll ever need to go to EC again. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>SisterLi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Pots are great for trade skills --  makes it quite easy to check merchants for newbie loot, and to deal with merchants that run out of ore.  (Yes, I know about the refined ore quest, but raiding dwarf town's ore merchant is quicker. =P)<br />
<br />
But when I am not in tradeskill mode -- binding at nexus and still having a spirit stone for a quick trip back to halas is the best.  (I'm a 245 smith, and need a quick way home to Halas for some forge time.)  <br />
<br />
Note that the spirit stone takes you to 3 igloos while the pots take you to the Halas docks.  For getting to Surefall Glade, the spiritstone is quicker.<br />
<br />
At this point, 3k is well worth some extra convenience.  If I were saving for something big, I might feel different.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I love the pots.  Last night, I was in DN killing spiders and got a tell to ask for help on Renux for a friend.  He offered to come get me in CS with his druid.  I said, &quot;Nah, brt.&quot;  30 secs later I was merrily running round in Steamfront waiting for the group (who had a porter)  to arrive.   <br />
<br />
Getting back to DN is a lil tougher, but I really don't go there that often.  I have Thurg gate potion if I am in a pinch to get to velious.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Xalbus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I have been bound at the firepots for nearly 20 levels and I LOVE it. Even as an ogre I can use them with the greatest of ease (I haven't seen Oasis in months) to get from Oggok, to Grobb to Neriak or in some cases LOIO and OT. The Gfay port dumps  you right near the PoD lift outside aggro range of the guards, FP port sticks you on the docks so  you can use the tunnels to get past the guards. Lots of versatility if you think creatively. I have not asked for more than 3 ports since I bound there. Plus for my 30's I was able to access the Golras with a simple lev and SoW and then gate back onto the spires, quick swim and boom at a vendor/bank. gate back and run to the iceberg. Made a ton of cash in both drops and pp loot (must have been close to a k by the time I was bored of them) But yes a pot that takes you to SH and thurgardin would be very nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kinring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I've been playing EQ for about 2 months and have a couple toons in mid-high 30's and have never even heard of Firepots, what and where are they?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>korinna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I have made these spirit stones. They are not to costly to make, but have a failure rate. I prefer to stay bound in luclin cause thats mostly where my Guild raids. <br />
<br />
But I have found the spirit stone a vauable tool, when stuck in a situation where you are told to gate out and if you sit to mem the spell you will get aggro.  So you reach into your bag  grab your handy spirit stone and port out. Sit and mem gate and you get back to bind safely.<br />
<br />
Also talkin with Clerics in my guild and making a few for them, they have the displeasure of binding in not so nice places. They get a faithstone they can easy be set to a safer location than where they bound for a rez. Same can be said for Shamans, if its going to be a tuff raid bind close by easier to run back for summons, use that spiritstone to get to a safer location and  rebind elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Theres endless reasons why these stones might be worth having, the just in case is always nice to have. I am glad to have mine at a higher level, I got out of a nasty train by using it. When a rogue person thought training sont  on my Guild was funny. I use my spiritstone got out safley, gated back to nexus and got a ride back.<br />
<br />
Only complaint I have is the clerics one weighs .1 lbs, while the shaman stone weighs 20lbs. What they think all of us carry tinkiering bags!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I haven't seen these or maybe missed them in the Bazaar. What is the name to look for or what do I type in the search box? Doh, for Troll, of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Dredak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">The other good reason to have a spiritstone is that they are so damn cheap.  I mean really folks 2k is not alot by the time you can use one. (lev 51)<br />

I love being able to port to innothule, the overthere docks, or the bazaar where I am bound.<br />

<br />
There's a wizard spire out in the middle of the water in Timorous Deep.  If you swim down, there's a little room with twelve firepots, 3 on each wall.  Clicking a firepot will take you to an old world city (they are NOT two way).  Destinations include:<br />
<br />
Halas<br />
Rivervale<br />
Erudin<br />
Kelethin<br />
Felwithe<br />
Freeport<br />
Akanon<br />
Kaladim<br />
Ogguk<br />
Grobb<br />
Neriak<br />
Cabilis</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Firepots at n12000 p4200 in TD.  Talk to the cursed traveler and bind on a spire.  Invis before clicking pots, especially if something in some EQ city somewhere might want you dead.<br />
<br />
Search term I used was &quot;spiritstone&quot; and 3k seems to be the going rate on Xeg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>AlynaRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I think one of the greastest bind spots is the TD location.. <br />
<br />
I normally play my mage and shaman 2 box alot - I can always get them together at any location via the pot room fast..<br />
<br />
I normally take the Gfay Spires to the nexus.. <br />
<br />
If for some reason I need to change my bind for a raid, it's not really a big deal anymore since I can rebind at the pots later.. <br />
<br />
I'll get the spiritstone, for those times when I'm not bound at the pot room, along with fob, inno gate potions.</div></div><hr />
