<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cymil</div><div class="date">04-10-2002, 12:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This whole prom thing has been tearing away at my inner being ever since last year when I had the chance to go and didn't. This year is my last chance to go, and bleh, im stuck going now due to the ridiclious reservation fee they will charge if i don't show up. Damn my friend for saving me a seat. <br />
<br />
I thought about starting this threat as a prom rant, but I don't want a flame war so oh well, i just need advise. The thing is, I want to ask this nice and sweet girl to prom. I am pretty sure she would say yes, but theres always that chance at no. And now here's the catcher<br />
<br />
I am more afraid of her saying yes than saying no. In fact, I would rather her say no, so I don't have to deal with all the pressures of going out on a date. Theres all this tension, Im normally a quiet shy person, I blush alot, I don't hid my emotions very well. I don't like dressing up, taking pictures, and ect.. and Prom is such a high profile event, it makes things all the more difficult. So then heres the other point<br />
<br />
If I crave the no answer, why do I even want to ask her? Because I'de like somebody to go with on prom. Im torn between the two worlds. I can't seem to relax, or stop depressing over this entire issue. I have some major social anxiety problems when it comes to dating and flirting ect... I almost avoid it and turn a cold shoulder and the poor girls that flirt a bit too much. <br />
<br />
<br />
So, my final question, does anybody have any advise on how to remedy this social anxiety problem? So I could ask this girl out and just have a good time at my prom?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Roophus Gunthar</div><div class="date">04-10-2002, 02:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not sure that this will remedy your problem.  However, just think about when your 40, looking back on your youth life.  Proms only come by once (twice cuz of junior prom) but that's not that often.  If you like this sweet girl, you should ask her, and if she says yes, go and try to have fun.  You must face your problems sometimes.  You can't avoid this for the rest of  your life, so you might as well face it now!  I know it's hard!  I'm actually in a similar situation (I dont like proms, dances, etc), only, I don't even have a sweet girl that would *Possibly* say yes.  I dont have anyone to ask.  Therefor, I'd hate to see someone waste a great opportunity just because they are a bit nervous!  I know the feeling!  I hope this helps :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sionach</div><div class="date">04-10-2002, 03:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ask her &amp; then go and have a good time &amp; try to relax.  :)  So you're hoping she says no because even though you want to go, it's a scarey thing and if she says no, then you have an excuse not to go.  But hey, stretch your boundaries a little bit &amp; have an experience you'll remember the rest of your life.  :)<br />
<br />
When you're feeling nervous, I say tell her you're nervous; I always think it's really endearing when guys are all sweet and vulnerable (granted, I'm not in highschool, but if she's as sweet and nice as you say, she'll likely think it's sweet that you're a sensitive kind of guy).  Just talk to her &amp; don't worry about flirting or anything, just be yourself.  :)</div></div><hr />

So, bah, bah I say!  Nice guys do NOT finish last (at least not in my book!).  :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is one of those moments where if you don't ask her you will always wonder about what might have been.  <br />
<br />
If you do ask her, it will actually be a freeing experience, yes or no.  You will have made the move, if she says yes, great, if she says no, also great, you can find another date.<br />
<br />
If you do not ask her, it will set up a lifetime of talking yourself out of doing the things in life you want to do.  Do not do that to yourself.</div></div><hr />

I wasn't even planning on going at all, but my friends eventually convinced me.<br />
<br />
To be honest, I've never had a better time with a gal since then.  This girl I'm sure would be thrilled to go with you.  A lot of girls get really sad when they aren't asked to things like this.  I doubt that your nervousness will make her have any less fun.  In fact, I bet real plat that she won't even notice because she'll be equally, if not more, nervous herself.  Seriously.<br />
<br />
To quote a bit from Orbital, &quot;It's better to regret something you have done, than regret something you haven't done.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vanidar</div><div class="date">04-10-2002, 04:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My Highschool prom was interesting I'll say that much :p<br />
<br />
I was looking forward to it and was ready to go with the girl of my dreams. Bought two tickets at 50 bucks each. Back then when your working only part time and paying for a car that is a lot of money. Add in cost of Tuxedo rental and so on. This was a major event for me. <br />
<br />
Well my &quot;date&quot; ran off with another guy 1 week before prom and got married in another state. How's that for a kick in the gut?<br />
<br />
I still had a ticket for myself though but didn't have anyone to ask for the second ticket. It was pretty hard to even think of asking anyone after what had happened. I ended up giving the ticket to a friend.  I will say this though. I am glad I went. <br />
<br />
Senior prom is one of those things that you will never forget for the rest of your life. You will make memories there that will stay with you forever. Usually good memories. Go, and be with your friends. Ask this girl to come with you and just be friends with her. Leave all the &quot;Date&quot; stuff at the door and try to have a good time. If you get along and there is a spark then all the mushy warm stuff will happen anyway :) Even if there is not a spark at least you can have fun.<br />
<br />
When I went I had all my girl- friends try to cheer me up. I had a lot of fun just dancing and being with my friends. So I didn't have a date... at the time it wasn't really anything big. <br />
<br />
Go out on a limb here and take a chance. And just relax and let be what will be. Enjoy the ride as much as you possibly can. This is your life to live so make the most of it my friend :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Emer</div><div class="date">04-10-2002, 04:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Without a doubt ask this girl out.  Even if she says no it's not an excuse to not go IMO.  There are plenty of girls im sure that you'd like to go and sometimes the most unlikely are the most fun.<br />
<br />
My junior year I took a date and my senior year a bunch of guy friends and I took the Norwegian foreign exchange student and had a blast.<br />
<br />
Prom is one of those things that's better gone to and have a terrible time than to wonder what it would be like to have never gone at all.  Have fun, be creative.  Asking a girl out is hard and now is a great time to get some practice!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VaderJM4</div><div class="date">04-10-2002, 05:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Please don't mention social anxiety, cause I doubt you have it, and it irks me when people suspect they do, when they really don't, and can't know what it's like. Being nervous is normal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Simas</div><div class="date">04-10-2002, 06:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My prom was a blast.<br />
<br />
Being nervous, just ask her, if she says yes just go and try to have a good time, hey maybe itll suck, maybe itll be boring, but then you had one boring night, big deal.  However it could be one of those things you'll remember for the rest of your life.  Dont end up always wandering.<br />
<br />
If she says no, then go stag, or ask another girl.  If you go stag steal someone elses date.  It doesnt matter if you cant dance, dance anyways.  Drink the spiked pucnh, and afterwards go party with your friends....dont go to dennys though, we still had the limo an hour after prom so we went to dennys, it really sucked, we ordered dessert and they brought it (like ice creme or something) and then we were like can we have a spoon and they said no all the spoons and forks are dirty. Needless to say we left without paying the bill.  <br />
<br />
But yeah prom is a blast, if you go with the girl great, who cares if your shy, it only matters what you think about yourself, not what others think, so have a good time with or without a date.  But def go check it out.  <br />
<br />
And dont skimp on your tux, get a pimp one =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jorana</div><div class="date">04-10-2002, 08:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You should ask her to go to the prom and I hope she says yes.  You will always remember the night for the rest of your life.  Just remember that your date may be just as nervous as you are.  There will be awkward moments.  Hey, I'm married to the greatest guy in the world and after two years of marriage, we still have those moments.  Anyway don't pass up on a lifetime experience.  You would regret it later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myrea</div><div class="date">04-10-2002, 09:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd say ask her, and forget about the pressure. Your senior prom only comes once. Mine was 13 years ago, and I still remember how it felt to NOT have a date. If nothing else, maybe you're saving your date from that.<br />
<br />
I don't know if your school is different, but at mine the pressure was all from beforehand. The actual night of the event just turned into fun. Besides, the after prom party was really the place to be. (Before you think I'm too old and &quot;things have changed&quot; my brother just went to his senior prom two years ago, and he agrees with me.) <br />
<br />
You will be nervous, but just work through it. There are a lot of things in this life that will make you nervous enough to think maybe they're not worth trying, but in most cases, you'll be wrong. Take the leap, and enjoy that free-fall sensation.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaraxel</div><div class="date">04-10-2002, 11:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Simple answer:<br />
<br />
if you do not ask, you'll look back later and kick yourself.<br />
<br />
If you ask, and she says yes, you'll go and can have a good time.<br />
<br />
if you ask, and she says no, big deal, go and have a good time, or ask someone else.<br />
<br />
I'm one of those that loath dancing and absolutely loath loud places, but since my girlfriend asked me to go with her (omg, has it been /that/ long..? omg...)... well, I didn't have a choice.  We did have a good time though, so if I had a good time, so will you :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tymoria Brightblade</div><div class="date">04-10-2002, 02:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So far as anxiety goes, think of her as simply a friend, talk to her like you would any other friend who happened to be a girl and you'l be fine.  If ya cant talk to each other then what would you do on a date right?   I dont like havin my pics taken either, but it makes the parents happy lol ;)  Most of my senior prom was spent at our table chit chatting with my date and my friends with thier dates.  Not a ton of dancing or high pressure garbage, just talk!  From there just move on wherever things feel natural, if you want to dance, do so, if she wants to, humer her, it's really not so bad once you get there hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TrackinU</div><div class="date">04-13-2002, 01:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been to 15 foriegn countries, have met/dated etc more women then I can shake a stick at. (no not a use em and lose em guy).  Ask this girl out, if your that nervous, ask her as &quot;friends&quot; and see how the night progresses.  Instill in yourself a aura of self confidence even if its fake and just do it!  Like they all said, whats the worst she can say? No? okay thanks, see ya round. Smile and walk off. *then kill her pets! jk*<br />
Good luck to ya friend, hope it works out the way you want it to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rankil</div><div class="date">04-13-2002, 03:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I never went to either of my proms.  My junior year I went tot he senior ball, and my senior year I went to the Senior/junior ball at another school.  It's all about being with your friends, and perhaps a great date.  At the senior ball I went to, I went with  German exchange student, and all the people we were going with were my friends.  I found out from another German exchange student taht my  date said, &quot;You think I have a great guy to go with&quot;  (in the actual context there was sarcasm in it.)  So I still went with her, ditched her, ended up with another girl, and still gave my original date a ride home at the end of the night.  Every thing worked out well, and it was the best dance I ever went to.  <br />
<br />
As for you situation, normally rejection is harder to take than acceptance.  If you expect no as the answer, which you already do, then the yes will be a gift.  You don't over come a fear of heights by keeping your feet on the ground and you'll never overcome your social fears by staying home and playing video games.  <br />
<br />
Give the girl a chance.  Believe in yourself.  Both failure and success are parts of life.  Most likely you'll have to dress up in some sort for whatever job you land, and you'll always have new social situations.  Try to embrace them rather than resist them.  Got with flow, not against the current.  Have a great night at the Prom.</div></div><hr />

(actualy my power was out for a rather long time and I crave pretty much anything electrical, but updates here ARE! so GIMME!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taluvan Winterscar</div><div class="date">04-17-2002, 08:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is better to have tried and failed than to wonder the rest of your life. It's highschool and it's your only chance at a highschool prom. Do not live in regret. Do not live wondering what might have happend. Live and love it. If you are comfortable with yourself no one could ever take that away from you. Nothing they do or say can hurt you. (well unless u get beat up that's another story) But don't live your live hiding. Live it proud. You are who you are. Sometimes I think back to the stupid things we've done in highschool, and remember that they used to make us feel so uncomfortable, but thinking back now it's those days that are most precious to me. If anyone has seen the anime series NADESICO, here's a phrase that i really love and i'll use it. &quot;Those unforgettable memories. For them I live&quot; (or something like that. I can't find my DVD *cry*)  Anyway good luck. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cymil</div><div class="date">04-17-2002, 09:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I decided not to ask her, but WAIT, I have decided that I will ask her out on a normal date. The thing is, this girl isn't in highscool, nor goes even to the same highschool as me =). She's a freshman in college, and slightly under a year older than me. I think prom's too high profile an event, and a bit too stressful as a date event thing. I'de rather take this girl out to a movie to get to know her better.. <br />
<br />
And Im going to prom solo, I thought about not going but If i have a bad time, I can always leave, and if i have a good time, I can stay.</div></div><hr />
