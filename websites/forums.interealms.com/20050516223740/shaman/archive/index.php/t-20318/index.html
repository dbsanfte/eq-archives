<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So... how do you go about making an encounter difficult, without breaking classes or causing uselessness of classes, in the process?<br />
<br />
As is no secret, almost everything can be timed. For instance, take the Terris Thule fight, you know, exactly, when things will happen. Add some random-ness factor in so you always have to be ready for anything. Content stays so stale and unused for so long... with a little random-ness thrown in, with a bit of a &quot;DPS/HP nerf&quot;, you add skill, to an extent, again.<br />
<br />
Anyone that can play their class worth a lick, should be able to easily alter what they're doing to make up for whatever random thing just happened. That includes spawn timers for everything. Yes, everything. (To make it simple, let's say +/- 10% from current spawn timers). It would make everything, across the board, MUCH less tedious... because you never know when something will respawn as there's a random modifier in it and will further test skill, and keeping everyone on their toes, than worrying about whether or not your 1500ac/9khp unbuffed tank can hold it.<br />
<br />
Now, while I have yet to step foot past Natimbi (and I avoid there now too until they fix the fact that greens/light blues hit harder than dark blues do, for a bigger reward), this could even work in Gates without really breaking anything. However, in order to work in PoP or Gates, the maximum hit would need to be lowered accordingly... in some cases, significantly, depending on the random factor.<br />
<br />
Maybe even similar random-ness into maximum hit, maximum HP, etc. How stale can you get when it's the same thing, over and over and over? There's no excitement when you know, exactly, what's going to happen, today, and a month from now. If you throw a bit of a random factor in there, it's different, every single time. Even the slightest bit of difference would make the older content a lot less stale and would more than likely, spread people out a bit and actually *gasp* add some real challenge, across the board.<br />
<br />
Sure, EQ caters a bit more to the new player than it did 1 year ago, 2 years ago, even 5 years ago... but at least make it somewhat of a challenge so we don't have all these level 50+s with no clue how the game works or how to play their class, or what the other classes do.<br />
<br />
That is all. Can you tell I'm burnt out of the same old, same old, with little to no variety and the number of seemingly clueless people that managed to level to 65?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Some ways they have tried to make it more difficult:<br />
<br />
Death touch:  Usually random, no rhyme or reason kills all classes equally<br />
<br />
AE Dragon Dispell (timed and procced) :circumvented by all classes by use of clicky buffs.<br />
<br />
AE massive Dispell (TT as mentioned): Timed event, run out, run back in.  Hardly an impact to any class in particular.<br />
<br />
AE feign death: haven't had experience dealin with this, not sure who gets hit the hardest.<br />
<br />
AE dots: Raise your resists, or use MGB HoT all classes equal<br />
<br />
AE DD:  Raise your resists, or use MGB HoT all classes equal<br />
<br />
AE combo dot DD:  Raise your resists, or use MGB HoT, Cure.  Makes some classes useful.<br />
<br />
AE mana dot:  Raise your resists, use cure.  affects casters<br />
<br />
AE Silence:  Affects casters<br />
<br />
AE increase cast time of Complete Heal:  affects cleric (druid too?)<br />
<br />
Waves of mobs (Rings):  Pretty much everyone has to work together.<br />
<br />
Traps:  PITA.  Affect different classes based on effect.<br />
<br />
AE rampage:  Affects melee<br />
<br />
Tethered mobs:  Equal affect to all<br />
<br />
Rooted mobs:  Equal affect to all<br />
<br />
Can't root/snare:  Mostly affect druid rangers<br />
<br />
Slow mitigated :  Affect shaman bst ench bard<br />
<br />
Non mezzable:  affect enchanter bard<br />
<br />
Seems like they have tried a lot of different things to make it harder without breaking classes.  Death touch was a dumb idea that I am glad is not being included in new content for the most part.  The rest of the stuff has varying levels of success at making things harder.  The one slow mitigation is used waaaay more than any other item though.<br />
<br />
It is a good question how to make an encounter harder without gimping a class or group of classes though.  There is only so many different things you can do while keeping in the rules of the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shamad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hey, I liked death touch. Nothing like hearing Cazic Thule shouting:<br />
&quot;Cazic thule says&quot; Do not worry my precious minions, I will protect you! Dedmon!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok that's not exactly what he said because it's been years sense old school Cazic Thule actualy deathtouched from across the zone (when killing Dracolich). :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">how to make mobs tougher all around while adding some realism to the game?<br />
make melee class mobs use all the abilities available to the class.<br />
rogue mobs will disarm you, pp you (lol) instill doubt, in th e50's they will duelist if presented a back and nimble if getting beat down to hard.<br />
warrior mobs will go defensive.<br />
monk mobs will fd and wipe target on a success,<br />
<br />
<br />
maybe its time they made new servers that were simply eq on the hard setting instead of 50+ on easy like it is now.</div></div><hr />
