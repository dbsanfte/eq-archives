<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jeyche Deychundei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">... and frankly im disgusted <br />
First off theres the rule of 3... only three members of the team can have agro on the mob, the warrior, the pets owner (charmed - ench) and the healer (cleric anyone). <br />
I spy with my little eye the holy trinity!<br />
so there i am sitting on my ass canniing as i can, watching this enchanter charmed pet chew thru EVERYTHING and nothing was slowed i felt like i was in the future of everquest and was that buff bit were becoming.... frankly i want to stick GoD and 30 second fights and speed and all my useless crap up the Devs arse that came up with this god awful (see what i did there :p ) idea of a game consept.<br />
<br />
oh and did i mention that i was a malo on the pet every so often.... so useful!<br />
<br />
i want to see that holy trinity - yu know the one thats no supposed to exist right now - put in to a black plastic bag hit with a very large hammer about a million times and thrown into the bottom of a big ocean.<br />
<br />
Please tell me that its all not like this?!?!?! i mean i know im feeling the burn in PoP (HoH is as far as i got so far but i do actually feel these issuses. infact im an advoacte for all our changes) but right now i feel soo useless i dunno what to do apart from sticking my spear in the ground and yelling &quot;I'VE HAD ENOUGH!&quot; <br />
<br />
*sigh*<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Welcome to frustration thread #10456.  Let's open with the pleasantries and then we'll move on to the meat.<br />
<br />
First off, sorry your experience blew and thank you for sharing (even though you are like the billionth shaman to post a similar story and subsequant rant).  My understanding is it will not ALL be like that, but that much of the content at that level is pretty much &quot;keep the chanter alive&quot; role with some effectiveness on trash mobs and little to no impact on boss fights.  Malos does help the chanter and since the chanter does play such a pivital and somewhat risky role (even skilled chanters have bad days), your heals, roots and malos help make his DPS more reliable and will likely reduce your total number of wipes by one or two.  That said, although many classes could replace you and be more effective in your role, there are a number of things you can do by using appropriate alteration between root, slow (still effective on some trash), gimp heals and HoT.  Being an enchanter's shield maiden isn't glamorous, but it's a job.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gaesekki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">So don't use a pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I guess it's all about how you want to play. I did vexd a couple of times with a chanter yelling at the group to malos/snare when charm broke, and constantly telling us not to get agro but just sit there. It was unpleasant and ended in a wipe each time, mainly due to the enchanter being too busy typing in instructions like we were noobs and not enough time looking after his pet.<br />
<br />
Since then I have farmed vexd, and won it a few times. Strangely enough we use a beastlord for tanking, and he pre-slows. I slow afterwards and nuke or patch heal. Chanter pet is support dps.<br />
<br />
Our normal group is <br />
<br />
Beastlord<br />
Cleric<br />
Shaman<br />
Ranger<br />
Chanter<br />
Bard<br />
<br />
We are all elemental but no further in terms of gear.<br />
<br />
Bottom line is play to what makes you feel useful. I know if I am just sitting on my ass waiting for charm to break I am going to be bored and watching the tv. If I am playing backup healer and participating on every mob I am going to be on edge and ready for anything.<br />
<br />
I am lucky that my group of friends wants me with them so we make the most of what we can do, not what we can't. The beastlord is pretty well geared, around 8k buffed I think, but I forget.<br />
<br />
We also use the same setup for tipt but haven't won yet. We did get the named to 31 percent but charm broke and it went downhill. Oh yeah, cleric died before we entered the named room so we went into it with my healing. lol.<br />
<br />
Anyway, not sure if this is helpful or not, but don't feel down, just find a group who is willing to work for the flag, and think outside the holy trinity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Dumb, question.  Why do were you using only 3 people with a charmed pet?  From what i understand about charm, the only reason for this could be to only have 3 people on the mob's agro list, so the pet can tank.  BUT if the war is tanking, then you can have as many on the agro list as you want becuase the pet is on DPS.  This would at least let you attempt to do something...<br />
<br />
But then again when i farm in vxed/tipt i normally don't slow when a pet is around.  But that's because i'm normally the puller, and need to go get another mob inc so the group isn't sitting around as much.<br />
<br />
I've found sham are very useful.  Just gotta think outside our classic role and do something more based on player skill than spell set, ie pulling in tipt/vxed where singles are very common if you know what you are doing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">rule of 3? *** are you talking about. that rule is only if you want the pet to tank. if you have a warrior tanking, do whatever the hell you want. when i'm in vxed, i generally don't slow...i heal the MT or i nuke, and malos the enc pet. hell i pull sometimes too. there's plenty to do to feel useful, when the clerics CHing and your crit 4k heal lands when the tank is at 4%, you feel useful :D<br />
<br />
let me make it clear again, if a warrior is tanking, and you think there can only be 3 people on the agro list, you really need to grp with people who know what they are doin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>jeyche Deychundei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">the warrior was pulling... so he was on the list.. that was all... and a random taunt here and there<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well it aint Tipt or whatever. <br />
<br />
But last night in Riwwi I convinced the chanter to finally come and charm.<br />
<br />
I was pulling as I normally do and Bringing them back non stop for like 2 and a half hours.<br />
<br />
Timed it so the First one died about 10 seconds after second one got to camp. My hot box SK would snare on incoming and would tank 2 for all of that 5-10 seconds. <br />
<br />
It was amazingly good xp and fun. But yeah my DPS wasnt important At all. But they came in slowed. and many Maloed and Pet was maloed the whole time. <br />
<br />
Was I as a class needed. Not really. But as a player with knowledge of  the location and spawn points and pathing I was invaluable. As a Beastlord I could not have contributed as much because of Malos               however. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah that group didnt know about the rules.<br />
<br />
When a charmed pet has the max aggro. And there are 4 or more on hte list then Its aggro is 100% unuseable. As long as the warrior would stay on top of aggro he would have 100% garunteed aggro on the mob.<br />
<br />
The pet would keep it that way. But if someone spiked aggro at all They would be dead meat cause the pet nerf will force the mob to peel off the warrior like greased lightning. <br />
<br />
Keeping it with 3 on hate list And then Pet just garuntees that Warrior will have unshakeable aggro reguardless of if those three spiked aggro or not. (Then the rule is Hits closest non pet target) <br />
<br />
It is a safety measure because of the charm nerf.<br />
<br />
And stupid as hell to be honest.<br />

Dont make the journey up to the flag mob.<br />

Make sure the people who need flag have a map.  Have them make a corpse at ZI, res them up (but leave corpse), buff, give them Spirit of Scale (for 70% speed), Invis and Lev.  They should be able to train up to the flag mob w/o dying and hail the NPC.  If you have a bard, it makes it even better.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'm not sure why everyone suddenly feels more useless in GoD than in BoT in terms of having a charm pet in the group.  I've posted my times about the sorry state of the shaman, and agree that there are problems, and agree that charm is overpowered, but I don't see why GoD content is any different than BoT in terms of the useless state of the shaman.<br />
<br />
I've been in BoT groups with an enc and mage, both have dark blue charmed pets. Bot giants die in like 10-12 seconds.  I don't bother slowing at all.  My dps is horrible (as is everyone elses with two charmed pets), so I really don't contribute much.  In fact, the cleric in a bot group, as well as all non-pulling dps classes probably feel useless as well.  <br />
<br />
If charmed pets weren't nearly as buff, then the issue would be healing the main tank thru the longer duration fight.  Which, when slow is mitigated, makes any slower feel relatively useless.   Granted, if we had better dps, healing, meaningfull buffs, etc.. we'd feel more usefull with or without slow, and regardless of the battle duration.  <br />
<br />
But, I&quot;m always curious why all the shaman are all of a sudden saying &quot;omg, with a charm pet in the group, I feel useless&quot; now that GoD is out.  Its always been that way.  And its not just us.  IMO, charm needs serious reworking so that all classes can contribute something.  However, in order to feel useful.. would you like to see charm nerfed?  I mean, man, xp can be insane with charmed pets, and some encounters, like the HoH dragon trial, are way easier with the power of charm.  So its a double edged sword.  Sure, nerf charm, then dps classes and slowers have more use, but at the same time, be prepared for slower exp, and new strategies for defeating tough encounters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am sure you were speaking facetiously, but a call to nerf a core ability of another class, even in jest is ungentlemanly.<br />
<br />
Charm (In zones it is allowed (*)) is not without risk.  There are ways to mitigate that risk for sure, but there is risk.  <br />
<br />
Nor is charm a skill-set which is given at creation. Take it from me there IS a learning curve.<br />
<br />
(*) Finally, Charm is not available in all zones or on all models. It is situational.<br />
<br />
Let's think of ways to bring the Shaman class up rather than other classes down.</div></div><hr />

Are you saying you dont have to kill all the mobs (50? ) to get the flag mob to spawn?<br />
<br />
Or do you get the 1-2 people to do this after he is spawned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">You still have ot kill all the mobs.. he just meant do not fight your way up to the flag npc.. you can do it near the iz for safety.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The problem is them balancing the trials around charm pet users, so that you almost need one to pass certain trials.  <br />
<br />
I want to share a little information tho, that might help some of you pass a trial and kill a tough GoD named a little easier.  You've all seen that 10-11khp tank go down like a fat kid on a cupcake, but the answer might not be to get a better tank or add more healers. It might be to add more rangers.  Rangers get this neato weaponshield /disc that can be heavily abused to kill high DPS and low HP mob bosses.  Use two rangers alternating weaponshield to finish off the last boss in tipt.  Also, monks are very good for this too as a lead-in.  They can engage riposte disc and tank for a short while, then have the ranger tank with weaponshield.  By the time both of their discs wear out, the mob should be nearly dead if everyone else is doing their job.  <br />
Once again tho, slowing is neither helpful nor necessary using this strat.  However, it may be useful for helping less-than-ideal groups to pass hard trials.  <br />
Here's a thought.  Have three rangers in the group, one warrior, you, and a cleric.  Warrior tanks trash mobs while rangers pincushion mobs with arrows.  Then when the named approaches, chain /ws and rangers can do DPS while not tanking with arrows.  Only problem with this is that you have no monk.  Sub a monk in for a ranger and you might just have a winning team tho.  1 solid minute of invulnerable tanking is invaluable on these GoD mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">yeah, I'll say it, just nerf charm. One character, who is not considered a DPS specialist, being able to add DPS equivalent or greater than an entire group of characters is broken and unbalanceable. The fact it's risky doesn't mean it's not broken either.<br />
<br />
Basically any ability that automatically scales to the mobs DPS has an immense potential to unbalance the game as mob DPS climbs. That includes /defensive, invulnerability disciplines that can hold agro, slow and charm. This is pretty obvious.<br />
<br />
It's equally obvious that SOE is not interested in making substantial changes to the game mechanics, so they will continue to plaster over the cracks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">One character, who is not considered a DPS specialist,  <br />
<br />
Enchanters aren't DPS specialists?<br />
<br />
Damn, wish somebody had told me when I was charming in LDONs, PoJ trials, Kunark, Velious, Luclin, ............<br />
<br />
Nerfing another class does not remove or even mitigate the problems with the Shaman class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Froggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Charm isnt a must. And if you cant make yourself useful, the rest of the group cant either. Now, I admit the class may have some problems, but if you cannot make yourself useful in a group, or cant find some role to fill, then you have no one to blame but yourself.<br />
<br />
I know im not the best shaman, but I can find a use for myself in almost any situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Charm has been gross like this since POP first came out.<br />
Snare, charm, haste, duel wielding golems in PoV are just as gross for dps there as charmed pooka/hynid is in Vxed/Tipt.<br />
<br />
I've gone through Tipt about 10 times now trying to get BiC drops (before the recent patch to make them drop every time and making the zone easier and better xp) and to flag guildies/recruits/friends.<br />
I've gone through Vxed about 6 times so far for the same.<br />
I treat these as a *trial* and not about your standard xp camp.<br />
Trials are hard.<br />
They need you to have a good well balanced group regardless of exactly what the trial is.<br />
<br />
When I do Tipt now, I generally won't bother going to the zone for anyone unless I have my core group of 5 people all built around Pooka.<br />
My group consists of:<br />
-Me (sham) for malo on pet and slowing mobs (nihil helps sooooooo much).  I'm the puller for the group.  I Malos on the pull, and tag with Nihil on the inc.  Mark NPC leader AA very useful for communication with group for what mob isn't slowed if you get a 2 pull.  (/g mark slow, /g mez mark)<br />
-Ench for charm dps.  Mez is 2ndardary<br />
-Cle for heals/res.  I've never made it through Tipt without someone dying once, though I've made it through many times with only me dying<br />
-Dru for heals/snare.  Ranger can do the snares, but you need some phat healage on the boss at the end, and 1 cleric + sham IMO isn't enough healing power, and weaponshield doesn't work anymore<br />
-Tankage being War, SK, or Pal.  The last and only 2 times I've done Tipt since patch I had the same SK tanking it for us.  She has 2600ac in the group and 10k+ hps.  She had no problems tanking the boss while the charmed pet did dps.<br />
-6th group member gimp that needs flaggage.  Not really a gimp, but it's a group member that provides no real additional help to the core 5 besides some minor dps or extra healing.<br />
<br />
The purpose of Vxed and Tipt are there to be obstacles for you to get through so you get flagged for KT where you get the real xp and fun hunting IMO.  You get some very nice xp in those zones now, but they are there to be trials for you to get to higher end zones.  Complaining about certain group makeups for this is like complaining about certain group makeups working better than others for PoJ trials, or the xp sucking in PoJ.  You don't do an exe trial for xp.  You do it to get flagged for PoV/S.  Any xp you get is a side effect of doing the trial.  Same thing applies for Vxed/Tipt.  You get a lot more xp in those zones than you do in other trials, but they are still trials.<br />
<br />
Once you get into KT, all that charm stuff goes out the window.  Everything in KT and Ikkinz and Uqua and Yxtta and beyond can't be charmed, so any reliance on enchanter charm dps stops in Tipt.<br />
Charm is a valid tactic in Tipt and Vxed.  You can do either trial without pet.  Pet access makes the trial go super fast, but it's not a necessity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">&quot;Seemed pretty clear he was not calling for a nerf; rather pointing out there are consequences for doing it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Exactly.  I'm one to admit, I love those nights where we have two charmed mobs in our group, and I'm getting an AA every half hour:)<br />
<br />
At the same time, I do feel useless in those situations.  Keeping malos on a pet for a couple hours isn't exactly a role that I find fulfilling.  Tossing a rather meaningless spot heal here and there isn't exactly something that makes or breaks an encounter either.<br />
<br />
Landragoran, while I appreciate that there are always multiple ways to win any battle, I also feel that usually 1 way is preferred. And in the case of charming, charm is ALWAYS preferred in high dps, low hitpoint battles.  Weaponshield, etc.. are abilities that are on timers.  A charmed pet is not.  <br />
<br />
As for charm being a &quot;core&quot; ability.. well.. I don't see it that way.  Charm has become more and more valuable as groups encounter these high dps mobs.  Its a &quot;kill them before they kill you&quot; type game in most big encounters.  I can't ever recall having a charmed pet in any group, in any zone, prior to pop (disclaimer: prior to pop, I can't recall having a charmed pet in a group that I felt was 10x the power of the group and felt it was making the battle trival anyways).  Its an ability that has become a core ability.  Like, if all of a sudden an entire zone opened up where the mobs could only be hurt by disease:)  That would instantly make disease dotting classes invaluable.  <br />
<br />
Charm has become more valuable because of the design of the encounters.  <br />
<br />
I don't think we should nerf charm honestly.  There is risk involved (albeit very minimal risk once you know what you are doing), and there are some (few) situations where it is not viable.  <br />
<br />
I do, however, think that, like wake the dead, there needs to be some limit on how much dps the pet can dish out.  In addition, other competing classes (namely us:), need some boost to be a desirable dps additon to a group.  I've posted before that our buffs need to add significant dps to a group (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=20638&amp;highlight=ungkor).  If an enchanter can add 500 dps to a group via a pet, can I get a series of buffs that adds 50 dps per player.. pretty please hehe.  <br />
<br />
The most forgiving parses seem to show that FA adds about 10-20% dmg to a player (if they aren't capped, etc..).  Push that number to a 40% increase in group dmg via buffs, up our healing a bit, and I'll be a happy camper.  <br />
<br />
Then a group could decide &quot;well, we can take a shaman for backup healing and a 40% damage increase, OR, take the slightly risker route and get a 200% dmg increase with an enchanter&quot;.  Its not that I want charm nerfed, its that no one class can provide anything remotely equivalent to its power, and thats a problem.  <br />
<br />
Charm is kinda like wizards getting a 7500 hp, 5 second cast nuke, but it has a 5% chance to kill the user.  <br />
<br />
Enc: 70% slow, 70% haste, mana regen, crowd control, and 500+ dps<br />
or<br />
Shm: 75% slow, 60% haste, 500 hp buff, minor healing, and about 50 dps<br />
<br />
Thats pretty much what stat maxed groups have to decide between right now.  Its not much of decision.  <br />
<br />
Now, add slow mitgation, or immunity into the mix, and we all agree, the situation gets even worse.<br />
<br />
But back to the original topic.  I'm just not sure why shaman are crying out about charm.  Since pop, its always been that way.  Charm is a tremendous benefit to an entire group, but it does make all dps classes, especially dotting classes, feel insignificant.  <br />
<br />
In summary, I completely agree with this:<br />
&quot;Let's think of ways to bring the Shaman class up rather than other classes down&quot;<br />
<br />
Leave charm alone, but then give the classes that compete for that slower spot (bst and shaman alike), something to add to a group that approaches the usefulness of charm dps power.</div></div><hr />

<br />
-Shaman (Malos, Pet Buffs, Spot healing [God save the Cleric!])<br />
-Chanter (Charm Pet of Death, mez)<br />
-Bard (back-up mez, puller, Deftdance discipline)<br />
-Cleric (heals, stuns)<br />
-Ranger (snares, weaponshield)<br />
-Warrior (discs)<br />
<br />
We found that having a bard was better since we had 2 mez classes in the group if things went south.  I was prefered over a druid due to malos, pet buffs, and being absolutely suicidal when attempting to save the group.  Bard Deftdance, Ranger Weaponshield, Warrior Defensive, and Chanter Pet of Death = dead named with very little/0 healing involved.  Routine forced charm breaks mitigated the majority of the danger involved with running a chanter pet.  We would let the warrior tank, so we didn't have to worry about the &quot;rule of 3&quot; that I see a lot of groups follow.   The cleric and I would spam heals to keep the tank up, and the cleric had stuns loaded if the pet broke early.  The system worked well for us- we could get most situations locked down in a matter of seconds.  <br />
<br />
I am curious as to what changes came out with the last few patches, though.  I was under the assumption that there was some nerf to the chanter pet aggro when it came time to engage named.</div></div><hr />

The problem though is, all those /disc you mentioned don't work anymore.<br />
When warriors use defensive on the boss, they lose aggro.<br />
When rangers go weaponshield, they lose aggro.<br />
When charmed pet gets aggro, charm breaks.<br />
You could get that group up to the boss very very easily.<br />
I'm guessing you'll wipe to the boss though unless you and the cleric have new heals and good healing AAs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Torp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">The nerf in question was to Warrior Defensive, and Jhiru will ignore warrior if defensive is up. This was not a nerf to weaponshield/whirlwind/nimble.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Hmm.  I might be wrong.  I know I've heard that it affected weaponshield too.</div></div><hr />
