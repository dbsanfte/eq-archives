<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tranzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">was wondering if anyone knew what level stuff started going green at..as i play on the FV server and we have that lovely TLC code in effect so if anything goes green to me for my Epic it just takes longer and is more annoying to get done. Didn't see anything about it in the walkthough FAQ but always chance i missed it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">2 guys in Rathe are level 32<br />
Mobs in City of Mist that drop pages are 31-45<br />
Lord Ghiosk, Neh`Ashiir, Lord Rak`Ashiir, 53-55<br />
High Scale Kirn, 55<br />
<br />
I couldn't tell you exactly when they go green.<br />
<br />
But the Iksar Broodling in Plane of Fear is level 1, there must be something special that FV does to get around that sticky wicket.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tranzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">*chuckles*<br />
<br />
well i know that they made the tear non lore and non magic on FV to get around the TLC..since there is NO WAY to get to the Broodling before he goes green to one who can even go to the Plane.</div></div><hr />
