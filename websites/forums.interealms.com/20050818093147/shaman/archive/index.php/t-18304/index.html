<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Santero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The list of the most useless shaman spells<br />
<br />
1. True North because today all the n00bs start with max sense heading.<br />
2. Tiny Pet because at lvl 19 shamans can shrink the pet!<br />
3. Reebo's because nobody want to waste time with LDoN chests.<br />
<br />
The list will be updated shortly with the SoE next patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bloxr Fatso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Should take True North off the list... trying to invis at 29 would be a pain without a level 1 spell to work up Divination.  That and sense animal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You have flash of ligth as lvl 1 divination spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">a) You blind yourslef which flash of light, not good (or get high magic resistance to resist it which is basically a waste of time<br />
<br />
b) Blind a NPC in which case you have to fight them or zone - big time sink.<br />
<br />
True north costs 5 mana, Flash of light costs 12.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>kilher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">or c) cast blind of light on a PC corpse over and over...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I still use True North for Div Skill ups, it has a better refresh time then Flash of Light. If you want to use Flash of Light go to either PoK, Bazaar or the Nexus where the NPC's won't attack you.<br />
<br />
If you wait till 19 to raise Div by casting Invis you'll have to raise it from 19 to 100.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Never blind kited?<br />
<br />
Bah, shamans nowdays, so trapped into how people say you should play the game.<br />
<br />
btw, which one has fastest refresh?  mana amount don't matter with clarity.  think your going to oom with a 12mana spell?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Without question the absolute most useless spell we get:<br />
<br />
Tiny Companion.<br />
<br />
1) Same level as Shrink.<br />
2) Same effect as Shrink, but only works on the pet.<br />
3) We get it 15 levels before we actually have a pet to cast it on.<br />
<br />
What a stupid spell for us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I agree with Tiny Companion as being THE most useless spell we have for one simple reason... It doesn't work. I haven't been able to shrink my pet in a while. What's the point of having a pet shrink spell if pets won't shrink? /boggle hehehe Well, I haven't checked in the last week. I've just given up trying, so if it's fixed.. oops. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rubitt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">#1 extinguish fatigue... doesnt even work with the new melee system<br />
#2 tiny companion....  heck right now our pets seem to be buged and even shrink wont work on  em...<br />
#3 group scale.. mostly cause 90% of people dont grasp the concept of not casting after its on</div></div><hr />

Charm Animals (can torment newbies by buffing charmed animals and zoning)<br />
Spirit of Cheetah (can get away in pvp server)<br />
Scale of Wolf (I still can't tell the difference in speed between Scale and Sow)<br />
Infectious Cloud (It's barely useful because you can tag faction with it I guess)<br />
True North (the most useful of the useless spells-- good divination practice)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">How about our pet buff? Lol, I don't even remember what its called. Bought it a while back just to have, never even used it.<br />
Acumen, and group Acumen are pretty useless in the form they were given to us. I know you Barbarians may find the vision useful, but I'm an Ogre and I do not. The stamina part is wholly useless. I'd prefer a vendor bought, long lasting see invis, ultravision type spell for the few occasions I would need to use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>starlite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">all wrong!!<br />
<br />
ALL time most useless spell is lvl 58<br />
<br />
Talisman of the serpent.  grp CHA buff.<br />
<br />
Who even botherd to mem this??<br />
<br />
Tho tiny companion is close second )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Malaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">actually i used group cha once or twice :p<br />
<br />
Generally, when someone ask me &quot;buff please&quot;. Here! group cha! you are buffed :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Skwerlbot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Group cha is also a good crap buff for ae dispellers</div></div><hr />

<br />
With regard to useless spell, I gotta agree with the pet buff(s).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Hyperd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">If pet buff had 65% haste it might make people use it. As it is now I dont think anybody got it in their spell books.<br />
<br />
Stat buffs at higher level, who isnt maxed ? I want a higher hp buff that stacks with clerics/druids skin (group upgrade to talisman of kraggs that stacks with all spells, increases hp by 700 and contains no increase in stats (and contains a a manaregen while I am asking :) )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Koushirou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I got pet buff only because it makes my spell book look more complete.  I actually do use it sometimes, though, whenever I'm not hasting the group.  Much easier to target puppy just by hitting the spell instead of F1ing twice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">How about our pet buff? Lol, I don't even remember what its called. Bought it a while back just to have, never even used it.<br />

I'd prefer a vendor bought, long lasting see invis, ultravision type spell for the few occasions I would need to use it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Uhhh....okay.  Acumen is 63 minute duration.  Yes, its not vendor bought.  But in Seb it drops commonly from reets and Myconids.  I was clearing to Trak and hanging out near the mushroom men (myconids) and I got 2 copies in about 50 minutes.  It also drops from the higher level mobs in Skyfire (GW, ancient wyvren)  Spirit sight, on the other hand, is a 27 minute duration.  Ultravision is 36 minutes ( If I remember correctly)<br />
<br />
Acumen - 75 mana  63 min duration<br />
          -or-<br />
Ultravision - 55 mana   36 min   \<br />
           - AND -                                                                  <br />
Spirit sight  - 20 mana  27 min  /<br />
<br />
You would have to cast ultra and spirit 2 times (3 times for spirit) to equal the length of Acumen, so it works out to 150 mana (170 mana) and a 72 minute duration.<br />
<br />
Why you WOULDN't use acumen is beyond me.  Just because it had the worthless sta regen taken away people treat it as if the spell is broken.  Its not.  Its every bit as usefull as it was before.</div></div><hr />

<br />
True north costs 5 mana, Flash of light costs 12.<br />
<br />
or d) Keep pressing Alt 1 (Flash of Light in gem 1).<br />
<br />
You don't have to be able to see to use spells. :)  I alternated between True North and Flash of Light.  Alt 1... Alt 2... Alt 1...<br />
<br />
<br />
Most useless spell?  Charm Animal.  Unless you want to get the PoD in Gfay killed.  :)</div></div><hr />

Usless spell, doesn't work, when you cast it, it doesn't cure blindness.<br />
<br />
There was a patch a while back when they said they fixed it, they never did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Tienen Crazywolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">seemed to help with black reavers, unless it was a coincidence the blindness wore off.Its been over a year since I did them tho.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is a named during the Fennin Ro script that blinds for pretty long also.  Our MT is usually blind for the whole duration of the fight.  I never bought cure blindness so I dunno if it cures it or not.  Im not sure if anyone else has tried curing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Popu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Cure blindness doesn't seem to work at all. Found this out PLing my bard on lightcrawlers in DSP. Managed to cast it 3 times once and shortly after the 3rd cast it wore off.</div></div><hr />

Cure Blindness (have you ever tried curing blindness with this spell?)<br />
Spirit Quickening<br />
<br />
<br />
Both i've gotten my money out of.  <br />
<br />
  -Spirit Quickening supposedly stacks with sltw, dunno he seems to interupt casters more.  <br />
<br />
   -Cure blindness I've used in various situations where I knew I was gonna get blinded.  My epic with the reavers for one, never had too much difficulty having it cure me or anyone else.  Just would setup a hotkey and target self and group members and spam like mad like mad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Wulfbane<br />
<br />
I researched it. I probably used it 5x in groups before I got focus, topped off the gimp melees who didnt have over 200 str, coupled with ToK and IoS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Fulaq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Just would setup a hotkey and target self and group members and spam like mad like mad.<br />

<br />
I guarantee you it wore off you didn't cure it, all you did was waste mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Most worthless spell?<br />
ANYTHING THAT HAS AGILITY AS A COMPONENT.<br />
Idiot tanks and placebo buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Invigor, Extinguish Fatigue - I use them - may become useless if melee changes go live as idiotically intended<br />
Creeping Vision - if you chain this (target critter your target sees, drop and recast) you can do some insane scouting<br />
Cure Blindness (have you ever tried curing blindness with this spell?) - yes...used to duo with a warrior in MSeru and DSP...cured blindness from LCs many times<br />
Spirit Quickening - my pick for most useless spell ever - if it did ANYTHING beneficial it could be so cool (/em ponders insanely uber BL pet buffs)<br />
Charm Animals (can torment newbies by buffing charmed animals and zoning) - used this in MSeru to solo before I got my pet.<br />
Spirit of Cheetah (can get away in pvp server) - saved my butt when invis dropped in the tunnel in gunthak once when going to dulak.<br />
Scale of Wolf (I still can't tell the difference in speed between Scale and Sow) - speed difference is minimal - I've tried using it in safe zones to improve speed and it doesn't seem to do squat<br />
Infectious Cloud (It's barely useful because you can tag faction with it I guess)<br />
True North - div practice as stated<br />
Tiny Companion - should work - very annoying<br />
<br />
Most worthless spell?<br />
ANYTHING THAT HAS AGILITY AS A COMPONENT.<br />
Idiot tanks and placebo buffs.<br />
<br />
I really have no idea what you're attempting to say, but I cast agility buffs - they raise AC - which is a good thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Yhakfiend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">ACTUALLY... <br />
<br />
Talisman of Raptor is one of my 4-spell junk buffs anytime we're fighting a dispelling mob.  <br />
<br />
Usually I'll stack Acumen of Dar Khura, Talisman of Raptor, Talisman of Epuration, and Talisman of Shadoo... Unless it's a poison / disease resist type mob, in which case I usually replace Epur/Shadoo with Spirit of Bih'Li / Pack Shrew and Talisman of Alacrity, because it's not usually necessary when stacked with 'chanter haste or SLTW.  <br />
<br />
Also, all 3 of my Reebo's spells are very, very useful, considering I spend a good 75% of my playing time in LDoN dungeons.  <br />
<br />
IMO, the most useless spell in my book is either Scale of Wolf or Tiny Companion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Daekar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Only spells I've ever found totally pointless in all my time would have to be.  By totally I mean I haven't used them more than once if that lol.<br />
<br />
Spirit Quickening, tremble in awe of it's pointlessness!<br />
Shrink Companion, riiiiight.......what can you say about this one....<br />
Any of our Stamina heal spells, with the exception of Acumen (hey go figure the ultra + see invis coupled with the duration make it hella usefull, even if the sta regen is pointless).  <br />
<br />
I'll be glad when they kill the sta heal lines with these new melee changes.....though I do hope they keep acumen in at least in some form.  I'd miss the long duration see invis and ultravision /sniff.<br />
<br />
I'd say everything else has it's place even if rarely used.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Never blind kited?<br />
<br />
Bah, shamans nowdays, so trapped into how people say you should play the game.<br />
<br />
I hear you... I'd bet that a good number of the 'modern' Shaman never used this.<br />
<br />
I still use Flash of Light and Blinding Luminance at times... very useful in some situations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Cerath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Both i've gotten my money out of.  <br />
<br />
  -Spirit Quickening supposedly stacks with sltw, dunno he seems to interupt casters more.<br />
<br />
If I remember right, it stacks with sltw because it has additional benefits besides the haste.  It'll still give the str and ac bonus with sltw on, but sltw will override its haste component.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Agree with Rubitt except reverse 1 and 2.  Tiny Companion is beyond a doubt the most pathetic PoS spell we get.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At my absolute brokest, I bought a buttload of ivory from vendors for 10pp each, Imbued, resold for 25pp each.  It ended up being several thousand pp.  Got more mileage out of it than Cure Blindness for sure (no, Cure Blindness does not work). :p</div></div><hr />
