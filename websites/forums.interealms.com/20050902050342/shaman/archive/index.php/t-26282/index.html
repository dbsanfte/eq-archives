<br />
I had several 1500-1700 + double evis's in SM this morning twinking, should see the damage spam, it is crazy, will post a screeny if can figure it out. In one shot had probably close to 4000 damage in numbers showing from one combat round.<br />

Woot. BF rules.<br />

Me too (shaman: better searing totem, no rez sick after reincarnate).</div></div><hr />

Just nice seeing your hits on BF so you know what it is doing. At one point I had 4000 + damage on screen, that is some serious dps boy howdy.</div></div><hr />

Hmmm - I feel like I read this somewhere . . . oh wait!  Now I remember!<br />
In one shot had probably close to 4000 damage in numbers showing from one combat round. <br />
Looking forward to the screen shot - must look awesome!</div></div><hr />

Poor warlocks still need some help.  They are the least played class by far now.  Oh and the new ui bars are great and don't lag at all like addons do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">was only semi-woot, no poison or nothing in this shot, I will get a better one with the 1700 +.<br />

not shabby though.</div></div><hr />

Liking the BF showing also have a better grasp whats going on to the add/extra now. I have to much fun with it sometimes gets me extra healing from my wife along with a glare when i pick bad times.</div></div><hr />

Got my little 40 mage into the 300's briefly with IAE, he gonna be fun.<br />
<br />
I would swear, and my roomate says the same, that somehow they mae BF work better tha before, but I have no way to tell. I do lots of sm runs twinking my alts, usually, Whitemane and Morgrain, when you kill themthe second time, I AR and BF and always used to have about 1/3 health left on Morgraine when Whitemane died, lately, seems to be either kiling him first, or at the same time, it is beefy.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm going to respec combat (swords) as soon as I can get my hands on a Thrash blade and something decent for offhand.  That seal fate bug fix really slowed down the PLing- bastards!  :p <br />
<br />
Mill, have you noticed a drop in your crit evis damage? I was consistently hitting over 700 on crit evis' (800 on casters) but now the highest I'm getting is upper 600's.  It's not gamebreaking or anything to me but it looks like something got changed- maybe the way AC mitigation works for crits?<br />
<br />
Having suffered through a mage dps nerf, a paladin dps nerf and a rogue dps nerf I can honestly say the rogue nerf has hurt the least.  In the first 2 cases the nerf affected the &quot;fun&quot; factor of my gameplay which ruined the class. The nerf to rogues in no way reduced the amount of fun I'm having and when I respec combat I won't even notice it.  Man did I pick the right class- even the nerfs don't bother me.  :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">No, have fairly often 1900 + crits on casters, no real difference I notice as of yet. You knew the SF fix was coming, that is good you still are fine.<br />
<br />
it is just insane the dps I can shovel out while AR and BF are up though. My roomate is specced like me and yesterday we got to wade into a group of 6 alliance, high 30's to low 50's, and we killed them all in about 15-20 seconds with almost no health loss, was awesome. Course a 60 pally still takes you 30 seconds or more with 6 peeps on em, heh!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">They beef up shamans and rogues, and nerf fear. Awesomest patch ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">How did they nerf fear?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Mana cost got like, tripled.<br />
<br />
But spellstone is 1% chance to crit or firestone is +15 fire damage!11!11<br />
<br />
Only fire spells I use is Immolate, and hellfire. Hellfire doesn't benefit from +damage items as far as I can tell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ranlron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">My experience on the recieving end of fear indicates it needs to be nerfed for PvP.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Well, the real nerfs were made to hunters.  Whether you call it a bug fix or inadvertant result of &quot;world team&quot; changes (Caydiem's words, not mine), hunter dps was reduced and pet abilities were reduced or removed.  Not whining, just stating fact.<br />
<br />
Happy for you Millman, rogues really needed a boost. :P<br />
<br />
Sorry for you Griz, Warlocks actually do need some love.<br />
<br />
If I see one more Undead rogue (or NE hunter) I'm gonna throw up.</div></div><hr />

You forgot the part that dealing damage usually breaks fear early. Hitting you with a shadow bolt is almost a guaranteed fear break.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ranlron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">But that doesn't matter in a group vs group situation. Another warlock, priest, or the same warlock just fears you again before you can get back in melee range. That's the no-diminishing-returns problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Kind of funny, was pvp'n in Azshara before servers went down, my brother logged out his 60 warrior for his 53 hunter, because the hunter is so much more useful hehe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I thought you became immune after 3 fears. At least that's what my experience is with fear and PVP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Fear is a non issue, be undead, or be a blacksmith :) Funny seeing a priest fear everyone away while you sit there and ram your maces up their behind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Yeah, but you better have good timing on the blacksmith trinket.  Blow your wad early and you're still getting feared and waiting for the refresh :).  Wait too long and you're still getting feared, mashing your hotkey in futility :).<br />
<br />
I like getting them back though... intimidating shout is fun to use hehehe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That really hasn't been the case in my experience. When I get feared, and I'm mostly thinking priests here I have Power Word on me, and then whatever their long casting nuke is. Priests are the one class I try to avoid fighting, but not so much warlocks. It probably has to do with the priest's ability to heal up to full almost immediatly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Plow through a priests hp bar, even shielded, within 15 seconds anyway. Bust shield, kick em in the jimmy, they are done. I suspect alot of priests go the massive intel route here once again, funny seeing them die with 3/4 of their mana left.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Yeah, dueling a priest with my rogue wasn't a big deal.  I just did massive damage on their shield, used kicks and killed them.<br />
<br />
My warrior on the other hand, omg, I have no clue how I can ever beat a priest one on one.  No idea.  I duel my wife's priest and at the end she is full health and no less than half mana.  Cooldown on all of my interrupts is too long to avoid a priest getting off a dot/shield/heal.  Slap a dot on me and shield then nuke and I'm toast.  Add fear into it?  Sheesh.<br />
<br />
/em waits for the &quot;you suck as a warrior, I have no problems with that&quot; posts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Ok the fight for me seems to go<br />
<br />
Cheapshot - BS <br />
<br />
Feared, dotted, nuked, shield, heal<br />
<br />
Sprint up SS, Gouge, Kick<br />
<br />
FEARED, dotted, nuked, shield, heal<br />
<br />
Run up, heal pot - dotted, nuke dead<br />
<br />
Or something along those lines. Basically I can't seem to do enough quick damage in between fears to knock one down. Any ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Not without fear immune I don't cappi, any battle I and my rommate are the designated priest killers, me with smithing trinket, he with wotf. Fear sucks when my timer is down I must admit.<br />
<br />
Got improved kick? Doesn't that silence them for a few seconds? I do, forget how it works though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I did, but their absorb shield seems to block it. Plus it's only 2 seconds, on insta cast spells like fear it doesn't do the 5 second cooldown like it would on heals. I said screw it, dropped it and bought an extra 2% dodge :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Blade Flurry so far I enjoy even more than Cold Blood. This talent combined with Adrenaline Rush (or Cold Blood) is so much fun it's ridiculous. Rogues in general are simply ridiculous. How many other classes can get four procs on their weapons?<br />
<br />
1) innate weapon procs (I use thrash blade + hanzo sword)<br />
2) sword spec proc (free extra swing 6% of the time- can chain with thrash blade for hilarious amounts of attacks)<br />
3) enchant proc (dual demonslaying for my grinding pleasure)<br />
4) poison proc (yet another dd proc)<br />
<br />
I don't even include crits. I'm grinding on the demons in Felwood and it feels like cheating. I'm almost always hasted so with 4 procs * 2 swords I pretty much get a proc on every swing.  When I proc Blade Flurry and Adrenaline Rush I can pretty much kill 2-4 even cons in a matter of seconds.<br />
<br />
As always, the biggest problem with the rogue class is the game does not contain enough mobs to feed to your blades without waiting for respawn.</div></div><hr />
