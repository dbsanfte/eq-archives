<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Lately I find myself hunting alone or with a rogue partner.  If I've got 2-3 hours to kill solo, I go to OS for plat grinding.  But frequently I'm looking for something thats a quick in and out and is reasonably safe for times when I can play when my baby naps and the wife steps out.  So far I've been tooling hobbies in PoN, but at 2% aa per kill it's slow as hell.  HoH mobs are manageable solo in teh face, but I can't seem to reliably single pull in the crypts and some mobs are immuned to root (I might try basement of a crypt and rooting the hummies, but that sounds pretty dangerous for the time investment I have in mind).<br />
<br />
I know search is my friend, but the info I found so far (mostly inner Acrylia and so forth) doesn't meet my needs.<br />
<br />
I'm looking for a spot with the following in order of importance:<br />
1) quick in and out with easy soloing (1hr hunting times)<br />
2) realtively safe incase I need to pop in to replace a soother or turn the musical mobile back on<br />
3) mobs can either be handled easily in multiples or single pulled without pac/harmony/FD.<br />
4) decent AA exp.<br />
5) loot is good, but optional (still missing a few spells)<br />
<br />
Although listed in Magelo, I am Keyed/flagged for the following:<br />
OS, HS, PoS/PoV, BoT (quest flagged), HoH (Quest flagged), PoTactics (quest flagged, but totally unfamiliar with the zone), CoD (quest flagged).<br />
<br />
Here's my reasonably up to date magelo (banked a few more AA's since I updated, but it's basically all there).<br />
Tarthug's Magelo (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=477090)<br />
<br />
Any suggestions that follow my requirements are greatly appreciated, I thank you in advance for your help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd recommend the pit in potactics. Good exp, and chance for war wraith blood and bricks of bloodmetal(both used to make bloodmetal earrings of engagement). Mobs here are mostly warrior(occasionally SK, necro, shaman). Hit in the 400s range, but not many hp. Solo pulls are easy to get. Also, about every 45 mins or so, you can hear a stampede coming, it's an emote to the zone. When that happens, get to a corner so you don't get run over by it, and watch it go by. There's a stampeding piglet that you need to try to grab, if you can. He drops a few nice items that you can sell(or use, who knows?).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Geordi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've spent the last 3 weeks duoing in the Plane of Hate with a 63 Mage looking for her Elemental Staff of Earth. I have become so familiar with this zone that it is a piece of cake now. I am also 63. All mobs except for the spite golems can be slowed on the first shot....no malo needed. The spite Golems can be slowed with Grummus, maybe takes up to three casts to land. Then let Dog-Dog and Flame Elemental pet do the tanking healing occasionally. Pulling is easy and if there are adds just root and Dot. AA's whip here with two but normal exp is a bit slow. There are some good drops here and some nice quests. Good Drops are very rare, and That mage staff is Ultra rare.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps ya<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Psleestak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I also have done pig pen area solo in Tactics, however I don't recommend trying a War Wraith solo, I had a very  bad experience recently doing that.  Most others can easily be handled, especially if you have VP3 and that new Bane dot from Ruj!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">revamped droga/nurga arent too bad as far as safety go, and they hit pretty light (up to 200), and there are quest drops and named in droga drop decent stuff.  Mobs have around 10-20k hp and go down fast enough.  Single pulls pretty much everywhere, nothing sees invis.  I've been messing around there when i have an hour to play and its fun :)  Exp leaves a little to be desired though..<br />
<br />
The big benefit is you take the OT book and run to FM and you're there, and i enjoy killing a cliff golem on the way, but thats optional i guess :)<br />
<br />
almost forgot..the other benefit is its pretty much just you in the zone :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks guys.  I appreciate the suggestions.<br />
<br />
I'll have to get my group to check out PoTactics before I try the pit solo, I might also have to upgrade my VP1 to VP3.  I'll Give Nurga/Droga a shot later and see how it goes.  Hate will have to be a &quot;we'll see&quot; situation as I don't have a ride up (I'll see if any wizzies are advertising in PoK), but I do have a ranger friend aching for a stone.  I recall mobs in Hate having a remarkably low aggro radius now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">revamped droga/nurga arent too bad as far as safety go, and they hit pretty light (up to 200), and there are quest drops and named in droga drop decent stuff<br />
<br />
/agree<br />
<br />
I started farming nameds in droga at 60 when I got torpor and malo, and its a cakewalk for a shammie.  Easy single pulls abound.  Lots of safe spots to sit, and several good named camps.<br />
<br />
There is another thread that covered all the good nameds in detail, so I won't reiterate here, but it sounds like just what you are looking for.<br />
<br />
Another option might be PoN hedge (there is another thread detailing this too).  Those mobs hit for about 400, but can be solo'ed by a shammie easily, since they don't have much in the way of resists and are all warrior mobs.  Its nice because its never contested, all easy singles, and it bit more risky than droga.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Stormriders in BoT garden seems easy enough. Just watch out for the casters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'd second the BoT Courtyard suggestion. You need to get to learn the spawns and then you can avoid the casters entirely (they're manageable but a pain).<br />
<br />
90% of them are single pullable, again you can just leave the others out.<br />
<br />
Loot is reasonable in that you get various types of diamonds and other gems, a few ethereals and a very occasional spectral. Plus the trash loot sells for reasonable amounts too. XP is very respectable too.<br />
<br />
Either root/rot or tank them IN TEH FACE so you can use dogdog with mage toys to add some nice extra dps, depends what your gear and spell collection looks like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gilly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I solo in HoH basement sometimes.  <br />
<br />
It's great exp and mobs drop pretty quick if you use all the dots you have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Gilly, how do you split the humans?  Or do you try em 2 at a time?  Or do you stick to the suits?  How do you handle the occaisional one that is immune to changes in run speed?<br />
<br />
I don't doubt I can take an unrootable suit, but the downtime would be nasty (might be out 90 seconds canning and Qing).  I've often wanted to come here, but I can't handle multiple pulls.  I can pull with root, but if resisted it'll be tight or wipe.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Namurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Howling Stones has been very good to me lately.  It took me a while to solo the master key to the zone, otherwise you need a rogue to go in various locked doors, including the ones to the west &amp; south wings.  I could have done the key faster with a partner or with the suspend minion 2 AA and a few ITU potions, but overall it was a fun quest so I'm not complaining.  I've made nearly 50k the past few days, and a solo AA in the south wing takes about 2.5 hours, the same as a solo AA in PoValor.  It still can't compare to BoT groups, but I hate PoP and this is a nice alternative.  I may try the east wing and see if the exp comes in any faster; mobs are slightly higher level there.. but I've found myself overwhelmed more than once in the south wing solo, and as I mentioned the exp is pretty good there.  About the only 'problem' is that most loot is fairly common and lore.  This requires me to bank often, switching stuff to my bazaar mule.  It tends to sell fast though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Psleestak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Did they nerf VP or have I just had some bad luck with it recently?  Been getting a lot more resists :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Airanandria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Grab a 65 Mage that has elemental charm and hit BoT. nice duo exp. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Syrellian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Lately I have been soloing the Golems in PoV at the NW corner.  There is plenty of room there to run around so that you can root, snare (If you have the equipment/items) and dot.  I have not been using the dog dog because it seems to die too quickly, and to me, is a waste of mana healing it and what not.  I usually just pull with slow, Malos, and use the following DoT spells: Epic, Breath of Ultor, Blood of Saryrn, Pox, Bane of Nife.  After I land the Dots, I usually just back off, hit Cann5, Q myself, and refresh dots as needed.  It takes a bit longer this way, but I have found that this is a very safe way to xp.  Inbetween the times I am waiting on Cann 5 to refresh, I just Q myself and hit Cann4 repeatedly for safe mana regen. I usually get 5 or 6% per kill AA-wise.  Most peeps in PoV (at least on Fennin RO) seem to like the usual camp spots: OC, IC, EC, WC.........Northwest corner is almost always open in my experiences and as I said, there is more room to run around if need be.  I realize that my method of soloing is not exactly the fastest way, but for me is definitely the safest as far as PoV is concerned.  <br />
