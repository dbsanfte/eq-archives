I'd say do Large Zelniaks in Dawnshroud until the Ranger is 40ish then hit City of Mist. XP in CoM is sick in the mid 40s to mid 50s and you can polish off some epic pieces while you're at it. But, the ranger's not going to be able to tank much of anything in CoM at 36. The phantoms at zone in tore a hole through my ranger at 39 and she's twinked pretty hard and always has a 61 druid in her pocket. It's possible, don't get me wrong. But it may be better xp/more efficient to do something else and avoid the downtime.</div></div><hr />
