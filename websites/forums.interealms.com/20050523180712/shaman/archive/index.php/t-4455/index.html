<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">There is a mob.<br />
<br />
2 group capable.<br />
<br />
Respawns every 2 hours wihout fail.<br />
<br />
No PH's.<br />
<br />
No rotation.<br />
<br />
Drops Torpor, Malo, and assortment of level 60 spells.<br />
<br />
People complain alot about the Kunark drops. Torpor, 3 out of 4 kills of this mob?<br />
<br />
It does exist. If you can guess it, email me at the_biscuit_bandit@yahoo.co.uk<br />
<br />
I will give you all 2 days to find it out.<br />
<br />
<br />
Time starts... NOW</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">my guess is that yet another person stumbled upon dumb luck (3 torpors from 4 kills) and now believes that to be fact.<br />
<br />
could be chardok royals he's talking about as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've got a better idea than this guy.  <br />
I know a mob, respawn is 2 minutes, drops an assortment of 58-60 spells, one group doable, kunark mob.  <br />
GO!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm guessing tola or protector too.  I've seen malo drop off him a couple times, although never seen torpor yet.<br />
<br />
Also, the nameds in Chardok ie Prince, Queen, and King, but it couldn't be them because last time I checked they don't even drop spells every time, let alone dropping torpor commonly.<br />
<br />
Hmm, source of level 60 Kunark spells as far as I know:<br />
- Chardok bosses<br />
- Guardian wurm (x3)<br />
- Ancient Wurm<br />
- Kunark named dragons<br />
- Emperor Chottal<br />
- Sontalak (I heard)<br />
<br />
If I'm not mistaken, I also saw some clay dude in OT drop some high level spells too.  We were killing him for part of a weapon quest, forget which one.</div></div><hr />

Clay golems in OT do drop high level Kunark spells, although I don't know if they drop Torpor and Malo.  I've killed them several times with a group for a Velious quest.  We never saw level 60 spells drop though. I tried to solo one, and lost twice.  They're somewhat hard to slow with just Malo.  I would have won but forgot to reslow.:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Chukzombi Astrocreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Landoragon  those rancors are old old old news. Was old news 2 years ago. Most dont bother with VP becuause of the pain in the ass involved in setting up the way to get out.  If you are at the point of putting out some serious dough to get your spell and you have a VP enabled well rounded group on hand you should head to VP instead. <br />
<br />
<br />
Those golems in OT are actually a good cheap source for spells and you can pull the light blue /blue trash guards in between spawns, they drop spells too btw.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only _two_ person has said the correct mob/s i was taking about.<br />
<br />
You all still have 1 day! Keep trying!!<br />
<br />
(PS nest dragons have 8 hour respawn)<br />
<br />
EDIT: To the guy who said 3 out of 4 torpor drops was lucky. Yes it was. Didnt say it was a fact, i was just proving that Torpor was dropping from the mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Yeah, get people to camp VP parts for a couple months and you are set.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Uh, no.  Nest dragons do not have 8 hour spawns.  I know this because I've farmed Yeldema with a friend.  We'd hit Yeldema and then go to DN for a while, then hit Yeldema again.  I remember the spawn time being 2 hours.  I've also see this for other nest dragons, when I had a group doing nest dragons for fun and loot, and we'd cover about 10 or so dragons in the 2 hour spawn time before repops would happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Hrmm...mebbe they have changed spawn time on nest dragons cause there is no way its 2 hours, cause I know gorge dragons are 2 hours and takes alot longer for them to spawn than it does Yeldema or the other nests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Pffft the only place I have heard decent Shaman spell drops is VP. Other than that it's blind luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Pretty sure it's 1.5 - 2 hours on the nest dragons.  Took a group out there one night and killed like 10 of them, by the time we finished only 3 had respawned, and we weren't going fast at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I have done the clife golms in OT with 2-3 friends meny time. Even farmed them for spells. They are on a 23ish min timer. We got a lot of spells to include Bane and regrowth of the grove. But the funny thing is that only Lv60 spells we ever got where.. Mala big saprise WFP rats should drop that spell it's so commen. And lv60 enchanter spell's. We got 4-5 copies each of Winds of tash, visions of grandures (Or what ever its called) over a 2 day time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Sounds like the Overking to me.  <br />
<br />
Of course, sitting down for hour after hour isn't the easy bliss some think.  Plus, in 10 king killings, I've seen one shaman spell drop - Pox.<br />
<br />
More likely to get an incarnadine bp which has a nice trade value.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">And I know how to make a million dollars, just guess and email me for the info!<br />

This kind of crap is the pinnacle of lameness.  This board is here (or used to be, at least) to help each other out, to SHARE information.  Not to play guessing games.  You have info that'll help people?  Share it then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">LOL Khallin<br />
<br />
I gave a 2 day timer!!! That 2 days in not up, but since peeps seem a little desperate to find out, then yes, it is Overking Bathezid in Chardok. /shrug Id thought id provide a little fun<br />
<br />
There, i shared it, i hope you feel happy Khallin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I've only been on a king kill 8 times so my sample isn't that large. But, out of all 8 of those times, the only Shaman spells that dropped were Talisman of the Brute X 2 and VoB. Oh, and an Incaradine BP ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Not just you, Urd.  It just seems to be the latest fad, as someone said.  Come in here, spout off like a telemarketer with some grand scheme, and then clam up when any info of any real value is asked about.  Did it hurt much to say right away that it's the Overking?  I doubt it.  So what good does it do to not say it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">I think some people find it fun to try to figure things out on their own, rather than just have people tell them.  Furthermore, I seriously doubt that is Urdegish had just come in here and posted &quot;Overking Bathezid in Chardok dropped torpor 3 out of 4 times the other day, and he's on a two hour spawn timer&quot; that we would have gotten a thread even half as informative as this one.  I now know that if I want to get Torpor that I'm not limited to doing the emporer in Sebilils ad naseum, that I'm not even limited to Kunark for that matter, and that I should go to VP (assuming I can find a VP capable guild and get my VP key) for the best drop rates.  The actualy overking tidbit of info had little value for me, but the rest of thread I found quite helpful.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think these threads are kinda fun, as long as they aren't taken to the extreme (I need an equipment upgrade, but first you have to guess what I'm wearing right now...).  They do provide useful information, both in the form of &quot;wrong&quot; answers and in eventually in the form of the &quot;right&quot; answer.  As long as people do it the way Urdegish did (say up front, I'll tell you in two days), where's the harm?  If you don't like this sort of thing, just wait two days and you'll find out.<br />
<br />
But that's just my 2 cp</div></div><hr />

Or you could just check the Spell Location's post and you would already know the mobs that can drop malo/torpor. <br />

anyway i was just responding to some elses post: if your too tight to share your own experience of rl then just keep your mouth shut, but us geordies have no qualms about being generous to other people.<br />
<br />
I can appreciate that folk dont want this forum, turning into a  sales pitch.  I simply said that i knew HOW to make money from the internet.  <br />
<br />
i have no problem about sharing that info for free!<br />
