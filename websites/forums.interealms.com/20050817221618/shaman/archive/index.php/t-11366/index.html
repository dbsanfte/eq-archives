<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>gump17</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">these are a few items from nadox that i gave to spell chick and she ate them!!!<br />
<br />
A blackened Vial (clr , dru ,shm) <br />
pirate eyepatch<br />
golden tooth<br />
broken bottle<br />
<br />
<br />
if ya have anything else that she eats or even gives a responce for please list so we don't waste time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Quiinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Did someone try to give a broken bottle to the water elemental guy in the sunken ship hull?  He asks for something empty that left its owner empty.  My first guess was a wine bottle or something close but hadnt seen anything yet.  Just a hunch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It was my understanding from another thread that you don't give the items to the NPC anymore, you hail them and they check to see if you have the item.<br />
<br />
So, the bottle may be half of the quest, but handing it in will get you nowhere.  You would have to get the other item and have both in your possession and hail the spirit.  This would prevent people from turning in things willy-nilly and seeing if they get an affirmative &quot;waiting for the rest of the stuff&quot; response, and multiquesting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dissonant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I heard from someone that you need to get an empty flask from a drunkard in Nadox.  Can't confirm or deny this info, but thought I'd throw it out for people to check on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sordia Winetrsbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My daughter made a little froggie (I never use my alts space anyway I'm a shaman after all), and from what I have seen if you give the item to a person and you are supposed to hail them, they give you the item back, and tell you that they have no need of it, even if they take it from you when you hail them.<br />
<br />
So, if you are supposed to hail them, I would think that they would give the item back.  At least that would be the case if SoE was being consistant.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The elemental universally eats or wields everything you give him.<br />
<br />
Bottle<br />
White wine<br />
Red wine<br />
Brandy<br />
Broken Bottle<br />
<br />
Will try the hailing bit later.  One of the elementals comments was something to the effect of &quot;You won't have to go far&quot;, so I'm checking in zone first, merchants, then breaking out the puppy to farm greens.<br />
<br />
Stormaye<br />
56 shaman<br />
Endless Knot<br />
Brell Serilis</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Slaorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">From what I understand from friends that have done thier lvl 44 quests, the items all came from Gunthak. Of course this came from a bard and a ranger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">In the newbie frog city, you no longer do hand ins for several quests.  If you hand something in - he gives it back.  If you hail the right person, the transaction happens.  Kinda weird, but it appears they're trying new things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Urnti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Sound like they are changing it so you can't MQ things anymore<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Avangion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I handed in the EMPTY FLASK (labeled Class:shm Race:ALL) to an impassive spirit in the water. This is the CORRECT item for him. However, he hands you back a Clear Rock. When you are ready for his challenge, he asks for it back. Currently, he takes it and NO MOB SPAWNS.. so as of now the quest is broken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>kaid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">What dropped the empty flask if you remember.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Salamonda Eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I just got an Empty Flask...<br />
<br />
Was in the.. umm.. forgot name.. Next zone over from Gulf of Gunthak... Dulak Harbor?  Dulak.. something like that.<br />
<br />
Off of a drunkard I think.<br />
<br />
IDs something like.. smells faintly of rum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sshasta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">No Shaman Love from SoE . . Bah!  Give us 1 real spell in expansion . .and the quest for it is broken . .who woulda figured that would happen :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Avangion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It drops randomly off any drunken pirate in dulak.<br />
<br />
I got another flask and ran through the quest with a gm swimming right next to me. After handing in the Clear Rock you get from the flask, absolutely nothing happens. No mobs spawn, there is no further text. The GM (jhaann) waited a moment and confirmed that the NPC is looking for two items that he linked me and is bugged.<br />
<br />
Its safe to hand in your flask if you wish to but do not hand in the clear rock as of now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hail,<br />
<br />
The GM (jhaann) waited a moment and confirmed that the NPC is looking for two items that he linked me and is bugged.  <br />
<br />
Are the empty flask thingies Lore?<br />
<br />
Could you possibly turn in the bottle, get a clear rock in return, and then give him ANOTHER empty flask and the clear rock to get the mob to spawn???<br />
<br />
<br />
The GM (jhaann) waited a moment and confirmed that the NPC is looking for two items that he linked me <br />
What were the 2 items he linked you?<br />
<br />
Thanks for posting!  I'd love to hear more about this.  I wouldn't even bother with these quests if they hadn't nerfed Disinfecting Aura. :mad: <br />
<br />
I hate how all of us 61+ (and thus OUTSIDE the designed level range for LoY, which is 30-60) had a working functional spell that was scribed in our books changed w/o notice and replaced with a spell that we must now quest for. :( <br />
<br />
Ah, well.  Such is life.  Let's solve this thing, then cause a mass rush to the new zones until we all get our now worthless DA replaced with Pure Blood. :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
In the meantime, until the quest is solved (or fixed), I think a few hours in Tier 2 to get Radiant Cure 1 is a much better use of MY time than running around Gunthak.<br />
<br />
Take care,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Avangion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I don't remember the names of the items. They were both labeled MAG and had similiar names.. something of Flotsam and something of Jetsam. I linked the two of them to the serverwide channel while i was on but i don't really remember the names.<br />
<br />
The empty flasks are indeed lore, no drop. Random drop off any drunken pirate near the zone in of Dulak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>waramorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Thanks to the previous posters for the info.<br />
<br />
Went to Dulak's Harbor and pulled a few drunken pirate's. <br />
Had to kill about 8 before the EMPTY FLASK dropped.<br />
I was pulling to the safe area on the dock, very low agro range so not so bad. <br />
<br />
The EMPTY FLASK is LORE NO DROP Class SHM Race None.<br />
<br />
Now I just sit and wait for them to fix the rest of the quest.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

*EDIT* By dock I mean the whole pier where the ship is docked.<br />
From memory this is NE from zone in from Gulf of Gunthak<br />
Pulled most of the drunken pirates from the buildings opposite the pier.<br />
<br />
*EDIT2* Pier is south from zone in from Gulf of Gunthak<br />
<br />
Tryed to give a broken bottle to the water elemental guy in the sunken ship hull but it got eaten (although I could have given it to dogdog instead /sigh it was late)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>lalebeq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Please expound on the &quot;safe spot on the Dock&quot; were is it please?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I'm not 100 percent sure this still drops.  Killed like 20 of the drunken pirates and nothing interesting dropped at all.<br />
<br />
Wasted a few good hours here</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Tarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I was in Dulak this afternoon.  I teamed up with another Shaman.  We each got a flask in under an hour.  This was on Xegony at about 3:00 - 4:00 Pacific.  So, yes they do still drop.  I haven't had time to go do the turn-in with it, but I hear the quest giver has been removed until the fix him anyway.</div></div><hr />
