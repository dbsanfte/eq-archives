<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kallaill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I thought it was just me until recently when a fellow shaman in my guild pointed out that he was fizzling more ever since the patch. Is it just me, are other people experiencing  an increased fizzle rate on all spells? And if so are other classes having a similar issue?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've fizzled three times in a row casting Canni4 lately.  That almost never happened before.  I've had two fizzles in a row a infrequently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The repeated fizzles come from a streaky random number generator.  I've noticed them a bit more since Gates of Discord was released, but I bet that's just perception thanks to the introduction of AAs to counter fizzilng on certain spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>BelegurthValar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">SoW is slower too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">In the same boat with fizzles with Canni.  Amazingly enough, I ripped off 7 fizzles in a row, and continually get 3 in a row frequently.  That isn't a RNG problem, something has changed for sure IMO.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>eci_shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It may be an issue with the random number generator because I have noticed that the amount of skillups and sucess rates on player made items have dropped ... at least for me anyways.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>tewdogs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">No empirical data, but I've definitely been getting the feeling that the fizzle rate has gone up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Even if you're right , even if you have some parse...well anything ,you'll get everytime : SoW is slower too<br />
No matter of what you do . in the past SCM3 was buggy too ,and the poor poster got such comments.<br />
<br />
       Now ,i haven't play enough since the patch ,it's just to prevent  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Otoole Frostypants</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">No, it's not your imagination...and I know it's not mine either. It's also not just a &quot;bad luck&quot; streak with the RNG. Fizzle rates HAVE increased--noticably so. I mentioned it in an exp group and the enchanter in the group said, &quot;I thought it was just me!&quot;<br />
<br />
It's not just shaman...and it's only since the dx9 patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Meryll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">SOE (and Verant) increase the fizzle rate every patch, Fungi's will become no-drop, SoW got slower, and if you hit bears with blunt weapons instead of piercers you get a better chance of an HQ pelt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Fizzles are definitely happening more, no doubt.  LDoN last night, I was dumbfounded when I got 2 fizzles in a row on Canni 3!  Never happened before, hardly ever get a fizzle on anything, all spell skills maxed at my level, 57.  Had 4-5 fizzles on that one LDoN adventure, usually don't have any.  Something is definitely going on.  Also, Chanter had a fizzle on a pull and almost bit it.  She was complaining also.<br />

*** is SOE doing?<br />

No significant difference :rolleyes: <br />

Funny: I do keep a log file. Even funnier: I don't have the time/inclination to do anything with said log file, atm. Perhaps another day...</div></div><hr />

Funny how your own numbers indicate a 16% increase in fizzle rate.  May not be significant to you, but it is to me and I bet plenty of other people.  Do the math, and thanks for helping to support our claim.</div></div><hr />

<br />
221 / 13632 = 0.01621<br />
<br />
31 / 1601 = 0.01936<br />
<br />
Both numbers look pretty small, of course.  But the ratio is:<br />
<br />
0.01936 / 0.01621 = 1.1943<br />
<br />
That's an increase of 19%.<br />
<br />
Is that significant?  Rounding that off to 20%, it means that if you used to fizzle 5 times in a given amount of time, now you fizzle 6 times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">He's not using the word 'significant' to mean 'important', he's using it in its statistical meaning.  i.e. are the numbers outside the realm of random variations.   Due to the relatively small sample size used, no conclusions can be drawn.<br />
<br />
For a definition of statistical significance,<br />
<br />
http://www.surveysystem.com/signif.htm<br />
<br />
<br />
In normal English, &quot;significant&quot; means important, while in Statistics &quot;significant&quot; means probably true (not due to chance). A research finding may true without being important. When statisticians say a result is &quot;highly significant&quot; they mean it is very probably true. They do not (necessarily) mean it is highly important. <br />
<br />
<br />
...and for a statistical significance calculator:<br />
<br />
http://www.prconline.com/tools-ssc.asp.<br />
<br />
Statistical Significance Defined:   Statistical significance is said to exist when a difference between samples/responses is large enough so as to be attributed to something other than expected sampling error.<br />
<br />
Comparative Error: 0.1<br />
Difference: .00315<br />
Significance: No<br />
<br />
If you need more information than this, take a statistics course.<br />
<br />
As far as the &quot;SoW is slower&quot; argument, all that really means is that subjective &quot;feelings&quot; are totally worthless in this kind of argument.  Seriously.   Just post the numbers, or save your...ummm... virtual breath.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I always wondered why some other casting classes got the Past Mastery spell, where you won't fizzle any spell below a certain level. Then I realized Canni4, and understood why Shammy's won't get it as an AA.<br />
<br />
Wastrel da Leezurd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Compare for yourself:<br />
&quot;Your spell fizzles!&quot; vs &quot;You begin casting&quot;<br />
<br />
A 20% difference in fizzle rate may fall within the margin of error. Even if it doesn't, I think it's simply too small a change to notice by seat-of-the-pants observation. I certainly didn't notice it when playing.<br />
<br />
People have been &quot;noticing&quot; certain after-patch problems since the dawn of EQ -- fizzle rate is one of them. I've probably been guilty of it myself at some point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry to resurrect this thread, but now that my log file has grown I just have to finish this off.<br />
March 1-March 22: 221 fizzles to 13632 casts = 1:62 fizzle rate<br />
March 23-April 7: 159 fizzles to 9672 casts = 1:61 fizzle rate<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />
