Went into the bazaar to buy a blessed fishing pole for earring of solstice quest and a few others have been looking as well. After talking to them I ended up going to pog to forage planar beams for fishing pole not to mention for blessed fardwer thunderbolt.<br />
<br />
Been there for 3 hours and noticed about 10 skillups per hour. This leads me to 2 questions that I need help with.<br />
<br />
1. Will skillups be farther apart as I raise this skill? As it stands with my skill at 70 and 10 per hour will take 13 hours of mindless clicks. Perhaps I deserved this as one skill I overlooked.<br />
<br />
2. Is there other ways to raise fishing as per combines in tackle box or such? Heard a rumor about this but can't confirm.<br />
<br />
Thanks all for any help blew</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Amise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes, you can raise fishing by combining items in a tackle box.  Check here (http://www.eqtraders.com/learn/learn_fishing.htm)  for more info, there are recipes for items you can make to increase your fishing skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just beware . . . I don't know if you are, but it sounds like you are fishing with it.  It can break!  Don't fish with the Blessed Fishing Pole!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Roophus Gunthar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Use that fishing pole that summons alcohol!  heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>blewstar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm too 130 on fishing now and it is slowing down to crawl on skillups. Was doing 10 per hour now around 4. <br />
<br />
My question is does str affect skilllup on this? Hate to have to buy wisdom gear if str will do the job. 229 on strength self buffed. Warriors should use str as well for skill ups so I'm a little confuse on this. Thanks blew</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">No, i dont think STR has anything to do with Fishing skillups. (It IS however a factor in Smithing). Its just the higher of INT or WIS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vladimirr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Go with WIS gear, yes.  All tradeskills, from 180 to 200 (Especially 190-200) are very, very slow.<br />
<br />
Getting Fishing to 200 isn't for everyone.  There are some workarounds - like buying the skillups from your trainer, or using the tacklebox-fillet combine.  But going about it the old fashioned way is the most satisfying, in this Paladin's opinion.</div></div><hr />
