<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ubex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I believe that shaman is the debuffer of choice going into lvl 65.  I will repeat again,  getting groups in zones like BoT etc is no problem.  While enchanters and 65 beastlords can do the debuffing ok, it seems that most player in BoT, HoH, PoV and etc still preceive the shaman as uber for slowing + valuable for the added spot healing, buffing and crowd control.<br />
<br />
What I was trying to say was that other classes are prefered for filling the debuff role in zones such as Hard LDoN's and GoD (beyond the trivial entry zones) and that we have very little else to offer that makes us a compelling choice.  Here the other contributions of enchanters and beastlords make them a better addition to most groups.</div></div><hr />

Everyone already gave up the idea of letting the devs know our situation, because they stated they have resolved the problem with a 250hp heal upgrade, which is hard to obtain.</div></div><hr />
