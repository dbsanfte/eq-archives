<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>zensation</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">When i play i normally duo with my roomate who is a 56 bst. When he pulls i assist then cast slow on the target. my question is everyone talks about the malo line and how they cast first. I dont tend to get many resists (1 out of 15 maybe) on the slow, so would mal~ make a huge difference? I also read how some shamans use the sripple line on pulls, after the mob is slowed is that needed/ noticable? I know these must sound like some noob questions coming from a 52 shammy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This is just my opinion, but you are totally fine at the moment.  When you get to Plane of Power mob level (or fight some of the nastier older world things like Tawro and Radir, or harder Ssra mobs), you will want to lead with Malosini-- even though Malosini and Turgur share the same resist chance, if you fail with Malosini you don't generate much agro at all, and tanks/your pet can easily pull it off of you.  If Malosini does land however, you're almost guaranteed to land Turgur's.<br />
<br />
Once you get into tier 2 type mobs, using Malo or Malos (the unresistable versions) starts to become more of a must.  I was doing okay in PoV with just malosini but it was scary and risky sometimes-- once I got Malos, everything got pretty trivial.<br />
<br />
Regarding Cripple, it's actually effective-- I would only use it on really tough mobs that proc or rampage or frenzy a lot, however, where the person has good agro control or if you can keep it rooted.  It works ok on weaker mobs too, but there are better spells you could be casting in that case.  Be very careful with Cripple if the mob is nasty... it is *tremendous* agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Agree with above.  I almost never led off with anything in the Mal* line until I got to level 60 and started using Malo, except on big nasties where I expected I might have trouble landing slow.<br />
<br />
In PoP, especially the bigger stuff you start seeing beyong Tier I yard trash, a resisted slow or two will paste you.  In that case, Malo then slow makes a ton of sense, if for no other reason, because Malo is low aggro and unresistable, so you never have to recast it, and it drops the average amount of aggro you get.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'm not a huge fan of Cripple.  I use it on big nasty raid-type targets, and that's really about it.  Otherwise I figure I'm better off throwing another DoT or Nuke or something with the mana and reducing the mob's damage output by the clever method of making it dead faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">At your level I would only malos line first if it was a mob I knew resisted slow a lot. I honostly never used the malos line at your lvl very much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It really depends on what mobs you fight, even in Elemental Planes and other PoP zones, depending on what my group is fighting I may or may not use Malos/Malosini before slowing.  I never use Malosinia for groups tho since I have a Pendant of Malosini hotkeyed, its usually good enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bamce ConstaCani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i usually just go for the immediate slow, if reisisted i try to malox while turgurs is refreshing. i have my good days, and my bad, the bad usually ending with me getting waxxed a few times.  <br />
<br />
but then again i'm usually torpored/Qed so whiel getting beat i'm already at 300 hp per tick regen</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hardly Malox here either.  Lead w/ Turgur, and fire off 'sini during the refresh only if it bounces, to help #2 stick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Once you get beyond Teir 1 PoP mobs most will smear you in the ground by the time you get a second slow off if you manage to channel though it.   If I can take beating for more then 4 seconds on the mob unslowed I will slow it with out first casting some type of magic resist debuff.  Other wise that baby is going be debuffed a bit.  <br />
<br />
On the cripple issue that is purely personal oppinion to use or not.  I do sometimes and other times I dont.  It ussually depends if I notice my pet's meele is hitting for lower then normal.  As the biggest benifit of Cripple is not the reduction of one mobs Damage out put.  Its the increase of 4+ meele people/pets hitting the mob for greater over all damage.  If your meele damagers are all ready hitting for max ( Ussually on LoW AC mobs LOW Darkblue/Light Blue Mob ) then its not that help full.  For deep reds it helps a bit by making it easier to hit.  But for those Even/Yellow mobs its golden.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I don't use the malo line in tier 1 pop, most of the time if slow fails I'm gettin whacked, and thats with sk's and pallys as my tank. I just throw myself a stoicism and keep trying, if it looks bad and my clerics not doin his job keeping me alive i either end up dead or spamming myself with sup heal while the gimp melees pull the mob off me. Cripple is scribed, never used it though. Kinda a waste imho, when ya only got 2-3 melees most groups, the agro makes me gun shy from watching what happens to shammys/chanters who do use the spell alot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I slap down Malosini on almost everything I hunt lately. Of course, when one is soloing in Torgiran / nadox, it really makes a difference...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>doqtir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I've been malosini'ing (almost) everything lately also. It lets the tank, who's better equiped to handle the hits, gain agro and it doesn't stress out the cleric who's wondering if I'll channel a heal. It's cheap, fairly fast cast time and helps the other casters land spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">In a group I don't maloxxx unless I figure there's a 1 in 3 or greater chance of a resist OR if the mob will chew me up faster than I can recast.  I will maloxxx while slow refreshes if the first one bounces.  <br />
<br />
Soloing I always maloxxx because it's my (unscientific) opinion that it helps root last longer.  Usually I root the mob I'm after, then malosinia until it sticks, then Turgur's, then epic, then start loading the dots until root breaks (usually every dot in POP, lol).  Then run back to dogdog, apply the rest of the dots, reroot and torpor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Situational and a judgement call. As noted above, consider 2 things. First, how often are you being resisted by the mobs you are fighting, (also other group mates as MaloX benefits them aswell). Second, can you survive long enough to try and land slow on the second casting, if the first bounces.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jeones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">In PoP zone I always us Malo* on incoming.<br />
<br />
One thing to remember is it also will help with wizards and others to land their spells more effectively.</div></div><hr />
