<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yeah I'm sick of being the only 55+ shaman around without his epic. I have been trying for too damn long to get that tear and I know some of you have to have an extra.<br />
<br />
BTW fright, dread, and terror can bite me. Friggen no show bastards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cammere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Thos MQ may still be possible, but only a shaman can do it and it needs a shaman who has max TrueSpirit faction.<br />
<br />
A shaman who receives his/her epic these days, gets BAD TrueSpirit faction when he/she gives the Iksar Scale to the Spirit Sentinal in EJ. After this point, that faction is indifferent.<br />
<br />
Now unless you can find a epic'd shaman who for some reason has no life and wishes to raise his/her faction back to Max, doing the Rathe Mt/Wandering Spirit cycle, I think you will be out of luck.<br />
<br />
In essence, the tear is not really MQ'able these days.<br />

I understand just how frustraiting it can be to have one of the easists epics and not have it in your hands.<br />
<br />
I got so frustraited and embarased that I quite my shaman and played a monk only to have the same experiance.  I had a necro take my shaman down to level 52 and sold the EE for cash but now I am back on my shaman.   No way will he go over 55 again without epic.<br />
<br />
I truly hope you get your tear soon.<br />

<br />
I was in CoM hunting reavers for a guildie couple weeks ago, and in the process Rak spawned. I conned him and was ally to him. Now that may mean shaman who received their epic prior to the patch can still MQ the tear.<br />
<br />
Just an FYI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Eh, Hobbez is now in our guild, Sinjun :)<br />
<br />
For the record, Shamans who got their epic pre-patch (Oct/Nov) are still ally. Shamans who got their epic after the patch, like me, go back to indifferent. Don't tell anyone, but I'm max allied again because I went through the Woe/Envy/Marr faction cheat afterwards.</div></div><hr />
