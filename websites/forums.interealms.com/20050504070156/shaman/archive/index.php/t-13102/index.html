<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Drylar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm still a newb. I admit it. Slowly learning the ins and outs. As per root, is it affected by extended affliction? Wanting to find something to make it last longer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No, not anymore.  After about 9 months, Affliction Focus items were &quot;fixed&quot; earlier this year to only affect dots.  There are a few upper level focus items which affect all detrimental spells (including dots, nukes, slows, roots, etc.).  For example, the Crown of Ambivalence in VT has the &quot;focus of mediocrity&quot; effect which affects all spell durations (excluding charm, invulnerability etc).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The only way to help this is to change which root you're casting.  if you cast Petrifying, then it's the longest lasting, costs the most and takes the longest to cast.  <br />
<br />
And where did they come up with the idea of a spell that was magic resist and added disease counters?  never made any sense to me....</div></div><hr />
