<br />
I see you are visiting and posting from time to time, but have not heard much from you lately.  Can you give us an update on what's going on with the class lists?  There is no new info on EQLive, so can you fill us in with whatever you know?<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I hope Sudedor has sharable info; the other classes are asking about their class definitions, too, and so far the stock answer about everything has been &quot;On hold pending Omens of War release.&quot;<br />
<br />
Not to sound too jaded, but I'm now expecting &quot;On hold pending Omens of War updates and tweaks.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Well based on responses recently made regarding how fantastic OOW is for Shaman and the game, SOE will have very little reason to change anything or do anything more with class balance.  <br />
<br />
There's been a lot of contradiction, backbiting, snide remarks and general bad attitudes towards each other that you can pretty much lose any hope of SOE re-evalutating the shaman class since we cannot seem to agree and rally behind any points anymore.   <br />
<br />
It seems that indeed, the Shaman is now again balanced for the price of $30 in Omens of War.<br />
<br />
Any momentum or credibility the Shaman community is pretty much lost at this point as people fall back into the trolling habits we all know so well....   <br />
<br />
<br />
Shaman AAAA says, &quot;Having a problem, we're nerfed&quot;<br />
<br />
Shaman BBBB replies, &quot;Well there are 2 reasons for that, either 1 you suck or 2, your friends suck.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Perhaps the Shaman class is now balanced or perhaps not, I'll leave it to the people who are still playing and enjoying the game to decide.  But I think the response you can expect from SOE now is &quot;Everything is working as intended.  Just buy Omens for your class balance.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards to all, <br />
Warren</div></div><hr />
