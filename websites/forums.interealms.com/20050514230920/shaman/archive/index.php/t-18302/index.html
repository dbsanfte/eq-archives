<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Koridar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just logged on test and found the Extinguish fatigue No longer works.  I imagine that acumen doesn't work either but my shaman is too low on the server to find out.  Even IF they were gonna do away with using Stamina for stats and Melee skills How freaking hard would it have been to change the code on Acumen to say decrease END loss by 10?? <br />
<br />
      Eff you SOE. ya lazy bastards.  It would be nice if just once you didn't half - assed do something and then clean up the total mess you make of things. Oh wel...l at least In Wow Shaman get to Rez :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I never got &quot;zing&quot; in the first place, since it has never done anything even remotely useful.<br />
<br />
Losing the stamina regen in acumen is equally meaningless. Would it be nice if it gave +endurance regen? Sure...will I stop casting it? No, it is still a very useful spell that I personally couldn't play the game without.<br />
<br />
People making a big fuss about nothing. Do you really *want* to be a melee twitch whore?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Acumen rocks for humans/erudites, and actually works as a good dummy buff (very fast cast) when you need dummy buffs than you have clickies :)<br />
<br />
Zing spells = never used once</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Makes sense that we rez in WoW. We deal with the spirits, so why not as a powerful shaman, can i call a spirit back to its body once i have healed it?  Never really thought about that till now.<br />
<br />
On topic, i havent used acumen since i was like 20ish, i rarely have a request from it. I do however use my group acumen cause the vison componet.<br />
<br />
<br />
Back off topic, i just did a lil research on WoW this morning and you know, it looks pretty decent. I like the races and calsses and it looks really nice. I like how they have quests ala DAoC to use as a exp system so you dont need to just hack and slash. Its just nice to mix it up. In EQ you get EXP for quests, but its not even close to being able to be used as a primary source of EXP, due in no small part to the difficulty in finding them or the weak exp you tend to get. <br />
<br />
Right now i basicly have quit EQ. I logged in today and played my necro for 20 min then logged out, first time in about a week or so. With NFS:Underground and Call of Duty and Unreal Tourney i just dont find myself wanting to play anymore. I hope it keeps up. I also hope WoW gets here soon :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>krindaria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I use acumen every day. In fact, I try and keep it up with my click earring up in first slot, sow boots in second and acumen in third. Why? Ultravision &amp; See invisible &amp; for how long it lasts. I'm a nearly blind barbarian so the ultravision helps, and the see invisible up all the time is just darn handy. Yes,  I give up a buff slot &amp; I know there are ultravision augs out there, but for me...acumen is still worth it and it's purpose hasn't changed one bit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Considering it is a mid 50's spell I doubt you were using it then...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA<br />
<br />
That is too funny!<br />
<br />
Does make me wonder if the will actually make the Fatique line actually usefule though. I saw it mentioned that the new Endurance bar will not have a regen component, but they do plan on having an &quot;increase pool&quot; spell for it. As for Acumen... I don't know what the hell they have planned for that one. I guess we will find out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Serbitar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Why would you ever delete any spell? Did you run out of room in your spellbook??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I always had acumen up so I could jump more =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I always had acumen up so I could jump more =(<br />
<br />
Back in the old days on a newbie bard, I used to use the endurance song to keep my endurance up to run away from the mobs by jumping.  That was before I had selo's and before I knew about strafe running.<br />
<br />
It's funny-- I hardly ever see &quot;jump&quot; running anymore.  I can just picture a bunch of new characters in front of Qeynos jumping towards the guards with &quot;beetles,&quot; &quot;beatles,&quot; and Fippy running after them.  haha.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Juff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">First buff - clicky SoW.<br />
Second buff - Acumen.<br />
<br />
Being a night blind Barb means I love Acumen - loss of the STA component bothers me not a bit.  The fact that Acumen does not now increase Endurance is not SoE 'being lazy' - they did it on purpose, not wishing to recreate the mistake of KEI and casters with acumen and melees.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">White Mage in FF11 is pretty cool. You get the best heals, slow, haste, some crowd control, and rez, in addition to having the only group ports in the game.  Oh, and your melee stays significant up to higher levels, and you get melee special attacks.  <br />
<br />
It's like . . everything a priest should be!   The only problem I've had with the class (been playing one) has been the constant tells asking to join groups and such.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'm not sure why everyone is so up in arms about losing the extinguish fatigue line. It's always been a pointless spell to have memorized. As long as acumen remains a see-invis/ultravision buff that has a nice duration, I'll be happy. I don't really see this change as affecting our daily play in ANY significant way. If we get any new endurance buffs, fine. If not, I'll find a way to move on. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>HordainPrima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Should i delete my Zing spells and Acumen now? <br />
<br />
Smells like Drama.<br />
<br />
Is your spell book that full that you need the space? As I remember theres more than enough space even if you had everything AND the ST Primal spells. It's not like you need the real-estate......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kelorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">About the shaman rez'ing thing. I think that shaman could call a spirit back to the body, but choose not to, since it kind of upsets the balance of the spirit world.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Has anyone ever used Acumen for sta regen or like me just for vision purposes ?.<br />
Only thing i will say is if the take out the sta regen please for the love of god for all Shaman when they 1st get the spell remove the fizzle adjust :)<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Bamce ConstaCani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Landragoran, which server on ff11 do you play on?<br />
i'm on sylph, wow that was completely off topic,....uhhh uhhh, get ornate hats, its like acumen all the time w/o the sta componet, /shifty eyes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Azadark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I did have someone ask for Acumen on a PoWater raid. Not sure why, I'm sure their STA was at or near max anyway, I guess all the swimming and the STA bar empty scared them. I just memmed it and cast, didnt even want to get into the whole &quot;if your STA is over 100&quot; debate. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I'm with the &quot;why would you delete a spell&quot; crowd. Why have them in the first place? For me its to have a full spellbook (still working on that.)<br />
Who know how the whole thing is gonna work, maybe they'll let you trade the &quot;no longer useful&quot; spells for something that is new? Maybe they'll let you trade them in for a bit of cash? Maybe you'll log on and find new spells in your book in place of the old? Who knows, its still a while away. <br />
By the way, I agree with two of the points made in this and other posts about this particular topic. <br />
1. The new endurance buff probably will, and should go to us.<br />
2. Even then, I wish it would go to someone else. Just another chore to have to perform in groups and on raids.</div></div><hr />
