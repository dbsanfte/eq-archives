<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I see this thing so often in magelo profiles, I have to ask... Why so? It can't be the +1 wis. The +2 AC doesn't seem that great. The hp / mana are kinda small (could get some BS earrings, for more of both). And the effect of scale of wolf... not horrible but harly great when you have SoW boots.<br />
<br />
So... Can someone allay my puzzlement?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">An awesome earring for PvP servers if ya have the sow boots.   Good for travel on blue servers.   I hate sitting down to mem scale of wolf all the time.  (I play on a red server)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Twisted leaf earring = 2 ac, 35hps/35mana, 1 wis<br />
<br />
Black saph earring = 2ac, 35hps/25mana<br />
<br />
So you get ~20 more mana + the clicky scale of the wolf which is actually quite nice in combination with insta regular sow due to not being potentially in trouble if scale gets knocked off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Because it's better than any black sapphire variety.  Sure, it's only better by 1 wis and 10 mana, but it's still better.  You don't turn down a 1 wis 10 hp upgrade when it's on a cheapo earring that's overfarmed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I also think they're more common than the other earrings in their family.<br />
<br />
I've got an Earring of Cleansing and an Earring of Purity (same stats but right-click Counteract Poison and Disease) that I swap in depending on where I am.  Very handy.  :)</div></div><hr />

I think the main reason is that it gives you an inventory slot back. I don't know about you, but my fur boots take up one of my inventory slots. Once I get myself an twisted leaves earring, I'll be banking the boots and geting myself another bag for my phat loot.</div></div><hr />

Click and hold the boots in your inventory slot. They do not need to take up a bag slot u can link items directly by clicking and holdign on the item. Then u can take that box to one of the banks on the left and drop it there. Did it with my bard before :)<br />
i don't have boots but i am guessing they work the same way. :)<br />

I use the Earring of the Solstice and Ivandyr's Hoop currently and have the Earring of Twisted Leaves sitting in one of my bags.  I have my SoW boots in my last inventory slot and have them hotkeyed.<br />
<br />
Can you hotkey an item IN a bag?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Hyacinth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have the earring because it dropped &amp; was an upgrade.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Am I following you correctly? <br />
<br />
You can hot key items inside bags?<br />
<br />
I'll have to give that try tonight. <br />
<br />
I love this forum I never stop learning new stuff :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I know you used to NOT be able to hotkey items in bags.  Hmmmm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Varyss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">No.<br />
<br />
You can't use any item when it's in a bag.  Try eating food, using a potion, or activating any item in a bag.<br />
<br />
AFAIK you can't even create a placeholder for that bag slot in your key banks, the way you can for an actual inventory slot (People who swap primal, ghetto bash, or otherwise swap items a lot probably know what I'm talking about).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Ahhh.  So it has not changed then.  Still, makes me wonder what I am missing about the Twisted Leaves earring.  Is it better than what I currently wear in some fashion?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Seefar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I just bought one of these but I cannot use the click effect yet.  Does anyone know at what level I will be able to use it? I am level 46 now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Haleice, the earring clicks scale of the wolf and has a cast time, sow boots click spirit of wolf and have no cast time, you'll never be able to get rid of your fur boots, trust me on that one =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Tenien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">People wear it cause it has decent stats, its inexpensive to buy and upgrades to it (Ivandyr's, Solstice) are expensive.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's nice for races that can use Ivandyr's.  You might notice there's no &quot;BAR&quot; on it. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I rarely use the clicky effect, but stats-wise it was an upgrade to my other earring.   Confirming:  You'll still want your sow booties from epic, there's a casting time on the earring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">My mistake Sebazy. I didn't know that it had a cast time.<br />
<br />
I thought it was insta click like the boots. I've got a vague feeling I read that somewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I actually prefer the carved bone nose spike:<br />
AC 4 35 wis/HP 5 svD<br />
<br />
only bad thing is when autolooting EQ likes to put it in the face slot if looted before mask.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I wear a Earing of Twisted Leaves that I wear for travel... when you think about it ears are the least effective slot to find anything worth wearing that will make a noticable difference.  <br />
<br />
The reason why I wear the Twisted Leaves is threefold; first it allows me another clicky to wear which makes me feel uber, second it allows me to venture away from the common realm of forrest loops and imbued ivory earings and third it has the same stats as the black saphire with an extra wis and traveling clicky for kicks.<br />
<br />
My other ear is a Fang Shaped Stone Earring  3 AC 5 Wis 5 Int 5 Magic Resist 2 Poison Resist 5 Disease Resist 10 Mana</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I dont know Hrothgar, I have the Fang Shaped earring and also a Vah Shir Claw earring which is great for HP/AC.  I don't think I would ever wear the Earring of Twisted Leaves ..<br />
<br />
edit: yeah vah shir, shar vahl ... whatever!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Do you mean the Vah Shir Claw earring? I am not familiar with a Shar Vahl earring unless it is quested from there but I do not know any of those either.  If it is Vah Shir Claw it has nice AC of 5 but the 4 sta is what 24 or so hp?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>bearknukl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Currently I'm using the Earing of Twisted leaves, and a hollowed pixie rib, but I'll switch that out as soon as I get an earing of solstice some time in the future.<br />
<br />
I also keep a shrunken gobby earing close by and easily equipable for the quick insta buff to protect from debuffing mobs on raids.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Why do people wear the twisted leaves? Because its <br />
<br />
a)common<br />
b)cheap <br />
c)better then the BS earrings.<br />
<br />
 I loved mine. Now I have lizard tooth, but probably woulda happily left the twisted leaves earring there till the end of time if I hadnt gotten the lizard tooth heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I must admit, I dont get it either.  I still use the black saphire earring.  True, the earring of twisted leaves is better, but its so minutely better I just dont care to buy an &quot;upgrade&quot;.  +1 wis and 10mana just isnt a big deal at all.  I dont unsderstand the click effect.  I have sow boots and thus use those.  My cloak clicks counteract poison, Ive got legs in a bag that click abolish disease, so niether of the other earrings are any better. Ill just hold the 1k or whatever it is until I get a real upgrade.<br />
<br />
Btw, the Ivandyr's hoop 1) cant be worn by barbs, and 2) isnt as good because it has only 6hp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Kellk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I have a solstice earring and the twisted leaves.   I also have an Ivandyr's hoop, but I normally wear the twisted leaves because of the extra HP.<br />
Sometimes, if I feel I need the ac, I'll wear the hoop, but usually, I feel better having the HP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Megara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I am just wearing it until I canget a raptor tooth bauble! :P    Seriously, better HP and mana is why I wear it, I have never clicked the thing, I use my booties.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Molerum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">wearing a Silver Hammer earing atm 6ac 6wis 6??? 6??? and mana soory tired cant remember stats.<br />
