<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>RangerLaly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I'm lvl 31 and boyfriend is lvl 36 (both rangers) and we want to group together, however his computer can't handle any of the luclin zones.  So here is my question:<br />
<br />
Where would you suggest we go in the 'Old World' to get good experience at these lvls?  We like to group and are willing to take the travel time to get a good spot.  The only thing we would like to avoid is anywhere that we would have to fight for a spot or something (i.e. like I hear HHK is a nightmare to find a group).<br />
<br />
I would greatly appreciate any help you guys can offer.<br />
<br />
PS - we are on the Drinal Server if that helps :)</div></div><hr />

I did MM with another ranger and pally for those lvls.  Great exp and loot!  And challenging to boot!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vegah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I did early to mid 30's at the giant fort in FM (long enough to get a pair of forrest loops); and then mid to late 30's fear kitting snow cougars in Iceclad by Balix.  Great safe spot to pull to at Balix; plus he drops free food/water.  Experience was pretty good.  Only downside is loot... its non-existant except for the rare Couar Claw Earring.  Altho there is a pretty easy quest for a decent face piece... Cougar Skin Mask quest I think....<br />
<br />
Good luck, safe travels...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Fear-kiting in Iceclad ocean (velious)<br />
or fear-kiting in Stoneburnt Mountains (old world)<br />
or grouping in the Overthere (Kunark)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tathagata</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I like CC and you two should be just about right to start there. Your BF will be anyway, you should be ok if you stick with him.<br />
Start on the miners and move your way around the zone collecting exp and loot until you hit about 45.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dirus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Mistmoor for sure. Harmony graveyard and areas under and near castle enterance. Just watch out for casters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Eorlin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I personally stayed in Iceclad long enough to get two Cougar Claw Earrings (*shudder*) and the Cougarskin mask. I suggest that you at least go to Everfrost and kill mammoths until you get 4 pieces of meat (they will con green to you), then stop by Iceclad and find a pair of HQ Cougarskins. Sometimes merchants sell them, so check the gnomes at their igloos. Then run to the island with the Tower of Frozen Shadow (keep camo up) and track down &quot;Ergrez Shortpaw.&quot; Give him 1 HQ skin and 2 (unstacked) mammoth meat. He will give you a mask that is pretty darn close to the Sarnak Hide Mask from KC. And don't panic if he gives you no message like &quot;Here is your mask.&quot; He did give it to you.<br />
If you already have better masks, don't bother, but otherwise the mask is a great piece of equipment for the risk and time involved for any fear-kiting Ranger.<br />
<br />
[EDIT:]<br />
I just noticed that, for some reason, merchants in freeport sell the HQ Cougarskins. You might find it easier to grab a pair of them from about anywhere; bear that in mind if you want to run in and out of Iceclad instead of spending any time there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sinolien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I must personally say that the Overthere was one of my favorite places that I went in that level range.  I learned how to chain pull, and gained 5 levels in one week (33-38) wihtout intense time commitments (2-3 hours a night maybe in good groups).  Loot is ok, nothing to scream about, but I jsut flew through levels there like no other time in my existence.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">In the low 30's I was still in HHK.  I moved from there to soloing in Thurgadin's mines from 36 to 39, at which point I started to solo in crystal Caverns.<br />
<br />
I'd think, though there'd be some down time as you two medded back up, that CC would be a pretty good place for the two of you to fight in.</div></div><hr />
