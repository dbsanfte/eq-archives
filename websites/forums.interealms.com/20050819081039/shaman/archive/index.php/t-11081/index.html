<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There are random Mobs in the zone that drop library cards. Give one to Posie the Librarian and she will give you a 4 slot container called the Book of Mischief. Also dropping randomly are four pages, top left and right and bottom left and right. Combine these four pages in the book and you will get a Words of Wealth, which unfortunately can't be equipped. <br />
<br />
Now talk to Bob the painter and give him your words of wealth and you will get a pot of gold (2 slot container). You will need to create an item using the deck of spontaneous generation. Only 2-card combination items work (i.e. Green Writguard, Vambraces of Distraction, Mask of Melodies, Crown of Distraction). Combine it in the pot of gold with a Words of Wealth. This will give you a funny money. <br />
<br />
Give 2 funny moneys to Peachy and she gives you a colored Gift Box. The box has 5 charges. If you click on the box, you will summon a doll. The type of doll seems to depend upon the color of the box. The doll has 5 charges of hug, which is a regen spell. As far as I know, the color of the box you will get is completely random. <br />
<br />
Each doll is named after a specific class, and there is one colored box per class. When this Doll is combined <br />
with the 5 main Armor of Distraction types (Gloves, Breastplate, Legs, Arms, Feet -- This is gotten through the Deck of Spontaneous Generation Quest) you get the Class-Specific Doll Quest Armor. <br />
 <br />
<br />
thats the quest info on allakhazam's  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have the boots and 2 flowers to show for it.<br />
<br />
Unless u are very ubber or have a good team up there it will be hell gettin cards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have 2 shaman in the guild that LIVE there , they are bound there and gate back and farm when we arent do anything. There progress thus far has been minimal , the only thing i think any of them have is that flower.<br />
<br />
Dont knwo if its worth it , on the other hand , if its like other planes , you can cash to buy nice armour  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Joril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">its 4 funny money to peaches for a random gift box or nothing.<br />
<br />
one words of wealth and one top left will get you one funny money.<br />
<br />
as for cards the hardest ones to get are the thrones.  only a couple mobs drop them and none are all that easy.  though a decently outfit shaman with topor (or even with out) shouldnt have that much trouble.  the best place for thrones is Stomples (giant rabbit that spawns when you kill sniffles.  he is VERY tough, can triple for 355 and hits VERY fast even slowed).  Stomples is the best bet for thrones.  drops one (or two rarely) every 5 kills or so.  had one streak of 35 with no thrones.  he is on a 33 hour spawn timer and is up at server up.<br />
<br />
other 2 places is alice 4 and the theather, killing puppets.<br />
<br />
here is the only site worth a blank for PoM, gives mobs and armor combos, has a message board, yadda yadda yadda.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">As stated, combine your WoW with a top left of WoW, NOT with armor made from your precious cards.<br />
<br />
<br />
   Hunt Alice 4 mainly to get your thrones, very rare, but doable without torpor.    Once you get Tnargs, a partner, or Torpor, go and do Stomples for thrones.    I'd watch the bazaar for a doll when you get near to completing your combinations.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
   The only piece sincerely worth all your time investment IMO is the boots.   White and Blue thrones, white crown, white knight.<br />
<br />
  The crown and thrones may take you a while, but you'll get them if you are determined :)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
   Only gorrilla mobs drop library cards, so don't count on getting one solo anywhere but Glonk.<br />
<br />
   Kill Slice and Dice whenever you can to get pet weapons.    Broken Blam Stick is LORE, so you can't stockpile them, but you can keep a spare so you only need 1 kill of slice/dice at the start and again at the end of your hunting session.<br />
<br />
<br />
  Blam sticks on pets are THE best weapon you can use other than mage summoned gear.    The 61 pet with 2 blam sticks will quad hit for 72 instead of the normal 60 max.<br />
<br />
<br />
  Another easy source of cards for a shaman is the Treasure Chest in the forest.   It is an enchanter type mob and has a TON of hp, plus chain casts rune.    But with pet on it and a constant stream of DoTs you can easily beat it down, it can drop crowns/knights/squires.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Okotona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The atmosphere of this zone from reading this thread is what I want in EQ... I think I'll try it when/if I get Torpor ;).<br />
<br />
sounds FUN...  (I know it's probably not, but WTH, gunna try it)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Hadd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">took me a good month of heavy farming of alice in wonderland wing to complete my shammanistic shenanigan breastplate and my pom boots ...<br />
at 60+ with torpor the aiw4 part is doable , not that good xp but still xp , all mobs can drop thrones , and you can farm book pages for WoW and funnies . be sure to get a broken blam stick off one of the two halfings ( slash and dash if i remember well ) for your pet as this will increase its max dmg ... as for stomples he spawns on sniffles death , at the end of aiw4 in the big room with the rooted archers . soloed stomples self buffed at 63 . he can be nasty though , on my second try on him he killed me 11 times ( i was bound by debbis , and i zerged him , he was under a bub each time ... ) then i got ressed rebuffed and got him down . i killed it a good 15 times i think , drops a throne every 4 kills or so .... problems is he is on a 33 hour timer , add/substract 3 hours . it can lead to troubles if trying to camp him . <br />
i love the zone , i wish they could fix the broken quests ...<br />
best infos will be found at www.planeofmischief.com  .<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Banuddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">all mobs can drop thrones  <br />
Not true.  Certain areas of the zone only drop certain ranks of cards, plain and simple (though some with more frequency than others).<br />
<br />
In terms of the feasibility of PoM- I spent 2-3 months there farming almost constantly and got the Boots, BP, and a cloak of confusion (and sold cards that totalled about 100k in the end).  I also got about 30 AA overall.<br />
<br />
The xp was actually some of the best in the game after the higher level xp changes so I would say it was worth hunting there, but with PoP out I wouldn't bother with the zone, there are upgrades that arent too difficult to get for the quest items, and you won't be able to get 63+ spells if you spend all your time there.  Plus, it is extremely boring after the first week or so.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, and the boots take 3 of the most rare cards in the zone (I was super lucky and got a white crown/throne on my first few days of the zone, don't expect odds like that though).<br />
<br />
If you do decide to do the quests, however, I would see if you could bring a friend or two up with you, having somebody to duo/group with makes it a whole lot more tolerable.</div></div><hr />

Aaaaauuuggggghhhhh! The PAIN! Make it stop!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Laetitia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well the reason for me bringing this up was that i heard that 2 clerics in my guild just got their CC bp , witch rocks !<br />
And they only used a month on it.<br />
They got all the cards in PoM except one of the 2 clerics went to bazaar and bought on fo the cards he needed for the bp.<br />
I Dont think they got anything else of the amors when they where up there but the bp is INSANE if ure not in a big raiding guild that kills in VT and Pofire and places like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I got a ton of cod cards in my bank from fishing. Anyone know *** they are for? Bah I need to go rebind in PoM....only other card I got in my 1 1/2 week stint up there was a black squire. <br />
<br />
Question about AiWL. There are what, four rooms, with the halflings in them? They get bigger and bigger. The halflings are standing right next to each other, so I am assuming you have to fight them at the same time. Can you single them at 65?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Crash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I have read the quest on allakazam and the PoM web site but I need some help still.  Which container does one combine the white throne, blue throne, white crown and white knight (for boots)?  Once you have the boots of distraction what container does one use to combine them with the shaman doll?.    Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Cards are combined in the deck of spontaneous combustion.  You get a deck by killing dinner and taking the king cod card to Ferjenorer in the garden.  Once you get the boots of distraction, you combine the boots and the doll in the empty pot of gold to get the final reward.  Dinner is like level 1 and dies from one hit.  The only problem is the two asslings in the chandilier Mizer and Bitz who nuke you when you go in room.  <br />
<br />
The cards you get from fishing is an alternate way to get a deck of spontaneous combustion.  You give 4 of em to Ferjenorer and he gives you the deck.<br />
<br />
I have been bound in Pom for about a month and a half now.  In that time I have killed stomples probably 5 times and he hasn't ever dropped anything besides the foot.  From AIW and Puppets I have recieved 3 blue thrones, 1 white throne, 1 black throne, 1 red throne, 2 full sets of crowns, plus 2 more sets of crowns missing white, countless knights, squires.  Have had four chances at gift boxes and gotten shaman, necro, enchanter, nothing.  I got the pieces I wanted, which were BP, boot and helm.  Now I can't leave just because of addiction heh.<br />
<br />
I 2-box a 62 magician (and me 63 shaman) and it seems to work out fine.  Before I started duoing I soloed puppets, stomples and AIW just to ensure myself that I was capable of it.  Its so much nicer with epic mage though, having a pet that can keep aggro even when I load every dot I have is very nice!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Very interesting thread.  I haven't checked out PoM and I've been meaning to.<br />
<br />
In reading the PoM forums, it doesn't appear that just using sow and a Shiny Brass Idol starting at the hub outside where the kos NTOV mobs start would get me to PoM.  <br />
<br />
Any of you guys just ran in like that?  <br />
<br />
If I got a 2 minute Bard selos, would that make the difference?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I made the run with full spawn with just bard 2 min selos and bard da.  Of course, I ran with a full group, so I had some people blocking for me, we all made it though.... not on our first try.<br />
<br />
It took me about 2 months of at least 5 days a week farming to get my boots.  I had 3 friends up there helping me too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Hadd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Gart , just check for the next server patch , make sure you have a shiny brass idol , and try to make a lil time at server up for camping , usually a guild will pass by the day the server is up , follow them , make sure you tell em , and they should start the named cleaning circle .... from there you can leave them at about halfway or so with your idol clicked ...... when i made the run  GrG was cleaning , it took me 3 hours of waiting while sending tells saying nameds were up around , two bad tries of a guild who failed to kill aary , then GrG showed up , and cleaned the way up to the 2nd lair on the right ( if i remember well ) on the way two shield of the wurms dropped and they only had one shaman , i ended up with a very nice shield ;) took like 2 hours for the raid to move halfway through the right walkway , they left , i clicked idol and made it to pom . total time : 5 hours and i got into pom . <br />
side note : that was my 4th try , i tried the run two times and failed short , and the 3rd time i clicked my idol by mistake in Cs ...<br />
any way , good luck , hope i'll see you up there , spiritstone of everfrost is our friend . <br />
<br />
Hadd.<br />
one month of heavy camping/soloing of AiW4 for bp/boots . <br />
even got an extra blue throne i sold for 20K i think .</div></div><hr />
