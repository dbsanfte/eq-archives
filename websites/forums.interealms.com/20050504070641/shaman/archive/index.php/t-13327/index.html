<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Khayla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings fellow Shamans, I've spent 2 days dwelling over what I should do and finally decided to seek some help from the veterans.<br />
<br />
I currently have the following AA:<br />
(General) RS3, Regen3<br />
(Arch) MC3, SCR3<br />
(Class) CanniV, MGB<br />
<br />
I'm 63, and not looking to see runes or 65 for awhile (so no Quiesence in the picture).  I duo alot with a 63 Warrior, and cast Kragg's constantly in this situation.  I'd like some advice on which AA's I should seek next in this situation.  I am also the  main shaman at most of our raids, so I need to consider that as well.  I rarely use Knarg's unless its an emergency (it just takes so much mana).  <br />
<br />
Since Healing Adept won't help Kragg's, I've put it on the back burner.  I'm leaning towards SCM or Healing Gift (though all that AA just for the &quot;chance&quot; to crit seems like a waste at this point).  <br />
<br />
I am also very tempted to get QB, as I do not have a spell haste item nor expect to get one.  No it won't affect Kragg's, but it will affect Torpor...which makes it worth it to me :)<br />
<br />
So I ask you all...SCM or QB...a little of both?  Or something else I'm not thinking of?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Njorls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I believe Healing Adept does work with Kragg's but Healing Gift doesn't. I should check this tonight, just bought HA1.<br />
<br />
There's a lot of different ways you can go. I suggest getting the ones that will have the biggest impact on getting more aa first.<br />
<br />
You could get Radiant Cure, Virulent Paralysis and Spirit Call at level 1 easily enough, these are nice additions to your bag of tricks for relatively low AA.<br />
<br />
As for what else to do, I'd finish SCRM before putting anything into Quick Buff, buffs lasting longer is better than buffs casting faster. SCM and ND are also both excellent aa.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes, QB is good for Torpor, but seeing how you wont use it alot on your tank buddy, how much is that really worth?<br />
<br />
Look into the Wicked Bone Ataili (sp?), I have one and it wasnt that hard to get. If it aint hard to get, then it should be cheap enough to buy sometime soon. <br />
<br />
Really, think about getting SCM down pat. Saves alot more mana than you think it would, and I dont know a 65 shammy that doesnt have it. <br />
<br />
If you wanna play around, the extra DPS of MightyDog Disc is fun and profitable :)<br />
<br />
GO ahead and max out that healing gift and adept! If you are main healer, these 2 things will save you alot of mana and before you know it, you will never scribe that Kragg's again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Wow, Khayla, thanks for summing up my situation almost exactly!  Or the situation I will be in soon, anyway.  I'm 62+7AA, shooting for 63 before I go 100% AA for a while and get Cann V and MGB.  No expectation of hitting 65 in the foreseeable future, but my wife is a warrior the same level as me and we duo a lot.<br />
<br />
What I'm considering that I haven't seen listed is ND3 and possibly STA for the hit points.  I have a goal that by the time I get Cann V I want to be able to survive a Cann V unbuffed in full gear AND self-buffed with no gear, without drawing low-health aggro.  Not sure if the latter is possible but ND3 and STA will get me as close as possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The latter is possible, with ND3 and sta aa. Helps if yer an ogre though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Khayla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Look into the Wicked Bone Ataili (sp?), I have one and it wasnt that hard to get. If it aint hard to get, then it should be cheap enough to buy sometime soon. <br />
<br />
<br />
I'd love to get one, but the money I currently have is being saved for the 63/64 spells...Talisman of the Boar and Blessings of Repleneshment mainly.  <br />
<br />
To me, AA is cheaper than money, and spells are more important than items.  Farming is boring, and I generally don't have time to do it anyways.  I'd much prefer xp'ing with friends and my hubby (the warrior pet) ;)<br />
<br />
I've seriously considered SCRM first...but after saving 9aa for MGB, 5aa for Canni, 6aa for SCR3 ...I wasn't looking forward to saving another 8aa, but on the other hand it must be done sometimes, so lets just get it over with now!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jorgan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I wouldn't do the healing aa's until I get done with SCRM, SCM, CA, and ND, to name a few.  The marginal benefit from the healing aa's just doesn't seem worth all the effort to get them.  Not when there's such a noticeable benefit to the others I listed above.<br />
<br />
If you want to improve your healing and you're in a  guild that is capable, look into getting one of the Improved Healing IV hats off of the prototypes in PoI.  The last time we were there, we got one off of each.  IH4 doesn't improve Kraggs, but it will Tnargs.  For me, that's good enough, since most of the time when I have to heal it HAS to be a fast cast heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">ND3 is very nice.  Can't go wrong with extra HP.<br />
<br />
I think after Canni5 and ND3, AA becomes very sketchy as to what's more valuable than others...<br />
<br />
CA3 to live longer...<br />
SCR to be more efficient at healing/buffing...<br />
SCM to be more efficient at everything...<br />
QB to heal quicker...<br />
SC/RC/VP for utility...<br />
<br />
I've just been hopping randomly around AA since I got canni.  I highly recommend RC1 though.  For two points, it's one of the most explicitly useful AA around.  Cures most dots or other bad effects in one shot, and you never have to swap **** around to mem a spell, just flip to the hotkey page.<br />
<br />
In your situation, I'd probably go RC1, ND3, then either SCM3 or CA3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Spiritcall is nowhere near as useful as Pet Control.  Especially if you duo a lot, pet control will help you quite a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">QB 2 isn't bad at all.  I have SCM2 so far, and haven't noticed any difference.  I'm sure there is one, but it's not noticeable to me.  I suppose SCM3 will be better of course.<br />
<br />
But torpor with QB2 and a wicked bone atatl is 3.3 seconds instead of 6 seconds without QB and a spell haste item.  That's significant.  Plus, faster a lot of other spells is good too, although not a reason alone to burn AA.  I'm pretty invis is effected along with all your buffs.<br />
<br />
I do think Radiant Cure and Spirit Call are worth considering for a shaman in your shoes.  They are quite handy, imho.  Virulent Paralysis too.  <br />
<br />
Of course, I still believe leveling to 65 is most important if effectiveness if an issue.  Without or without your spells, and they are getting a bit cheaper, 65 is more effective than 63.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">radiant cure1, spell casting mastery, then ND.<br />
Free cure of all bad effects, Free mana, free HP.  You can't go wrong with that.  :)<br />
<br />
Quickbuff is very nice, I have QB3 and I love it but you can get a haste of mithaniel item that will work on most things that it does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">SCM is very good.  for two points RC1 is a steal, going beyond lvl 1 i dont plan to in the long future.  CA and ND are very nice as well.  And if you duo with the warrior a lot, HA would be usefull, but the only problem is its still limited to being usefull only when duoing.  a bunch of the others are usefull all the time.  also as said before, healing adept works on kraggs, healing gift does not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Asraguard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hey Khayla,<br />
<br />
The progression I took was<br />
<br />
Regen3<br />
Run3<br />
MC3<br />
Canni5<br />
ND1 - wasted 2 AA here<br />
MGB<br />
RC1<br />
SCR3<br />
SCRM<br />
QB3<br />
SCM2<br />
<br />
I'm currently working on SCM3 and after that I'm not sure. I may waste 10 points to get ND3 but I really don't want to.<br />
<br />
The way I figured my AA was based on what I perceived a shaman to do best. Canni5 needs no explaining, MGB is vital if you are in a raiding guild and RC1 is invaluable against most PoP encounters. SCR3 and SCRM gives you 50% buff extension and 1800hp Torpors which I rate as a much larger mana saving to that from SCM. With my innate regen and replenishment I find for every Canni5/Torpor I actually gain enough HPs to throw in a Canni4 as well and still be at full hps.<br />
<br />
Next I got QB3 cuz I wanted 3sec Torpors and its so handy to have fast casting buffs in both groups and raids. Now that I have Quiesence I find 3sec cast time on 1800hp heals for 200mana an incredibly powerful tool. Further if you are battle rebuffing on a raid while having to worry about keeping mobs debuffed its amazing what a difference it is to have to have ur buff times 50% hasted.<br />
<br />
I'm working to SCM3 now and then afterwards I may go for some of the PoP AA like VP or SC. I am not a big fan of spending 12AA on ND3 to get a measly 10% gain on HPs out of it. I guess I will get it out of the way after SCM3 but I would be tempted to go for CA3 first.<br />
<br />
Cheers,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">For any raiding shaman, this is probably the route you want to go with and probably never deviate from it, unless you don't like the regen 3 and want something else.<br />
-Run 3<br />
-Regen 3<br />
-Mental Clarity 3<br />
-Cannibalization<br />
-Mass Group buff<br />
<br />
After those, here's the path I took I think.  I took them because they are all more activatable skills that have really good uses in the right situations:<br />
-Radiant Cure 1 (This skill is amazing.  It cures poisons, diseases, curses, snare, root, magic based dots, and all sorts of afflictions that you would have to dispel to remove, and you don't need to mem a spell to do it.  Best 2 points you could ever spend)<br />
-Spirit Call 3 (The free damage is nice.  Each pet parses about 750-1000 damage depending on the target.  Their push factor is both a blessing in some situations, and a curse in others.  In the end, 3500-5000 damage every 12 minutes for zero mana is hard to argue with)<br />
-Virulent Paralysis 1 (This skill I wasn't sure was going to be too good, but I found I really like it.  It's disease based, so the different resist on being able to root stuff can be useful.  The knockback effect is very good for positioning mobs.  The root is free mana, so when I'm root rotting stuff, I can save myself about 100+ mana every 2 minutes on a root.  The knockback pushes most mobs out of melee range, so you don't need to move much to stop getting hit (good when you are on a horse))<br />
<br />
-After these skills, I went for the Weight Watchers 3 skill so I eat less food and water.  I'm on my horse a lot, so I hate going through all those hero sammiches and misty thicket pic-a-nic baskets.  It's very noticable how little food you go through with this skill.  I think a stack of 20 miraculous food/water will last me for about 2 weeks straight.<br />
<br />
-After that, because I am often the shaman massing f07, and because I have Q, I got Spell Casting Reinforcement Mastery.  Less massing of buffs.  More efficient heals.  Less often buffing other annoying buffs.  Longer lasting Ferine Avatars is nice.<br />
<br />
-After that, I got Quick Buff 2.  The first level was to get Elder Title.  I got the 2nd level so that with my Haste of Mithanial item, I have the max 50% quick buff level for Q.  If I replace my Haste of Mithanial item, I'll probably get Quick Buff 3, but for now, I have zero need.  I also got QB2 just so I don't have to bug Clerics for BoR quite as much.<br />
<br />
That's about as far as I am in my AAs.<br />
Hope it helps you decide.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Khayla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Thanks for the responses all :)  I priced the Wicked Bone Atlat... 20-30k is way way out of price range.  But, I will hold off on QB as well and just suffer with the 6sec casting time of Torpor...as someone mentioned I don't cast that on the warrior in battle (for obvious reasons).  Talisman of the Boar and Blessings of Replenishment are running about 10k apiece, still above my price range but thats my next stop.<br />
<br />
My hesitant next steps are:<br />
SCRM - will extend swifty, regen, and other buffs and will thus save me mana when duoing AND in raid situations<br />
RC1 - ya'll convinced me of its worth :)<br />
<br />
Then I will add SCM, ND (I need the HP buffer) to that list.  The consensus here seems to be that the healing AA's aren't good enough to put ahead of some of these others, so I won't.<br />
<br />
I so want to do Spirit Call, just to see all those puppies at once, but I'll resist...for now :)<br />
<br />
Thanks again, and good travels to you my fellow Shamans!</div></div><hr />

<br />
All definitely nice aa's. I personally did ND back when it was added in for shaman and the hps it added was nice. I went SCM first before SCRM for the mana savings while debuffing since if i'm going to run out of mana debuffing odds are I can't pause long enough to cann v let alone cann 4 for mana. SCRM is a great aa tho.<br />
<br />
Next I got QB3 cuz I wanted 3sec Torpors and its so handy to have fast casting buffs in both groups and raids.

<br />
QB3 always seemed soo expensive and somewhat pointless. An enhancement haste item, regular spell haste item and/or cleric buff takes you close enough to the cap with just qb2  just can't see the point of spending 9aa to max out the aa but that just my personal opinion.<br />
<br />
I'm working to SCM3 now and then afterwards I may go for some of the PoP AA like VP or SC. I am not a big fan of spending 12AA on ND3 to get a measly 10% gain on HPs out of it. I guess I will get it out of the way after SCM3 but I would be tempted to go for CA3 first.<br />

Since your already over 3khps unbuffed I'd recommend doing ca3 and lr5 before you do natural durability. You've got pleanty of hps even unbuffed to not have to worry about low health aggro issues with cann v. CA3/LR5 is going to do alot more for your survivability than another 300 hps will if you get aggro from something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">(grammarnazi)<br />
&quot;Ya'll&quot; is not a correct contraction.  That would be &quot;ya will&quot; or &quot;you will.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y'all&quot; is the proper way to spell it, as it is a contraction of &quot;you all.&quot;<br />
(/grammarnazi)<br />
<br />
(I hope I didn't make a grammar/spelling mistake somewhere in here for someone to be a dick and point out.   :D )</div></div><hr />

I agree with nearly everything you said. Your above statement was my exact thinking as to why I cannot be bothered getting ND3. There comes a point when the main reason you increase your HPs is just to play comparing games with your mates rather than actually needing them  :D .<br />
<br />
As for my reasoning for getting QB3 its simply cuz none of the long term items I want have any form of enchantment haste on them. I really don't see the point wasting an equipment slot on an enchantment haste item when, as a shaman, you have AA that max enchantment haste. <br />
<br />
Cheers,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">After the hard grind of MC3, Canni V and MGB, I believe every shaman deserves a break. Have some fun and spend some quick AA on RC1, SC1, and VP1. Every one of them has saved someone's life at one point or another.<br />
<br />
RC1 - cured root so I could run away!<br />
VP1 - innumerable times, rooted add and got it away from melee range.<br />
SC1 - Twice on a CR, when jumped by a mob and VP was resisted, SC1 has held off the mob for long enough for me to escape, or load the necessary spells to kill the mob. Also really really useful against gating mobs for the interrupts and pushing effect.<br />
<br />
After that, I think most issues have been mentioned above. I think shaman are lucky, we get an awful lot of genuinely useful AA skills.</div></div><hr />

I look at things a bit differently. I plan to and already have a spell haste item which covers everything for 18%. I'd also like to someday pick up a xxx of mithaniel item or compairable for the 25 or 30% benificial spell haste for heals. Since they both effect other spells besides just buffs I don't see qb3 negating the use for either one of these items compleately so I take it the other way around in that these items negate my need to bother getting qb3.<br />
<br />
And more hps in never a bad thing but for your aa point right now you can definitely spend them elsewhere for better survivability =)</div></div><hr />
