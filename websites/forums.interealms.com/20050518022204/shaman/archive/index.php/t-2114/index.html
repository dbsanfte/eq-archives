<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Maboun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well let's see , I voted Nader, Perot, Perot  in last 3 elections. Not that I'm a huge fan of either but the 2 big party candidates did not speak to me at all. I tend to take a stand on individual issues and if anything would consider myself left leaning on social issues and right on economy/defense. <br />
<br />
But, I really think people should examine individual issues and work to get viable 3rd, 4th, 5th whatever parties into the mix.  To be honest I feel that taking part in and being aware of local, state, and national legislative elections will make far more difference than whoever is sitting at 1600 Pa. Ave this year.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ya, nader isnt the most leftist guy out there, but he is probably one of the most well known after the last election.  Noam Chomsky would have been a better fit, but i wonder how many people would actually know who he is.  I would call clinton moderate left and not centrist because he did do alot for certain leftist causes, the enviroment comes to mind.  I tried to use more well known figures, and couldnt think of any else that people would recognize.  Had i been able to vote last election (i was 16, will be able to vote in the next presidential election), i would have voted for David McReynolds (socialist party).<br />
<br />
On the third party issue, i do not believe that third and fourth partys on the right and left fringes of our current partys would be able to survive due to lack of support.  What i think needs to happen is a third, centerist party, needs to take shape, and let the democrats and republicans move farther to the right and left.</div></div><hr />

 I agree that Chomsky would have been a better choice for the Hard (&quot;unemcumbered by reality?&quot; =p) Left, but I'm also wondering how many would even know who he is. So I don't think putting Nader in that spot was really a bad choice.</div></div><hr />

Both parties are beholden to wealthy special interests. For example Big labor extracts &quot;dues&quot; from members for the DNC while Big Management pulls funds from shareholders for the GOP. Wealthly business people support the GOP and wealthy celebrities support the DNC.  <br />
<br />
Historically there has been zero difference (other than rhetoric of course) between the far left and the far right of the political spectrum. Both ends aim for total control of personal behavior and subjegation of the individual to the state.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I applaud much of what Nader has done for consumers in the past, but much of his rhetoric alienates me.  He's far too much of a communist, and I'm not of that leaning.  He's definitely far left if you ask me, since he goes beyond &quot;socialism&quot; and quite a ways into &quot;communism&quot; with his leanings.  I've never been able to accept communism's teaching that my work should provide for others' leisure.  <br />
<br />
I'm with Bush right up until he does something like stand up for the continued isolation of Cuba.  There's no reason for that in my opinion, unless it's just to garner votes with older generation Cuban Americans.  I quite frankly don't understand that demographic.  <br />
<br />
The one thing I love about America is that democracy is firmly broken in this country.  If that ever changed, if we became a true democracy, I'd have serious doubts about our future.  As it stands however, with the numerous immigrants from all over the globe over the years contributing their unique experiences and political leanings, our democracy is further than ever from working.  This pleases me.  Nothing is more scary than a democracy that works.  <br />
<br />
Which is why we generally support monarchies in Middle Eastern/Islamic countries.  Those people are far too homogenous  in ethnicity, culture and especially religion for Democracy to be a safe form of government for them.  Give them a nice dictator instead.  They aren't happy, and thus are too involved in trying to organize a revolution to worry about attacking other people.</div></div><hr />

Well, it you harken back to when energy policy was a major issue, Bush came out in support of nuclear power, but the problem is finding anyone who wants to build a nuclear power plant.  <br />
<br />
I can A) build a coal plant, have it ready fairly quickly<br />
B) Build a natural gas plant, have it take a bit longer, but has fewer environmental problems<br />
C) Build a nuclear power plant, have it take forever to build, have almost no pollution(excluding heat), and be regulated into the ground by the left.  <br />
<br />
What a surprise, nobody wants to build a nuclear power plant because of all the regulations imposed on them, often to the point of them being purely punative.  <br />
<br />
Nobody has even proposed a new nuclear power plant in 25 years, and what can Bush exactly do?  Say, 'I'd like to lighten regulations and possibly subsidize part of the building costs on new nuclear power plants'.  Let's suppose he did that, how long until you'd hear people saying, 'See, he's in the pocket of big energy, he doesn't care about you..'  I'd give it until the evening news.<br />
<br />
Take your big oil/power conspiracies elsewhere tks.</div></div><hr />

Conservation is a joke. Has it worked in California which has enacted some of the most stringent energy laws in the world? No, it hasn't. The demand for power has increased in California... In order to meet the energy demand caused by future economic expansion, the US energy industry needs to create new sources of power... conservation doesn't work, stifles industry, and is a joke. The same asses pushing conservation are driving SUV's that get 8mpg. Conservation is nothing more than liberals dictating to me how to live my life.

Clinton or Gore would have been a better fit for the centrist role.  Yeah I know they talk like liberals but their actual policies aren't (What politicians lying!? Inconceivable!).  Go check out some footage of the Gore and Bush debates and you'll see them literally say &quot;I agree with my opponent on this issue..&quot; on just about every issue that was discussed except abortion and the environment.  Even the majority of Clinton/Gore pro-environmental policies were made so that they could be easily undone by Bush as soon as he came into office.  You might remember that being in the newspapers.  The policies werent made to protect the environment they were made to make Bush look bad, knowing that he would overturn them.<br />

Bull****.  No environmentalist supports nuclear energy as an alternative form of energy.  Nuclear waste=worst kind of pollution.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Has it worked in California which has enacted some of the most stringent energy laws in the world?&quot;<br />
<br />
Actually it was privatization of public utilities that caused the power shortages in California (Democrats and Republicans working together).  Those conservation laws you were talking about?  Those weren't enacted until after the power shortages took place in order to deal with the crisis.<br />
<br />
We environmentalists tend to lean towards renewable resources like Solar, Water and Wind power.  If you'd like to see some of our environmentalist policies Gorre in action come on up to my home town of Niagara Falls, we have a hydroelectric plant here that provides electricity to most of the Northeastern US.  It sure as hell beats watching a couple thousand more civilian American and Arabs lose there lives while a bunch of Fundamentalist Christians and Islamics battle it out over oil, money and religious dogma.</div></div><hr />

According ot Al Gorre, cow farting/burping is the worse kind of pollution.... but I stray.<br />
<br />
Walruss Touth made the point that we could go with Nuclear power as an alternative, but it wasn't viable as it would make Bush &quot;poor&quot;. I responded, with sarcasm that those that don't want to drill for oil 2000 miles away will certainly want to have a nuclear power plants in their back yard. See the sarcasm? Obviously those that don't want oil drilling don't want nuclear power plants!! <br />
<br />

<br />
Who said anything about power shortages? I said CONSERVATION hasn't effected CONSUMPTION. CONSUMPTION is up in California, even though they have enacted laws that &quot;force&quot; conservation. Again, Reading comprehension 101 please. By the by, the laws you say weren't enacted until after the power shortages... please do some research. California has been leading hard on conservation for close to three decades.<br />
<br />
If you'd like to see some of our environmentalist policies Gorre in action come on up to my home town of Niagara Falls, we have a hydroelectric plant here that provides electricity to most of the Northeastern US.<br />
<br />
Lovely! Can we put some of those fancy-schmancy water falls anywhere? How exactly do you build a waterfall? Sarcasm again for the impaired. That is great for places that have waterfalls... but not everyone is lucky enough to live by one. As far as supplying energy to the Northeast... how many kilowatts of power is your plant generating? Why are there 5 nuclear reactors in NJ if you guys are supplying the Northeast? FYI, any type of generated power in the Northeast is on &quot;The Grid&quot;. &quot;The Grid&quot; moves power around to different parts of the Northeast depending upon where it is needed. So if your little power plant shuts down for maintenance, thank your lucky stars there is a nuclear reactor somewhere sending you power to play EQ. I am not against your little dam/power plant, but to think it can cure the world off of dependence upon Nuclear/oil is absurd. <br />
<br />
Solar power and wind power? How big of a field of solar panels would we need to supply a small city? Face it, nice in theory, but the current technology makes in non-viable as an alternative to nuclear/fossil. Some day, maybe.<br />
<br />
It sure as hell beats watching a couple thousand more civilian American and Arabs lose there lives while a bunch of Fundamentalist Christians and Islamics battle it out over oil, money and religious dogma.<br />
Couldn't agree more... so does drilling for oil in Alaska and building more nuclear power plants... something we can do now, but we are prevented from doing because of leftist conservationists and democraps like Tom Daschle who rather keep the votes of the conservationists in his pocket than do what is best for the country.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">California is so proud of it's environmental stands but all it truly does is export its polution to other parts of the county / globe and then heap ridicule on those that provide energy for California.<br />
<br />
Do you realy think that power you purchase from Mexico is produced without polution?<br />
<br />
Do you realy think oil produced in Siberia or South America will be cleaner then that produced by American Coprs. in Alaska?<br />
<br />
If you are truly environmentalist then you should be saying YES IN MY BACK YARD so yes can make sure it is done right instead of just buying the resources you consume from parts of the globe where production is not restricted by any concern for the environment.<br />
<br />
How about producing a little of that oil of the coast of California instead of buying it from Mexico or Agentina.<br />
<br />
If you look at global impact, I bet California is the most poluting state in the union.  The big differance is that California does a big chunk of its poluiton outside its own borders.  They don't live in the filth they produce but poor people around the world do.</div></div><hr />

I am just a lowly uneducated prole who cannot always pick up on the superior wit and intelligence of our ruling caste.  After this post I promise to return to my designated class and never again challenge the claims of my superiors and always address you with the words &quot;Yes Massa&quot;.  <br />
<br />
You see I simply jumped to the conclusion that when you talked of energy problems in California that you referred to the energy shortage in California because you were concerned with problems that affect us commoners.  It was not my intent to step out of line.  It was selfish of me to ask you to think of us citizens when your mind should be occupied on more important matters like expanding corporate profit margins.  Conservation! To hell with it!  Never again shall you be forced to scheme by the light of 45 watt light bulbs.  A mind as enlightening as yours deserves no less than 75 watts.  In fact, I humble propose building one of those nook-leer reactor thingies in order to power a massive light bulb that you may work by day and night.  As long as I draw breath never again will you be forced to ride public transportation with lazy welfare mothers, and (/gasp!) minorities.<br />
<br />
Anyone who thinks that the billions of dollars it takes to build a single nuclear reactor is in any way related to the massive debt owed by privatized utility companies in California is certainly not thinking clearly.  And anyone who says that this increased debt is what led them to hold back power to create shortages that weren't there 2 years so they could push for deregulation of prices to charge outrageous amounts for power is nothing but a bleeding heart pinko liberal/communist/anarchist/socialist like I was only 5 minutes ago.<br />
<br />
My dreams of us using renewable and less polluting forms of energy were just that- the dreams of an ignorant plebian.  Why you are absolutely right, we should be following in your native New Jerseys steps in environmental policies.  Why, when I even say the name &quot;Jersey&quot; my imagination is filled with beautiful visions of wondrous smog clouds in the sky taking shape of various animals and beautiful beaches filled with sandcrabs and infected syringes.<br />
<br />
Solar and wind power is, as you said absolutely absurd.  We cannot afford to stifle progress by wasting our time inventing new technologies.  Progress isn't about inventing new, better, more efficient ways of doing things, it’s about enforcing the use of old ways to make some people richer.  We can't be spending billions of taxpayers dollars on attempting to find new technologies that might not materialize when we already know that spending billions on military spending to subjugate foreign cultures and installing puppet dictators like Saddam Hussein, Manuel Noriega, the Taliban and the Northern Alliance works and will never backfire on us.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">The same asses pushing conservation are driving SUV's that get 8mpg<br />
I sencerely doubt this, most of the enviromentalists i know drive around in hybrids.<br />
<br />
If you are truly environmentalist then you should be saying YES IN MY BACK YARD so yes can make sure it is done right instead of just buying the resources you consume from parts of the globe where production is not restricted by any concern for the environment.  <br />
perhaps if it was some other part of our backyard, but please, not in a wildlife reserve for chrissakes, one of the most pristine wilderness areas left on earth.  Also, drilling for oil is just about the same in our country as anywhere else, its still done by BP, Shell, etc.<br />
Do you realy think that power you purchase from Mexico is produced without polution? <br />
California produces most if not all of its own power locally, if they where able to draw power from sources far and abroad there would not have been a power shortage.</div></div><hr />

Much better... although I don't recall asking for your servitude. Try arguing facts and reality in your next post rather than just throwing out some eloquent prose. Maybe respond to some of the points I made rather than trying to be a clever and witty guy?<br />
<br />
PS: What is it like to live in the '60's, dude? How is the Hemp crop coming?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Gimgrim Fren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Being a troll, some would contend tha I lean to the right of the politcal spectrum. Not so at all. My mother was a kind hearted  troll who encouraged me to take pity on the lesser races. Her first rule was that you should never torture others for too long before ending their pitiful lives. I strive to live up to her standards but sometimes I find myself longing to torture a human, or better yet a hafling, for a very protracted period of time. That being the case if any politician(and I use that term with the highest regard were a hafling, which btw I think for the most part they are) I would only torture him for say.... a few hours-- and then kill him. So, as you can see I'm moderate in the strictest sense of the word.<br />
<br />
As for all this talk about the pros and cons of energy consumption. Let me just say that troll dung has been researched for many years and is a proven energy commodity. BTW if anybody's interested, I feel a fresh supply coming on. Well, that's all I have to say about that. And remember... moderation in torture.</div></div><hr />
