<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Havanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Why can't there be an Equipment section in the main forum page? <br />
<br />
Shamans are (or many would like to believe) more AC/HP based, and thus need more exact choices when it comes to equipment, similar to melee characters. <br />
<br />
It wouldn't be hard at all to add, and equipment forums wouldn't really need that much moderation either, just a thought. <br />
<br />
It's strange to have all these general concerns tied in with equipment questions, it'd be neater as well.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Havanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">First off, sorry I didn't see the post before. If this is unnecessary or misplaced as a post, I'm sorry, but by the time it was pointed out, it was too late. <br />
<br />
I'd say 24% warrants the creation of the section due to the fact that it would require so little actual work to create it. If it didn't work out, delete it, sections have been created and deleted on numerous boards.<br />
<br />
Other than that, I don't see why you brought up the poll. It's simply a poll, and no one's seen any evidence that aything ever came of that. I'm simply asking why not, it's not pointless, but the want of an equipment section shouldn't require an in-depth explanation.<br />
<br />
It might, probably, maybe, won't work, I'm simply saying why not try.</div></div><hr />
