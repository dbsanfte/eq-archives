<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>coquinmalin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello,<br />
<br />
I intend to play a shaman in the high level game (lvl 60 raids).<br />
Do you think Iksars are a good choice. I know they have problems with some armor types, including the famous jbb.<br />
<br />
Is it really difficult to solo at lvl 60 without a jbb ?<br />
Is there any other free nuking item ?<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot !</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">they have a jbb type weapon .. little harder to obtain http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=8827<br />

id be a kitten if i could .. sneak owns</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zorarian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Never had any glaring problems leveling up myself, but that is sorta misleading. Lvl 60 is demarcated more by spell book than race for shaman.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you're powering to 60 just to raid, and going to do it fairly fast, it probably doesn't matter what race you choose.  I've never had a jbb and lived fine w/o it.  Anything that a jbb-enabled shaman can solo, we can solo as well =)  Keep in mind most shaman do not have a jbb.  It'll speed up your levelling from 45-55 or so, which is quite useful, but nothing you'll die without.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Heh, a year+ or so ago you would have asked &quot;why be anything but an Iksar?&quot; or &quot;are Barbarians worth it?&quot;.  A bit farther back and your question would have been &quot;why be anything but an Ogre?&quot;.<br />
<br />
Play what you won't get sick of looking at and whatever race you identify with.  I lived in Florida swamp areas when I was young, like beer, have green as a favourite colour, and get a Pavlovian urge to n00k everytime I see a light npc, so I ended up playing a troll....go figure :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Blackdust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">OMG Gloriana that was so funny, one of the funniest posts I have seen in a long time hehe.<br />
<br />
I play a mean Iksar shaman, I'm so glad I stuck with it. The 20% experience penalty sucks big time. But once you hit 60, it doesnt matter any more. Iksars are great, but they aren't easy. The xp penalty is rough and the faction was difficult to deal with before Luclin came out. If those things don't bother you then an Iksar may be a good choice, otherwise you may want to consider a Vah Shir or Barbarian since they don't have much of an XP penalty at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Make a cat or an ogre.<br />
<br />
Stun immunity vs. Sneak is the big choice there.<br />
<br />
Stun Immunity is pretty damn handy, I hate getting stunned as a barbarian.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>mmshah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I love being iksar and while it will slow u down getting to 60, its worth it in the long run IMO.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>bluefire</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Lvl 60 and I can solo as good or better then any shaman with a jbb.  They are a TOY, not a make or break item for fighting.  Personally...just pick whichever race you like the best, if you get your spells and are a decent player you can make any race work, toys or no    :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">As an ikky I find my base sta far more troubling than the lack of the jbb.  As for soloing towards the end game, done ww (including aoe dragons) and pog so far for comedy solo spots, grouping is far more enjoyable for good xp though, even if its duo.  Pick what race you will enjoy the most is the best route, just remember, tails &gt; all else =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Isnt winterstorm a proc now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Chikarsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">No, don't make an Iksar.<br />
<br />
Actually, don't make a Shaman at all. <br />
<br />
k thx.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The last time Winterstorm dropped we forced someone to loot it. It's not that hard to obtain. THO isn't like Avatar of War or anything. He's a big teddy bear. If you can go say hi to him, you can kill him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">And here I was hoping he was asking if Iksar were worth it when it comes to the hassle it causes the rest of us. :( THE ANSWER IS NO! /cry</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">IKSAR IS THE ONLY CHOICE !!!<br />
<br />
Those who are not of scale, do not possess the power to be be true children of Cazic Thule. Fear is the path of the dark side !! <br />
Once you have fear in your heart only then will you be ready. <br />
<br />
You are not worthy of being Iksar if you have to ask.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
FEAR leads to anger, Anger leads to hate, Hate leads to suffering !!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Actually, a while back VI explained the paradigm of iksar faith on their boards while discussing why DEs could be agnostic, but not iksar. Fear has to do with bettering oneself, not embracing evil. There's no darkside about the iksar. It's all just some big scaley version of Scientology.<br />
<br />
It's about time us 'softskins' helped our shamanic cousins with an intervention. ;(</div></div><hr />

WTS next level of enlightenment 10k</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">If you are trying to haul butt to 60, make a kitty shaman. If you would like to have a manafactory shaman at 60, make iksar. If getting to 60 as fast as possible is the goal, iksar probably not worth your frustration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Katnyp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I am a 55th level shammy, and I love being a Vah Shir. As far as racial abilities, Vah Shir come with Sneak, Safe Fall, and Infravision. If you're not going for Troll, I would create a kittie.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Warscar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Evil is just not my thing. Kats look cool, have good faction, some interesting abilities and last but not least......we have a tail. Tails roxor! Tails &gt; then all.  &lt;g&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Iksar have tails !!!<br />
<br />
Iksar are not evil...we are just misunderstood ! Fear is the only emotion you need to know. Strike fear in your enemies and watch them crumble before your scaly feet ! <br />
<br />
Iksar have great faction...we can pretty much kill anybody we want and not have to worry about who we pissed off !! <br />
I've killed a guard in just about every town...why ? You ask<br />
Because I CAN !!! <br />
<br />
To know us is to FEAR us !!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Chamelius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I agree with stormrazor, I like being evil because I dont have to worry about what I can or cant kill to keep my faction up. PoG you say? Sure why not.<br />

The only thing that bothers me is that damn greaseball brianna treewhisper! Stupid drood.  Anyone think he is soloable at 60 with a full spellbook?<br />
<br />
By the way iksar tail &gt; vah shir tail</div></div><hr />
