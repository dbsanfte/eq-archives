<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nindalf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Being in Australia I often need to look up the time for PST, CST, etc.  I've found many websites that incorporate world time zone, but I find most of them confusing, clumsy and overcomplicated.<br />

I just found this one however at<br />

It seems to be really polished and I found it easy to use instantly.  Quite fast.  I think it also has some nice touches such as the map that shows you where the sun is shining in the world.  All in all, very polished and meets my Everquest needs tremendously compared to other world zone websites I've come across.<br />
