<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Quinnell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello everyone.  Just wanted to let you know that I've had some issues with the patch and install of Luclin.<br />
<br />
After installing DX8.1 and then the Luclin expansion, I tried to patch yesterday and had all the same issues that everyone else did.  Late last night, I finally managed to get the patch done.  With amazing joy and wonderous expectations, I clicked the Play button on my launcher -- and got a fatal exception error that crashed Windows.<br />
<br />
I rebooted and, after Scandisk ran, tried again to launch EQ.  Unfortunately, this time when I clicked play I got a fatal exception error and the computer refused to boot.<br />
<br />
Basically, something in the patch crashed my box and I'm going to have to rebuild it.  It may be a day or two before I'm around.<br />
<br />
It definately wasn't a virus and it definately wasn't a pre-existing condition.  The only thing except for updating my McAfee dat files I've done to my PC in a month is install Luclin and patch EQ.<br />
<br />
Anyway, just wanted to let everyone know that I'll be back......but it may be a few days.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Boogahz Dokupuppy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I had a similar problem, but it was with DirectX 8.1.  It was corrected when I reinstalled Windows over itself then upgraded.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Windigo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yikes Quin :(  Seems like everyone is having some sort of troubles.  I hope you get it solved soon.  Any problem is stressful but it's even worse when you do everything you're supposed to and it works worse than before.<br />
<br />
Good luck there.</div></div><hr />
