<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was in dreadlands last night, leveling my monk (lv 41, iksar).  I decided to try grouping them, killing with the shaman, and letting the monk soak up xp.  It didn't take long to remember how worthless shaman are at killing masses of green cons.<br />
Anyway, I decided to kill the dog, and go straight healer and let the monk fight it out.  After all, the monk could kill much faster than the shaman anyway.  Instead of just killing the dog, I had the monk duel it just for laughs.  I guess the laugh was on me, the monk beat the dog...badly.<br />
Now the monk is twinked, wears a fungi.  Monk was buffed with ios/talisman of altuna/alacrity.  The dog had focus of soul/celerity.  I dont have any way to know how much hp the dog has, but the monk had 1900hp/850ac(buffed).   Monk also uses a soulscream belt, where the pet didn't have any item haste.  Proc on the monks' copper hammer never went off, so all damage was pure melee.<br />
My poor pet had taken all of 10% off the monk before he was down to 20% and enraged.  The monk ended up at 70% by fighting through the enrage and killing the dog.<br />
<br />
This is pathetic.  My 41 monk couldn't even touch a level 58 mob, much less kill it, but he destroyed my level 58 pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hail,<br />
<br />
 :eek: <br />
Hmm, did dogdog have weapons?  Did the monk use mend?<br />
<br />
I would say a twinked monk (even at 41) would easily overcome dogdog in most cases.  Remember that with mage weapons, FA, Haste,Focus + Diaku, I think the parses came out that dogdog will do max around ~40 dps.  Dogdog is a naked warrior for abilities (taunt, enrage, shield, etc) with the hitpoints of a naked ranger &amp; the offensive melee skills of a naked caster. :p  Don't expect miracles. :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Monks specialize in avoidance, and dogdog already whifs alot as it is, so I doubt you would be seeing him win against a monk unequipped.<br />
<br />
Try again with dogdog equipped with mage mask/girdle/weapons, and give him FA, Focus, SLTW, Replenishment, and Strength of Diaku for a rematch.  I think he'd do more damage in procs than in physical damage.<br />
Would be an interesting battle. ;) <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>enarcheos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sounds a bit bugged. <br />
Pet has an average of 20 dps and 2,500 hp when hasted and focused. <br />
Monk had 1900 hp * 10% damage done = 190 hp. <br />
190 hp / 20 dps = 9.5 seconds before enrage.<br />
Pet had 2500 hp * 80% = 2000 dd. <br />
2000 dd done by monk / 9.5 seconds = 210 dps<br />
<br />
<br />
Level 41 monk with 210 dps? That must have been an easy PL. You should take him to BoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Fight was about 30 seconds or so, so theres some hp regained from the fungi/iksar regen.  Mend wasnt used.  Could easily try it again, however the monk is 42 now ;)<br />
Monk is using hammer of battle/copper hammer.  Add in fungi and ummm orc fang earrings, hes fairly twinked. (I hate the price of good jewelry)<br />
What really bothers me is that the monk cant even hit a npc of that level.  He was hitting doggie as easy as the even con drolvargs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Sounds to me like you don't know how to set up your pet more than anything. <br />
<br />
20dps? <br />
<br />
Try 40dps with summoned pet gear and decent buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Jharassik, i was just out pl'ing.  Not exactly something I'm going to go all out buffing/gearing up a pet for.  Perhaps read the first post?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Was bored and did it again.  Made a log this time.  I'd still like someone to show me a level 58 mob that my monk can hit.<br />
Not a complaint, its just funny, take it in humor.  Doggie did better this time.  Just as a note, seems the monk wasnt wearing  bracers the first time, were still in his trade bags.<br />

Perhaps there's a damage nerf to pets in PVP? Max pet hit was 36 damage which is PRECISELY 60% of the normal max hit. You'd think I would have noticed this on Rallos =p. Ah, here we go: http://eq.crgaming.com/archives.asp?Day=28&amp;Month=9&amp;Year=1999&amp;ID=331&amp;Action=View.

Then add summoned armour if he is attaually going get beat on.  And then buff him with as much HP/DEX/STR as you can.  Puppy really doesnt do a whole lot unless you work at it.  my unbuffed pet with no items to be honest plain sucks and I wouldnt use him if I didnt know that by buffing him and arming him he turns into a little procing machine.</div></div><hr />

Ok, this is all well and good but your not really making a point anyone doesnt know. A twinked monk can kill an unbuffed, naked dogdog, who has a natural build in weakness in PvP. At least give dogdog some sort of evening odds, weapons, buffs.. or Just cast that lovely Turgurs on the monk and lets see him repeat that beating. Honestly the pet works just fine, and when do you use him and NOT slow your opponent? thats our big advantage, the dog isnt meant to kil for us, he's meant to tank for us.<br />

Thats all I got to say here, just got to remember dogdog isnt the shaman.. the shaman is.</div></div><hr />

It raises some interesting testing potential, about the effect of attack rating/level.  <br />

<br />
I agree that this seems to be off, that the monk should just in no way be able to hit that pet that frequently.<br />
<br />
A level 58 mob, debuffed by a TEAM of 65 players into AC,AGI,ATK, RESIST *oblivion* would not get hit that often by a 41 pc or npc.<br />
<br />
Did he con the pet? Was it the right spell? Somethings just weird about all this.<br />
<br />
I would like to see independant confirmation of this test done, with a pet that was confirmed conned, buffed and given basic DW Weapons.</div></div><hr />

these will increase his hp regen and his<br />

<br />
The problem I am having here is that those buffs wouldnt change the rate at which the monk hit the pet. Those all increase the output of the pet, which is not what is so strange here.<br />
<br />
Ignore the dps of the pet, what they hit for per hit, even what the monk hit for per hit. The &quot;weird&quot; part is that the monk, or any pc or npc, landed such a high % of his swings on a npc that was 17 levels higher.  <br />
<br />
The parse seems to have pc misses off, so we can't see the exact percentage, but if you took a level 41 pc or npc, and fought a normal level 58 mob, you should hit like 5% of the time, even with MASSIVE debuffing.<br />
<br />
I mean, jeesh, he's QUADDING on a mob 17 levels higher, thats just not sitting right with me.<br />
<br />
That's what needs evaluating.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Just a random thought, but I wonder if mage summoned pet armour would impact this at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">sad it is.  worse, lets think what this does on a pvp server.<br />
<br />
before your pet is even competent, you have to cast how many spells?  use how much mana? spend how much plat on pet kits and weapons?  probably have to SoW the pet too because his run speed is gimp.  then perhaps have to canni and heal to get that mana back.<br />
<br />
in the average pvp zone, you don't get that much time.<br />
<br />
worse, if you are on a pvp raid and zoning alot; you lose the pet each time you zone.<br />
<br />
while i understand 99% of shaman do not care, we are so far behind in pvp balance as to constantly drive us off of pvp servers.  luckily we are still ahead of pure melee classes.<br />
<br />
go to Discord,<br />
/who all shaman<br />
/who all paladin<br />
/who all rogue<br />
/who all warrior<br />
/who all cleric (ok, with no rez, not a great need for clerics on Discord)<br />
<br />
last night you could see every single member of those classes, because the lists were not cut short.  <br />
<br />
then try<br />
/who all wizard<br />
/who all magician<br />
/who all necromancer<br />
<br />
the lists were cut short because of to many to list.<br />
<br />
is that not the best indication of our pvp balance?  personally, i believe that if Sony will do that to us in pvp, they are not above doing it to us in Gates of Discord...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">still seems fair to me for pvp purposes.  I (at level 48) schooled a level 65 monk in the arena at our last guild event.  dog dog just ate away at him while he was trying to catch me, and when he tried fighting dogdog I'd just drop a stoi on him, nuke the monk a bit, and heal the dog when needed.  if the dog fought anywhere close to his appropriate level in pvp it would have been even more sad.<br />
<br />
I got resists on about 75% of my spells and still made him look silly as soon as slow landed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I guess the biggest point being made is the rate of hits landed by a PC many levels below that of the pet. I can remember from my warrior days getting long strings of misses against DB con mobs. Thats with my weapon skills maxed and the mobs debuffed. The worst part of all was knowing that there was nothing I could do about it.<br />
I think the biggest factor would be the pets very low innate AC. Maybe a modifier has been put in place to help melee blows land as well? The question I would have if this were the case is, does that apply only to PC's or does it work for mobs too. My experience with the 61 pet tells me that mobs land generally the same amount of blows on him as they would land on an appropriately leveled PC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Rgallnor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">You can bet the monks attack rating is too high for the low AC of the pet allowing the monk to hit on just about every attack.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Obviously, something like that is going on, but the dog has got 17! levels on him.<br />
<br />
Even with absurdly low, I mean crazy low AC, a 41 entity just should never hit a 58 entity that much in the EQ engine.</div></div><hr />

Hail,<br />
<br />
Try again then.  Remember the dog is NAKED!<br />
Give him a full set of phantom armor, a girdle and mask, AND give him Ancestral Guard for added AC.  See if the AC change noticeably effects the monk's ability to land hits on the dog.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Hehe, miss a couple days, a whole discussion pops up :D<br />
Dog was a bit buffed, In included buffing at the top of the log, but reading it is really boring.  Monk had infusion of spirit/talisman of altuna/alacrity/sow.  Dog had Focus of soul/celerity.  Granted the dog is naked, but it would obviously take a good deal more buffing or equipment to make to dog competent against the monk.<br />
As has been said, a player has a great deal of difficulty hitting any mob that much higher.  It just seems odd that you can hit a pet with the same level difference.<br />
Anyway, I dont want anybody to think that this 'test' had anything to do with much of anything.  Theres no axe to grind, no crying of 'gimp!!!' or anything at all.  In the first case, I was getting ready to /pet go away but decided to have a bit of fun instead.  I admit the monk was twinked and have all along.  I admit the dog wasn't alpha buffed.  It was in no way intended to be a fair fight or test of doggies' compentence.  I thought it might be a funny thing to share, so dont try to read any deep meaning into it.  If you dont care to believe it, thats fine, have a chuckle anyway.</div></div><hr />

Pets dont have skills like dodge, block, and parry that the monk has.<br />
Xp mobs at lvl 58 have different stats than a pet does.  Can you imagine a lvl 58 xp mob having 2k hp, low stats, and no evasion abilities at all?</div></div><hr />
