He wasnt alot of &quot;help&quot; for a few months prior to his leaving as he just resorted to one sentence responses to anything.  You could see it was just his time to go.  I just dont buy &quot;chronic complainers&quot; as this msg board is lame when compared to other class boards.</div></div><hr />

Nixx was a very high profile cheerleader for Shamans on Test.  Test is a server unto itself.<br />
<br />
While the Zeks are &quot; red &quot; and the rest are &quot; blue &quot; there are dynamics on a blue server unlike test.<br />
<br />
The first and foremost dynamic is the race to kill a MOB.  Why?<br />
<br />
1) It is a rare spawn.<br />
2) You are in direct competition with other guilds to kill said MOB.<br />
<br />
Test (by their own admissions) goes up and down several times a day.<br />
<br />
Pause.<br />
<br />
Pause.<br />
<br />
Think of it as a server with patches on a daily basis and 1/5 the player population. Starting to get a picture now?<br />
<br />
Spell drops.<br />
<br />
Nixx has admitted to ONE spell that was given to him by the GM's to test. I would imagine that Malo, Torpor and others aren't : a) as rare or b) as expensive as the are on other servers.<br />
<br />
Nixx was very &quot;rah-rah&quot; concerning the class, dismissing those who had valid complaints as if his experience was the one and only.<br />
<br />
Kudos to him on soloing Phara Dar first. Kudos to him soloing Emperor. But thumbs down for never recognizing that his in-game environment was unlike 95% of the other shaman on this board.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Nixx was a great poster for a very long time.  I learned a lot from him.<br />
<br />
Like a lot of people do, he stayed in the game too long and was just bitter.  He also got a little full of himself after being the first to post here about Yeldema (even though dozens of people had done it before him and much more impressive things--like Tugg's Jugg solo--happened long before) and reading everyone humping his leg about how l33t that was because they were impressed about a froglok kill because it was in a dragon skin.  That post was the worst thing to ever happen to our class, but that is another story... <br />
<br />
His last couple months he was a shrill, whiney VAK who seemingly had no ability to seperate himself from the company.  Every time someone had a suggestion, be it alchemy, spell drops, stackability, or whatever, up popped Nixx with &quot;I soloed a drogon, everything is perfect, I don't know why we do anything for you whiney players anyway&quot; routine.  &quot;We&quot;?  <br />
<br />
Then he did a 180, flamed the hell out of Verant, said they ruined the game, that SoL sucked and quit.  This was a couple months before SoL came out I think.<br />
<br />
I don't think he ever killed Phara Dar ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Chukzombi Astrocreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">*sarcasm*Yeah based on the responses in this thread its clear Nyxx was at fault and everyone else was right. *sarcasm*<br />
<br />
Maybe he didnt hold your hand while you cried in your sleep about not being powerful enough but from what i got  in his posts he was very happy in his own power as a player <br />
When he posted about how he soloed Yeldema he wasnt saying haha i am uber fear me, but was basically telling the whiney little punkasses on this board to shut up becuase the shaman class owns. All his *snide* type posts were a goof on the people who simply suck at playing a shaman and instead of *gasp* getting off their ass and stop sucking, they rather complain to Verant they need more powers.<br />
<br />
Just realize something. Nyxx was the best friend this board had and you clobbered him into submission.  Now that hes gone you have yourselves to thank for any class bugs that go live.<br />

<br />
The problem with the endless Yeldema BS is that he brought it up when it was irrelevant.  Thread after thread like this:<br />
<br />
Shaman: maybe they should look at spell drops?<br />
St. Darkpaw: I SOLOED YELDEMA WITH SPELLS HANDED TO ME BY A GM AND PICKED UP ON THE LEAST POPULATED SERVER IN EQ, WHICH PROVES OUR CLASS IS PERFECT IN ALL RESPECTS!<br />
<br />
Shaman: maybe they should look at raid stackability, I feel kind of useless when I am the 6th shaman on a big raid?<br />
St. Darkpaw: I SOLOED YELDEMA ON TEST SERVER, WHICH HAS FEWER LVL 60 SHAMANS THAN YOUR GUILD, WHICH PROVES OUR CLASS IS PERFECT IN ALL RESPECTS!<br />
<br />
Shaman: maybe they should do something about alchemy to make the higher-level potions economically viable?<br />
St. Darkpaw: I SOLOED YELDEMA, WHICH PROVES THAT OUR CLASS IS PERFECT IN ALL RESPECTS!  MANA REGEN POTIONS ARE ALREADY OVERPOWERED NOW! YOU MUST BE JOKING IF YOU THINK THEY ARE TOO EXPENSIVE.  DID I MENTION THAT I SOLOED YELDEMA, WHICH PROVES OUR CLASS IS PERFECT IN ALL RESPECTS?<br />
<br />
<br />
He was a cool guy that got burned on the game, got a little bitter for a month or 2, then quit.<br />

This past weekend, I decided to go solo Yeldema myself since I have a full spell book(save Group Focus). After Yeldie died, I stepped up to check out what loot she had and was like ***?!?<br />
<br />
Only thing on her was:<br />

I'm a member of a post AoW pre Emperor guild who has a spellbook that includes everything but Tigir's Insects and the two new Ssra drop spells. I've worked to get what loot I have.<br />
<br />
I still think that Nixx's attitude was beyond arrogant for the last few months that he was on the board.<br />
<br />
The question is 'did Nixx really quit'. The answer is 'yes'. There's no need for 'yes, because of whiny jerks' or 'yes, because of baby losers' or 'yes, and it's good, because he's an ass'. None of that opinionation is asked for in the original question. Just answer yes, and move on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>SisterLi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Wow -- popped a big 'ole puss filled boil with that question.<br />
<br />
From what I recall:<br />
<br />
Yes, Nixx did quit -- sounded like the game just wasn't providing the entertainment it once had.<br />
<br />
The message boards played a part in that.  As you can see from the above posts, the tenor of disagreements on this board had taken a rather nasty vicious turn.  Even when it's not directed at you, it is not all that enjoyable to read.    <br />
<br />
For the record, I saw the Yeldema and the SG posts in a different light.  Part of the fun of playing the game is telling (and reading) tales -- tales of big mess ups, funny tales of spontaneous adventure, tales of big accomplishments, tales of something that you just enjoyed doing.  Nixx tales came with pictures, and were quite enjoyable to read.  There's no reason to think they were politically motivated, or meant anything more than &quot;Damn, I'm having fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
It's a game.   Bringing a playful attitude to a game should not be verboten. <br />
<br />
Test is well aware that it is a different environment.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Minng</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Test server shaman here.  Things ARE different on Test than they are on the prod servers, but not hugely so.  Nixx had a full spellbook for largely the same reason that any top tier shaman in a good guild on prod would.  He had a guild, and a group of people beyond that,  that did what they could to make sure he got the spells/gear that he needed.  As he did for them in return.  <br />
<br />
Funny thing is, malo and torpor are probably harder to get on Test now than they are on prod.  Most of the time the Kunark dragons will live from whenever they pop until the next server down, not really anybody taking them out on a regular basis.<br />

<br />
Heh, i have soloed what i needed to. The most recent thing i soloed was all the ice giants to Vox's lair for essences of winter. BTW, horrible camp . dont do it if you  enjoy your sanity. repops are a bitch.<br />
<br />
I didnt mean you guys with your &quot;wah wah i want to do what he can do!&quot; babble made Nyxx quit EQ but before he quit he posted that this board drove him away. Its  certainly not the same environment when i started posting here in late 99. Even Eduin with his rude ass comments was more helpful  than  some of the posters on this board. <br />
<br />
I  do feel for the new shaman who starts surfing this board and reads all these  &quot;fix shaman now&quot; threads and thinks he picked the wrong char and poof just like that he drops his class and another potentially great shaman player bites the dust.<br />
<br />
Nixx was actually working with the game devs to improve the shaman class.  His mistake was letting you all know this and you kept bugging him  to ask for this tweak or that tweak and when it didnt go live you were ready to call  him a sellout or a VAK whatever**** that means. Some months back before they upped the drop rates of the kunark spells i was approached by a VI dev  and was asked what spells are rare. i told him straight out what was rare and was was just not dropping  at an acceptable level. I actually told the dev Malo was fine becuase it dropped off Sontalak for us almost every time we killed him. <br />
Yeah it sucks they tweaked Sontalak but heh if you want the spell so badly there he is, up mostly all the time. go get it.<br />
Ask the wizard class where their best spell Garrisons Superior Sundering drops off of and see  who has the right to  complain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gikk the Unholy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">People were blaming Nixx for things they saw wrong with the shaman class.  Repeatedly.  While i'm sure this board wasn't the only reason he quit, most likely it had more then a little to do with it.</div></div><hr />

Kudos Nixx, where ever you are....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Tryg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">erm and what you do if you cant kill Sontalak? Nice that you have a guild that can just knock it off anytime you wish and great to see that every 60 shaman is either in the same type of guild or has the 100-200kpp that you need to pay otherwise. (I am in a guild that could not at all take him down and I have approx 4kpp in the bank which wont exactly get me far in the purchase stakes even if any copies were for sale). The whole of our guildbank wouldnt be enough to purchase a copy even if the guild choose to spend it all on one spell.<br />
<br />
Nice to see that Devs as usual go to the higher level guilds to get an 'average' view point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Hrm, I've seen Sontalak die at least a dozen times and so far the only Shaman Spell I've seen drop was VoB. :/<br />
<br />
Anyway, Nixx was a damn good shaman, but there WERE a bunch of whiny asses, or should I say still are, that literally blamed him for all the problems they saw with the shaman class.  Pretty sad IMO.  The guy did his best to be objective about things and looked at the big picture, and in return got **** on time and again here.<br />
<br />
What's funny is that these same whiny asses seem to love to point out how Nixx would say that the shaman class was in relatively good shape, and ignore the fact that many of us non-Test shaman did and still do agree with that.  Oh wait, we must all have had our spells handed to us by GMs and play on servers where there is no competition for uber mobs with those spells that aren't just given to us. Riiight.</div></div><hr />

Actually it is normally posts like this that take threads, that I have posted in, from the &quot;back and forth debates&quot; to full on flame wars.  Posts with absolutely no point other than to inflame and entice reaction.  But then again I am just a &quot;whiney ass&quot; with differing opinions (on some) of the things we discussed on this board over the years.  Nixx was a good shaman but I disagreed some of his opinions on where the shaman should be... so sue me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Disagreeing with anyone is fine.  I realize I've made somewhat of an ass of myself being a hypocrite and slinging names here. :eek: You are correct, calling people whiny asses adds nothing and increase the chance of a flame war, so I apologize for being a hypocrite.<br />
<br />
I mean, I did that to illustrate how so many posts degenerated into flame wars instead of polite discussion.  Yeah, that's the ticket.  I was simply providing an example of what I was talking about!  /nod  You believe me right?  I wouldn't slip into that pettiness.  NEVER!:rolleyes: <br />

Some of you have very incorrect views of me and what I did in EQ.  I TRIED to get things like spell drops fixed, but it didn't happen, so I quit.  I got sick of expansions being released before they were finished, so I quit.  I got bored of buffing after playing for 3 years, so I quit.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Relv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Heya Nixx, good to hear from you again.  Yep yep, still playin.  Test has been crashing a lot lately but I'm sure that will change.  They have a new guy in charge of everything including spells, who's really on the ball about stuff (Rich Waters / Jahaar, think you know him) and they've improved their management for POP significantly.  Oh yeah, and spell drops have been fixed :)<br />
<br />
And I finally SOLOD A JUGG!  Not bad for a ranger eh?  Still working on Yeldema tho :(  With MGB buffing is really easy now, and we have a couple regular shamen, drop by sometime!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Lororm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Hey Nixx, as Tal said...good to hear/see from ya again bud. You probably don't remember me cause I was just a wee shaman when you were still playing...but I remember asking you for advice many a time while playing. Normally you had your afk message up...<br />
<br />
/afk Buffing on a raid can't talk got 300 people to buff...leave a message at the beep.... BEEP.<br />
<br />
You'd usually talk to me though and answer my questions. <br />
<br />
I always saw you as a great shaman and one I went to advice to. One I learned a lot from. Wish you'd drop in and say hi sometime, don't think anyone wouldn't mind your company :)<br />
<br />
Test been droping a lot, other than that its good. Torpor seem to be droping more than Malo now-a-days. But spell drops been fixed very nicely.<br />
<br />
Take care bud.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Tain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">I strongly suggest that anyone who starts to get a bit burned out at playing a Shaman stop reading this forum for a while.  It'll help a lot.  It's amazing how much fun you can have playing the game again without having to read every single day about how horrible things are.</div></div><hr />
