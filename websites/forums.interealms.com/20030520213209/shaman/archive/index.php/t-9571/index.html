<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>celebel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">what are the good boots for a shammy, available to a 1 group of 60+ people?<br />
<br />
currently my shaman has ToV boots, but they are not so good I think (what s your opinion?)<br />
<br />
<br />
forget about vindi boots, we cannot do him.<br />
FT3 boots for CT are possible, however there is not much AC on them.<br />
<br />
what else?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Was it your guild who made you get ToV boots? In that case you should be able to take Vindi down imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>celebel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">We farm HoT with our guild usually with 2 or 3 groups.<br />
<br />
most people are 55+, a lot are 58+<br />
<br />
but we lack clerics and the ability to do a reliable and long lasting CH line...<br />
<br />
I am in full ToV (except circlet of falinkan and sleeves who are crappy), and we have a lot of people with ToV or Kael armors...<br />
<br />
however we don't have many BP/Robes...(I am lucky to have one...we got 3 chain BP drops in one day(!) )<br />
<br />
we are going to attempt Vindi very soon I think, but the chance to get the boots if they drop is slim (guild use a class who can wear - roll system)...<br />
<br />
I got my circlet with a small group (5 people, and I think 4 would be enough now with pop spells and levels)<br />
<br />
I am looking for an interesting pair of boots that I could get the same way: with one group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you've got reasonable AC with your other gear, then I'd go for the CT boots, FT3 is always nice. When you get an upgrade you can sell em for a fair bit too.<br />
<br />
I can't think of anything better you'd get with one group, although I'm not too good on the end-game loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">not so many clerics are always an issue.. I've done vindi with 1clr and 3dru, 1shm in ch chain.. its doable.. but a bit hard :) I would still wait for those boots :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Heigelyac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Get your guild to go to ToV and kill Lendinara the keeper.  Not only does she occasionally drop ST key, she also drops boots of Superiority.  They have affliction efficiency 3 on them.  Makes tugurs, cripple, all of your dots and some other spells more mana efficienct.  they are a better boot than FT3 IMO</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jagara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i dont know if i have bad luck or what, but the FT3 boots are rare.  as in be prepared to live in CT rare. as in i spent 9 hours straight there yesterday and we only saw one named, which wasnt even the named that can drop the boots.  and of course, not only do you need a rare mob, but you need the rare drop.  if your guild is capable, vindi, HoT, or LTC's boots much easier to get, although if i could pick anything, i'd go with the ft3 boots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>wrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">boots are a pain to get from CT but your best bet as an upgrade I think.  You get decent xp and other loots as you go and those boots are a big part of the 'easy 7' route to FT 7<br />
Boots of flowing slime<br />
blessed coldain prayer shawl<br />
solstice earring<br />
<br />
Wrothgar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Get your guild to go to ToV and kill Lendinara the keeper <br />
I dont think they are able to kill LtK if they are unsure if they can kill Vindi..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>celebel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">yup, our guild is probably not capable of killing lendinara...<br />
<br />
we killed recently:<br />
<br />
va dyn, lord doljoblablabla (those are easy)<br />
Gryme the crypt guardian (not an easy fight, with 3 groups and a 57 war as MT :) other ones were not available at that time)<br />
<br />
that s the kind of mobs we are able to take down...<br />
<br />
once more than 4 groups have to be involved, forget it, we cant gather enough people.<br />
<br />
So, probably CT is a pain in the a55, but I think I will have no other choice.</div></div><hr />
