<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bigcatt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So, I just made a tour of Sony's boards and found a post of Chutoi's regarding messages dissapearing, based on them having a rating of 1, and a standard filter that only shows messages with a 2 or higher. (there was much more involved around devs setting Chutoi and others messages to a permanent 1, but this post is not about that)<br />
<br />
<br />
I immediately set my filter to show all 1 postings, THEN! I had a moment of brilliance (imho) and realized that if I gave all the fanboys stupid posts (Stupid = roughly 'but but shamunz can solo dragunz from 5 expansionz ago! nerfs required!) a 1 rating, they would vanish from peoples normallly set filtering. Hmm. Kind of turned SOEs little trick back on the fanboys. <br />
<br />
Thanks Chutoi for pointing out that little 1 rating trick they have been using, and allowing me to return that favor on fools. <br />
<br />
<br />
Peace and Love<br />

<br />
Chutoi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">So let me get this straight....Chutoi doesn't follow the company line.  Chutoi upsets &quot;somebody&quot; at Sony or in charge of the message boards.<br />
<br />
&quot;Somebody&quot; then perma-changes all of Chutoi's posts to a 1-star?<br />
<br />
Wow.  Talk about focusing on the wrong things.<br />
<br />
No wonder: I never post over there, and don't take anything they say seriously.<br />
<br />
Or as somebody much wiser than me once said:<br />
<br />
&quot;Anybody who takes anything written on an on-line message board about a GAME - SERIOUSLY, has bigger issues to deal with.&quot;<br />
<br />
/nod to Chutoi for fighting the good fight.<br />
<br />
/rude to Sony for CONTINUING the TRADITION of combatting your playerbase (a bad holdover from Verant) instead of listening to them.<br />
<br />
I can see those pea-brain types now:<br />
<br />
Dev_1: &quot;Hmm perhaps we should look at Shaman, they seem to be quite upset.&quot;<br />
<br />
rytan: &quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dev_2: &quot;But look at what this one dude wrote on the boards. Seems well thought out, reasonable and not game-breaking.&quot;<br />
<br />
rytan: &quot;So.&quot; (Rhymes with 'no')<br />
<br />
brenlo: &quot;Man, making me look bad.  What can we do?&quot;<br />
<br />
A quick, hurried conference is scheduled for the next day where all members of SonyEQ gather in mini focus groups to determine NOT Shaman fixes, but how to silence Chutoi.<br />
<br />
Finally after over 5,000 man hours, 27 cases of Mountain Dew, 155 Dominos pizzas and an embarassing moment where abashi admitted he &quot;liked being the victim&quot; some pimply-faced 17 year old temp getting paid $5.25 an hour tells them how they can set all of Chutoi's posts to an automatic one-rating.<br />
<br />
Much celebrating ensued including /Temps_toons=65 keystrokes, a wedgie for abashi, and general all around Snidely Whiplash laughter at how &quot;smooth&quot; they are in dealing with the players.</div></div><hr />

Wow I think you hit on something Faern.  That looks like dialog from The Breakfast Club                           <br />
BENDER: (under his breath) Eat my shorts...<br />
Vernon spins in his tracks and faces Bender again.<br />
VERNON: What was that?<br />
BENDER: (loudly)Eat my shorts!<br />
VERNON: You just bought yourself another Saturday, mister!<br />
BENDER: Oh, Christ...<br />
VERNON: You just bought one more right there!<br />
BENDER: Well, I'm free the Saturday after that...beyond that, I'm gonna have to check my calendar!<br />
VERNON: Good!  'Cause it's gonna be filled, we'll keep goin'!  You want another one?  Say the word, just say the word!  Instead of going to prison, you'll come here!  Are you through.<br />
BENDER: No! <br />
VERNON: I'm doing society a favor!<br />
BENDER: So?<br />
VERNON:That's another one, right now!  I've got you for the rest of  our natural born life if you don't watch your step!  You want another one?<br />
BENDER: Yes!<br />
VERNON: You got it!  You got another one,<br />
right there!  That's another one<br />
pal!<br />
<br />
As you can see, the next response from Rytan will clearly be YES!  So make sure you ask the right question next!!</div></div><hr />

You left out the part where they fired the temp after he made the code change to give them &quot;plausable deniability.&quot;</div></div><hr />
