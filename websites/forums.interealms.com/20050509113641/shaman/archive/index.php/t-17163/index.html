<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Morning all,<br />
<br />
     OK guys, I finnaly convinced my friend to give EQ a shot (he was/is a big time Ultima Online player).  He is experimenting with a few different characters (Mage, BST, and Necro).  <br />
<br />
I am leaning towards a BST (I haven't put in my 2 cents yet though), because they have some healing, have some great DPS, and can mix it up to some degree.  <br />
<br />
I know that Necro's have awsome Mana regen (better than us?), good pets, great DoT's, and at higher levels, they can rez.  What I don't know is.....How is thier healing ability (for thier pet)?<br />
<br />
And Lastly Mages, I know they have the best pets, good nukes, and at higher levels give us great kits for the pets, but do they have any heals of any type?<br />
<br />
Thanks for taking the time to read/respond to this, and yes i know that search is your friend....but out of date info is not.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I love my shaman and there is only one class I would even consider playing as a main instead of shaman, and that class is necro.  They have the nearly limitless mana regeneration abilities that we do (better, imho), coupled with awesome damage dealing capabilities.  They're sort of like shamans that do damage rather than prevent/heal damage.<br />
<br />
Beastlords are also a great class.  My alt is a 53 beast, and it's pretty fun.  I made a beastlord instead of a necro because melees are just so much easier to PL as a shaman.<br />
<br />
Mages are very good at what they do, but I don't find them as being much fun to play.  That's just personal preference though.<br />
<br />
edit:  Actually read your post and will reply to your questions :D<br />
<br />
Necros have a nifty group lifetap over time spell that is a pretty decent heal.  They also have single target heals that hurt them but heal their target.  I'm not sure how big of a heal it is, because I have honestly never seen it in action.  The group lifetap over time is really great, though.<br />
<br />
Mages do not have to ability to heal other people.  They, like necros, do have the ability to heal their pets.  For exact numbers on their heals, refer to eq.castersrealm.com and just look it up.  I do know, however, that it is usually more efficient to just reclaim (kills your pet and gives you some of the mana back) your pet and cast a new one that it is to heal him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Glimugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">For a bonafide partner, I would go for necro. Beastlords are good, awesome dps and all, but short of that, not much else.<br />
<br />
Necros just bring alot of what we don't have. Summon corpse for screw ups (for them of course, we shaman never hose it, right?), FD, damn good pets, lifetaps, and so on. <br />
<br />
Mages have good DPS, great pets, and eventually toys for alpha, they only add nice DSs and backup debuff for us.<br />
<br />
Overall, I just think necros for their stand alone capability are more appealling than the other two.<br />
<br />
Just my 2cp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The question is what should your friend play?<br />
<br />
I wouldn't look at this question in terms of raw power, if I were you.  Is your friend going to want to get up and smack the mob around?  Beastlord is the only choice in that case.  Does he prefer raw power?  In that case, I'd say mage - their ability to burn down 2 or 3 of the adds in a train in a VERY short amount of time is exceptional.  For the raw utility powerhouse player, necros and beastlords are tied in my opinion.  Sow and slow vs. FD, snare, undead mezz and slow... it's a tough choice.<br />
<br />
They're all solid choices, and nobody in their right mind would call any of them underpowered.  Beastlords, at almost every level, are more powerful on their own than any other class I've played.  Personally - while I enjoy my mage a lot, I don't think I could ever play one as my main because there's just so much sitting around.  I'd go with beastlord just because - like mages - they have really exceptional pet healing abilities.  And you can't go wrong with slow.  If he plays a necro, you're going to be sticking to undead a lot - which is fun, but cuts down on your scenery changes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the responses, am I right in assuming that Mages have the most powerful pets, followed by the BST, and lastly Necro?  (Out of those 3 classes of course)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>woon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">LaughingWoman necros can mez any mob not just undead ones</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Yodelroy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Some of the advantages of beastlords (slow, haste, conflicting buffs) are limited or negated by having a shm partner. Also bsts are very poor at kiting, which is a common activity.<br />
<br />
Mages offer DS but low regen means high med time. Shamans will end up waiting on them to med, which sucks. <br />
<br />
BSTs+mages don't have snare which a shm really wants, and they require your heals alot.<br />
<br />
Necros have 0 downtime, have group+target heals, excellent DPS, lifetaps (meaning you won't have to heal them normally). They can nuke, dot, summon corpse, group mana tap, stun, root, mez, snare, slow undead and charm undead.<br />
<br />
Necro is an obvious choice imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yodel spouts off silly info.  Who would have guessed?   :D <br />
<br />
Beastlords kite decently by themselves.  They keep agro with dots while having pet chew on the mob's ass.  With a shaman duo kiting...shaman keeps agro with heavier dots, and the bst and pet chew on the mob's ass.  Root rotting, yeah, they're not that great at.  And don't discount MGB paragon (think quies + mana regen for the group).<br />
<br />
Mages have ridiculous mana regen at higher level, between rods and pet-canni.  Best pets and and the second best nukes in the game, and summonable focus items.  Mages can be a valuable partner for a shaman.<br />
<br />
I suppose he's right about all the necro abilities though.   :p<br />
<br />
Bards also make a great duo partner, since they're so ridiculously overpowered since PoP.  Also, bard + shaman = great foundation for a group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hmmmmm... Bard, I hadn't thought about that.  I was only really thinking pet classes, but....hmmmmmmm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">This person is on your Ignore List. [View Post] [Un-Ignore User] <br />
<br />
Sweet.<br />
<br />
Necro is a pretty neat partner for a shaman.  Of course if your friend ever wants to participate in the high end game, it kind of blows for him because necros are still a dime a dozen and still don't bring anything really awesome to the table.<br />
<br />
You might want to consider adding a rogue to that list as well.  Rogues have decent utility, especially at the post 60 levels, and their DPS is still pretty incredible (especially duoing with a shaman who &quot;tanks in teh face&quot;).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I group with a mage all the time and I wouldn't think of having any other partner.  Their pet heals are awesome and they can get a Pet Lay on Hands in aa ability.  His mana regen is not an issue and with the focus items, pet kits, and mod rods, you are really set.  He is level 63, I'm 61 and our pets really dish out the damage.<br />
<br />
Here is the real question, and someone elluded to it earlier:  How does your friend want to play their toon?<br />
<br />
pure caster with a bully pet?  Mage<br />
melee with a pet?  BL<br />
Utility?  Necro</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have three different partners that are all amazing:<br />
<br />
65 Chanter - with CoD, my fast heals, my slows, Nukes/Rains, their haste, and a steady supply of moBs we get an AA every 45 minutes assuming charm doesn't break early too often. Throw in a Druid for snare on the pet, added heals and DPS, tracking for pulls ... and you have some amazingly fast XP. I'm not even needed, but it's great they keep me there ;)<br />
<br />
Necromancer in CoDecay: Pets tank, we DPS, they snag singles - either slows - both DPS. One AA every 45 minutes or watch your level zip by.<br />
<br />
EQ/AM3 65 Ranger with Elemental bow: I aggro kite with DoTs while pet chews on the MoB and RanGAR DPSes like mad. <br />
<br />
All three are about the same XP. All are great partners.<br />
<br />
Shaman work well with any class. XP was slow when I duoed with my Paladin, but it was steady and we had staying power. Let your friend play whatever they enjoy most :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I love all 3 classes, but I have a few 65 mage friends who'll knock yer socks off....  get in a group with them and it's like you're in the middle of a nuclear holocaust... crit after crit for 5k+ and not to mention the pet is quadding for 70+...  fun to watch them mez elementals or summon a whole army of earth pets.<br />
<br />
I'd love to have a 65 mage and just blow sh*t up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Bendarin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I play a 65 shaman and a 65 mage :)<br />
<br />
Mana regen after level 49 is not a problem for mages.  They can use canni-petting to regen mana absurdly fast.  (Cast 49 earth pet, reclaim more mana than it cost to summon pet).  Mages can also mez summoned creatures post 60.<br />
<br />
Pets are very good on slowed mobs.  Canni-petting is a bitch on items to give to pet unless the mage has the stash pet AA.  He can stash his buffed and equipped pet, then summon 49 earth and reclaim mana until full, call back buffed pet.<br />
<br />
I never could get into necros...  My current attempt is level 10.  I think you just have to like necros, cause they are very good partners (fear, snare).   My mage did a lot of duoing with a necro.  BSL... well when they first came out I had one to 20 before I deleted.   I know they have changed a lot since then so my data on them is schewed.  I do know they are great in pet groups with mages :)<br />
<br />
So...  I would suggest a mage based on my limited experience, but if your friend can get into a necro thats another good option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">In terms of pet tanking the order is beast, mage, necro. Pretty much both in terms of beast HP and heals. When going solo the beast slow makes any comparison of pet tanking futile.<br />
<br />
Mind you beasts also have significantly weaker ranged damage options. So there definitely is a trade off there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tuibumbi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I've played most classes up to a certain point, and the necro ranks up there as the most fun class to play imo. Their downtime is as stated minimal which makes playing this game much more enjoyable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I am going to tell my friend about this post, he can draw his own conclussions about what to play. I just wanna thank you all for taking the time to answer these questions so well!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">For a duo, all 3 work well imo but necro is my favorite. Necros have snare, DPS, Feign pulling and mez (up to 55th lvl mobs) among other things. Shaman adds regen for the necro, malo to help him land spells and healing if he needs it along with a bit of DPS. At 65 I think it's the deadliest duo in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I have to agree with what a few others have said, THE deciding factor on what character your friend should try is your friend’s play style.  It took me trying about six different classes before I decided to play a druid as my main.  Then I played a ranger because I found myself trying to tank with my druid.  After both characters hit level 51 I ended up putting them on the shelf, for reasons not worth going into here, and I started playing my shaman.  I also have a level 54 beastlord for the same reason I created my ranger.  I like playing both a caster and a tank, depending on my mood.  With two main characters I can switch off depending on how I feel at the time.  So your friend should try to figure out if he prefers to tank or to stand back and cast.  Or perhaps like me he’ll end up liking to do both.<br />
<br />
The beastlord is a good class.  One advantage of the class is that the pet is so powerful that what gear you have isn’t very important.  And this is a good thing because there is a huge gap in the price of gear.  You can outfit a beastlord in decent low to lower mid level gear for a reasonable amount of money.  But then there’s a gap the size of the Grand Canyon if you want to buy any upgrades.  Prices, at leas on my server, jump from about 500pp for a weapon to about 15000 for the next upgrade.   But as I said, the BL pet is powerful enough to make up the difference until you can manage to buy or loot better equipment.  <br />
<br />
I’ve never played mage but I’ve grouped with them and have a lot of respect for them.  They have a variety of pets, which is nice and I know at high levels their pets become very powerful.  And one of their earth pet can snare, which is extremely helpful.  That’s one of the drawbacks to soloing with a beastlord, no snare or root.  And of course all the summoned items mages have at their disposal are extremely useful.  But don’t expect to live for long if you start getting hit.<br />
<br />
I’ve only played my necromancer to level 20, but one of the people I regularly grouped with played a necromancer to level 63.  And I must say I’m incredibly impressed with the class for both soloing and in groups.  If you have a necromancer in your group who knows how to play his character, especially at higher levels, it makes killing mobs so much easier.  Not only can they lifetap for huge amounts of damage, but they can cast group healing spells when there’s a mob to suck the life from and they can cast group manna regen if you are facing a caster mob.  They can also keep a couple of mobs stunned or fear them if adds aren’t a worry.  They can slow and charm undead and dire charm them with AAs.  They can even pull for a group and feign death and let the tank grab them.  And if mobs are too tough to tank fear kiting can work great in many areas.  <br />
<br />
There are a few down sides to necromancers.  As a caster they can’t take many hits.  But they have feign death that can easily keep you alive if you learn to use it properly.  The class is evil, so you have to deal with being KOS in many cities.  But if you should want to try to reduce that somewhat you can choose a gnome necromancer and be a bit less hated in many places.  Or you can say to heck with it and just kill everything you come across. *grins*  And for some reason necromancers often have trouble getting groups.  I chalk this up to ignorance, as I’ve groped with many necromancers and know from personal experience that they can be awesome in a group.  But it can be a problem if you have to put up the LFG flag very often.<br />
<br />
Best of luck to both you and your friend. I’m sure you’ll have fun with whatever class your friend picks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Thanks woon.  I thought maybe that necro mezz only worked till level 55 or something, because the necros I take into dungeons won't/can't mezz live critters.  *shrug*<br />
<br />
Another big reason I had such fun with the mage partner is that we were able to crawl deep into places we wouldn't have gone before (when he was playing his warrior) because we could just gate out at a moment's notice.  We avoided a LOT of corpse runs that way.  Gate is a big factor for necro and mage, in my book.  Not to mention what was mentioned earlier about a lot of beastlord and shaman abilities overlapping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I've got a beaslord and I love the class, but necros are very good fun to play too and probably complement the shaman better. <br />
<br />
Gate is nice to have, but the PoK quest items with gate to PoK, and numerous PoK portals, plus now the new LDoN teleports, has really taken away a lot of the issues with not having gate. <br />
<br />
My vote goes for the necro first. Bst and mage is a tough choice and comes down to whether your friend would rather melee a bit or just cast spells. All in all, I don't think you can go far wrong with any of these 3 as a partner.<br />
<br />
For pickup groups, bst probably has it easiest, followed by mage and then necro. Crazy given the power of necros but people still don't get it... perhaps because they solo so much?<br />
<br />
Quick pros and cons:<br />
<br />
Pro Mage:<br />
Gate<br />
Summoned items + mod rods<br />
Great nukes for massive burst dps when needed<br />
Overall dps with nukes + pet is awesome<br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
Can't melee<br />
Can't take damage<br />
Can't heal anything except pet<br />
No snare<br />
<br />
Necros:<br />
Pros:<br />
FD<br />
Fear<br />
Snare<br />
Crowd control esp vs undead<br />
Gate<br />
Hp/Mana taps<br />
Massive Mana regen<br />
Good DoTs<br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
Pets not so strong<br />
Can't take damage<br />
Mediocre nukes<br />
<br />
Beastlord:<br />
Pros:<br />
Can melee and take some hits<br />
Great pets<br />
Paragon of Spirit<br />
Some healing power<br />
Shaman buffs work well on them<br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
No snare<br />
Can't gate without using item<br />
Heals are weak<br />
Overlaps with shaman abilities<br />
Mediocre mana regen until getting paragon<br />
<br />
Someone mentioned bards too. Great fun class and much in demand at the moment. But they do need a lot of attention and I think are only suited to a minority of people due to the constant twisting. With their AE kiting and swarming probably get better xp soloing than with you :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Pre-PoP, you can't go wrong with any of them.<br />
<br />
You are not going to really want to duo by tanking in PoP unless you are with a real tank class.  You can, but it won't be that efficient.  If she cannot beat on the mob, most of the BL's damage is gone.  You will be looking at root dotting or kiting or charming.  <br />
<br />
Root-dotting, the necro hands-down obliterates any other choice.  <br />
<br />
Kiting, the necro is also the best choice, because they bring snare to the table.  It is possible to full-speed kite (shammy gets lots of aggro and the BL and pet attack or the mage pet attacks and the mage nukes) with SoW or a fast horse.  But it is more dangerous, more annoying, and requires a lot more space (and can therefore be done in fewer places).<br />
<br />
That leaves charming.  BL's cannot charm, so they are out.  As far as PoP xp zones go, Mages can charm in BoT, Necro's in CoD.  Zone advantage probably goes to the mage here, since there is better loot to be had in the former zone.  If you are into slumming/farming, the necro probably has a wider variety of places to charm overall.   <br />
<br />
Seems like Necro is the best choice unless all you want to do is farm BoT for xp and loot.<br />
<br />
Also, consider utility.  Mage focii and coh and cannipetting are nice.  Beastlord crack is OK, but the beastlord's biggest utility skill -- slow -- is redundant in a shaman duo.  Necro has a _ton_ of neat tricks -- FD, snare, summon corpse, res, instaclick invis, innate undead invis, harmshield, etc etc -- that makes them not only great pullers in tricky spots, but a nice Swiss army knife to have around all the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Fumeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">&quot;How is thier healing ability (for thier pet)?&quot;<br />
<br />
My brother has a 65 necro that I duo with on occassion. I never heal his pet.  If were taking on mobs that hit hard (PoP) Ill throw on regen and thats really about all he needs. In the middle of keeping his pet alive, and snaring, and dotting, he's feeding me health and mana from mobs and ending up with the same or more mana than me at the end of a fight.  Necros rock, too bad they nerfed fear kiting in PoP :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Necro live mez is capped at level 55 and is only for three ticks. It's basically useless once you hit 65. Fear is also capped at 55.<br />
<br />
I think the reason necro's aren't popular in groups is basically because they're a DoT class. Beastlords can be seen to be doing melee damage, mages can drop some huge nukes which drop the mobs health by a noticeable amount, the necro just seems to be hanging around the back. Although the PoP necro nuke is quite decent. <br />
<br />
I love my necro. Substantial power, variety and a huge amount of independance. But like all generalists you miss the pleasure of being the best at something. And there's no &quot;awesome&quot; necro facility like slow to make people go &quot;wow&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Necros can charm in hoh as well, just an fyi...and as far as pet heals go necro pets heal themselves(lifetaps).<br />
<br />
I like partnering with both mages and necros, but I have to give the edge to the necro for sheer survivability. They make life easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Most necro's discount charm now. Unless you're grouped with a class that can MR debuff the duration is extremely short. On the good side the necro L65 charm spell has dropped in price a lot.<br />
<br />
The necro pet procs lifetaps quite frequently for, I think, 80 points a pop. Good for regenerating their health but not nearly enough to keep up with damage when they are tanking.<br />
<br />
I gotta admit, I'd be tempted to dump the shaman and go for a necro/beast combo. That would be a lot of fun. Sort of heresy to say it here though :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Dire charmable mobs too.<br />
<br />
And 80 hp taps on slowed mobs = more than enough to keep pet going.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Cyynister</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I belive the shaman/necromancer combo works very well.<br />
<br />
I have to disagree with the statment necromacers can not take damage.  They do something called ToM (Touch of Mujaki) tanking.  This is where the necro tanks a mob using life taps to keep hp's up.  This is a tactic used in places like HoH and BoT where mobs can not be snared and can summon.  For this you do need to have AA's for combat agility, lightning reflex, channeling, etc.  It is not uncommon for necro's to go for hp's with there gear, 2600  hp unbuffed at lvl 65 is not uncommon.  VT equiped necros tend to be 3000+ and PoTime equiped 4800+<br />
<br />
As stated the group life tap is very nice as it can allow the shaman to cann, while getting healing off the lifetap.  Group mana tap has obviouse advantages too.<br />
<br />
Necromancers can mezz up to lvl 55 for live mobs and lvl 65 for undead.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Vahnisia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Why has there been no mention of the stereotypical duo of shaman/SK? Sure the pet is garbage, but with the tanking ability, DoTs, snare, aggro control, life taps, etc you would think the combo would be mentioned.<br />
<br />
As for the original question: just about any class works well with a shaman.</div></div><hr />
