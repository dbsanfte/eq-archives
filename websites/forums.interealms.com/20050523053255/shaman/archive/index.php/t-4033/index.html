<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>barmanham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">haven't played in awhile just found out about these new items and was wondering if people would give up stats to use these example: would you use obulus death shroud with the focus effect or a pair of IGS<br />
<br />
basically trying to find out how to upgrade stuff due to the new focus stuff</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I LOVE my focus items.<br />
The ones I have are:<br />
Obulous death shroud.<br />
Enshrouded Veil<br />
Coldain Military Wristguard.<br />
Supple Scale Armband.<br />
Some others at level 2 that barely ever come into effect.<br />
<br />
I wear those shoulders full time.<br />
It's hard to think about taking those off for right now.<br />
If I got an afflicition efficiency 3 item, I'd no longer use the ob mantle.<br />
As it is, whether I'm soloing, or in groups, it's constantly flickering.<br />
Every torpor, chloroblast, malo, cripple, turgur, pox, bane, haste, buff, blah blah blah is less mana.<br />
I think someone did an estimate, and basicly with the average casting they did, and the amount of mana saved, they would have to have shoulders with Flowing Thought 5 to be roughly equal in value in terms of mana conservation/regeneration.<br />
The shoulders have decent stats to them as well.<br />
<br />
The only situation I'd use the Imbued Granit Spaulders is in places like NTOV, where mana efficiency isn't quite as necessary all the time for shaman (backup healers and debuffers), and where resists are very important.<br />
Even then, if your resists are high enough, you might want to use the ob mantle instead.<br />
You can probably get a blue diamond helm, neck, 2 bracers, and mask for about 10k PP total, which will provide most of the resists you'll need.<br />
A lodizal shield will round out your resists rather well, and you can then use the ob mantle and not worry about the IGS.<br />
<br />
Basicly, IMO, the focus effect of the ob mantle far outweighs the nice AC and resists of the IGS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As for the other focus items I have, they are kind of situational.<br />
I used to wear the enshrouded veil full time, but recently got a crystal eyes instead.  I keep the mask on me for a bit of resists, or if I summon a pet, though I might just twink it soon.<br />
<br />
The coldain military wristguard I use on raids in Ssra, or on other raid targets that take a long time to kill, or when I'm soloing, or when I'm actually able to use my dots.<br />
When I've been on Emperor or HP or Creator raids, I've usually been in the CC group.<br />
The extended duration of the debuffs is really useful.<br />
When soloing, I get extra damage out of my Poxes and my Banes.<br />
It's enough that I have to cast 1 less dot or about 6 less JBB bursts per kill.<br />
<br />
The supple scale armband I use less frequently, but still somewhat often.<br />
When I'm pulling stuff, I use it.<br />
You really do notice the increased distance you can pull from.<br />
It's big.<br />
The other effect that when I'm on raids, I equip it so that my small torpor and buff casting range is increased a bit, so the group members I'm with don't go out of range nearly as much when I'm trying to cast on them.<br />
<br />
The only other Focus Effects that I am missing that I'd like are healing mastery and affliction haste.<br />
The haste would be useful to help cast through attacks, but I doubt I'll see an item with it's effect any time soon.<br />
I'm not worried about that though.<br />
As for healing mastery though, I've got the quest item for the Shroud of Dar Brood quest, which I need to obtain some day.<br />
I'm currently sitting at Ally Giant factions, so it'll be a long time off before I get it, but the effects on the Shroud are enough that I'm willing to faction change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>barmanham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">does any of the focus items help out torpor?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mudcrush Durtfeet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Anything with manapreservation 3 will save you 10 percent mana per cast on torpor.<br />
<br />
   I dunno if anything else affects torpor, I recommend getting qb3 and scrm if you want to make torpor better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Spell haste 3 works on torpor</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The only other Focus Effects that I am missing that I'd like are healing mastery and affliction haste. <br />

<br />
Look into the Circlet of Falikan quest. If your going to switch to CoV anyway.</div></div><hr />
