<br />
So far, I am cool with everything so far.  What knocked me for a loop was the fact that they also want to have a doctor &quot;mess around&quot; with the genes to forcefully make the child be born deaf.<br />
<br />
Their reasoning, they want to be able to share their culture (one of them is deaf and speaks in sign language I believe) to their child in this way, and that it is their right to have a deaf child.<br />
<br />
Please tell me that doctors cannot in good conscience disable a soon to be child from being able to hear normally because of the whims of his/her parents.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A lesbian couple, both deaf and living in Bethesda, MD wanted to have a deaf child. They solicited a donation from a deaf man to try and ensure their child would be born deaf. He is now 5 months old, and they succeeded.<br />

OK, I spoke, he read lips, and he signed, and wrote when I didn't understand his sign. He said:<br />
 &quot; Is it any different from a black couple selecting a black man to donate because they want their child to have the same skin color as his parents? Sure, people of color have it tough... but that doesn't mean we want our children to be white!&quot;<br />
<br />
He also pointed our that a hearing child raised by two deaf parents is going to have a MORE difficult time adjusting because he will be a child caught between two cultures. A deaf child will fit into the deaf culture with his parents; a hearing child will have speech delays and may feel that he doesn't really fit in either word, hearing or deaf. Why not just tell people with disabilities that they are not allowed to raise children?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaraxel</div><div class="date">04-16-2002, 03:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why isn't it, Drexel?  The problem is, where does one draw the line at being desirable and not?  This is eugenics all over again.<br />
<br />
One can argue the same thing for blindness, one can argue the same thing for brown hair, one can argue the same thing for an extra thumb, sickle cell.<br />
<br />
The question is, how do we draw the line, as a society, to determine something is not &quot;desirable&quot; or &quot;disabled&quot;?  While this (being deaf) is a generally accepted form of disability, but what about sickle cells?  IIRC, while they might cause blood clodding, it was also responsible for immunity to a certain type of blood diease.  (I need to reread up on that one).  What about being in a world of loud noises that would just cause pain without protection?<br />
<br />
I am not saying the fact that the parents trying to force their children a certain way is right, but how do we, as a society, prevent ourselves from forcing on a subgroup of people what we think is not desirable and not?  Today it can be deafness, tomorrow it can be skin colour.  Is it wrong for me to want my children to be Chinese too and prefer a Chinese wife?</div></div><hr />

Let's not give them the best chance to live a normal life.  Hey, if this is going to be the norm, when people in wheelchairs want kids, we can just cut the legs off the child right after it's born so they fit in with who is raising them.  Makes sense to me!</div></div><hr />

It's pretty simple, really.<br />
<br />
edit: I spoke too soon there, I see now that you were arguing the morality issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kahla</div><div class="date">04-16-2002, 03:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In all honesty this issue is far more complex than it seems on the surface and Nitefox I've read your arguments in the past and know you know how to think so step back a bit and just think about this issue.  Its not so cut and dry as people want to make it.  That is why I also have had issues sorting it out on my own and I still have no idea where I sit.<br />
<br />
Taamar raises a great point as well that the child would suffer many issues growing up in a deaf houshold his early learning would me destroyed since nobody woudl be talking during the key part of yoru speech development.  Truly its a fascinating puzzle.  In the end though I expect the child in this case will grow up and not care one way or the other what choice his parents made and just be glad he is hear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaraxel</div><div class="date">04-16-2002, 03:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">/bonk Drexel.  heh heh.  I think Tamaar and I are both arguing the morality issue.   <br />
<br />
There are two problems here:  how do we, as a society, decide what is good and what is not?  Deafness can be argued to be immune to noise, afterall.  How /do/ we classify something as disabled?  Deafness now, what about short arms, short legs, weak bones, nearsightedness (which IS a disability if you come down to it)?  <br />
<br />
The second is, is it right for the parents to try and apply eugenics on their own children.  Extremists would think even skin colour is alright (ala black wanting black children, chinese chinese children, etc).<br />
<br />
It all comes down to, where do we draw the line.<br />
<br />
And Nitefox, I know what you're saying, but the fact we can't breathe water but can breathe air, does that mean we should rip out the gills on someone somehow mutated to have gills instead of lungs?  It IS genetically possible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Try applying this to some other feature.... hair color? Suppose a childless couple is looking for a donor... do they have the right to select one to give the greatest chance of having a physical trait in common with the parents? What if the hair color they want is the red that comes with insta-burn white skin? What about colorblindness? Its not a HUGE inconvenience... can I select a colorblind donor so my child will have something in common with my husband?

<br />
If the a child is born a certain way(perfect, deaf, blind, no legs, etc) then there is nothing that can be done about except help them overcome an problems they may have and make life as normal as possible.<br />
<br />
If people go out of their way to not give a child the best chance at a normal life then to me that is wrong.  They intentional wanted to short change this kid so they could fufill their selfish needs, with any regard to what the kid might want one day.  I mean can you see it 15 years from now?  &quot;High Jr., we did everything possible to make sure you would never hear a sound.  Aren't we swell?&quot;.

Hmmm... tailor make? No.... but if I want blonde children I should be able to select a blond donor. Or husband. My question for you, Telumahtar, has to do with what should and shouldnt be allowed... there HAS to be a middle ground. All or nothing means that people whose children may have Tay-Sachs may not have children because you insist that genetic modification is a black/white issue and you fear &quot;Nazi loving wannabes&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rykar</div><div class="date">04-16-2002, 04:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">After your first message Taamar, I can understand why the parents would prefer to have a deaf child.  However, we now go into deep ethics on as others mentioned when is something classified as a disability or a feature.<br />
<br />
On the one hand, the majority of society view deafness as a handicap that can limit the opportunities of this child when he is grown up.  This child can never be a fighter pilot.  They will always be given preferential/special treatment on certain social events and functions.  In sum total, the child cannot live a normal life as espoused by society in general.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, the parents will have issues raising a normal child if both are deaf.  Here we get into the sad ethical question on are these people fit to raise children?  Can we in good conscience say that their handicap/feature should keep them from raising children?<br />
<br />
It seems that the deaf community would want their culture to propagate through time.  Is this the best way to pass the knowledge down?<br />
<br />
If someone comes along and says I have a potion where with one spoonful, you will be cured of deafness.  Would they even want to be a member of mainstream society?<br />
<br />
I see self serving purposes in this issue as well as very ethically wrong (to the majority of society) ideas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telumehtar Ben'Kiriath</div><div class="date">04-16-2002, 04:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">and you fear &quot;Nazi loving wannabes&quot; <br />
<br />
Careful Taamar you are placing words in my mouth that are way out of context.<br />
<br />
Firstly I never said I would call them &quot;Nazi loving wannabes&quot; I simply said if someone tried people would call them that.<br />
<br />
Secondly your statement shows that you infered I'm against genetic modification when in fact I'm actually very open to the idea.<br />
<br />
So please don't try and peg me in a hole when the hole you selected for me isn't the right size.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nightop</div><div class="date">04-16-2002, 04:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Perhaps I should go read the article before commenting on it but, on the surface this seems wrong on multiple levels.  While I am no legal expert or even claim to know how this case would be handled, I do have one question.  Since this child is deaf, I belive that the child qualifys for govermental assistance of some sort.  If that is the case then this is wrong to purposely place a burden on society.</div></div><hr />

If you have HIV, do you want your kid to have HIV so they can experience your culture? Please. To go back to my first comparison, is it okay for me to TRY and raise a shizophrenic child just so we'll have more in common? This is nothing like black or white, this is about *intentionally* trying to mess up your kid. That is wrong.<br />

Yes, we can debate whether deafness, mental illness, loss of limbs, etc are &quot;disabilities&quot;, but that's just semantics when it comes to imposing these conditions on someone for your own whim :(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myrea</div><div class="date">04-16-2002, 04:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would have to say that genetically manipulating the child in-vitro in order to guarantee a certain genetic result would be wrong, whether you are seeking deafness, blindness, blonde hair or a higher IQ. Maybe it's just the regligious side of me, but I really do think that it's not up to us to interfere with normal human development. Even correcting non-fatal defects genetically seems wrong to me. Our differences and our individual hardships, and the way we compensate for them are part of what makes us who we are. My grandfather, my brother and my son are all red-green colorblind. My son is autistic. Would they be the same people they are today if those problems had been detected by genetic screening and eliminated before they were even born? I don't really think they would.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, seeking certain genetic characteristics in the sperm or egg donor for your child is natural. It's what species have been doing for billions of years. The female and male each seek the best mate for desireable characteristics. Now that we have reached a point where survival isn't our main goal as a species, the definition of 'desireable characteristics' changes.<br />
<br />
If a woman with red hair seeks a red-haired sperm donor, is that eugenics? What about eggs? Those places are EXTREMELY strict in their screenings - no genetic diseases, 20/20 vision, above average IQ, etc.<br />
<br />
This is not a case of someone who wants to give their child surgery to eliminate his hearing. It's a case of someone who wants their child to be like them. There are those who consider being black a disadvantage - should that mean blacks should seek non-black sperm donors for artificial insemination?<br />
<br />
I, personally, can't imagine actually wanting a deaf child, but if I had one, I would love him, though it would take time to get over the shock and disappointment. (Trust me, I know what I'm talking about in this case.) These women would have loved a hearing child as much as a deaf one, it just would have taken some time for them to get over the shock and disappointment of having one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elwin</div><div class="date">04-16-2002, 04:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think these women are very selfish as well. Things have a way of working themselves out. Their child *could have* lived a fruitful life WITH his hearing fully intact. Speech problems? I thought they had corrective classes for that. Speech impairment is MINOR in the long run, and can be corrected. Now he is DEAF for LIFE. Presently, deafness can not be corrected.<br />
<br />
I wish we as a culture could just let nature take its course. Humans have been breeding for several thousand years without the need for genetic engineering. To me, natural reproduction will always be the ethical superior because nature has been refining that art for billions of years, it works, and it deals the least harm.</div></div><hr />

Hardly suggesting you were... I was trying to illustrate the difference between paralysis and deafness. Your comment that the parapalegics you know dempnstrates a significant difference I think? And you will note that I didn't attack you personally and I request that you keep any attacks directed at my arguments, not at myself. <br />
<br />
Deafness is a culture in the same way that blackness is a culture. Black people can have black donors to have black babies. Why? Beacause being black does not make people inferrior. Deaf people don't consider themselves inferior.<br />
<br />
Drexel and Elwin say the two women are selfish... I disagree. They are trying to bring a child into the only world they feel competant to teach him... the deaf world. Ask both women if they would want to be able to hear... I'll bet they say no. Would you want your child born with an extra arm? Might be handy...  but you wouldn't be able to teach the child how to use it, and your child would probably suffer less confusion if he was built like his parents.</div></div><hr />

I didn't attack you either Taamaar.  You are reading something that isn't there.  Please try not to make a big thing out of something that isn't there.<br />
<br />
As for the women, yes they are being selfish.  Where is the choice for the child?  If the child had to decide, do you think they would choose to hear or not?  I bet the child would want too.  And your assumption that the two women would not want to be able to hear if they could is laughable.<br />
<br />
And like others mentioned, if they were so bent on getting a deaf child, they could have adopted one.  That would have been the best option available.  <br />
<br />
Again, these women are selfish and this child has to suffer because of it.</div></div><hr />

I have not been surprised by any of the &quot;Regulars&quot; views on any of these &quot;moral&quot;, &quot;ethical&quot; or &quot;societal&quot; issues in a LONG time.<br />
<br />
We have the side that feels: &quot;There is very little in life that is right or wrong. Let people live however THEY feel they should live. Do not ever try to tell others what YOUR views are on a subject because there are no wrong views. Just about ANY action or belief can be justified. Why are you all so intolerant of everyone&quot;?<br />
<br />
We also have the side that says: &quot;There are cretin things in life that are Right and that are Wrong. There are things people should NOT do because they are not right, they are wrong. It does not matter if &quot;YOU&quot; think they are right or not, or OK, they are not. Our country and Society in general are going downhill at an alarming rate mostly because of &quot;Political Correctness&quot; and the misrepresentation of what &quot;tolerance&quot; means.<br />
<br />
I honestly believe that some here would defend almost ANYTHING if the people they see to be on &quot;the other side&quot; where against it. I don't know, this is kind of a Highjack and Rant of sorts I guess, but it is also justified I think. Maybe I will read less of this forum, these threads, or this board in general. I can honestly say that before I even clicked on this thread I KNEW who would defend it, and who this would bother. I even guessed half the justifications for this. <br />
<br />
The only thing I can say that comforts me a bit is that I realize most of the people in my life, does not matter where from, this game, work, church, friends, family, Fraternity, etc. Most of them have a better sense of &quot;Right&quot; and &quot;Wrong&quot; than a vocal few represented here. I just Hope and Pray that the majority of our country has that same sense.</div></div><hr />

/sigh<br />
<br />
Being born &quot;black&quot; is by design, it is how they are &quot;supposed to be&quot;. Being born deaf is because of a defect. Something did not develop the way it was supposed to develop. Humans where not meant to be born deaf. You HAVE to be able to understand that, don't you? I mean seriously, that is just basic Biology, right? It is not like eye color, hair color, skin color, where there are many varieties, right? We are supposed to be born able to hear, but &quot;oops&quot; sometimes someone is born who cannot hear?<br />
<br />
No I believe they had the &quot;right&quot; to do what they did. They broke no law, etc. Of course I also think what they did is odd, morally wrong, and maybe even bordering on abusive.<br />
<br />
Most parents what their children to do better than they did, have an &quot;easier&quot; life, and be even more successful. To go out of your way to try have a child with a birth defect that will limit them in our country seems, well selfish and ignorant.</div></div><hr />

And your assumption that the two women would not want to be able to hear if they could is laughable.<br />
<br />
Actually, it's not.  A significant majority of deaf people surveyed would not choose to hear if they had the option.  It's been many years since I saw the survey, but it was somewhere in the 60-70% range.<br />
<br />
At first, my reaction was that it would be unethical for these women to want their child to be born disabled.  But I think we have to throw out the idea that deafness is a disability.  Deaf people certainly don't think that it is.  To them, being deaf is a gift that has allowed them to experience the world in a way that hearing people cannot.<br />
<br />
And after all, why do we have children?  Because we want to send some part of ourselves into the world that will live on after we're gone.  Because we want to continue our culture and our values.  Deaf people have their own culture and values that they want to continue, and a child with hearing is the one who would be disabled in that culture.<br />
<br />
So, on balance, I think it's ok for deaf people to want their child to be deaf.  It's not any different from the athletic person who wants his child to be a great athlete, or the scholar who wants his children to be smart.<br />
<br />
Now, if they plan to achieve it through genetic manipulation, that's a different story.  There are a lot of moral considerations there, that I think we haven't worked through yet.  But if they do it more or less the old fashioned way, choosing a partner with suitable characteristics and hoping things work out, I say good luck to them, and may they have a happy family.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually thats not entirely correct... A significant portion of people who were BORN deaf or became deaf at an EARLY age were polled as wanting to remain deaf.  I know that may sound nitpicky but if you change the sampling to deaf people in general then the numbers change dramatically as many people who are deaf used to be able to hear.  And Firion it isn't my intention to bomb you on your stats on this one I'm just pointing this out cause I figured the &quot;born deaf&quot; survey was what you were refering to and no the &quot;general deaf public&quot;.<br />
<br />
As far as what is considered a disability or not... simple way to solve this and for that matter a few other problems.  If the law in other areas determines something to be a disability that requires special treatment then it is a disability and should be treated as such in ALL cases (btw that is how they handle this kinda of thing legally... i.e. called precedent).  If deaf people are willing to give up their right to special treatment in the work place by having special equipment and other stuff provided for them so that in exchnage they can be considered &quot;normal&quot; or deafness not as a disability then fine but I find it to very much be a double standard that they can in one case claim disability allowances and then in another case claim that they are not disabled. They need to make up their minds and settle on one or the other and not try and mooch the best of both worlds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While a Deaf Culture sounds like a good thing, in some cases I think it's taken too far.  Such as this one.  To me this sounds more like its &quot;US&quot; and &quot;THEM&quot;; I don’t want our child to be one of &quot;Them&quot;.  There is nothing wrong with “US”.  <br />
<br />
The one thing I will comment on is that this is in no way analogous to something like being black, asian, white, left handed, blonde and blue eyed or anything else.  Those are all aesthetic traits.  Hearing is one of our senses.  Human beings have not evolved to compensate for loss of hearing the way say... bats develop sonar to compensate for poor sight.  <br />
<br />
As far as the right of these women to do this; I suppose it’s really not my business, they should be able to do what they want.  Had it been a case of them manipulating an Embryo or DNA that’s different.  But as I understand it they simply sought a deaf mans semen to give a greater chance at a deaf child.</div></div><hr />

I strongly disagree, as they are tampering with the life of another human being who has no say in it whatsoever. Plus, when would &quot;do what you want&quot; stop? It's okay to try and have a deaf baby, so is it okay to try and have a retarded baby? Is it okay to try and have a baby with AIDS? Is it okay to purposefully try to limit an innocent being's functunality because you &quot;want to&quot;?</div></div><hr />

These two women decided that they wanted their child to be disabled, given an impairment that is not something that a healthy, fully-functioning human being has.  You can argue &quot;culture&quot; or wanting to be like them all you want - it should not have been their decision to permanently harm that child.  I'm not buying that being deaf isn't a disability - if it's not what the other 90-something% of us would be born with, it's not what a person is intended to be born with.  That's just common sense.<br />
<br />
If that child wanted to make himself deaf to be more like his parents, more power to him - while I would still find that disturbing, those women had no place making the decision.<br />

Who cares what our child might want? I want it DEAF. Gimmie a deaf child! NOW!<br />
<br />
I tell you what. If I grew up and found out my parents purposly picked a donar to ensure my deafness, I would hate them forever, with every ounce of passion in my being. So, these parents probably have coming for them what they deserve. I just feel sorry for the poor child who had no voice when his deafness was chosen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I believe that the two women decided to do what they because they were paranoid and wanted to protect themselves and their child due to their homosexuality.<br />
<br />
Having dated (and almost marrying) two women that were deaf, I have seen and lived in deaf culture.  The saying &quot;talking about someones back&quot; takes on an entirely new meaning.  I learned that a simple and innocent action can take a different path when viewed by a deaf person, and in the deaf community, rumors tend to run rapid.  Compared to everything else, that time period was some of the best times of my life as well as some of the worse times of my life.<br />
<br />
Is what they did wrong for the child? Yes, since I have met quite a few people that were born to one or two deaf parents.  It is not quite the same as being born in a bilingual family, but is similar.<br />
<br />
In fact, there are a few programs that actually have parents teaching their children simple sign language to express their needs before they are able to speak.  (chuckles)  I have taught my 3yr old niece to say I love you in sign, and she gets a kick out of it.<br />
<br />
Tis my thoughts on it.</div></div><hr />

It's not abuse, and it's not ANYTHING like Nazi eugenics or wishing for a child to be born with AIDS. It's simply a case of two parents who very much wanted their child to be like them, with a quirk that neither of them view as a disability - any more than those with fair skin view their susceptability to sunburn as a disability.<br />
<br />
If my husband were not capable of fathering my child, I would seek a donor who was about 6 feet tall, brown hair, brown eyes, glasses, and part Native American. (My husband is 1/4). Would it be better for my child for me to seek someone with 20/20 vision in order to give him a chance at perfect vision? Or maybe I need to avoid the Indian blood because they seem to have a pre-disposition toward alcoholism. Maybe, but I want my child to be as close a reflection of me and my partner as possible.<br />
<br />
That's all these women did. They sought a donor whose characteristics most matched their own features. They wanted a child who was like them. What about parents with dwarfism? Some of them want their children to be normal, but many would feel uncomfortable with a normal-sized child and hope for any children to be small like their parents. Are they abusing the child if they choose a sperm donor with dwarfism?<br />
<br />
It's not like the had the child's hearing damaged in some way. They rolled the dice like every parent does, and they got what they wanted. There is no comparison between what they chose to do and cutting a child's legs off to make him paraplegic.<br />
<br />
It's not something I would choose for my child, but I can't bring myself to condemn them for their choice.</div></div><hr />

It is a Selfish act, &amp; that is what I have a problem with. They tried to have a disabled child for their own motives. They thought of themselves, not of their child. Just like this example is a selfish act, even by your own description:<br />

IF it were posible for these two to have children (ie one of them was a guy) then thier child would have had the exact same chance of being deaf as it did with thier friends donated sperm.  Or even for that matter, if she had simply been with him instead of her girlfriend, same result.  The point is, there was NO genetic manipulation involved here.  They said in that article there was every chance the child would have been hearing and they would have been fine with that, in choosing a doner who was deaf they rolled the dice, I mean heck, many people skip the doner and find a close friend to simply have relations with so they can have their child.  If there WAS genetic manipulation involved this would be a whole new issue, but there wasnt.   Personaly, I think if they wanted a deaf child they should have adopted one, but thats just one view among many really.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because of their choice, that child will never hear the wind blow, or &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot;, or the crack of a baseball on a wooden bat.  Their chance of being a good musician is practically nil.  Being deaf makes it harder to be a good athlete, at least in team sports.<br />
<br />
I am all for treating deaf people as normal, as far as we can.  Treating them normally doesn't mean I can talk to their back and expect them to understand me.  It means that I value them as a person just as much as anybody else.<br />

I don't think that it would be a stretch to think that many deaf people seek other deaf people to form relationships with.  Should they be prevent them from having children as well because they will likely have a deaf child?<br />
<br />
The only reason why this is getting any publicity at all is because they are lesbians and therefore have to seek a sperm donor.<br />
<br />
I agree that adoption would make a lot of sense, but I also can't fault these women for wanting a child that is from the body of one of them.  Just like EVERY other couple that is out in the world.<br />
<br />
Personally I think that they are being selfish, and that it is unfortunate that they are hoping for a deaf child.  However, I would be more concerned about any kind of formal legislation or government interferance with their choice of a sperm donor.<br />

<br />
Deaf people marry other deaf people NOT because they want deaf kids in most cases but because they fell in love.  The reason for choosing the mate in this situation is not to try and find a specific genetic characteristic but to find a mate to share life with and who has things in common with you.<br />
<br />
The thing that is bothering people about this is if the lesbian couple wanted a child then they should've just picked any donor... if they wanted a blonde child then pick a blonde donor.. but picking a deaf donor in the hopes of getting a disability is wrong.  Your purposely trying to pick defficient genes to handicap someone.  <br />
<br />
If they wanted a deaf child then the best thing they could've done to help their &quot;culture&quot; would've been to adopt a deaf child show someone who is already at a disadvantage the love and culture that they will live in their whole life.  I'm sorry but their &quot;selection&quot; of genes was both wrong and purposefully hurtful.<br />
<br />
And if you say that Deafness is not a disability like these women are claiming then I point you back to my solution on defining legally whehter you are disabled in ALL cases or in none.  You can't mooch both worlds.</div></div><hr />

I don't disagree with you, I was just trying to point out that it's the fact that they biologically have to seek out a donor that has brought this issue to the foreground.  If they felt the same way about wanting a deaf child, but could have children on their own, we'd never have heard about it.<br />
<br />
I really don't disagree with you on this issue much.<br />
<br />
It seems that the parents don't view deafness as a disability, but of another characteristic such as eye or hair color.  While I myself don't really agree with that, I do know that it is a pretty widely accepted viewpoint in the deaf community.<br />
<br />
I also agree that if that is going to be their viewpoint, I don't think that they should be covered by ADA nor expect any special treatment within the workforce.<br />
<br />
However, I would be concerned if the government were to enforce some kind of restriction on this.  Selective reproduction is NOT something that I want our government putting it's nose into.  While the actions of these women are unfortunate and arguably detrimental to this child, it is NOTHING compared to the kind of damage that the government could do if involved.</div></div><hr />

Also if you have 2 children there is a provision for taking one or both of them away to be wards of the state.  In the case of boys they usually end up military for the rest of their lives.  In the case of girls they end up as slaves or worse.<br />
<br />
And Aizle that makes more sense the second time around.  Your right had they  been able to have children of their own we would probably not be hearing about this but regardless of whether they are having children on their own or with assistance if someone picks a mate to purposely try and increase the chances of a defect then I think that is wrong.<br />
<br />
That is not to say I think disabled people shouldn't marry other disabled people as the reason most people marry is love not genetic selection.<br />
<br />
Oh and HOLY SMOKES Aizle and I agree on something... What is this world coming to... the end days are upon us :D</div></div><hr />

However, I would be concerned if the government were to enforce some kind of restriction on this.  Selective reproduction is NOT something that I want our government putting it's nose into.  While the actions of these women are unfortunate and arguably detrimental to this child, it is NOTHING compared to the kind of damage that the government could do if involved. <br />
<br />
I do not disagree with this statement.<br />
<br />
However...what if in 20 years that child is extremely pissed off that he can't hear the latest Britney Spears album?  Let's say he then decides that nobody else should have to go through what he did.  What can he do?  Only one option: sue with the hopes that if he wins then other parents will avoid doing what his parents did.<br />
<br />
The problem with not allowing the government to legislate against any behavior is that lawsuits become the de facto legislation.</div></div><hr />

Last time I checked, having sunburn doesn't mean you can't hear.</div></div><hr />

I hold fast that as a parent you are supposed to give to your children every opportunity you did and DIDN'T have.  Simple as that.<br />

Last time I checked, sunburn was midly painful, and temporary. Deafness severly limits the human experience, and is permanent.</div></div><hr />

Hmm.  Well considering the child would not have been born without them making the choice they did, there is not much he or she can be upset with.<br />

Completely agree here.  I think it's fairly obvious however that these 2 particular individuals do not see Deafness as a disadvantage.  Quite the contrary, they feel it is an opportunity.</div></div><hr />

Then I propose a test to see if this is how they REALLY feel.<br />
<br />
Simply propose to them at this point that you can either<br />
<br />
A) continue to live your lives with your new child but you and your child are no longer eligible for special treatment including special classes in school for your child or special equipment for the workplace both for your child and yourselves.<br />
<br />
B) You claim deafness is a disability and the child becomes a ward of the state since you two are unfit mothers but your child and yourselves will continue to be allowed to make use of special services devoted to the deaf.<br />
<br />
Very simple question... its basically asking are you diabled ALL the time?  or just some of the time.<br />
<br />
If they want the gravy of being disabled but then turn around and want the gravy of being &quot;normal&quot; then what we have on our hands are hypocritical moochers of the system.</div></div><hr />

The genetic monkeying is wrong.  Aside from disabiling said child, designer babys are a bad thing, *especially* considering how crude our manipulation of the human genome is.  We don't know the side effects ATM, and considering the potential implications.  As far as the findind another deaf man goes, I feel bad for the kid, but i'm not sure anything &quot;wrong&quot; happened per se.</div></div><hr />

Ask that kid in say about 15 years or so and see what he says about that.</div></div><hr />

If the couple simply found a deaf donor in hopes of having a deaf child then i dont find anything wrong with it.  Its the same as another couple that cant have kids looking for a smart donor or a tall donor or whatever.  As for doing a diservice to their child i can not say.  As someone said a hearing child raised by 2 deaf parents may have a harder time then a deaf child.  Im not sure ive never been deaf or known a deaf person (aside from one regular costumer at burger king) so i cant comment on a sense of culture or whatever else.<br />
<br />
However i feel if we allow people to chose donors (which i dont have a problem with) then we cant say well yeah you can chose the smart one becuase you want a smart kid, but you cant choose the deaf one cuz you want a deaf kid.<br />
<br />
Now if the child was denied something in the womb (thro a medical procedure)  to make him deaf  im a little more uneasy.  The problem with that sort of thing is where do you draw the line? Is it ok to pick if your child is a boy or girl?  Ok to pick the hair color? Pick if he or she is deaf or not?  Does the unborn child have rights?  Could he or she grow up and sue his parents becuase they violated his right to have hearing or to be a boy or whatever?  <br />
<br />
Im not sure who i feel about this.  Some things to &quot;pick&quot; about my child i wouldnt have a problem, but i bet others would have a problem with what i think is ok to pick, and im sure id have a problem with others who &quot;pick&quot; other things that i think just go a bit too far.  But how can you regulate which one is right or not?</div></div><hr />

I do not see a problem at all. Should not be &quot;allowed&quot; to &quot;pick&quot; anything! You get what you get, that is how this was designed to work. You don't get to say, I want a red, curly haired girl with green eyes and if she starts out as a blond haired, blued eyed boy we will fix it. Of course the Child has rights, the right to grow as a human that was not manipulated to meet some selfish desire of parents who get confused and think they are picking out a pet dog or toy doll not bringing a life into this world.<br />

Deaf people marry other deaf people NOT because they want deaf kids in most cases but because they fell in love. The reason for choosing the mate in this situation is not to try and find a specific genetic characteristic but to find a mate to share life with and who has things in common with you. <br />
<br />
The thing that is bothering people about this is if the lesbian couple wanted a child then they should've just picked any donor... if they wanted a blonde child then pick a blonde donor.. but picking a deaf donor in the hopes of getting a disability is wrong. Your purposely trying to pick defficient genes to handicap someone. <br />
<br />
If they wanted a deaf child then the best thing they could've done to help their &quot;culture&quot; would've been to adopt a deaf child show someone who is already at a disadvantage the love and culture that they will live in their whole life. I'm sorry but their &quot;selection&quot; of genes was both wrong and purposefully hurtful.  <br />

Heh, we agree for once  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Llegolas</div><div class="date">04-18-2002, 11:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a really hard issue to figure out how I think about it.<br />
<br />
I don't think that deafness can be compared to skin color.  The parents are removing one of their child's five senses (we've only got five, you know).  I think it would be much more similar to deciding to remove a child's leg at birth (or before birth).<br />
<br />
Here's another analogy:  If everyone on earth was telepathic, and I'm just plain old me (no telepathy), I think they would consider me disabled.  I think I would also consider myself disabled, even if I had made some friends that also happened to not be telepathic.<br />
<br />
I'm sure everyone here agrees that the problem that black people face is a problem with society, not a problem with their skin color.  It's an external problem, not an internal problem. <br />
<br />
It's good that the parent's have accepted their deafness.  In fact, it's good for them that they've been able to embrace it and form a &quot;culture&quot; around it.  But remember, it IS a disability.  However you look at it, there are many things that hearing people are able to do that deaf people aren't.  <br />
<br />
I think the only arguement that supports the parents in this case would be that the child actually might grow up being able to relate to his parents because he is deaf as well.  I suppose the parents could make that arguement.<br />
<br />
Basically, the arguement the parents are making here is whether or not his life will be better overall being deaf or not.  They think it will.<br />
<br />
I happen to think it's selfish and not in the best interests of the child to deprive him of his hearing.  Why don't they let him choose to have his hearing removed when he's 18?  Probably because he'd recognize it as a disability and choose to not remove his hearing.</div></div><hr />
