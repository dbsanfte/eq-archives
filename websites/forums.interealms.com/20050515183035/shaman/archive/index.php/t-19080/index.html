<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Much has been said about priest healing, so I did some caclulations to compare the role that shaman slowing has on the amount of mana spent by the different classes.  My model is relatively simple.  Without going into the details on how I derived it, I used the following formula to calculate the average costs of healing:<br />
<br />
Total mana spent = debuff costs + [(mana cost x mob dps x fraction slowed) / amount healed] * fight duration<br />
<br />
The term in braces &quot;[ ]&quot; is the rate of mana expenditure on healing per second.<br />
<br />
I used this equation to compare the incomplete heals of druids and shamans to the complete heal of clerics.  In each case, the mana cost for the spells is 400.  Without showing you the graphs (I'm no Thott), here's some conclusions I drew:<br />
<br />
1.  Because they heal more per cast, clerics are always more efficient than druids and shamans, as expected.<br />
<br />
2.  A shaman healing with slow initially spends much more mana than a druid healing without slow because the shaman incurs debuff costs (Malos + Turgurs = 650).<br />
<br />
3.  However, the longer the fight lasts, the more similar mana costs become.  If the fight lasts long enough, a shaman will recoup the mana lost due to debuffing by having to cast fewer heals.  Conversely, when mobs die quickly, shaman healing is extremely inefficient compared to other priests because the debuff costs are paid for every mob.<br />
<br />
4.  The time it takes for a shaman to recoup the mana lost on debuffing increases dramatically with slow mitigation.  In fact, with sufficient degree of mitigation, a shaman cannot ever recoup this mana, so a druid will always be more efficient.<br />
<br />
Here's an example of my calculations to give you a feel for what happens with slow mitigation.  Assume a mob doing 100 dps, then we have the following mana costs:<br />
<br />
Fight duration = 1 minute<br />
<br />
Cleric mana cost = 320<br />
Druid mana cost = 813<br />
Shaman mana cost (no mitigation) = 957<br />
Shaman mana cost (25% mitigation) = 1188<br />
Shaman mana cost (50% mitigation) = 1419<br />
<br />
Fight duration = 2 minutes<br />
<br />
Cleric mana cost = 640<br />
Druid mana cost = 1625<br />
Shaman mana cost (no mitigation) = 1265<br />
Shaman mana cost (25% mitigation) = 1726<br />
Shaman mana cost (50% mitigation) = 2188<br />
<br />
Although these are theoretical calculations, I think they are fairly conservative, since actual mana costs for all 3 classes will usually be much higher for a number of reasons.  Essentially, mitigation removes us from being a viable healer in groups because we cannot keep up the the mana costs even with cannibalization.  I noticed this when I first tried to keep mobs healed in Plane of Sky, and later in BoT.<br />
<br />
The bottom line is this: shaman healing is extremely weak when we have to debuff mobs before each encounter.  This weakness is compounded greatly with mitigation.  It is most severe on mobs that have high dps but die relatively quickly.  That is why PoP-type mobs, with high dps and low hp relative to older expansion mobs, have marginalized shaman healing and slowing ability.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It should also be noted that while druids and clerics are casting their spells they are also regaining mana from their passive mana regen buffs.  It would be 20 per tick for a cleric using yaulp and 12 for a druid.  Shamans are prevented from using our mechanism for regenning mana when we are casting spells.</div></div><hr />

What DO druids do?  Who cares if they can heal better than shaman...hardly anyone groups with druids anyways...I know they're at the bottom of my list of classes I seek when I build groups.  When is the last time you were in a group and somebody suggest you fill up your last spot with a druid?<br />
<br />
There is no reason why all priest classes should heal equally well or for the same mana costs.<br />
<br />
Newsflash - if you want to play a strong healer be something other than a shaman.  Healing is one of our many abilities, and despite being a priest variant, it's not our forte, yet we can still be the primary healer in many situations.  Get over it.<br />
<br />
In many situations shaman can be an adequate primary healer - which is pretty amazing considering how weak shaman healing is compared to others.  I'll be there are plenty of situations where a druid could NOT be the primary healer if there was no slower in the group - and I bet you could even say the same for clerics. At the highest levels, in planes of power and such, perhaps shaman cannot fill this role because it is the highest level content and no weak healer SHOULD be able to be primary healer in such a situation.  GET OVER IT!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Keldrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Excellent analysis.<br />
<br />
You should also take into account the damage done before the mob is debuffed and slowed.  This has a big effect on the amount we have to heal.  In fact... if I get a couple resists.. and have to wait for the recast timer... then often I wind up having to spend an inordinate amount of time trying to heal the tank bank up from the damage inflicted by the unslowed mob.</div></div><hr />

- When you are done with Kunark as game content and actually move to the bigger leagues (PoP and beyond) give us a call. Of course you are the few who like to be outnuked by rangers, outbuffed by beastlords and outhealed by paladins. The majority of shamans don't like that idea to be outdone by hybrids. Maybe you should follow your own advice and &quot;get over it&quot;.<br />

It's really difficult for us to reach consensus on ANYTHING. Everyone, please help our discussions by keeping them civil. It's really okay to disagree, we all play shaman differently, we all want different things for our class. We have to work together to find SOMETHING the majority of us can agree on. <br />

According to Henora's poll, it's improved healing ability.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
If you don't group with druids, that's your own fault for failing to understand basic game mechanics. I've done EP exp groups and LDoN high-risk missions with druids as primary healers. Druids are a strong class now, and I welcome them into my groups. It's not just healing - it's also good nukes, snare, Spirit of Wood, harmony, and charm that make them effective. Not to mention, the extra mana from 9 is rather handy.<br />

<br />
I agree that the CONCEPT of mitigation is good. The implementation leaves a lot to be desired, though. No one wants to see more 100% MR mobs - that hurts all casters, not just shaman. Mitigation also allows for a wider variety in terms of encounter design. One of the significant downsides for shaman is that mitigation narrowed the gap between all slows.<br />
<br />
One way around this would have been to make mitigation subtractive rather than multiplicative (i.e., instead of multiplying the slow % by 0.5, you would instead subtract 50% from base the slow percentage). This would extend the advantage of shaman slow vs. other classes' slow when fighting mitigating mobs, which is the exact opposite of the situation we have now.<br />
<br />
I don't know about everyone else's slowing strategy, but for PoP xp groups and LDoN high-risk adventures, I almost always lead off with Malos. Even in Tier 2 with max defensive AAs, getting an unslowed mob beating on me for any significant time is going to put me at risk of death. Perhaps it's different if you are a Time-equipped shaman with 6k unbuffed HP, 1800+ AC, and a Time's Antithesis, but for most of the rest of us, Malos is key to survival. <br />
<br />
Our heals should be balanced with regard to both slow mitigation and the need to debuff mobs before slowing them. They need to be balanced to take into account the fact that most mobs last no more than a minute in camp before being killed. I think Gardeltron's calculations are pretty accurate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Assume a different DPS... or assume a different time frame... and you still will get results that say &quot;Shaman spend a heck of a lot more mana to keep people alive than the otehr 2 healers, unless it is one LOOONG fight&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are we reading the same thread?<br />
<br />
Please do me the favor and quote quickly some of Gardeltron's points, where he 'whined and bitched'. Oh wait, you can't - because he didn't. He posted pure numbers and made a (quite theoretical) observation and even admitted, that his calculations are theoretical in nature.<br />
<br />
If you can refute some of his points or numbers, go ahead. Drawing the 'whiner' card to make your point is rather lame.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I disagree when you are speaking about PoP or high dps mobs that do not mitigate slows.  Although your numbers are great, when you apply other factors the numbers are irrelevant.  For example, since you are going to include debuffing into the spell cost for the shaman, why would you not compare the total mana cost using our most effecient heal?  If you were to do that, the situation quickly changes due to timing (malo on inc, slow within the first few seconds of the fight, for example), focus effects, and AA's.  The numbers also do not reflect possible burst damage.  Without slow, vs BoT mobs, clerics and druids would be starting their cheals very very early.<br />
<br />
Perhaps I just don't quite understand the necessity of comparing the raw numbers for a spell that we already know is quite bad :)  While it is true that a cleric hitting for near full on every cheal will be able to keep that up probably indefinately, its just not applicable in game.<br />
<br />
For example, I malo on inc, the mob hits the tank unslowed for 5 seconds (say 1500dmg in BoT) and is then slowed.  By the time it is slowed it's down to low 90's, I take a few hits from slow aggro (say 800) and then I throw two 50% extended Q's onto the tank.<br />
<br />
My cost is 250+350+400 so about the same as you suggested, but has the added benefit of a) spell haste, b) mana pres so the mana cost is more like 900, c) controlled (slowed) environment, d) I'm not spending 10 seconds of my time casting a single spell.<br />
<br />
Perhaps 100dps is a bit low when you are figuring the numbers if you are going to be talking about PoP mobs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Q does not stack while running (something normal heals do) and the 300 hp a tick is to low to keep a tank alive in any higher tier PoP zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Chifari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">There are numerous problems with looking at healing (or damage) in terms of hp per mana (or damage per mana).  The game has moved away from this &quot;sustained&quot; model and to &quot;whatever does the most the fastest&quot;.  <br />
<br />
It doesn't matter if we heal very efficiently if our spot heal isn't big enough to save someone.  <br />
<br />
How many shamans have found themselves in the following situation?  A mob that hits hard is inc (let's say, a deadly earth armadillo, for example), and you are the only healer.  You go to slow it, but it gets resisted, and now your tank is at 40% and dropping fast.  Now you get stuck in what I call a &quot;tnargs loop&quot;, where you have to chain cast tnargs over and over again just to keep the tank alive.  Maybe you will score a crit heal (if you have all those aas worked), and the tank will go up enough that you can pause and cast another slow.  By that time, the dillo is probably dead anyway and you have just blown a huge chunk of your mana with a bunch of fast heals.<br />
<br />
Does this sound familiar?  It's why looking at &quot;slow+heal&quot; as a combo package just doesn't capture the big picture.  Sometimes you need a heal and you need it fast.  Ours (imo) should be big enough to buy time for a slow on any xp mob, even an elemental one like the dillo.<br />
<br />
Really, I don't care if the hp:mana ratio is absolutely godawful if I can toss out a 2k heal.  <br />
<br />
I'll go so far as to suggest:<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;Shammy Version of Infusion&lt;/b&gt;<br />
1.  Increase HP by 1800<br />
Mana:  600, Casting Time:  4.0, Recast: 2.0<br />
<br />
This is a little bigger than druid NI, so would only be appropriate if druids were getting their heal upgraded in GoD.<br />

<br />
Perhaps.  I should have stated that my example was in no means meant to represent an elemental or ldon hard situation.  Although, Gard's original numbers assumed a 100dps mob so that's even more of a stretch to assume he *is* talking about elemental or ldon hard.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">When people use slow as a basis for why we are fine with low rate healing spells, it makes me cringe.  I'm not necessarily talking about the original poster, but people in general who think that way.  Whether slow lands for full or is mitigated, or doesn't land at all, mobs (xp quality/raid trash) still die the same rate.  Any decent dps group make-up can do it.  <br />
<br />
My point is, slow is really just a helpful deterrant to lessen damage done to players.  That's it.  It doesn't mean players become immune to damage done to them.  Clerics and druids heal players fighting against slowed mobs, just as much or more as a shaman might.  With the high damage upper tier zone mobs do, I still don't understand why healing is too different compared to druids.  This causes a shaman needing to cast heals in a greater quantity on someone to keep him alive, and that can result in an extreme case of agro.<br />
<br />
When people argue that we have superior mana regen to keep up with healing, that holds some truth.  But remember, canni'ing takes up physical time, which means you aren't healing in the meantime (casting time+refresh or having to wait 3 minutes to Can5 again), and seconds can mean life or death to someone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll tell you right now, you will never be a primary healer in Phase 1 of Time.  In Field 1 of Doomfire, I can debuff and heal a properly &quot;AA'd&quot; tank, note, AA'd, not equipped as by the time a tank makes it that far, their AC should be a respectable number.  Field 2 would be harder with my current setup but doable if downtime isn't a factor (a dowtime of 2-3 minutes).<br />
<br />
So, where in the game is it?<br />

Personally, I think we're fine in the heal department in the overall view of our class.</div></div><hr />

Well, let me ask you this: Why do 2 of 3 priest classes have the ability to become a primary healer in raid situations, and one doesn't?  I'm not talking about being able to CH an MT, but keep a group (with tanks) alive through thick situations.</div></div><hr />

/sigh i was really hopeing to finish reading this thread and not see thottbot graphs show up, i'm sorry but they have been shredded before, iirc, the graphs i saw you post are even more bias as they say for druid/cleric heals they assume the mob is unslowed, the fact that its further biased by only the shaman lines being effected by mitigation, also the only time i've ever used our craptastic lvl 58 heal is between the levels of 58-60, post 60 i exped in pop, and i was lucky enough to have torpor at 60 that engine +chloro was better than the slow heal, and pop required second healer. (well at least until Q) your pretty crayon drawings don't account for any caning, crit heals, aa's focus, altho non of the classes are counting those other factors. Also, lets take tank hp's into account now i was never in highend luclin guild pre pop, but tanks had 8kish hps i'm guessing, or lets use it for numbers sake, that means kraggs our biggest heal at the time may do 25% of a tanks hps, now a days when you have 10k+ tanks it does less than 20% of a tanks hps, again of the high end guild varitey. how about mob dps, pop mobs hit harder than any other exp mobs ever, when you have mobs in ele plans that hit 700ish on hte low scale, at least doubling a 10 sec heal that heals 3 hits from a mob is a waste of time.&quot;<br />

I don't know what raids you're doing Wulf, but the hybrids in my guild when we're doing EP and Time are NOT healing.  IHIV/Marr's Gift has been fine for me so far.  I don't care what other classes can do.  My concern is how efficient Shaman are.  And we are efficient.  The entire healing debate is really just a matter of perception/jealousy. <br />
<br />
How many of you here have done an exp group with a hybrid as a main healer?  That's it, all they did was healed and nothing else.  In the 5 years I've been playing, I've never had a hybrid been a main healer in my group.<br />
<br />
As far as having 3+ shaman in raids not being useful, if you can't contribute to your raid because you feel there are too many shaman there, you fall under the &quot;operator error&quot; category.  There are a number of encounters where 3 shaman is not enough.<br />
<br />
I have fun with the game which is why I still play it.  I have said in the past and will continue to do so that we are balanced.  If some of you feel that we aren't, ask a guildmate to switch characters for a week and try their class.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">We aren't asking to be primary healer, we are asking to get a decent spot-heal.<br />
<br />
Actually... the reasonning that was given to us about our lack of healing power was that slow is supposed to make it so I can be a primary healer in a fight a slowed MOB (exp, not raid) spending an equivalent amount of ressources as the 2 others, non-slowing healers.<br />
<br />
Even before mitigation was introduced (and even ignoring 100%MR, unslowable MOBs), I found the above stated situation to be the exception rather than the rule. Considering what the mana I had to spend to slow a MOB, I consistently spent a LOT more mana (both proportionally or in absolute) than a druid or a cleric would have. And that's not even considering either of those class could have helped damage down the target with DDs and shorten the fight (and thus the amount of damage to heal) considerably more efficently than I ever could with DDs or DoTs.<br />
<br />
With mitigation, with no significant increase in healing power other than Tnarg, this ain't even funny... and the clerics and druids have only gotten more efficient at DD. And, amusingly enough, the clerics now MELEE without a mana regen penalty...<br />
<br />
So, I am sorry... if someone said that slow should make me a decent primary healer, I would like it to have been true before I resigned myself to beg to be a decent spot healer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have completed both a full potime clearing and the Valdoon raid + the Synarcana ldon raids as the only shaman present (minus phase 1, we had one shaman bot logged in). I can tell you that I did not have any problems with the debuffing at all.<br />
<br />
This is where our problem lies. Exactly what does a shaman do after the mob is fully debuffed? Yes, that's right, we heal/nuke.<br />
<br />
Also, how much do you contribute to a fight when the main mob is unslowble and doesn't spawn adds? Tell me how useful you feel during the Zek brothers in potime? If you don't think that you would be more useful as a dru/clr/wiz, then you are just delusional.<br />

I'm not exactly sure what your problem is with my analyses.  From your rather garbled post, I get the feeling that my graphs support your position, although its not entirely clear what your point is.  Perhaps you had a bad experince with math in school.  That's unfortunate because I'll bet that the developers did very similar calculations when designing these spells.  Let me try to point out why my calculations support your position.<br />
<br />
You were concerned that I did not calculate mana expenditures for druids or clerics for slowed mobs.  I did that on purpose to make our healing look as good as possible.  Its quite clear from the graphs that cleric and druid mana costs would be substantially lower if a mob was slowed.  Which means that our healing spells are weaker in actual encounters than the appear in my graphs.<br />
<br />
Another concern you had was that my graphs didn't show the effects of all the additional spells we must cast in order to regenerate mana.  This takes time away from doing other things, and in the case of our AA cannibalization increases our risk of being able to withstand inadvertent attacks when we get aggro from resisted slows, etc.  Such factors decrease even further the efficiency of our healing below that of a comparably equipped cleric or druid.<br />
<br />
You were also concerned with what happens when mobs have high DPS, like those in PoP.  The effect of DPS on my graphs is to make all the slopes steeper, which means that mana costs increase dramatically.  Again, this makes our heals even more inefficient compared to those of other priests.<br />
<br />
The problem with posting graphs like mine is not so much what the graphs show as it is with people, like yourself, who cannot interpret them correctly or think about how they might apply to the actual design problems that the game has.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Fibonacci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">OK, now you made me start messing with the spread sheets ...<br />
<br />
Is it true that the best we can heal is 261 hp/sec?  Also, this is assuming Q is already on, Regrowth is up and we are chain casting Tnarg's.<br />
<br />
There's something to think about.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Tikker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">The bottom line is this: shaman healing is extremely weak when we have to debuff mobs before each encounter. This weakness is compounded greatly with mitigation. It is most severe on mobs that have high dps but die relatively quickly. That is why PoP-type mobs, with high dps and low hp relative to older expansion mobs, have marginalized shaman healing and slowing ability.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You've made a bunch of bad assumptions I think<br />
<br />
The biggest problem I have with your model, is that you don't really seem to take into account the cast time on the druid and cleric heals <br />
<br />
without debuff (slow, or slow+malos) those classes generally won't have time to land their most efficient heals<br />
<br />
Where a shaman may blow more mana doing it, but it will be viable to use a shaman as solo healer~<br />
<br />
<br />
I would say there's a LOT more content that can be killed with a shaman but no cleric and druid, than there is with a cleric/druid and no shaman/enchanter<br />
<br />
<br />
Slow and Complete heal are the 2 most powerful spells in the game<br />
shaman get slow, and semi decent heals<br />
<br />
clerics and druids only get heals<br />
I'd say shaman wins that battle almost every time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Uman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Unlike Thott's biased propoganda, these graphs communicate simple ideas that are obvious in everyday EQ situations.  The math-phobic are completely off base here.  I don't see how the pictures could be any easier to understand.<br />
<br />
Here are the ways that G's graphs could have been, but were not biased to paint an overly pessimistic picture of shaman healing:<br />
<br />
1) he could have showed healing costs for druids/clerics healing bard/BL/chanter slowed mobs alongside the shaman costs (since every group will have some form of slow!).  Instead he showed that a druid or cleric alone can Keep The Tank Alive (TM) on less mana than a shaman alone for typical duration fights (even in hard ldon, fights are 1 minute or less, to say nothing of normal)<br />
<br />
2) he could have modelled resists and the variable time until slow actually lands, assuming you start casting as soon as the tank gets agro.  Instead, he presents a situation reflective of the most agressive shaman who starts casting (or pulls with) malos and immediately slows, before the tank even gets hit.  You can't complain about that.  Sure, in some cases you can land slow without malos, but by having slow always land (immediately) in his model, he's painting a rosy picture.  The easy mobs in normals that you can get away without a malos on die so fast that you may as well not slow them.<br />
<br />
The only things that are slanted toward making shaman look worse than they actually are:<br />
<br />
1) no graph for quiescence+fast heal (which is what most shamans use in practice).  however, against harder hitting mobs, you are essentially chaining the fast heal and Q is only doing 20% at most of the healing.  the overall point is still true.  *and* HoT do not stack, and clerics have a 500/tick.<br />
<br />
2) *against hard hitting mobs* clerics do not try to land every heal for 8k hp, even with the nowadays-common 11k hp tank (it easy to land the druid 3k or 5k heal for full though).  of course, against mobs that hit so hard, the shaman would not be able to keep the tank alive unless slow landed on the first try.<br />
<br />
On the balance, the graphs show what is wrong with shaman heal balance.<br />
<br />
Remember, before the incomplete heals/PoP:<br />
<br />
1) shamans had the same big heal efficiency and healed *faster* than druids with torpor (although in practice tanks didn't like having it during downtime, too lazy to click it off to fight).  druids had a better fast/big heal but torpor+chloro were better.<br />
<br />
2) there was NO slow mitigation<br />
<br />
3) shamans regened mana much better than clerics/druids<br />
<br />
In that era, there was some truth to Thott's graphs: shamans (for slowable mobs) could be the only priest/healer, close to clerics without a slower, and better than druids without a slower.  Of course, in practice, every group had a slower of at least 50%, so clerics were still better.<br />
<br />
Since then, every factor has been adjusted strongly against shamans ... druids heals are 50% more efficient/powerful (that is HUGE), mitigation is prevalent except in bottom end (valor/bot) content (just look at the graphs to see the effect), and passive manaregen/horses have all stepped up considerably.<br />
<br />
Leave no shaman behind!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Uman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">How about everywhere a beastlord is capable of being primary slower?<br />
<br />
That's an excellent benchmark, but not really fair.  A beastlord *with a mage* and a cleric/druid would do a better job than a shaman of doing LDoN hard healing/slowing simply because you can keep slowing while healing in case of resists.  I don't think shaman should be able to do quite as well as a BL/cleric with a resist debuffer (even though they bring considerable group buffs and DPS above a shaman, it is two people).<br />
<br />
A shaman should be able to easily main heal a mob that never resists slow in the same places a BL or bard + cleric can.  I think that's fair, since the inevitable resists mean you'll need another healer for backup anyhow.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This point is somewhat valid, although it will only be valid for mobs with extremely high DPS.  In my model, a mob doing 100dps will only remove 1000hp after 10 sec, so casting time is really not critical.  In the graphs I posted for Zorlac's benefit, I did the same analysis with the level 63 quick heal spells for all classes, with similar results.<br />

<br />
your orignal post, on the big heal vs quick heal thread<br />
<br />
You can see a comparison of Kragg's and Tnarg's mending relative to the comparable spells of other priests here. Tnarg's actually stacks up very favorably compared to the other heals for fights of moderate duration (30-45 seconds). Kragg's, on the other hand, is pretty useless unless mobs last a really long time. I'd actually prefer an upgrade to both. The idea behind Kraggs is nice, but to be helpful it needs to do at least another 1000hp of healing with the same duration and mana cost.<br />

You clearly didn't undestand what I was saying. I did not say that more than one shaman at raids were some completely useless or detrimental to the raid, but in every single case (except phase 1, 2 shamans are optimal there) swapping out the 2nd, 3rd, 4th etc shaman for ANY other class would be beneficial for the raid. Also, if you eventually do some of the PoTime ldon raids such as Valdoon or Synarcana which are advertised as encounters where multiple shamans are a requirement you will most likely notice that ONE shaman is more than enough which we have already shown you.<br />
<br />
You took two low-end encounters as an example for raids that require more than one shaman, and this just shows your ignorance. Both Fennin and Xegony can easily be done with a single shaman without suffering any losses in the debuff department unless the shaman is worthless. You also mention 2 shamans for the tank for Fennin. WHY? There is nothing that have to be cured so I guess you two just spot-heal or some $hit. Guess what? 2 druids would make a MUCH better job than two shamans there. Same thing on Xegony, replace the shaman doing rgc/spot-heal on tank there with a druid and you will get a MUCH better result.<br />

<br />
Absolutely.  I did an analysis of the problem, which means I isolated a single factor; in this case that factor was the &quot;theoretical&quot; healing ability of priests as affected by slow mitigation.  In this &quot;best case scenario&quot;, shaman healing is very weak compared to other priests, even if a shaman heals damage done by slowed mobs and other priests don't. <br />
<br />
you don't have full mitigation charts for all the healing classes, <br />
<br />
They're not needed, because the healing of other priests is much better than shamans if there is any slow  on the mob at all.  In the charts, shaman healing with slow is compared to healing of unslowed mobs by the other priests.  This is an importatn point, because, presumably, this is how the designers balanced the healing spells in the first place.  Shamans were given lower effect heals because they have slow and other priests don't. <br />
<br />
you don't have resists,   <br />
<br />
If you factor resists, shamans would use even more mana, right?<br />
<br />
shaman healing time shouldn't even start until 10 sec into the fight.  Assuming that said shaman uses malos, 5 sec casting, 2 sec general cool down, 3 sec turgurs, then start healing.   thats already 10 seconds of no healing totally 20 seconds before your first kraggs lands.  <br />
<br />
This is a very good point.  A mob doing 100dps for 20 seconds would do 2k damage, about what Kragg's heals.  Obviously, if the mob's dps was higher, shaman healing would be much worse.  But if you look at the chart for Tnarg's, you'd see the same situation.  Shamans stack up a little better with Tnarg's but would have the same problem.  The bottom line here is if you add the time spent debuffing into the analysis, shaman healing is even weaker than it appears in the charts<br />
<br />
you didn't include druid/cleric healing on slowed mobs to skew the information to your benifit.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what you think I'm trying to do here.  I'm not trying to say shaman healing is fine.  My graphs don't show that.  They show that shamans use much more mana on healing damage done by slowed mobs than other priests do on unslowed mobs.  Furthermore, these costs escalate greatly with slow mitigation.<br />
<br />
as for cani5, i'll assume every shaman worth they're salt Q/torpors themselves before hitting that magic button.  to limit the amount of damage they take,  <br />
<br />
I'm not sure what your point is here, but I think you might be saying that shaman mana regeneration cannot keep with the exhorbitant costs of debuffing and healing.<br />
<br />
you didn't give anyone a base size mana pool,  all that healing may be great, but how long are you going to have to sit around for? <br />
<br />
Shamans generally have lower mana pools than other priests, so shaman healing would be much weaker from this standpoint as well.<br />
<br />
you picked 100 dps mob to once again bais your graphs,  now i have no idea about parses but that seems low by todays standards,   <br />
<br />
DPS isn't the issue here.  I picked 100 dps for convenience.  Yes it is pretty low.  Use my equation if you like to create your own graphs.  I did, but haven't posted them yet.  Bottom line is, shaman healing is far less effective than other priests on mobs with high dps that die quickly because our spells heal less.<br />
<br />
Quisence,  this is probably the only spell that rivals cani and turgurs for the amount of times i cast it, yet there was no graphs showing how effective it is agianst mobs of varied dps.  i have personally found Q is enough up to tactics (except for south/kriegers in bot, because of they're procs and kriegers hit harder) <br />

I haven't analyzed the effect of Quiescence relative to other priest's heal-over-time spells. My guess is it will stack up favorably because it has such a low mana cost.  But as you point out, heal-over-time spells are of limited usefulness on high DPS mobs. <br />
<br />
your orignal post, on the big heal vs quick heal thread<br />
commenting on this will just get me off track from what i've typed lower, perhaps i'll come back and edit something witty or sarcastic in<br />
<br />
The game designers did not use wit or sarcasm to create and balance our healing spells.  They used mathematical and logical reasoning to do so.  It helps us understand what they did to use the same kind of thought process.<br />
<br />
as for my rambling posting, thats just me being boggled and having so many things to say that they all come out semi jumbled.    <br />
<br />
Nobody's perfect, I wish I could say everything I want to about shaman healing more clearly.  The problem is complex and I think you do have a good understanding of it.  I believe all of us who play shamans understand that something is wrong with shaman healing and needs to be fixed.<br />
<br />
as for me you graphs not being the problem, but my lack of understand for such divine testement, if you tried not comparing apples to oranges to grapes then maybe your graphs would be fanatastic but as they are incomplete finger paintings, please do not stand by them<br />
<br />
I do stand by the graphs because they succinctly summarize the problems that you, I, and many other shamans have learned about how unbalanced our healing really is.  The assumption that shamans should have lower effect heals simply because we can slow mobs and have slightly better mana regeneration capabilities than other priests is a bad one to make.  This design problem must be corrected if shamans are to maintain our viability as a healer class.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Mixelplux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Shamans generally have lower mana pools than other priests, so shaman healing would be much weaker from this standpoint as well.<br />
<br />
w t h?<br />
<br />
If your argument is that shamans perhaps due to their race selection have a lower base wisdom, and as such generally have a lower mana pool due to this over their lower levels, then perhaps you have a small point. However, most shamans cap wisdom rather easily with the gear available for quite some time now, so your statement seems highly inaccurate. There are no other distinguising factors for your mana pool besides level and items (wisdom and mana) and spells - class makes 0 difference.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Tikker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">This point is somewhat valid, although it will only be valid for mobs with extremely high DPS.  In my model, a mob doing 100dps will only remove 1000hp after 10 sec, so casting time is really not critical. <br />
<br />
<br />
If a mob has low enough DPS you could do it with a bind wound rotation<br />
<br />
<br />
as for mobs that it's more viable to kill with a shaman and no cleric/druid, I'd say PoF/W/E/A would be a good example<br />
<br />
cleric/druid with no slower are going to expend more mana keeping a tank up, than a shaman would</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">The essential truth is that debuffing a mob is a constant mana cost that you aim to recoup over the duration of the encounter. Thus it works a lot like a DoT, it's an investment. The shorter the combat the less value that slow is getting you. This is in addition to slow mitigation of course, which means you might be getting a reduced effect over the same short time.<br />
<br />
It's fairly irrelevant though. I'd be much happier with a good cleric /  chanter than having a shaman involved. And in a relaxed XP grind druid / beast might be even better.</div></div><hr />

Was looking through some of my older parsings and picked out one I had a lot of data on(over 300k damage anyway)..brann militis in BoT(seems like a good run of the mill exp mob that everyone has access to imo) do roughly 136dps after slow, which would put their unslowed dps around 544.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, I would have guessed lower end PoI stuff to perhaps have 100dps unslowed, but even then I'd be skeptical. In fact, I doubt very few if any PoP exp mobs have as low as 100dps.<br />
<br />
In the end the original post was very &quot;thottish&quot; in nature, completely impossible to have that scenario ever to occur, making any conclusions irrelevant to game play.<br />

I strongly disagree with this point.  Shaman healing cannot keep up with the damage done by yard trash mobs in elemental planes because it's too slow.  You'd be chain casting Tnarg's plus Malos and at least one Turgur's on every mob.  Down time would be pretty high, more so for shaman than for a druid or cleric.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As much as I value your opinion Bamce, might I respectfully suggest that the &quot;flaws&quot; are not with the graphs, but with the way the game works.  When the designers sat down and came up with these spells, they could not account for every detail of every situation that they might be used in.  Your knowledge of the game is based on your day to day experiences with using those spells in a variety of situatons, most of them unforseen by the designers.<br />
<br />
Everything that you have said thus far has reinforced the conclusion that shaman healing is inadequate.  Is this in fact what you believe? Or do you think shaman healing is fine and needs no changes?  That's what is at issue here.  My original post was meant to focus the discussion on how adequate shaman healing is relative to changes in the game such as slow mitigation.  <br />
<br />
My graphs were not meant to be realistic, but rather to recreate as much as possible the thought process the designers used when making the spells.  Regardless of how accurate the graphs are in representing what the game designers actually did to create the spells, the end result of their efforts left our healing way out of balance.<br />
<br />
I would prefer that you use your time to come up with viable suggestions for improving shaman healing than to waste time attacking a straw man.</div></div><hr />

with that being said,  i don't see how your graphs demonstrate an accurate description of how much shaman healing sucks,  you leave to many factors just left out.  however if you were to come back with something more concrete perhaps they would be welcomed more warmly.  just as i have poked holes into those graphs any dev or hell, anyone can see  the slanted flavor of them  will realize that was done intentionally to prove a point to your advantage  discretiting the whole attempt,  however graphs made with harder facts and much more consistancy will stand up to much rigorous investigation.<br />

Ok, here's the point of the graphs.  You're right, they're slanted to make shaman healing look as good as possible.  Despite the obvious slant, in this admittedly unrealistic situation, shamans use much more mana to heal the same amount as a druid or shaman unless the battle lasts a long time (several minutes).  So shaman healing is unbalanced even in the ideal situation where you'd expect them to look at least as good as other priests.<br />
<br />
What happens when you add realism to the situation?  Shaman healing looks even worse compared with druids and clerics.  You're absolutely right, Bamce.  We are in agreement!  <br />
<br />
There is no way in heaven or hell that someone could use the graphs to argue that shaman healing isn't broken, because every &quot;flaw&quot; they could possibly come up with would only make shaman healing look worse.<br />
<br />
Now, what I'd really like to do is for Sony to pay me to collect and analyze data from their computer files on thousands of encounters with shamans healing and debuffing and compare them to druid and cleric healing.  But take it from a professional statistician, if I did that, there would be a lot more graphs for you to enjoy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">I don't know what raids you are on Grimrod, but on the raids I am on, when we have already 3 shamans, it's too much. 2 shamans can easily buff whole raid and do whatever shamanistic duties are needed (done plenty as only one as well), 3rd shaman (and more) have literally nothing to do. What, nuke the mobs? Don't make me laugh, our nukes are pathetic (low damage, helluva long cast time, big mana) and DoT's/rains are mostly resisted a lot or mobs are even totally IMMUNE to poison/disease. So, we basically don't have anything, almost, to contribute when it comes to the damage. With the amount of mobs, which mitigate the slow so much, or are totally immune to it, usefulness drops even more. Heals are so little that hybrid classes outheal us. This is NOT normal, when I as a shaman am outhealed, be it HoT heal or whatever, by my &quot;hybrid&quot; offspring class, or outbuffed/outdebuffed, as a matter of fact. This is not normal that if there's already more then 2 shamans on the raid, these shamans have really NOTHING to contribute to the raid and are mostly a waste of group spots. We don't have the utility or flexibility to offer.<br />
<br />
Your point of view is so typical, what I have seen in many occasions: &quot;if things are good for me, then they must be good for all and if things are not good for all, then all suck!&quot;. Heck, when I am ONLY shaman on raid, then I can't complain either, as I am busy and whatever I do, it's needed. When I am 3rd (or more) shaman on the raid, I have nothing to offer to the raid, really. Only the spot heals for my group, in hopes that NONE of my group ever catches any aggro, because if they do, they bite the dust.</div></div><hr />

Yesterday I raided TT (PoNB) with NINE other shaman in the raid (6 of which are in my guild)....I pretty much stuck myself on autofollow on my alt warrior and became his heal/FA bitch because there was nothing much to do. Although that amount of shammys is unusual on our raids - we generally have about 4-5, leading to competition on who can slow first, and who can get summoned the most on trash mobs. We have plenty of clerics/druids on our raids, so healing is pretty much covered, leaving very little for us to do once the mobs are malos'd/slowed/crippled</div></div><hr />
