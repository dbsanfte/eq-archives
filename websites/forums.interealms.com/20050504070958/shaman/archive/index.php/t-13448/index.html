<br />
Specifically, at the very bottom:<br />
Additionally, we're looking at the concerns from players about their spells, and changing them where appropriate.  The goal here is to remove annoying issues with spells, not necessarily to increase caster power overall. <br />
<br />
Time to get started on listing our concerns with the annoying issues with our spells. Do it in this thread. Keep it constructive. Don't slam each other, but feel free to discuss others points of view. No wishful thinking, keep it real, concise and to the point. Thanks for your time brothers.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
* Spells having to reload if you cast them on a target which gets out of range before spell finishes casting. <br />
<br />
There is no reason this should be so. Especially annoying on spells like avatar with its huge reload time, and with malo/s which needs to land asap on big mobs.<br />
<br />
* Cannot land torpor over bard speed.<br />
<br />
* The chance of being interupted when casting AA abilities seems just a bit out of whack. I know spells that are not naturally inherent to your class are harder to channel, but virulent paralysis and spirit call are just rediculously easy to have interupted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">How about, having a decent chance to obtain Malo/Torpor?  Enough with the 50-100k spells that are 4 expansions old!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Was just talking to a guildie about something along these lines tonight:<br />
<br />
$@*%*$@#&amp; INVISIBILITY and it's 3 second durations!! Could we please get an improved invisibility for shamans? Clerics have improved invis to undead. Druids have improved camo. In fact, they both have AA abilities giving them innate camo/invis to undead...0 mana, instant cast, 3 second re-use. I really dont think it's a game-breaker to let shamans have this also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">oOOo fixed duration invis would rock.  i bet i would still find a way to break it but thats not the point</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>maccuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Sorta Spell related but Spirit Call not resetting if a target is mezzed or you have a PC targeted. Nothing like using the AA to have your puppies sitting about doing nothing or in the case of a PC target by accident no puppies at all and it not resetting.<br />
<br />
Malicious Decay still gives a spell not ready message if you chain cast it...<br />
<br />
Also semi spell related is losing the ability to slam in bear form...<br />
<br />
The short range on Blood of Nadox and the fact you cant cast it on other groups. It should be Group version 2.<br />
<br />
Being able to shrink/group shrink within a raid not just a group.<br />
<br />
Being able to grow inside a raid.<br />
<br />
Lack of a group Grow spell.<br />
<br />
The insane recast time and relatively short duration (not to mention lack of sta) on VoB basically making the lower level (albeit hard to obtain) Primal Essense a better choice due to sta, duration, and recast issues.<br />
The entire spell line could stand to be retuned.<br />
<br />
Talisman of Alacrity having a small ae range and only being group version 1.<br />
<br />
Acumen of Dar Khura having a small ae range.<br />
<br />
Lack of a timed self only invis for the Shaman class.<br />
No aa. No spell yet almost every other class that gets invis gets a timed invis.<br />
<br />
Spirit Quickening being almost totally useless.<br />
<br />
Recast times on Scale of the Wolf and Spirit of the Cheetah.<br />
These spells are rarely used because of this.<br />
<br />
Lack of group Avatar.<br />
<br />
Lack of Group Primal Essense.<br />
<br />
Cast time on Cold based nukes are too high.<br />
<br />
Too much aggro on Tnarg.<br />
<br />
Too much aggro on Cripple and way too hard to land.<br />
<br />
Damage is too low on Poison based nukes.<br />
<br />
Also only somewhat spell related.<br />
Saryn's Venom Focus effect is way to limited.<br />
It should at least effect Blood of Saryn if not our entire poison line including AEs.<br />
<br />
Will harmful spells that were nerfed off Affliction efficancy ever being given their own focus as was being discussed????<br />
<br />
DoTs over all need to be re-evaluated completely.<br />
Issues such as aggro, durations, mana cost, and damage done need to be addressed.<br />
<br />
Already mentioned somewhat but stacking issues on Bih Li, SoW, Torpor with Selo's. It should work more the way haste does that they all stack but only the higher run speed (or lower for Torpor) takes effect.<br />
That way Torpor will land with Selo on but not give you the increased speed of Selo until it is off.<br />
The attack buf from Bih Li will still be present even if using Selo for faster speed. This should also be taken into consideration for SoE which often gets stripped off on no lev zones etc. IE Bih Lih (or SoW) should stack with SoE not be overwirtten by it the same way haste and lev spells will stack.<br />
<br />
Also in addition to the already oor problem their needs to be no recast on did not take hold.<br />
<br />
I know some will likely disagree or have other stuff to add this is only my personal list of annoyances ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Talisman of alacrity being 50% haste and not 60%<br />
<br />
Talis/str of the diaku still being useless unless your melees are very poorly equiped, I still stand by my guns saying that one should be a str/atk buff and the other should be dex/archery.  Agi is a borderline useless spell also, I don't remember signing up to be the master of wasting buff slots, so make my buffs actually be useful pls =)<br />
<br />
Reinstate Khuras mending pls =(<br />
<br />
Fix the balance between the ench and shaman elemental chest piece effects unless you really want to see shaman go down the same road enchanters did with Velious once the BP's start becoming readily obtainable.<br />
<br />
And 3 little ideas I had.<br />
<br />
Give shaman cast avatar a visible effect on the player its cast on, it would make it a lot less stressful to use in groups if I could actually tell who its faded on.  An illusion ala boon/tricksters or a subtle particle effect ala Torpor (Just toned down to be less obstructing and laggy).<br />
<br />
Give druids and shaman the ability to res a corpse with ZERO xp return, it simply means that if your deep in a dungeon with either a druid or shaman as your healer and no pally, if someone dies the group isnt stuck, you still loose the xp, but at least the group can get going again without all the hassle that usually ends in the group breaking up.<br />
<br />
And one interesting idea that may or may not work...<br />
<br />
How about a buff that we can cast on 1 person at a time only that tries to equalise mana between the 2 people, just at a capped rate, think a dot version of Divine Arbitration thats constantly going, but doing mana instead of hps, IE, shaman casts it on there group's cleric, if the cleric has 60m and the shaman is Fom, the dot takes say 20 mana a tick from the shaman and gives it to the cleric, if the cleric is fom and the shaman is oom, it would work the other way draining the cleric and giving mana to the shaman.<br />
<br />
Obviously to stop issues with excessive mana regeneration, it would need to have stacking issues.  And logically I'd say it would be best if it didn't stack with the clarity line.<br />
<br />
What would this achive?<br />
<br />
Imho it would mean that the shaman would be a viable alternative to an ench in a melee heavy group, its depressing as hell to see a your enchanterless group grind to a halt every 3 hours because the cleric can't face life without mana regen buffs.<br />
<br />
I think it would be balanced though, shaman tend to have smaller manapools, and hence run lom VERY fast compared to other priests, in pop, chances are if the group pulls 4 mobs, I'll have blown at least half my mana getting them under control and parked, during that time the cleric will likely be getting drained of mana by me, so using the ability would need some care.<br />
<br />
For raids it would simply give excess shaman something to do, pick a cleric, stick the mana bond on them and know that you are at least doing something useful with all that mana.<br />
<br />
Thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">MAKE STATS MEANINGFUL<br />
<br />
Yes verant... you heard me. Stats are useless aside from dexterity. there is a solution to BOTH your melee DPS problems, and your spell problems! Make STR, and Agility actually DO something! instead of being usless numbers that add absolutely pathetic amounts of atk or ac, make them increase maximum damage or the frequency of max hits by a NOTICABLE amount and make Agility mitigate small percentages of damage.<br />
<br />
Shamans are supposed to be master buffers, only surpassed by clerics. But instead, our buffs are nothing spectacular. The only reason people want it is because it's 544 hp that stacks with Virtue. thts 1/3 of the hitpoints that virtue gives... which is supposedly justified by the wonderful stat mods. Except they do nothing.<br />
<br />
Lower stat caps, make innate stats harder to gain and stat buffs from items and buffs should make a noticeable difference. on ALL stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Make rabid bear useful and give us Bash! I miss not being a melee shaman, would it really hurt anything for us to melee as well as a cleric? <br />
<br />
Triple the duration and mana cost of haste and regen spells, god they're annoying to keep up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Shaman ornate boots should have MP4 like the other priest boots.<br />
<br />
Group shrink REALLY needs to be /tgb'able, even if it's a confirm window.  While you're at it, regular shrink should act the same.<br />
<br />
Remove the &quot;nerf&quot; on cast times.  When they fixed the insta-click refresh bug, you now have a 2.25 second delay when you memorize new spells that was never there before, and I don't see much reason for keeping.  You couldn't forget and re-memorize a spell in less than 2 seconds anyways to get around it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Spell recast time not met&quot; needs to be fixed.  I remember when they started putting these things in, and it's never worked right since they did it.  There are still issues with casting fast spells that make it think you're abusing the system.  I often have the problem when hitting can5 then can4 immediately afterward as well.<br />
<br />
No focus effects for debuffs.  What happened to this?<br />
<br />
<br />
As for this thread, they're looking for ways to &quot;remove annoyances&quot; with spells.  Not add spells to us, or to rework the entire stat system.</div></div><hr />

Nice wish list going here - but what does it have to do with the quote in the initial post?<br />
<br />
The point made a out spell reset times when target moves out of range seems to fit.  The idea of having group shrink /tgb fits.<br />
<br />
The rest are good points, but not relevant to &quot;remove annoying issues with spells&quot;<br />
<br />
So - how about the ability to duck out of a spell while mounted on a horse/drogmor?  That annoys me.</div></div><hr />

Oh yea, been meaning to post this here... I've been having folks feedback the following idea, hope you'll join in:<br />
<br />
Right clicking on a buff that's on your character should have a countdown to expiration timer on it.<br />
<br />
(gawd wouldn't that rock? You'd know if that advertised ext kei really was ext for starters!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Torrent of Poison and Tears of Saryn have absolutely RIDICULOUS resist rates.

If I don't bother to debuff with sinia, forget it, all or most of the rain waves WILL be resisted.  On light blues even!<br />
<br />
Ok that's my bitch of the day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Annoying issues for me:<br />
<br />
Not being able to shrink outside group.<br />
<br />
Infusion of Spirit stacks with Kraggs, dex, str, but doesn't stack with Harnessing or Focus of Spirit.<br />
<br />
The improved invis would be nice too - mages are the only other caster that doesn't get one, though I think they need it more than we do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What about the bug, when you are re buffing somone right when there old buffs are wearing out, and they dont get the buff while still you loss the mana?<br />
<br />
And just incase anyone missed it.<br />
<br />
What about the bug, when you are re buffing somone right when there old buffs are wearing out, and they dont get the buff while still you loss the mana?<br />
<br />
This ranks right up there as one of the must frustrating bugs going as far as buffs go.  Really is long overdue for a fix =(<br />
<br />
*Edit*<br />
<br />
Mages do get a fixed duration invis.<br />
<br />
http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=2537&amp;source=Live<br />
<br />
Shaman and beastlords are the only 2 invis capable classes in the game without a fixed duration invis or something similar unless I am mistaken?(Innate camo for rangers, CoS for SK's).<br />
<br />
*edit 2*<br />
<br />
Infusion of Sprit should be put on the table of spells that a shaman can recieve from Ethereals also.</div></div><hr />

<br />
3. Replace the Agility line of spells with something useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>vaniar luclin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Id say basically they need to revisit the Shaman class completly. <br />
<br />
Let me take you back to Luclin and lets follow the nerfs and reasons.<br />
<br />
Nerfed DoT effectivness due to resists and long durations to get this &quot;Uber damage to mana ratio&quot; alot of this was caused by soloing shaman (nothing wrong with it just sayin why it happend) that were able to DoT the crap out of high XP mobs and use slow/ topor/ canni to basically maintain a solid DPS through an entire encounter with no chance to fail besides LD.<br />
<br />
DDs were increased but also given longer cast times and poor mana damage ratios because Nuking isnt &quot;suppose to be&quot; our strong suit. This was a toy they added to make us feel less abused in a DoT stacking situation where our dots were highly resisted or less desirable than druid / necro dots. <br />
<br />
Rains have always been crappy cause of target restrictions max of 4 actual hits on a spell.... so you can hit 4 mobs once or 2 mobs twice or 1 mob three times and resists count toward the total. We lack a true AE, even our slow is limited to 5 total targets and if your inrange you are automatically one of these targets. This sticks us in the peanut gallery for any situation that stratigically calls for AE and thier are many.<br />
<br />
Invis we have just always been overlooked as the only class that can cast it but doesnt get a self only X duration invis.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now we enter PoP<br />
<br />
Basically they nerfed our heal because the argument that Slow = heal basically. 75% slow + topor = full health in most situations so logic says we dont need a 4k plus heal.<br />
<br />
BUT at the same time they nerf slow to the point of making us essentially useless vs BST, Chanter, and bard who contribute much more to an XP OR raid situation than we do (charm, mez, DPS, rune, AE songs etc) 90% of all mobs tier 3 or higher are mitigated to an average of partially slowed which is near as we can figure 50% of our full capacity to slow or approximatly 37% slowed. (this varies from agian best guesses of mostly slowed 50% total, and slightly slowed approx 19%) <br />
 Our slows also have a very odd differnce in being resisted compared to Beast and Chanter slows, so we are actually behind on not just how effective the slow is, but having a lesser chance to stick it at all.<br />
<br />
DoT damage: Our dmg is increased but when you look at Shaman effectivness against other caster classes our DPS even if they go to full duration dont come close to Druids, Mage, Wiz or Necros. Im talkin Mana/ damage/ duration of spell/ duration of recycle and taking into account dogdog DPS, and dont even try to take DD vs DD cause we are the weakest of all those classes in this regard, especially since we are limited to one elemental type of damage (cold), and poison which we all know is the worst resist of all on generic mobs.<br />
<br />
Mitigation of damage: We are given a few AAs (that ALL casters get) to help some with mitigation but we have no inherant ability to mitigate beyond that of any other caster that has FD, Rune, DA, Mez or Snare (I say this cause you have to option to run and not have it spontaneously drop 1 tick after cast). We arent given Defense bonuses even though our spells lead to a confrontational style of play. We arent given Rune, DA even though our abilities tend to lead to immense amounts of agro. We arent given FD though I understand this its still a way to get mob damage off you. We arent given a method of Crowd control beyond a root that can and often does break within 20 sec of cast.<br />
<br />
Melee: We arent given Bash though some how some one decided that a class with 75% of the races having inherant (though untrainable) slam would be over powered with an actual skill that would help with a confrontational style of play. We are exactly the same in melee as a druid or cleric and little better than Int casters, however given the abilities of these other classes the only class other than a shaman with a confrontational type of abilities is a cleric, but most of thier strength lies in being an exceptional behind the tank support class.<br />
<br />
Buffs: Our buffs are pathetic upgrades from lvl 60 especially compared to similar classes or useless to begin with. We either share our buffs with other classes or they are so lacking that the only reason they are prefered over a beastlord is because we can do using less slots.<br />
<br />
Group healing: We lack even an AA heal similar to Spirit of the wood, Ethereal elixir, or paragon of spirit. <br />
<br />
Healing: The changes in Quiesence were nice but should have been accompanied with an increase in the amount of the heal, and dont worry about mana regen/ canni issue because we have nothing to do with all our mana anyway besides span an already underpowered heal. Right in line with this mana regen issue is the fact that all classes got a Mana regen buff or 2 in some cases but our Canni remains the same as it was at lvl 60.<br />
<br />
So now we are left with mitigated slow (basically equal to bst and chanters) lack of DD heals (that was justified by pointing to the potential of a now worthless slow)  lack of group heals, lacking DDs, lacking dots, and no reason to try and compensate with melee. Taking hundreds of AAs just to reach a lvl to be competitive with other healing classes and still being underpowered and useless on a raid for little more than Buff once an hour and malos.<br />
<br />
Basically if you gave Beastlords Fo7 and malos you could do way with shaman all together and give them something to do on raids.<br />
<br />
Shaman are HORRIBLY screwed up right now, and before you go talkin about how much you do in a raid, think for a second what it would really mean to a mob encounter if you didnt do anything but Malos, slow (try to), cripple (if a chanter doesnt) and canni up your mana. If it werent for many people not realizing that shaman slow isnt much better than Bst slow we wouldnt get groups at all anymore, cause we dont bring anything constructive to any situation anymore.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Good feedback and many great ideas in here. However, I think many of you are getting lost in wouldn't-it-be-sweet-if land. It seems pretty clear from SOE's statement that they will NOT be adressing class balance/retuning issues. They are cleaning up on annoying issues with spells. Stuff that gets you pulling your beard out and kilt off in frustration because the spell quite obviously is not working properly. <br />
<br />
While it would certainly be nice to have shorter cast times on our nukes and more damage on our dots, this is NOT the issue here. We are looking for spell issues which border on being bugs.<br />
<br />
Think bug. Not rebalancing.<br />
<br />
Keep it coming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">&quot;Also semi spell related is losing the ability to slam in bear form...&quot;<br />
<br />
This isn't a bug.  Bear form changes you to medium size, and medium size creatures can't use slam (because the game defines it as a large race only ability).  If you want to make your slam work in bearform, just cast grow on yourself after you cast bearform.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Though of course Loramin, us haveing bash would fix that, increase the fun factor, and not change game balance since we already have slam.<br />
<br />
<br />
Recast on Spirit of Cheetah is insane, No matter what you think, this is not a Divine Aura type of spell.  This could be a good travel spell, but it sure as hell ain't going to save your life.<br />
<br />
The % of increase in speed with Spirit of Scale is laughable.<br />
<br />
Lack of early dex buffs, lvl 1 you get a dex buff.  Then not of another one till 24, then another one the very next spell lvl.  Inbetween 1 and 24 people are working their early weapon skills and need a little help in the dex area for learning, not for dmg.<br />
<br />
Removing the Group restriction on Shrink would be very handy, I am unsure on how this would effect Greif Play though.  Making some spells Group/Raid only would be perfect.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Uhm, Bears are not on the small size if you havent noticed (IRL or in game).<br />
Bears that are shrunk are still larger than shrunk Ogres.<br />
Barbarians can wear both MEDIUM and large sized gear.<br />
Last I checked casting grow had no effect on Bear Form. (Will double check later to make sure)<br />
Not to mention I know for a fact Ogres do not lose the ability when shrunk (Have an Ogre Warrior as well).<br />
<br />
Losing a racial ablity we paid an exp penalty for due to shape change is a bit silly.<br />
Do Trolls and Iksar lose their regen in bear form? Nope. <br />
Do any races lose the ability to bash in non-human forms?<br />
No, they are not technically using a shield anymore but they can still bash.<br />
<br />
We should not lose the ability to Slam (it is more than just a racial thing when you figure in the exp penalty to have it we should never lose it) in any form but Bear form is the most annoying as it is our self only spell.<br />
Yes I do consider that annoying and a somewhat a spell related issue.<br />
<br />
While they are at it I think we also lose the ability mounted (which isnt really spell related other than mounts use a buff icon and basically are an illusion spell).<br />
Again we should not lose it period. I can somewhat understand mounts though.<br />
I just cant help that think though that ramming a big arse horse/lizard into something is still going to hurt for at least the 1 damage slam does and still possibly stun you ;)<br />

an·noy·ing<br />
adj. <br />
Causing vexation or irritation<br />
<br />
That is a pretty broad range and very open to personal opinion.<br />
My personal opinion is this would pertain mainly to existing spell lines.<br />
Not adding new abilities/spelss but fixing:<br />
stacking, cast times, damage done, making current spells work better, outright bugs, and even the lack of group version of existing lines I would personally feel is in that realm.</div></div><hr />

Not sure if it's what you ment, but before you can grow in bear form, you have to shrink first, then grow x2.</div></div><hr />

Try to be the main healer in an experience or raid group at level 65 with Quiessence, Tnargs, and Kraggs.  Watch the kill rate of the group plummet while you desparately cannibalize while trying to keep the main tank out of the purple club.<br />
<br />
Annoying?  Try moving from group to group to cast group shrink, then having the rangers and encanters complain that they didn't want to be shrunk.<br />
<br />
Annoying?  That's when you watch your mana drop faster than you can recover it after constantly casting short duration, second rate haste spells when you're unfortunate enough to get into a group with no enchanter.<br />
<br />
Annoying?  Here's annoying.  Not one, not two, but THREE stupid, useless, waste of time class specific AA's: Rabid Bear, Alchemy Mastery, and to add insult to injury, Hastened Rabidity.<br />

Annoying?  Casting a poison rain or &quot;AE&quot; slow and having them resisted by the mobs but hit you is like scraping your nails on a chalkboard.<br />
<br />
Annoying?  How about running through a dungeon thinking you're invis'd when poof, all the sudden everything sees you.<br />

Annoying?  Annoying is when the one spell that presumably is your speciality is &quot;partially&quot; or &quot;barely&quot; effective on mob after mob.<br />
<br />
Annoying?  How about being the LOWEST effective DPS class in the game.  Stacking dots is NOT effective when you're summoned and beat to a pulp by a mob on which your slow was only &quot;partially&quot; effective, or when it takes you so long to cast a dot that the mob is dead two ticks after your seven tick dot hits.<br />
<br />
Annoying?  One phrase that really grates on my nerves is &quot;the ultimate melee buff.&quot;  You know which spells I'm talking about, don't you?  I love our MAs, but there's no way I'm going to spam AvatarXX on them since they now have better weapons than their Primals.<br />

Why is it, when spell recovery time is not yet met, that the spell gems are already active again? I swear i get crazy someday, when reading 'spell recovery time not met blah blah'.<br />
<br />
Especially funny, when a bit hectic and you try with a CH-macro:<br />
- &quot;Casting iCH on tank_01 stay in range&quot;<br />
- spell recovery ....<br />
- &quot;Casting iCH on ....<br />

- &quot;Casting iCH on ... - landed<br />
Finally /sigh.<br />
<br />

When it's a synchronization problem -that would be my guess-, do the spell timing LOCAL, not on the server and be done with it.<br />
<br />
Oh forgot:<br />
REDUCE THE RECAST TIME ON RABID BEAR $%$%&amp;$&amp;.<br />
<br />
It was (i think) supposed to be a fun spell to help shaman with meleeing (Hey look, the bear is going crazy again), not that we spend our whole career as melees .... With the actual recast and the only mediocre power of the ability this AA is just crap.<br />
And the AA ability to reduce recast of rabid bear (oh sorry, you have to waste even more AA points on a melee ability, you rarely use) is a sick joke.<br />

<br />
ERRORS/BUGS<br />
<br />
Focus of Soul [Level 62]<br />
Lasts 1:20:00, when previous Focus of Spirit lasts 1:40:00. Focus of Soul needs to be upped to 1:40:00.<br />
<br />
Focus of the Seventh [Level 65]<br />
Lasts 1:20:00, when previous Khura's Focusing lasts 1:40:00. Focus of the Seventh needs to be upped to 1:40:00.<br />
<br />
Focus of Spirit [Level 60]<br />
-Has less hp than Khura's Focusing (405 Focus vs. 430 Khura's at level 60) which makes the spell Focus of Spirit unable to take hold over Khura's Focusing the group version.<br />
-Cast time is 13 seconds long. This should be 8 seconds like level 62 Focus of Soul.<br />
<br />
Khura's Focusing [Level 60]<br />
Cast time is 26 seconds long. This should be 13 seconds like level 65 Focus of the Seventh.<br />
<br />
Talisman of the Tribunal [Level 62]<br />
Lasts 1:00:00, when previous Talisman of Epuration lasts 2:30:00.<br />
<br />
Talisman of Alacrity [Level 64]<br />
-Name should be Talisman of Celerity if it is going to be 50% haste. (Or maybe Talisman of Advanced Celerity due to its longer duration than Celerity).<br />
<br />
Talisman of the Serpent [Level 58]/Unfailing Reverence [Level 59]<br />
-Unfailing Revenerence increases cha by 55, while Talisman of the Serpent increases cha by 40. Talisman of the Serpent should increase cha to 55 also. Though Unfailing Reverence should be moved down a level, and Talisman of the Serpent should be moved up a level (they should switch levels required to use because you should get the single target buff first).<br />
<br />
Endurance of the Boar [Level 62]<br />
-Buff Wears Off message is &quot;Your health fades&quot; when it should be &quot;Your endurance fades&quot; like the group version Talisman of the Boar.<br />
<br />
Talisman of the Boar [Level 63]<br />
-Buff Cast On Other message is &quot;Someone looks healthy&quot; when it should be &quot;Someone grunts&quot; like the single target version Endurance of the Boar.<br />
<br />
Agility of the Wrulan [Level 61]<br />
-Mana cost is 150. It should be 175 like the other single target stat buffs level 61+.<br />
<br />
Strength of the Diaku [Level 63]<br />
-Buff stat increases are +35 str/+28 dex, when Talisman of Diaku grants +45 str/+35 dex. Strength of the Diaku needs to be upped to its group equivalent, Talisman of the Diaku.<br />
<br />
Talisman of the Diaku [Level 64]<br />
-Buff Cast On You message is &quot;The strength of the Diaku fills your arms&quot; when it should be &quot;The rage of the Diaku fills your arms&quot; like the single target Strength of the Diaku.<br />
<br />
True Spirit [Level 61]/Spirit of the Howler [Level 55]<br />
-True Spirit (level 61) costs 650 mana to cast, which is the same as Spirit of the Howler (level 55). The mana cost of Spirit of the Howler should be lowered to 575 to scale with the rest of the spirit wolf pet summoning spells.<br />
<br />
Cannibalize 3 [Level 54]<br />
-Fizzle Adj. is 15. Because this spell is cast so much, this is too high a fizzle rate. It needs to be lowered to that of the other Cannibalize spells.<br />
<br />
Replenishment [Level 61]/Blessing of Replenishment [Level 63]<br />
-Replenishment costs 275 mana, when Regrowth (previous) costs 300 mana. Replenishment should have a mana cost of 325 to scale with the other spells, and adhere to the &quot;group version of regen costs double mana as single target&quot; rule. (325 mana doubled is 650 mana, which is Blessing of Replenishment.)<br />
<br />
Harnessing of Spirit [Level 49]<br />
-Cast time may be too high at 10 seconds compared to Focus spells. Perhaps 6 seconds cast time? Since shamans have to cast this on everyone in group there should be a group version at level 49 also. This would ease the hassles of buffing with this spell.<br />
-Recast time (7.5 seconds) is too long considering shamans have to buff everyone in group with this. Make it 2.25 seconds recast time.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
ANNOYING SPELL ISSUES/NOT NECESSARILY BUGS/ERRORS<br />
<br />
Blood of Saryrn [Level 65]<br />
-Comparing to the necro equivalent, Blood of Thule (both level 65)....Blood of Saryrn is MORE MANA, HIGHER CAST TIME, LESS DAMAGE, and MORE RESISTED (necro Blood of Thule has -50 resist adjust, shaman Blood of Saryrn is 0). Both have the same duration of 7 ticks.<br />
Shamans have always been &quot;highest damage DOTs, but less DOT lines overall than necros.&quot; Therefore, the damage needs to be upped on Blood of Saryrn either with a DD component initially (to keep our individuality as shaman DOTers), or upped damage a tick.<br />
<br />
Breath of Ultor [Level 64]<br />
-Many shamans may/will disagree with me on this, but I feel that with initial DD components on our DOTs make us individuals, and not just &quot;another DOTing class.&quot; It was always the shaman trademark persay, to have a DD component in our DOTs. Many shamans complained it broke root too often. This may be so, but it would be nice if we could keep some individuality. So in my opinion, both Blood of Saryrn and Breath of Ultor need DD components.<br />
<br />
Blast of Venom [Level 54]/Spear of Torment [Level 61]<br />
-340 mana, 680 DD. Then Spear of Torment (the upgrade at 61) is 275 mana, 675 DD. <br />
Blast of Venom needs to be a 300 mana, 640 DD. Spear of Torment needs to be a 330 mana, 800 DD.<br />
<br />
-Fizzle adjust 25 on Blast of Venom, the spell fizzles too much.<br />
<br />

Ugh, but DISAGREE with the initial DD component. Just look at it this way, that a 60 plus shaman finally figured out how to cast a DOT more efficient and safe ... So no initial DD for me, thanks.<br />
<br />
Just for the fun of it (bear with me, i am bored):<br />
<br />
Strength of the Diaku:<br />
Stats are +35 STR/+28 DEX, where Talisman of Diaku grants +45 STR/+35 DEX.<br />

Replenishment [Level 61]/Blessing of Replenishment [Level 63]<br />
-Replenishment costs 275 mana, when Regrowth (previous) costs 300 mana. Replenishment should have a mana cost of 325 to scale with the other spells, and adhere to the &quot;group version of regen costs double mana as single target&quot; rule. (325 mana doubled is 650 mana, which is Blessing of Replenishment.)<br />
<br />
<br />
Just wanted to note, regrowth only takes 250mana (unless they've changed it since I last looked)<br />
<br />
Also, I REALLY want to reiterate the issue with rains spells not being able to hit below a certain % health of the mob.  I seem to recall a long time ago (before Velious release) VI saying that the issue was that the rain spell couldn't make the kill shot, as it counted as neutral damage and hence the corpse would poof. Something along those lines anyway.<br />
<br />
Also with regards to rain spells, the damage that you personally take as a target, doesn't add into the count of targets hit.  Ever stood next to a mob (for whatever reason) and watched three rains hit it, and have yourself hit 3 times by the rain too?  That's 6 hits, more than a rain should do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Remove Diaku please. It was useless when it was 2 spells, and it's useless as one. <br />

Harnessing of Spirit does not need a group version to &quot;reduce hassle&quot;. At 49, be glad they gave us that spell, instead of demanding more. Sheesh, why dont they just give us a spell that adds to all stats and make it a 4 hour duration from the get-go? pffft<br />

Other than that, it's all just hair-splitting.</div></div><hr />

Fixing that buff wearing off bug that's been mentioned already.<br />
<br />
This bug: You begin casting a spell when your target is in range. Your target runs out of range. The cast finishes and you get a message that your target was out of range. But your mana is lost, and your spell gems are grayed out as if your cast was successful. This is particularly annoying on high mana cost spells, or spells with a long recast time (Avatar line).</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're right... that many shaman will disagree, that is. You're wrong on the individual thing. Actually, considering that the necros get all our disease and poison DOTs up to Plague and Envenomed Bolt, rather than individualizing them to the shaman class, what the upfront DD mostly did was to make our DOTs among the most resisted damage spells in the game. <br />
<br />
Making the DOT last longer is not a solution either. At 26 ticks (2:36 minutes!), BoU is already freakishly long... Hell, in raids, I use it to time when I need to recast Slow. Disease Slow MOB? Cast slow, cast Ulthor, recast slow when Ulthor fades. Magic? Cast Ulthor, Cast Ulthor again, recast slow when second Ulthor fade.<br />
<br />
As for Blood of Saryrn, all that a longer duration would do it make it more likely not to run full length in groups, thus wasting mana. Instead, to put those DOTs back into balance with the necro ones, they would need to up the damage per tick by about 15 to 20%. Or lower the mana cost by as much.</div></div><hr />

The rarest spells are shaman spells, there is no balance issue for this as far as I can see.  When balanceing a casting class, it is considered that the class will have access to all spells, if key spells are un-obtainable then those who are unable to obtain their spells are not balanced, therefore the key spells of Malo and Torpor should drop much more than they currently do in order to balance the shaman class.</div></div><hr />

The only other issue I have is with all the shrink/grow nonsense.  It seems like the shaman community is pretty united in what we want: Translocate style shrink/grow boxes that otherwise work like Khura's Focusing in terms of Target Group Buffung and Mass Group Buffing.  As far as I know, this would make the vast majority of shaman happy, and (again AFAIK) nobody else in the game would really give a fig.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agreed, that may be the reasoning behind it.<br />
<br />
But why not just clear ONLY the spell slots containing spells too high for your lvl (f.e. all 65 spells, when you delevel from 65 to 64)?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">The DD on our DoTs never had a second separate resist check.<br />
<br />
And that ex cathedra statement is backed by... ?<br />
<br />
Plus, anyway, it's not question of a 'second, separate' resist check. It's a question that, instead of having a simple 'all-or-nothing' check (like debuffs and DOTs without upfront DD have), our pre-60 DOTs get the 'all-or-partial-or-nothing' check because of the upfront DD. But since since you can't do a 'partial' of the DOT component, those translate into full resist.<br />
<br />
That has been actually demonstrated, you know? simple too. Find a low level, moderatly poison resistant MOB type. Cast a poison DD at them, keeping track of the ratios between full damage, partials and full resist, then do the same with Bane, then with Blood. The resist ratio on Bane will be close to the combined partial and full resist of the poison DD, while the resist ratio on blood will be closer to the full resist ratio of the DD.<br />
<br />
It's not like it's new either. Clerics stuns and enchanters DD used to have the same problem because there is no partial resisting on the stun components. Those got fixed though.<br />
<br />
And, regardless of wheter this could be fixed for our DOT, non-root breaking DOTs are much too useful to give up. Again, up the damage per tick or lower the man cost... don't screw us up with another upfront DD.</div></div><hr />

The DD on our DoTs never had a second separate resist check.<br />

<br />
&quot;And that ex cathedra statement is backed by... ?&quot;<br />
<br />
Let's see...<br />
<br />
How many times have you scored a critical on the DD part of the DoT?<br />
Never you say? Pretty weird, huh?<br />
<br />
&quot;Plus, anyway, it's not question of a 'second, separate' resist check. It's a question that, instead of having a simple 'all-or-nothing' check (like debuffs and DOTs without upfront DD have), our pre-60 DOTs get the 'all-or-partial-or-nothing' check because of the upfront DD. But since since you can't do a 'partial' of the DOT component, those translate into full resist.&quot;<br />
<br />
Again, if you had a slight clue, you would know that if such a check was in place(partial-all-nothing)for the DD part of the DoTs, you would be crit'ing, which you do NOT.<br />
<br />
&quot;That has been actually demonstrated, you know? simple too. Find a low level, moderatly poison resistant MOB type. Cast a poison DD at them, keeping track of the ratios between full damage, partials and full resist, then do the same with Bane, then with Blood. The resist ratio on Bane will be close to the combined partial and full resist of the poison DD, while the resist ratio on blood will be closer to the full resist ratio of the DD.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh, that has been demonstrated...where exactly?<br />
<br />
You are talking out of the ass and making up things.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not like it's new either. Clerics stuns and enchanters DD used to have the same problem because there is no partial resisting on the stun components. Those got fixed though.&quot;<br />
<br />
In the case of the Enchanter DD...well it's a DD, makes sense that it has a DD check, duh.<br />
Clerics have always been able to score critical hits on the DD portion of the stun. And again, we do NOT ever crit on the DD portion of our DoT's<br />
<br />
Btw, i am in no way advocating reinstating the DD to our DoT's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">My largest concern is Dots not being as good as they once were, especially after the AA ( critical blast ) came out.<br />
<br />
- alot of spell casters has their DD spells close to the same mana efficiency as our dots. And with the AA critical blast now, they can not only be ALOT more mana efficient as our dots, but they can also deal a whole lot more dmg.<br />
<br />
- Why isn't there an AA to increase our dmg output on our dots like there is for all DD spells (which makes our dots obsolete ) ?<br />
<br />
- And the agro check is very bad compaired to dmg/time.  Our dots are meant to deal &quot; damage over time &quot; .  So why is it, that i agro less when doing more dmg at once ( rain spells, DD ) then i do with 1 dot that cannot nearly do as much dmg at once. think about it !<br />
<br />
- Most mobs die way bofore our dots can wear off, which also makes dots not worth useing.  Our fastest/hardest dot in game (Blood of Saryrn) takes 42 seconds to be fully effective, which isnt too bad exept for the fact that you have to dot the mob right away so it will be fully effective (which agros the mob right away until its over half dead). <br />
   So what are we suposed do with :Breath of Ultor: which takes 2.6 MINUITES to be completed, other then useing it at guild raids , in which shaman really have no time to dot mobs anyhow ?<br />
 <br />
  Personally i rarely dot anymore, ITS NOT WORTH IT.   Since i have trained my critical blast, i deal alot more dmg on 1 mob, agro less, and spend about the same mana.  Now if somehow critical blast can be applied somehow to our dots, it might be worth actually useing them once again.<br />
<br />
P.S. -Focus effects on items are not considered to be an answer to this problem, due to the fact that a focus effect item (example: Cloak of Combustion) can increase a DD by 30%, and the BEST focus effect for our dots in the game atm,( Kelp-lined Mantle) is only a 20% increase on dmg.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">And one interesting idea that may or may not work...<br />
<br />
How about a buff that we can cast on 1 person at a time only that tries to equalise mana between the 2 people, just at a capped rate, think a dot version of Divine Arbitration thats constantly going, but doing mana instead of hps, IE, shaman casts it on there group's cleric, if the cleric has 60m and the shaman is Fom<br />
Obviously to stop issues with excessive mana regeneration, it would need to have stacking issues.  And logically I'd say it would be best if it didn't stack with the clarity line.<br />
<br />
What would this achive?<br />
<br />
Imho it would mean that the shaman would be a viable alternative to an ench in a melee heavy group, its depressing as hell to see a your enchanterless group grind to a halt every 3 hours because the cleric can't face life without mana regen buffs.<br />
<br />
I think it would be balanced though, shaman tend to have smaller manapools, and hence run lom VERY fast compared to other priests, in pop, chances are if the group pulls 4 mobs, I'll have blown at least half my mana getting them under control and parked, during that time the cleric will likely be getting drained of mana by me, so using the ability would need some care.<br />
<br />
For raids it would simply give excess shaman something to do, pick a cleric, stick the mana bond on them and know that you are at least doing something useful with all that mana.<br />
<br />
Thoughts?<br />
<br />
<br />
Most clerics that I know complain that they are always FM or /tell I'm going afk for a bit take over on heals please.. Either you have crappy clerics or crappy tanks (or crappy slower but we know that can't be it ;).. I would HATE to be sitting there feeding some cleric mana like a gimp.. siludorf why don't you just sit there on your horse canni up and feed the clerics.. %t is slowed! /tell siludorf thank you for slowing, but we prefer you to be feeding the clerics mana instead, I know it sucks but we all have our roles to play to make this more successfull.. I'd rather be nuking, or have cleric be in ch line and not worry about healing anyone else.. also if it doesn't stack with VoQ.. the cleric will not be clicking it off on a raid to be fed by a shaman running off of it ;) and if it stacked then I'm a newbie but that sounds a bit too good.. ft 20 in addition to whatever VoQ does.. <br />
<br />
We did tunare with 21 ppl (20 because 1 was kiting ali) 3 clerics with paladin as MT and 1 cleric went oom near the end w/o tunare being slowed.. (bard debuff, chanter debuff, shaman debuff no malosinia) and we couldn't magic slow it.. so maybe I am spoiled with clerics that have endless mana pools and tanks that don't take damage ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
IMO the stats do not need to get any better and agi does not need to be improved.. in xp groups it's redicilous nowadays in tier 3 if the puller brings 3 after the fight everyone is 80m+.. if it gets any better everyone will be 90m+.. I have not had downtime in a LONG time, and also on raids it would be a lot easier.. we still want a challenge keep that in mind =] I like seeing &quot;NO ONE SIT&quot; because ppl are lom in a dungeon.. I don't want to see &quot;Mana check?&quot; and everyone be 90m+ because the agility mitigated a lot of damage.. like 5% is a lot of damage over the course of 2 hours with mobs hitting for 7-800.. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">Annoying?  You want annoying?  Try to be the main healer in an experience or raid group at level 65 with Quiessence, Tnargs, and Kraggs.  Watch the kill rate of the group plummet while you desparately cannibalize while trying to keep the main tank out of the purple club.<br />
<br />
Annoying?  Try moving from group to group to cast group shrink, then having the rangers and encanters complain that they didn't want to be shrunk.<br />
<br />
Annoying?  That's when you watch your mana drop faster than you can recover it after constantly casting short duration, second rate haste spells when you're unfortunate enough to get into a group with no enchanter.<br />
<br />
Annoying?  Here's annoying.  Not one, not two, but THREE stupid, useless, waste of time class specific AA's: Rabid Bear, Alchemy Mastery, and to add insult to injury, Hastened Rabidity.<br />
<br />
Annoying?  Casting a poison rain or &quot;AE&quot; slow and having them resisted by the mobs but hit you is like scraping your nails on a chalkboard.<br />
<br />
Annoying?  How about running through a dungeon thinking you're invis'd when poof, all the sudden everything sees you.<br />
<br />
Annoying?  Annoying is when the one spell that presumably is your speciality is &quot;partially&quot; or &quot;barely&quot; effective on mob after mob.<br />
<br />
Annoying?  How about being the LOWEST effective DPS class in the game.  Stacking dots is NOT effective when you're summoned and beat to a pulp by a mob on which your slow was only &quot;partially&quot; effective, or when it takes you so long to cast a dot that the mob is dead two ticks after your seven tick dot hits.<br />
<br />
Annoying?  One phrase that really grates on my nerves is &quot;the ultimate melee buff.&quot;  You know which spells I'm talking about, don't you?  I love our MAs, but there's no way I'm going to spam AvatarXX on them since they now have better weapons than their Primals.<br />
<br />
Annoyed?  You bet I'm annoyed.  I almost didn't update to LoY because I was so annoyed.  If SOE is really interested in removing these annoyances, well we've got a quite a few.<br />

In bot anyway =] I don't get partial resists except on nameds, I'm level 63 and with kei i can be the slower and haster and healer in a group of 5 melee (yes hasting sucks).. In raids everyone has a shrink device so it's only a convenience to have a shaman in group, and aa is also for casual ppl not just high end..

I would like to have fd =] or DC, but hey that's wish list stuff.. shaman with DC = a group of 6 shaman busting it out..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">How many times have you scored a critical on the DD part of the DoT?<br />
Never you say? Pretty weird, huh?<br />
<br />
So... <br />
<br />
a) our upfront DD isn't really a DD because it doesn't crit <br />
b) it doesn't check for partial resist because it isn't really a DD.<br />
<br />
to put plainly, your reasonning is based on a chain of incorrect assumptions.<br />
<br />
First, actually, our upfront DD doesn't crit because he is not part of an 'instant' duration spell. This is fairly easy to check if you care for... a casual look up of the focus effects that applies to DDs versus those that do not will show this. This is why cleric stuns or enchanter DDs crit, by the way, while our DOTs don't... their spells are instants, ours have a duration. <br />
<br />
As for your second assumption, even if you weren't just, as you so elegantly put, 'talking out of your ass', it is based on the first assumption being true. Which, of course, it is not.<br />
<br />
The partial-resist effect on multiple component spells has been brought up and discussed long ago between players and developpers. You can follow this link (http://eq.crgaming.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=3833) and check out one of the Q&amp;A on the old Developer's Corner where that issue was raised.<br />
<br />
Enchanter Stun were specifically fixed though to allow for partial resist, as announced in this patch (http://eq.crgaming.com/archives.asp?Day=4&amp;Month=9&amp;Year=2002&amp;ID=4526&amp;Action=View). So were the clerics stun around the same time. Our DOTs, on the other end, have not.<br />
<br />
Is this enough documentation for you to drop the issue, Glac, or do you want to go on making an ass of yourself on something that is not even in question except by you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>windfinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">oks i just tought of something. most all dot classes have a pet correct?<br />
<br />
well you could have a way to crit a dot then ( since thay seem so enept to be able to put in a alternet stacking data for a critted dot debuffs. ). hear me out oks when you cast a dot, the first check that is made is do you have a pet? if that is a yes then the check is made to see if you critted, IF you critted then you pet casts the exact same dot at the sucker ( this is now possable since thay alowed the same dots to stack on a mob from diffrent people ). thsi is nto a auto land spell it still must land to do damage ( kind of like partial resist crits ) now I would also say have this ability be able to activat with swarm pets as well as the normal pet ( yes 7 bloods from you might be a bit much but gives some use for the party trick ) but this may not fly. now so there you go a viable way to crit dots and makes dog dog do something more then just swing at them, and makes him more in line with his shamaistic haritage. I could almost stand with this being a AA that had pre-recs of fury3 and this would also not make the dots more useless by just extending the deration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Cubman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">Single biggest complaint...give us an upgrade to slow.  It's ludicrous that we still use a lvl 51 spell as our trademard at lvl 65.  Don't get me wrong, i'm not saying we need a bigger slow%, but how about MAKING IT LESS RESISTABLE?  I get dam tired of having to cast slow 3 and 4 times on some mobs even after Malo has landed...c'mon, if we're supposed to be the &quot;slowers&quot;, then let us do it.  It gets very aggravating to see a BL cast his slow without having to cast malo first and it sticking on the first cast, especially after mine has gotten resisted.  Heck, I'd settle for a lower % on the slow as long as it didn't get resisted as much.<br />
<br />
Only other thing...we used to be considered the battle healers...what ever happened to that?  Clerics (with their hammer) wade into battle more often than shaman do...I see something fundamentally wrong with that.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Especially in PoP grouping situations dots aren't as bad as you make them (the poison ones at least). When you really have to wait for under half health to dot, get another tank. Even the most underequipped crappy warrior should NOT need so long to build solid aggro. With a knight tanking you can dot (in my experience) right after one bub of health or even faster sometimes. For a normal, reasonably equipped warrior you may want to wait half a bub more.<br />
<br />
I agree that dots could use tweaking and nukes can be a possible alternative (when you spend the AAs  to maximise them), the situation is just not as horrible as you paint it (for poison dots). With the tons of HPs that PoP-mobs have, the efficiency of dots got even slightly better, but still needs a look into.<br />
<br />
The main issue of dots for me is also the aggro they gain. Relative to the damage we do  the aggro is too high, period.<br />
<br />
As i remember, there was an interesting thread on some melee board claiming that aggro fades over time (the amount of aggro, not the aggro itself as entry in the hate list), though i don't remember if there was some 'proof' for this. That would at least be a good theory to explain the different aggro amount of dots, as you do fresh damage to the mob every tick, meanwhile the old nuke damage of a wizzie will be 'forgotten' over time (as no wizzie in his right mind will chain nuke normally). That is just a THEORY i  read, so someone with more experience may want to fill the gaps.</div></div><hr />

You are making me laugh. No one ever denied that there used to be an issue with non-partial'able spells having a higher resist rate due to nature of the coding. What i have been saying is, that this does in no way apply to our Pre-PoP DoTs, but you seem to conveniently overlook that.<br />
<br />
In addition wheres that proof you were using as a counterargument in your first post?<br />
<br />
That has been actually demonstrated, you know? simple too. Find a low level, moderatly poison resistant MOB type. Cast a poison DD at them, keeping track of the ratios between full damage, partials and full resist, then do the same with Bane, then with Blood. The resist ratio on Bane will be close to the combined partial and full resist of the poison DD, while the resist ratio on blood will be closer to the full resist ratio of the DD.<br />

This won't be overpowering.  We can Spirit Call every 12 minutes.  What would be the problem with going Rabid ourselves every 15?  Maybe buff up the AA as well so that we do double damage (or hit for max?) each hit for the duration of being Rabid.  That might be reaching a bit, but at the least reduce the reuse timer on this.  MAJOR annoyance and the reason I haven't invested in this AA.<br />

Make Hastened rabidity allow Rabid Bear to be cast every 10 minutes.<br />

I have provided reference and documentation. You have not. I have also provided you with a simple test methodology, not as a reference but as an exercise for personal edification. You have spouted incoherent fallacies :) Fine. Let me spell it out...<br />
<br />
Giac, you're an idiot. That's not something I can hold against you, though. But, luckily, you're even worse, you're a lazy idiot. Or possibly a troll.<br />
<br />
That DOTs with an upfront DD are more resisted than those without isn't even in contest. Anyone using both knows it from sheer experience. The example I gave is not a proof. It's merely a simple test to both show this and a correlation between those resist and the partial/full resists on DDs. I won't take credit for it, if I haven't seen it here first, I have probably seen it on a necro board or even may on the old whineplay. If you were to use it as a proof, it would be inductive at best, which is not sufficient in itself. The proof was, in this case, out of the mouth of the developers.<br />
<br />
So, here it is, Giac. Bring in some documented proof that DD/DOT combination spells have normal resist, unlike all the other combination DD spells used to have before they were specifically modified. And, so you do not get too confused, here is the standard of proof, same as the one I adhered to: some verifiable mention from a developer, either from an article, a patch message or a reported Q&amp;A. What you believe isn't proof. What you incorrectly chain together from poorly understood mechanics is not proof either. What a VI or SOE developer said, that is proof.<br />

Back on topic.... another small irritating spell issue: the way the Frenzy line spells block your spell gems for 30 seconds or so.

Having only 8 spell gems and 15 buff slots, a spell must be evaluated both on its usefulness in isolation, but also with regard to whether the caster can afford a spell gem to memorize it (or the time/hassle to swap it in) and whether the target has a better use for the buff slot that a given spell might occupy.  Sadly, with stats having been proven time after time to be nearly irrelevant, many of our spells simply don't measure up.<br />
<br />
spirit quickening<br />
I can think of no conditions under which I would EVER waste a spell gem on this useless spell.  Stats appear to do nearly nothing on the pet, but even if they did, we can buff up the pets stats much more effectively with our normal buffs.  And the haste component of this thing is laughable.  There are so many things wrong with this piece of junk that I'm offended by its very existence.<br />
<br />
Post-Level-49 DEX/STR buffs<br />
With these buffs not stacking with Harness/Focus, they simply don't get much use.  Yes, if you managed to find a copy of infusion of spirit, you can achieve some very nice DEX/STR using these and infusion, but the value of that extra little bit of DEX/STR does not appear to be sufficient to justify the two extra buff slots which would be needed in order to cast them.  There are just so many other buffs which obviously do more.<br />
<br />
Spirit of Cheetah, Scale of Wolf, Spirit of Scale<br />
There are a number of things wrong with these spells as well.  Spirit of Cheetah is obviously intended to be a shaman version of a divine aura spell, else its insanely long recast time makes no sense.  Of course, that very recast time combined with an absurdly short duration is what makes it nearly useless.  In general, if you need to run away in an outdoor zone, you simply don't need this spell.  How many mobs are deadly, unrootable, run faster than SoW speed, and can kill you before you can get to zone running at SoW speed?<br />
<br />
And the two &quot;upgrades&quot; to SoW are obviously intended to be travel spells of some kind.  Sadly, if you're travelling anywhere dangerous, you can't use them, since invising yourself will click off the runspeed buff.  With the trivial ease of travel brought to us via PoP, I simply cannot recall ever wanting to memorize these spells.  Perhaps it would be worth it if they actually buffed your speed a bit more, but otherwise we simply get to where we're going fast enough now to not need these.<br />
<br />
And the fact that these spells overwrite regular SoW would make most of these entirely useless, especially the group version.<br />
<br />
Tiny Companion<br />
This spell may have upgraded several classes, but is totally useless for shamans, who can just use shrink instead.<br />
<br />
A number of our spell lines just seem to have died out<br />
<br />
Fire Based Nukes<br />
Shamans start their lives with &quot;burst of flame&quot; and never get another fire based spell regardless of their level of mastery.<br />
<br />
Charms<br />
We get a couple of charm animal spells early in life, then never see another one.  Nor do we get any new &quot;charm spirit&quot; spell lines to indicate that this is simply a shaman transition to more spiritual activities.<br />
<br />
Area of Effect DoT Spells<br />
Very early in life, shamans get an AoE DoT spell (infectious cloud).  After that, we never again get another AoE DoT.  This spell line seemed like an entirely reasonable one for shamans to have, yet it died out before it even got started.<br />
<br />
Silly from a &quot;Role Playing&quot; point of view<br />
<br />
Our &quot;wolf spirit&quot; Pets don't have innate Spirit of the Wolf<br />
Having to memorize single-target SoW is a pointless hassle.  If I'm SoWing in a group, I always use Spirit of Bih'Li.  If I'm sowing myself, I use my clicky SoW boots.  The only target for regular sow are strangers begging for buffs and my pet, a wolf spirit which should already have innate spirit of the wolf.<br />
<br />
Upgrades which aren't clear upgrades<br />
<br />
Root spells<br />
We get a variety of root spells to use, but most of them simply aren't useful upgrades to plain old level 14 root since even with resists debuffed, our DoTs break it, making any root with longer duration than 42 seconds overkill in most cases.  And how many of us can afford two spell gems to keep &quot;situational roots&quot; memmed?<br />
<br />
Some PoP Buffs durations are downgrades from pre-PoP<br />
<br />
In general, short duration buffs are irritating.  A half-way awake shaman can eeasily keep a one hour buff up just as well as a 2.5 hour buff, but it's simply annoying to have to do so.  I'd honestly be very tempted to use epuration over tribunal just because it will likely need zero refreshes.  The duration difference is made even greater on these since it's trivial to get an extended enhancement 3 item, but extended enhancement 4 items are much rarer.<br />
<br />
Talisman of the Tribunal<br />
1.0 hour versus 2.5 for talisman of epuration.  Is 10 extra poison/disease resist SO powerful that the duration has to be cut?  And by this much?<br />
<br />
Focus of the 7th<br />
1 hour 20 minutes versus 1 hour 40 minutes for focus.  The upgraded stats from this LEVEL 65 spell really aren't all that impressive, especially compared with the upgraded versions of other classes level 60 buffs.  Did the duration of this already shorter duration buff really need to be cut by 20% ?<br />
<br />
Frustrating to use<br />
<br />
Rain Spells<br />
These are just too annoying for words sometimes.  Fizzling a spell two or three times in a row, using up half your mana bar doing it, then having two of three waves resisted is just insanely silly for a spell line which is already only situationally useful and which would be taking a back seat to our DoTs in most cases if our DoTs were not so stupidly broken.<br />
<br />
DoT Spells<br />
These simply don't have the damage-to-mana ratio benefits compared with non-DoT spells which they used to.  Disease DoTs are particularly frustrating to use, since they pretty much never finish, which makes their ratios even worse.  Having most drop well before your spells have run to completion is just frustrating.  Perhaps these spells could be condensed a bit?  Let them do the same total damage, but over maybe half the amount of time?  Poison DoTs could finish in 4 ticks.  Disease in 8?  To be honest, the total amount of damage from these is unimpressive as well, since you cannot realistically stack them without tanking for a good chunk of the fight, or at least having multiple spells not finish as the mob dies in no time at all.<br />
<br />
Also, in the rare cases where the mobs last long enough to use DoTs at all, shaman DoTs just aren't that great.  Compare Bane of Nife (SHM56,npc-dropped) with Winged Death (DRU53,vendor-sold).  Bane does about 1600 damage for 425 mana.  Winged death does about 1300 for 350 mana.  On the face of it, Bane has a slightly better damage/mana ratio (3.88 versus 3.68), but when you add in the HUGE -100 resist bonus on Winged death, the shaman would have to Malo in order to approach the same chance of sticking bane.  That's another 350 mana, lowering the ratio to 2.12 for Bane/Malo, versus 3.68 for winged death.<br />
<br />
I two-box a shaman+druid.  I always thought of the shaman as being better at DoTs than the druid, but I don't really think it's true when examined closely.  If shamans ever were &quot;masters of DoTs&quot;, I think they no longer are.<br />
<br />
Invisibility<br />
The random duration on this spell is quite annoying.  Pretty much everyone who can cast invisibility but shamans gets some kind of improved invisibility eventually.  Is it too much to ask for shamans to get improved invis at some point?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Israi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">Okay first stuff that annoys me.. We have to have too many spells memorized to do anything efficently, first of all we always need canni 5 memmed so bye bye to 1 slot..  the next  2 slots are taken by our HOT spell and a quick heal.  now its varies a little.. in xp groups you just have malos and slow taking up another 2 slots and slots availabe for buffs. Now depending on the group we will cast focus+sta+agi+gindan+haste maybe. Now we will want to mem avatar during the xp group so that leaves us 2 slots ,, that means a root and nuke maybe..  Now on raids we have  canni 4, HOT , and quick heal, Malos Malosinia, slow, focus and sta.. That fills our buff slots up.  PITA to have avatar up. And either buff people quickly or have malosinia up. Seems like it would be nice if we could have canni 4 in the guise of an AA skill to open up a spell slot.  <br />
<br />
So basically canni 4 in aa form. <br />
<br />
Now onto spell changes i want to see. <br />
<br />
Sow. we were supposed to be the Kings of Sow.. but then druids got upgraded over us. I want an upgraded sow,, even if it is self only i want a new sow spell. If you choose to make it castable on everyone make it a group spell. <br />
<br />
Slow.. You have nerfed it and made our have less of an effect compared to other slows when it is mitigated.  First all does our slow get resisted more? Is there modifier?   If  this modifier is based on the percentage of the slow then lower the resist modifier to counter act this. If it is based on lvl give us a lvl 65 slow that does exactly the same thing as turgurs. <br />
<br />
Dots: You guys have even said dots suck. I know why, the damage they do over time is just soo small compared to what any other class can do nuking. What needs to be done is a Change to ALL  POP Player Character dots.  This means the lvl 61 and up dots.  This is what i want to see done.  Basically for the shaman dots.. blood of saryrn should be 3 or 4 ticks instead of 7,  Focus effects blow for dots as it is.  Breath of ultor should be 8-10 ticks instead of the 27 is it now which is a huge nerf over our other disease dot lines.  My reasoning behind this is based on the fact that Uber mobs  Dot for anywhere between 400-3300 in AE and single target.   We should be somewhere in  that range. <br />
Some people will say they will make too much aggro. That should be fixed as it. It seems to me like poison dot aggro is out of whack, its like the mob feels  it is taking 2300 point of damage every tick instead of the actual 320 or so it is actually taking. <br />
Also lets take a look at nukes. and thier focus effects.. you can raise nuke damage by 30 percent with focus effects and with crits you can crit for over 5k.. Dots will never do that.<br />
<br />
Also healing.. Crit heals are giving the aggro as if i regularly healed for that crit amount.  when it should only give me the aggro of the base amount. That needs to be fixed. <br />
<br />
So in summary,<br />
<br />
Make canni 4 an aa skill<br />
<br />
Give us a New sow that is faster<br />
<br />
Lower duration increase damage on dots and fix thier aggro.<br />
<br />
Fix turgurs,, either lvl 65 version or modifier on it.<br />
<br />
Fix healing aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">Bug: If you sit down right after casting a rain spell (Torrent of Poison), the 2nd and 3rd waves of the rain cause you to appear to stand up as if you've just been hit, even though you're still actually sitting. Appears that way in both first person and third person views. Very annoying. <br />
<br />
Good point there. The druids Blizzard spell suffered the same problem, and that was fixed in the may14 patch. Just goes to show how lazy the coders are to not test all the rain spells when they have a bug report for one type.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Tudani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">Well, the couple most irritating things.<br />
<br />
1)  Talis of Alacrity, make it 60% if you think it's too overpowered since chanters don't get a group haste spell around that time period then &lt;gasps&gt; give it to chanters around 51/52.  I have no problems with chanters having it, they should be the kings of haste.  And if not this, then make the duration on sltw higher (or give us a different haste spell so that you don't have to balance our haste and low level chanter haste together).  There is nothing more annoying to me when exping to have to stop and rehaste 5 tanks, me and my pet every few minutes when sltw fades, we're not level 49, and our spell haste line was always outta wack duration-wise.<br />
<br />
2)  Shrink....it's already been nerfed enough via minimizing devices and other clicky shrink items.  Let us cast it outta group, even if only on people in a raid.  In fact, being able to make buffs raid targetable would be nice.  For example being able to cast some self group only buffs on any group in the raid so that the person in question doesn't have to keep hopping around.<br />
<br />
3) Dots and other dmg:  I find myself increasingly using a DD spell instead of a dot to do my damage in groups.  As a class we're not damage dealers, but many shammies like to help out the damage a bit.  Why nuke instead of dot? because a) i don't spend half the fight tanking the mob, b) i have more control over my mana/dmg that i do (If I have a lot of spare mana i nuke more, less i nuke less, and way too much of a pita to sit and mem a nuke when after casting a dot i realize i have plenty of mana, besides which, if i sit after a dot i'm tanking). c) my spells will actually do full damage instead of having the mob die with my dots only half or less finished.  No, this doesn't apply all the time, but a significant portion of the time in exp groups it is so.  So...either up our nukes to be more in line with what our dots should be dmg wise, or lower the aggro OR the duration (while keeping the total damage the same please) on our dots.<br />
<br />
4) fizzles resists and other things:  Why does canni 4 fizzle just as much at level 65 as it did when i got it? Give us a break...please. We've been dealing with the fizzle queen of all spells for 65 levels, let it fizzle less, or give us that nice AA whereby you can make all spells under 60 or something like that never fizzle anymore.  The resists on our rain based nukes (which are always situational due to mez breaks), are huge, even after I malo a mob.  This turns this spell from what could be a &quot;fix&quot; to our damage to just something to use when i'm tired of velium strike. Also, it's way past time to fix the rain can't kill anything because of non assigned damage bug(s).<br />
<br />
5) strength of the diaku/talisman of the diaku:  This was an attempt to fix useless spells....and well, it only somewhat worked.  I have never ever cast strength of the diaku, and my only use for talisman of the diaku is to buff people who want to max strength and/or dex for tradeskilling.  And now that I have ferine avatar I don't even use this spell to buff myself for tradeskilling.  My suggestion, keep talisman of the diaku...it's situational at least, but give us something else instead of strength of the diaku.  Maybe a new heal?<br />
<br />
6) Healing:  Lately shammies  have become 4th rate healers.  (Clerics, Druids, and Pallies are all ahead of us.)  In general this doesn't bother me too much.  I have quies which is great....when I can use it.  Unfortunately many times in an exp group I can't be the healer, if there's no clerics or druids looking for group a group is outta luck when it comes to being able to heal.  Yes, with 2 shammies with quies in a group it's possible to get by, but this is a level 65 spell and fairly rare (on my server it sells for 40kish still).  Which is the same problem that people have with torpor.  I'd personally like to see us get an upgraded percentage heal.  Ours is 600 more heal than our fast cast heal (hmm, 1 hit yay!).  Druids get an almost 5k percentage heal at 64, and at 58 have a close to 3k one.  This makes a level 58 druid be able to heal better than a level 65 shaman when it comes down to a time when quies just can't keep up and you need real heals.  I would personally love to see us get a 3k percentage heal at 62 or so.  Or give us a 4k one but make it a max of 50% or something, I'd still be happy.  I don't want us to be too powerful healing wise, and I hate being asked for groups to be healer (If i want to heal i'll play a cleric) but I also hate seeing groups grind to a halt because I can't heal as well as a 58 druid. (and worse, I can't exp very often with my shammie friends because i have to find a cleric/druid for the last spot so my group can have a real healer.)<br />
<br />
Yes, some of these are balance issues.  But when it comes down to it any change in a casters spells are going to effect class balancing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>Owwiefixer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">My beefs-<br />
<br />
tnargs - aggro on this spell is insane.  It doesn't make any sense to me that a cleric can throw a cheal for 4k+ on a tank from fresh pull and obtain aggro, at which point the shaman scrapes the cleric from death for ~1400hp (extended) tnargs land.. and which point the shaman steals mob aggro from the cleric with no DA involved.   Tnargs should generate roughly half the aggro it does currently.<br />
<br />
DoTs- athough they behave as if the DD component added a second check, the reality is the older DoTs do resist in a fashion to give the illusion of this.  A good place to parse is a 65 shaman in PoN against wraiths or banshees near alt zone-out.  These mobs are insanely PR/DR and malos/slow pulling then using Spear of Torment for a control with parser- they are close to 85% full resist, 10% partial, 5% complete hit.  If you then parse with Bane of Nife vs Blood of Sarryn, BoS does in fact gain and extra 10% land rate over BoN.  Nothing concrete- just about 4 hours of quick study to give me enough of a 3/4 chummy towards leaving the DD portion out of our DoTs, if for anything sheer luck factor.   My suggestion would be to simply have all our DoTs have similar resist offset like the necro line so our older spells will have more success similar to BoS/BoU.<br />
<br />
Rains- Torrent of Poison/Tears of Sarryn are a good start.  The resist rate is still a joke.  Low mob health (15%) exclusion is a bigger joke.  Fizzle rate on Torrent of Poison and recast times on both are also a joke.   Reduce fizzle rate on Torrent of Poison.  Reduce recast on both.  I'd also suggest improving damage:mana ratio but that may fall out of the scope of this thread.<br />
<br />
Bearform + Mount- it doesnt figure we cant use bearform and also use a mount.  As funny as it may sound, a bear riding a horse or lizard is the end result.  If not visually, the WIS + regen component of the illusion should be retained.<br />
<br />
Slows- We really need a new 65 slow to compete on the slowing market.  Given Beastlords and enchanters, our slows are pathetic and we are no longer prime slowers, which was our only specialty.  A level 65 slow is in order that has an effect 85% vs mitigating mobs only + 75% on all others.   Basically, it would give us a perk on mitigated mobs yet not be overpowering for non-mitigating mobs.  As the mitigating mobs only operate on a fraction of the total land, the perk would only be an additional 3/5/7% roughly on top of the additional 3/5/7% we currently have over BL's.  Lets face it- on mitigating mobs, 5% over a BL is not even worth mentioning.. but 10% starts to raise an eyebrow... and keeps a 10% advantage over BLs.<br />
<br />
Group Primal Essence- enough said. <br />
<br />
Talis. of Tribunal- as already mentioned, the duration on this is a joke. <br />
<br />
FO7/Boar/Wrulan- durations reduced from level 60 and prior spells is also a joke.  SCRM AA should be a perk... not a requirement to recapture old functionality stripped away.<br />
<br />
Malos- recast of 10 seconds?   Nice duration, but recast is annoying.  Encounters that really count are gonna get Malo/Malos overwritten with 'sinia anyways, so why take another spell slot to load Malos and Malo to get around recast (.. so we can use a 3rd spell slot for Malosinia).. ?<br />
<br />
Pets- pets are more and more becoming &quot;lost&quot; after the latest pathing changes.  Also, they cannot be summoned back after an attack order has been issued until the mob (they arent attacking because they are lost) is dead.   You issue a pet attack, notice the dog isnt anywhere around, so you go to summon to your side and get the &quot;.. his focus is on something else..&quot; or whatever..  You then have to wait until the mob is dead, THEN summon and park him.   Fix pets so they dont walk into a blackhole when covering the 6' between fight spot and park spot and also make it so summon companion WILL summon the companion when he's not actually landing any bites or taking damage because hes in never-ever land somewhere.</div></div><hr />

This is often the result of the pet taunting the mob from a distance, even if they aren't engaged in melee. Taunt puts your pet on the mob's hate list which makes him unsummonable. So a work-around is to turn off pet taunt.</div></div><hr />

Another anoying thing with our pets is the number of times they just get lost and despawn when not doing anything.  One real anoying thing is crossing the bridge in Torgiran Mines - pet always despawns then while other classes keep theirs.</div></div><hr />

A good piece of advice, but I disable the pet taunt the moment I summon a doggy for exp group usage.. mainly to eliminate the taunt spam and there is no need as group has an MA holding aggro.<br />
<br />
It still behaves the same way- sending a lost pet into a mob will not allow a summon to side until mob is dead.  It's a really annoying bug.  :(</div></div><hr />

Why wont bear form hold until rez effects are completed?  It really sucks having to wait for rez effects are down to throw bear form up.  <br />

I often times like to use bear form as a top-junk buff slot along with my clickies.. it gives me more junk buff slot buffer up top so if Im slow or being lazy during the next dispelling encounter, I dont have to hurriedly scramble for a clickie on dispells... 1 buff extra slack.. and captures that occasional &quot;2nd or 3rd slot&quot; random dispell nicely.</div></div><hr />

Nitpick: To my knowledge it's the stat strength that helps you learn most melee skills ( weapon skills, attack).<br />
<br />
[I suspect that agi helps you learn defensive skills like dodge etc ( I am not sure).<br />

The only skill dex should 'reasonably' help you with is Riposte? but I think dex is good for nothing but effect procs.]<br />

Bears that are shrunk are still larger than shrunk Ogres.<br />
Barbarians can wear both MEDIUM and large sized gear.<br />
Last I checked casting grow had no effect on Bear Form. (Will double check later to make sure)<br />
Not to mention I know for a fact Ogres do not lose the ability when shrunk (Have an Ogre Warrior as well).  &lt;snipe&gt;.<br />
<br />
Actually, size is only based on height. Since a northman (barbarian to you non-northmen :) is much higher than a bear, he's allso considered to be much wider..  wich isn't the case.<br />
<br />
F.x. (For example): If you as northman (barb) want to enter the bank of Kelethin ( woodhead elf city), you can't, you're considerd to tall/fat.  Ducking won't help either =)<br />

Iffen you turn to bear form, you get much lower, though VISUALLY(only) fatter.  Even you're now logically to fat to enter the door... you can enter it easily =)<br />

Granted, the buff would only givs us 82 mana each tick ( 6 seconds) Vs. CanniIV's 82 mana wich can be casted each ~4.5 seconds?? (have not checked), but we can't cast CanniV all the time either, so a perma-canniIV would be far to powerful.</div></div><hr />

Fix Avatar's duration/recast.  We are the &quot;ultimate buffing class&quot;, according to the SOE CS reps.   Avatar is useless in it's present form.  KEI lasts 3 hours, Avatar lasts 3 minutes.  Is giving melee's +100 ATK for 30 min worse than giving Druids and Necro's the ability to solo non-stop for 3 hours?  Please explain this!  Avatar is the one spell that proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that no one in SOE has a clue what to do with the shaman class.<br />
<br />
Group Avatar, pls, after you get it fixed.<br />
<br />
Please incorporate STAMINA and AGILITY into the Focus line of buffs.  We only have EIGHT FREAKING SPELL SLOTS....I'd like to go on a raid and actually only open my spell book after rezzes, not every five minutes!<br />
<br />
Quiescences should have it's mana charge doubled, and it's amount healed doubled.  I don't care if it has negative effects or not--but I can't keep anyone up with Torpor in PoP, it's just not effective enough.  Change Q to 400mana for 2400 hitpoints over 4 ticks, put the negative effects back in, and I'm happy.  Now I can heal ONE-THIRD of a poorly equipped warrior's hitpoints over half a minute, with negative effects.<br />
<br />
Change the stacking issues with Focus and the cleric mana regen buff.  I'm tired of the bitching from clerics.<br />
<br />
Focus of Soul should be a better spell.  544 hps? are you kidding? It should have been 700 at least.<br />
<br />
Since Verant has decided to NEVER up our melee abilities after level 50, through 4 expansions, could you please give us a self-buff that jacks up our melee abilities considerably?  Something in the vein of Voice of the Berserker, but that also gives Double-Attack, Damage Bonuses, yadda yadda.   Rabid Bear is a nice AA, but the re-use is ridiculous.<br />
<br />
Fix the Rabid Bear re-use timer to something more manageable.  No reason it shouldn't be 10 minutes, like Spirit Call.<br />
<br />
Fixed duration invis would be nice.<br />
<br />
Bah, that's all I can think of now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u91"><b>Badmorta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p91">I totally agree that the buffs post 61 need to have their duration increased.  It is rediculous that these spells do not last as long as the spells they are supposed to be an upgrade for!! <br />
<br />
I also agree that SoW/Bih'Li should both load much faster.  What a pain in the butt that wait time is.  <br />
<br />
One other thing, and I am not sure if this is just me or not, but I seem to get an AWEFUL lot of fizzles!!  At level 63 all of my skills are maxed out, and what troubles me the most is that my specialzation is in ALT and has been maxed out for forever AND I have SCM 1 and I will still fizzle on Canny two or three times in a row sometimes.  I don't know if my char is broken or if it is a thing with all shaman or all barb shaman or what, but it is REALLLY annoying!!  Whatever it is I would love if it was fixed!!!</div></div><hr />

I'd love to see q upgraded to heal more but for the love of god do not put the side effects back on it. Torpor already heals more than pleanty for my self canning and if you put side effects back on it thats about all it's good for. I'll stick with q as it is rather than have it doubled but with the sideffects back.<br />
<br />
Having no side effects makes q so much more useful for me than it would be otherwise. I can heal people outside of group. I can heal tanks and casters alike in combat with out having to worry. I can use it on myself and not have to worry about root breaking while soloing. Putting the side effect back on it wouldn't be worth it for it just to heal double.</div></div><hr />

spirit quickening<br />
I can think of no conditions under which I would EVER waste a spell gem on this useless spell.  Stats appear to do nearly nothing on the pet, but even if they did, we can buff up the pets stats much more effectively with our normal buffs.  And the haste component of this thing is laughable.  There are so many things wrong with this piece of junk that I'm offended by its very existence.<br />
<br />
<br />
&gt;AFAIK the spell Increase Attack Speed by 20% ,and stacks with our normal haste buffs; you you can have that puppy hasted 80% instead of 60% if you wish. Spell lasts way to short for me to bother using it though, I do agree, but it is at least hypothetically usefull =)<br />

<br />
Spirit of Cheetah, Scale of Wolf, Spirit of Scale<br />
There are a number of things wrong with these spells as well.  Spirit of Cheetah is obviously intended to be a shaman version of a divine aura spell, else its insanely long recast time makes no sense.  Of course, that very recast time combined with an absurdly short duration is what makes it nearly useless.  In general, if you need to run away in an outdoor zone, you simply don't need this spell.  How many mobs are deadly, unrootable, run faster than SoW speed, and can kill you before you can get to zone running at SoW speed?<br />
<br />
&gt; You may run fast enough to not aggro KOS casters, for example, or get out of range of a caster to throw a new spell on you, or, I do belevie, even run away from a summoning mob =)  ( he'll summon you, but then you may have enough time to get far enough for him to not summon you, at least I know bards can do this si certain situations).<br />
<br />
But I'd love SoCheetah to be upgraded: pref faster recast time and some longer hold time, but add Silence...  thus it won't be exploited by Shms for grinding =)<br />
<br />
Will be more useful for getting away, and as a travel spell.<br />

Area of Effect DoT Spells<br />
Very early in life, shamans get an AoE DoT spell (infectious cloud).  After that, we never again get another AoE DoT.  This spell line seemed like an entirely reasonable one for shamans to have, yet it died out before it even got started.<br />
<br />
&gt; I'd love to have more AoE DoTs... but they're possibly too powerful / easy to exploit?<br />
--<br />
<br />
<br />
Rain Spells<br />
These are just too annoying for words sometimes.  Fizzling a spell two or three times in a row, using up half your mana bar doing it, then having two of three waves resisted is just insanely silly for a spell line which is already only situationally useful and which would be taking a back seat to our DoTs in most cases if our DoTs were not so stupidly broken.<br />
<br />
<br />
&gt;Hm.. I used our two latest rain spells in Sirens Grotto today, I nuked for 7900 in like 20 seconds. While I did get afew resists, and I did drain at least 1/2 of me mana, it seems to me that they do have their use...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u95"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p95">A couple comments for beargor on replies to my suggestions:<br />
<br />
1.  while the spirit quickening icon stacks with the celerity icon, the hastes do not stack, at least according to those members of this community who have done parses.  I maintain my opinion that this spell is 100% useless.<br />
<br />
2.  cheetah - you mentioned a possible use for this, but didn't say whether you'd actually ever used it for this purpose.  I'd wager not, considering that the thing takes like 5 minutes to mem.  I certainly never use it.<br />
<br />
3.  rain spells - i never said these were useless.  I use them whenever the situation permits.  But they are very specialized in their use.  Further restricting them by having crazy high fizzle and resist rates is just plain irritating.</div></div><hr />

Damn ! that would be so good</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u97"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p97">Annoying: a level 60+ shaman who is landing Turgur's Insects for the full 75% can't land a slow on a mob already slowed by a higher level shaman even though the slow % is the same. This makes it very difficult when the higher level slows a boss mob, then dies or can't reslow for whatever reason and the lower level shaman can't step up and reslow until the original slow wears off, which is a bad thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u98"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p98">agreed kaesha that sucks hard. though its in place cause higher lvl shamans slow lasts a tad bit longer.  but its a pain in the rear.</div></div><hr />
