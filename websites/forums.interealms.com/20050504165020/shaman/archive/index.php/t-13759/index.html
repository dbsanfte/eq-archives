*** The Legacy of Ykesha is now live! *** <br />
<br />
As the afternoon heat grows, a trickle of adventurous folk can be seen moving through the rocky vales of the mountains called Stonebrunt. These quiet lands, normally inhabited by panda bears and kobolds, are slowly becoming a throughway for heroes, mercenaries and adventures of all races. Are you one of them? <br />
<br />
And in Gukta tadpoles are growing into young Frogloks. There is no doubt in the minds of the conquerors of Grobb that the new generation of their people will grow into strong and steadfast servants of Mithaniel Marr, worthy of his respect. Will you be one of them? <br />
<br />
OOC: Have fun with the new features, the new race and the new zones. Thank you for playing EverQuest.<br />
<br />
At the dock in Stonebrunt Mountains. Explore from there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You'll find the zoneline in Stonebrunt (click on the doors on the ship at point 4 on the eqatlas map).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Angryor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Gunthak is off of the Stonebrunt Mountains Zone if you have purchased the LoY expansion.<br />
<br />
There are no maps for the LoY zones at EQ Atlas, if you are looking for LoY maps you can find some basic maps at this (http://maps.eq-toolbox.com/) link including one for Gunthak.<br />

<br />
I would ask a Druid or Wizard to gate you there.  Its on the continent of Odus, and quite an out of the way place considering you need to go: Tox -&gt; Paineel -&gt; The Warrens -&gt; Stonebrunt.<br />
<br />
And trust me... navigating the Warrens when unexperienced is annoying.<br />
<br />
