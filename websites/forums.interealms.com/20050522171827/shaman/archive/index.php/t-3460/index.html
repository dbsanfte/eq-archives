<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Actually, if you know any enchanters have them buff your wisdom, then also buff your dexterity as high as it can go. That should help your chances.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For skill INCREASES, you want to max either your widsom or intelligence (the highest of those two is what is used).  Some theorize that Dex is a secondary check, so you might as well max buff your dex too.<br />
<br />
For SUCCESSES, the only thing checked is your skill.<br />
<br />
Alchemy is a money pit.  Don't expect to ever make money with it, or be realistic about the investment required before it starts paying off.  I was very active selling SoW potions, back before AA skills and TBoots, and never came close to making up the investment.<br />
<br />
The re-sell of potions to vendors is horrible.  Returns less than 10%.  There is a trivial chart at EQTraders that should become your best friend:  find the cheapest potion that is above your current skill, and make that to skill up.  Eventually, your only real option becomes Titan potions, at about 11 plat per attempt (trivial above the max skill of 180).<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gothlips</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Get INT as high as possible.<br />
<br />
WIS effects whether you fail the combine or not<br />
INT effects how quickly you learn the skill<br />
DEX effects how quickly you learn COMBAT skills (not tradeskills!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">ok so wait . i hit 37 on my skill last night . so that means i cant get any better with SOW potions ? i need to make somehting else to raise my skill level ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Irksome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Goth, I don't want to be rude, and that is not my intent here.  You are simply wrong.<br />
<br />
Read the EQTraders site a bit, there have been tons of tests done on this.  The ONLY thing that affects success is your skill.  All variance is just the random number generator and a human's ability to see patterns in randomness.  This is probably the most hotly debated subject in tradeskills, but it has been proven both in objective tests and by discussions with VI employees.<br />
<br />
Same is true for the skill-ups.  ALL tradeskills, including alchemy, will check the HIGHER of int and wis for skill-up chances.  Some tradeskills have secondary stats that are known, others are just theorized.  We know for sure that blacksmithing has a secondary check on strength, for instance, as it was uttered by VI at a Fan Faire.  I believe there is one other skill where the skill-up chance has a secondary check on dex.  Nobody has proven (or pried from VI) that alchemy has a secondary check, but I personally (when I still was able to skill up) max buffed myself (I can get to or near 255 on str/sta/dex/wis).<br />
<br />
This is not intended as a flame, and if you believe I am wrong I respect your right to believe as you will.  I'm not likely to reply to any flames directed my way on this subject, and I encourage everyone to make up their own minds on things like this.  Until we can see the actual code that EQ uses, no one can be certain, so I of course could be completely wrong.<br />
<br />
As always, your mileage may vary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">With the AA skill &quot;run3&quot;, what use do you have for Alchemy? It's<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Holdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">easiest way to raise alchemy<br />
<br />
SoW potions til 37(easy to make the money back for these)<br />
Shrink til 70(you can sell some of these to make back some of the money)<br />
Aura of Purity til 103<br />
Grow potion til max skil<br />
<br />
took me about 4k to go from 80 to 142 this way..damn cheap from what I hear.  Not sure on the cost from 26 to 80 though..probably a few k, but I made most of that back with potion sells(sow and shrink)</div></div><hr />

It's pretty cool to be able to enhance our own abilities.  Gates (self or other) to FoB, Everfrost, and Innothule are not part of our standard spell line up.  Damage shields are not part of our spell line up.  Invis to undead is not part of our spell line up.<br />
<br />
I really enjoy anything that adds to my abilities, whether it's a snare spear from VP or binding in the firepot room for ease of travel.<br />
<br />
Yes, alchemy is expensive.  You're right, it's not useful all the time.  I still think alchemy is an excellent and interesting perk for our class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Irksome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Alchemy is very useful, and most raiding guilds need a source for alchemy items.<br />
<br />
Shrink potions - all zones.  Pack 50 people into a tight space (say, around a single mob) and shrink is invaluable.  There is no way to shrink someone in any other way in many zones.<br />
<br />
Damage shield potions - 31 damage added to every hit is VERY useful for mobs that cannot be slowed.<br />
<br />
For mid-level guilds, where the gear may not be uber, and levels not at 60, the resist potions are very handy.  Trak kills go easier when you have an extra 25 poison resistance, for instance.<br />
<br />
For sub-50 players, particularly the non-twinked crowd, SoW potions are still economical and effective.  They sell for about 10 plat per dose, and can easily save your life running thru a tough zone without invis.<br />
<br />
For all non-gating classes, gate potions are extraodinarily useful.  I have many people looking for Swamp of Innothule and Field of Bone potions, as they both help the person get out of a bad situation (LD at a raid, stuck deep in a dungeon), and can help them get to either Sebilis or Cazic Thule.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm a 180 skill alchemist, and I rarely try to sell potions for a profit.  I make probably 100+ potions per week, primarily for guild use, with various special requests from friends (and the occasional random stranger).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Remember too that alchemy is level capped - <br />
I don't see your level there, so I will tell you this:<br />
<br />
(Your level - 24) x 5 = max skill you can achieve.<br />
<br />
So at level 40, ((40-24)x5) = 80 is your max skill.<br />
At level 60, ((60-24)x5)) = 180 is your max skill.<br />
<br />
<br />
What use is alchemy: <br />
<br />
The potions I make and use the most (or my friends/guildmates use the most).<br />
<br />
Big Damage Shield potion <br />
Shrink<br />
Vampiric Spirit<br />
Stinging Wort<br />
Gate potions<br />
Sow potions for twinks.<br />
<br />
Alchemy is expensive.  Some of the potions are good though.  Even if all I could make was our big damage shield potion it would be worth it to me at this point.  I love damage shield and I have to go back to Chardok to recharge my ring like every other day.  Selfbuffing a 56pt Damage shield is lovely for soloing big game.<br />
<br />
We have no wizards around.  When we are deep somewhere and someone needs to leave, they just pop a gate potion and have a druid come pick them up in surefall glade the next day.  If they did not have that, we would have to fight out and quit for the day.  Yes, even though there are gate to Thurg potions made with pottery I still keep people regularly supplied with Gate to EFP potions because you dont have to farm those components.<br />
<br />
No mages/necros manahelpers?  Those potions of vampiric spirit sure can come in handy.  They are expensive as hell and require farmed components - but they *are* useful.<br />
<br />
and if you think skilling alchemy is expensive now, keep in mind lots of shaman skilled up before Titans potions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I AM one of the one's who got my skill up before Titans potions. <br />
<br />
I'm amazed that people are able to sell the gate potions. I <br />
thought they'd be a big seller among the non-gete'rs, but I only <br />
found two buyers (only one of them a regular). In the end, I was<br />
selling them for 300 P each (or at least trying to). <br />
<br />
Wolf potions used to sell, but with Jboots and the AA skill of run3<br />
the market dried up.<br />
<br />
I used to sell resist poison potions when people were doing <br />
Trak on my server, but now that's not the huge deal it was when<br />
Kunark was new. I hunt mainly in Seb and almost never see the<br />
crowd gathering around the seb bubble like in the old days. <br />
<br />
People have NEVER asked me for damage shield potions. The <br />
only requests I've get are for the occasional shrink potion. I <br />
guess my server's economy is different. People just don't think <br />
potions are worth the money. Effort isn't the question, I had this <br />
funny routine I'd go through when I entered the zone. &quot;Krazy <br />
Kbok's Potions&quot;... sounding like a used car salesman on TV. Had <br />
fire sales and everything. Got a lot of laughs, but very very few<br />
takers. <br />
<br />
Before Kunark, I did pretty well selling invis to undead potions in<br />
lower Guk; but those days are long gone. <br />
<br />
Well, as long as I have my port idol, I don't need the income for <br />
Innothule Swamp gate potions. These port idols are the best<br />
thing Verant's done since adding the abilty to reorganize the<br />
spell book.</div></div><hr />
