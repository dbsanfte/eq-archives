Unfortunately, with the changes to the game and SoE's apparent desire to scrap shamans as a class.... I'm done.<br />
Yep ended billing and my account expires in a couple of weeks. No Ebay, no giving the account away. I worked too hard on this character for him to end up being someone's buffbot. Rather I should slip quietly away and hope that my 3 accounts closing adds to the numbers flocking away from the game. <br />
<br />
Good luck all and keep fighting the good fight!</div></div><hr />

I still enjoy playing my shaman. The only thing I hate about playing a shaman is casting FA every 10 mins. The one thing that will make me quit in the future is the availability of my 65-70 spells. If I have to spend 400k on new spells or if I need a raid to get them, I just might be another bear down too. We'll see.<br />

Same here Grim.  If the horrible spell distribution model implemented in Gates carries over to Omens, then I'm out.  Months after the release of the expansion I'm still no where near the point I can camp the rare mobs for the hours I need to get the rare drops.<br />
<br />
Use the LDoN model, or make the spells droppable, I don't care, just give someone in a small family guild who does not have uber gear a chance to get them.</div></div><hr />

My words exactly, except for WoW.  If I retire, I'm ending the whole MMORPG time sink deal before I get attached to a new group of friends I won't be willing to part from.  Would be nice to get my REAL social life back in order, as well.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brothur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">See this is the root of the problem with content progression.  Most of the drevolpers play uber characters in time enabled guilds, or GoD farming guilds.  So, the new content is aimed at keeping them with new and exciting stuff that is totally on par with thier game.  For the less than tottaly commited raiding player, a lot of the new content will be out of our reach.  On the plus side, we will be able to keep doing our jobs in zones that we are familiar with and little pressure to advance due to the near impossibilty of getting new spells and such.  On the negative side, as time goes by, less and less of these uber players will be around (due to changes in interest, etc.) to make use of the new content.  As catching up will be next to impossible there will  be a need to bridge the gap, and the new gaming progression templates ( such as the ones used to make the 66-70 Shaman spells ) do not facilitate such a bridging.  <br />
<br />
I feel that new content should open the doors for the hardcore elite, but not make the other 75% of the EQ population dispise the newest expansion, while 50%+ of the current content is not even being used because it is fundamentally obsolite.<br />
<br />
Sorry for going on and on... I thought that there was a point in there somewhere but now I feel a little less excited about my beloved EQ...<br />
<br />
Sorry to see ya go HoundHammer.  :(   Good Luck in your journeys.</div></div><hr />

<br />
WoW will be out in 2006 thanks for play EQ for two more years. Big fat disaprove for you.<br />
<br />
What an a$$hole LoL. And for your information jackhole, WoW is being released the end of this year.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Clawmarks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Sorry to see you go but I still don't buy into the ..SOE has made Shamans useless. I have never felt I am useless (I raid most the time) and in some cases I believe with out me, things just wouldn't of went so smoothly. Problem shamans have these days is adapting to a different play style. <br />
<br />
<br />
Clawmarks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Brothur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I admire your optimism Clawmarks, but I feel that you may be a little too optimistic... /shrug.  Glad too see that you are at least satisfied.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Clawmarks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I realize that some of us play this game at all different levels but I can just talk from experience and I do honor the problems some long time shamans have with the game. I say long time because I have really only played a shaman for 2 years but played a necro for 4.<br />
<br />
I recently quit the necro and decided to go full time shaman. I don't regret it one bit and in fact the other night when doing god and the raid limit was at max..the necro was asked to sit out. That right there made me feel more of a &quot;wanted&quot; class. I understand some are not at this level of play and its hard to understand the actual need for a well played shaman. Do you need 6 shamans on a 54 raid limit raid? Of course not but with so many people throwing in the towel lately its getting the numbers down to a managable size and the actual need is there once again.<br />
<br />
I would be a fool to say our class is with out its problems but honestly ..alot of classes have issues. If I liked what another class can do..I would make that class and play it. I like the shaman period whether the class isnt as powerful as it once was.<br />
<br />
During exp play its fun. The other day It was myself 2 monks and a mage in Plane of Fire fighting red-white con mobs. At times we had 2 in camp with monk as tanks and me as primary slower and healer..could keep this up for hours and hours.<br />
<br />
No healer for LDON? No problem a shaman can slow and heal a full group of melees. Yes I know when it comes to Kod Taz + zones (tipt even) a shaman being primary healer just doesnt work out but a primary healer with out a slower in Kod taz is just as bad imo. Sure beast lords have slow and better dps but for some reason Beast lords are rare as well when ever I am on..might be different for you all,<br />
<br />
The game is old, the class is old, you make what you want about it. I like it still or I wouldnt pay to play.<br />

<br />
j/k<br />
<br />
GL IRL bro...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Serranex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Sad to see you go. I will agree with Clawmarks, however.<br />
<br />
I don't really understand what the gripe is with shaman anymore. I know that on a raid, Shaman are the only class that can hit Balance and reliably slow an add before it eats up all the chanters. Hell, an unslowed Ikkinz raid mob will smack around some of our 11k knights as if they were a caster. <br />
<br />
In groups, Balance is crazy good. Low aggro, low resists. Chanters have to tash (High aggro) and then slow which is a much higher risk. 2 mobs come into camp, both chanters and shaman can do crowd control. Chanters through mezzing, and shamans through slowing both mobs (then healing yourself) and maybe hitting VP. I CAN function as a secondary healer with all my healing AA and foci that I can replace a druid in Ikkinz 1 trial and do backup healing. I feel useful in vxed, tipt, KT and Ikkinz...Is there something I'm missing? (Possibly once I hit Uqua or Qvic some more problems surface?)<br />
<br />
Only issue right now is my lack of ability to do damage. Raise bane and Anathema as well as BoS damage, maybe raise disease dot damage just a bit. Upgrade Tears of Saryrn (no 20% resist rate) and VS. I'd be a happy happy shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Houndhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Your shaman has crap gear, it ain't your main you have other reasons. Lies will get you everytime<br />
<br />
Well you know what? To hell with whoever said this... yeah I'm not in an uber raiding guild, no I'm not in the EP's+ and so that makes me a liar? <br />

Pretty pathetic that you have to make your asinine comments in a rep comment and not in a post where everyone can see what you have to say...... coward</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I agree Hound, my buddy, who I work with everyday just recently quit.. He had a 66 ish shaman with over two hundred AA's!  His guild only asked him along from time to time to make him feel needed.  I have a 62 shaman with 20+ AA's and I only use him as a bot now, not that I cant do well at my level, but when I look further down the road its a rather bleak picture.  Ive devouted most of my time to my Ranger and my Barbarian Warrior..  Good luck to you Hound, I hope you find some sort of happiness elsewhere..And to those who put those negative bumps with rude and sarcastic little jabs, You are cowards plain and simple!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Farewell Hound, take care - I'm sure there'll be a lot more shaman folowing you out of the door soon.<br />
<br />
My shaman is seeing less and less use now, getting sick of logging in and LFG - trying to get GoD groups together is impossible (even within guild).<br />
<br />
Having fun with a wizzie and paladin alt and I think I will be officially switching main soon within guild, I can see my shaman (created Sept 99) becoming purely a buff bot and PL toon very soon when I have a few more aa's on alts.<br />
<br />
Its a crying shame because I want to play the shaman and contribute more meaningfully to groups, what I don't want is to be the person that gets invited to the group either out of pity or only because there are no bards/enchanters/beastlords LFG.<br />
<br />
Kevak<br />
<br />
As for the person who posted that comment on Hounds goodbye, &quot;**** you piece of scum, not everyone can be in an uber guild and have 300+ aa's&quot;. <br />
<br />
I don't give a rats ass if you do a rep job on me as a) I have no idea how to find out what my rep is :) b) I don't give a crap what other people think about me, I post what I believe in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Grimleaper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Someone else just gave me another anonymous negative bump for saying that I can't wait for WoW to come out.<br />
<br />
He's Right. Wow ain't coming out until 2006 with Blizzards track record. So here get a clue and enjoy another Big fat disapproval!<br />
<br />
I can't imagine a bigger coward then one that gives negative bumps on a messageboard anonymously. I mean honestly, what could you possibly have to fear? This sounds like the type of person that is still wetting his bed at night.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I could care less about the rep. I just think it's pretty pathetic.<br />
<br />
Does anyone remember the story about some anonymous poster that pissed some people off on a messageboard? They traced his ip, did a little research and found out exactly who it was and posted his address, phone number and picture up everywhere. It turned out to be some 12 year old punk. Man that was funny.  :D</div></div><hr />

Wow, my thoughts almost exactly.<br />
<br />
I don't plan on quitting EQ anytime soon, but when I do I am done with MMORPGs.  Too much time taken away from my family and friends and work and education and...<br />
<br />
One thing, not only did your post catch my attention because of the simliarity to my thoughts but your sig line amused the heck out of me until I noticed the 'r' in 'britches.'</div></div><hr />
