<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kongar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">SO...<br />
Here I am - freshly dinged 44.  I bought all my new spells, and I have about 180pp left over.  I'm not a twink and I don't have tens of thousands of plat for buying uber gear.<br />
<br />
So, I was planning on doing Hill Giants, Gornit, and green stomping SolA until I scraped up about 15K for a JBB and then start farming East Commons for one...<br />
<br />
But then i'm thinking that maybe I should just forget the JBB since I'm broke and go for levels...<br />
<br />
I'm interested in your opinions as i think it will take FOREVER to get that kind of cash together - and maybe I'll be better served by just forgetting JBBs exist (even though I want one REALLY bad - I dont' have any right clicky stuff :)<br />
<br />
Opinions?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>pathogen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, coming from a casual player, it is very difficult to see the JBB and know that you will never have one.  When I turned 45, I did HG's all the way through that hell of a level, but I was SUPER EQ'd out when I was done.  I made about 6000pp, but the thought of killing more of those damn things made me want to dig my eyeballs out with a cheese fork.  <br />
<br />
Because of that, I didnt play for about 2 months after dinging 46.  The game just wasnt fun when I was just going for cash.  <br />
<br />
My advice is to just get into groups and level and have fun.  Also, from what I understand, getting into groups and trying to win rolls on marketable stuff is a much more fun way to try to get the JBB.  <br />
<br />
Good luck... Remember, GAMES should be FUN... not painful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I was never obsessed with any piece of gear to the point of trying to accrue huge amounts of plat at the expense of leveling.  I wanted a fungi tunic, I got to level 57 got in a group and went down and got one for me and one for a monkie friend.  I kinda wanted a JBB and at level 56 (57?) a friend gave me one.  <br />
<br />
The money thing gets easier in the 50s...you start hunting in places (OS, KC, Velks) where you occasionally get the nice (or just semi-nice) piece of gear to wear or to sell.  You might get 100+ plat cash splits after a night of exping and maybe a couple of cash loot gems to sell (after giving the cleric their share for dot costs, of course).<br />
<br />
This was just my experience of course, my gear slowly got better and better (heck I was still wearing jarsath pants at 59!) my bank balance kept slowly slowly growing and I never stopped leveling, I just went after stuff I wanted and I eventually got it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>morbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Concentrate on leveling, for the most part.<br />
<br />
Level AND get cash when you get to 54 or so.  Start getting groups in Seb: Get experience, get items, get cash.<br />
<br />
In between exp'ing, try to get in a Kael raid, or even Hate a few times.<br />
<br />
Stay the hell out of places like Velks for experience.  You'll likely leave with nothing money wise, and people wearing Totemic at level 60 look lame.<br />
<br />
I personally wasted a lot of time around 50-57 dicking around with trading.  Had a fungi at level 52, but with considerable time wasted in EC.  Kinda had fun trading though, so it's not really a total bust.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd vote for lvling first myself. As you get higher as people pointed out can go to places with better drops. I also found if i feel like it once in awhile I'll spend some hrs farming plat from Hgs or Ice giants or whatever and at a higher lvl becomes much easier to do. Kill more in a few hrs than you could before than go back to lvling after you get tired of doing so. I was able to upgrade a couple items from regular money that dropped exp hunting mixed in with an occasional night/day of farming plat or whatever your favorite way to make money is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shenlon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">lvls = greater cash flow = more fun <br />
<br />
<br />
i thought i was gonna buy/sell until i got a fungi when i was in my 40s, now looking back i wish i had lvled instead and gotten the fungi later</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>DarkPhase</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Use your gear to make money.<br />
<br />
Buy an item you can use as cheap as you can get it. Auction it for more than you bought it for. Don't keep on to it unless it's an powerful item like a JBB or fungi.<br />
<br />
If you keep on doing this you can eventually afford JBB, Fungi and even FT3 boots. Thats how I got those aforementioned items at level 56 (Even bought malo at that level).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I was obsessed with finding and obtaining a JBB when I was yer level.  I scrimped and saved and came to the conclusion that I needed a better source of cash.  So I figured out the wurmslayer quest, figured out how to get it done with minimal people, and did it a couple times with a friend.  At that time the WS was selling for upwards of 9k, so the money added up fast.  Me and my friend became wealthy overnight, and this at only lvl 47!  We had much fun doing the quest and much fun selling the WSs for phat ca$h!  <br />
I then had the cash on hand for a JBB, and it took me about 2 weeks to find one. . I had to hire people to look for one for me, but eventually one came up for sale and my contacts let me know right away.  I bought it for 12k and it's the only piece of equipment I wore then that I still wear now.  <br />
<br />
Point:  You gotta get creative to get the cash at that level.  It's doable, but you need to be tricksy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Toreden_Demonslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I still dont have no Fungi or ft3 boots or anything nice, got epic and got a jbb camping crypt. Didnt get any of them till 60 doh, and im 60 =) why need a jbb when you can get a friend to be your jbb?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">excelent advice there from landdragon&gt;  those that make money in rl AND IN eq ARE those folk who spot a niche and exploit it like there life depends on it: and i dont mean riping folk off!!<br />
<br />
I personally took the trader route in ec to gaining money, and sometimes u get lucky: folk sell items for silly amouunts cos they are bored or ignorant.  I once bought a drakel icehingy 27 45 2hb for 250-300 [bored high lvls druids do have there uses] and sold it few days later to some bloke who had a ubber rl friend.  lent his frind 30k for a spending spree, and the 2hb i was offering was GREAT cos he hit for more that 50 with it.  he gave me 1000p and a flayed turmoilskin belt.  Yeah he was insane!  Who was i to agruse with a madman :)<br />
<br />
Granted most players are more sensible:  but folk like that DO apear in EC,  sadly most of them are either broke or too arrogant to talk to.  however early in the morning or laste at night- bargains are there to be had.<br />
<br />
go fishing!<br />
<br />
oh yeah and try bargaining with the buggers!  I hate it when folk do it to me~ but it IS a skill and u need to do it tho make da shinies</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">hmmm hers a bit more waffle)<br />
<br />
to answer the bloke who started the topic&gt;<br />
<br />
do u have enoug pp to buy- jbhelm, jb boots, jb arms?<br />
<br />
imo  they great for freeing up 2 spell slots, and they seem to sell dirt cheep :)  hard to tell given the variation between servers.<br />
<br />
maybe u should do the exp grind upto 46, and then u have the option of gettin into planar raids&gt;  tho dont count on and decent drops, but at least u got 4 new zones to try out!<br />
<br />
At 46 start ur epic if u aint well into it already.  The boots are a life asaver (invent slot click) and camping the stables in COM is reasonable exp and say 2pp per mob&gt;  helps the funds add up!<br />
<br />
After nailing the spec courier.  Switch to a lower guk grp.  frenzy camp etc&gt; u get exp and chance of drops. after 47.  GO all out on exp to hit that magica 49!   try soloing in DL  or COM if ur go an ok ac.  I u get bored thers always karnors castle to mix it up, but can take ages to get a grp(<br />
<br />
lvl 49 dramtically improves ur optiions.  maybe even attempting that dubious practice of solo farming a dungeon or two (but dont quote me on that heheh)<br />
<br />
hope that helps  /waffle off  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The quickest way to make money, by far, is to level.  <br />
<br />
Put a few levels on you and you'll wind up spending one hour killing or camping stuff of equivalent value to the stuff you would take five or ten or twenty hours camping and killing when you were younger.  <br />
<br />
You'll have the same amount in plat or much better, but all that time will have been spent on leveling, not trying for loot, so you will be way ahead of the game -- same loot, plus levels.  And...leveling isn't anywhere near as boring as just hanging around camping stuff or killing greenies for fine steel or whatever.<br />
<br />
Guarantee you will like the game more if you take care of your money worries by leveling instead of burning yourself out at low levels camping and killing garbage.</div></div><hr />
