<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>JESTER</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all, myt rl gf just started to play, I have a 60 shaman so she decided to make a shaman also, now I am looking for place's to pl her up to 50-55, thank you all for any idea's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">umm, just go anywhere that you could solo those levels and pull for her with malo, root and slow for her, maybe toss on a dot or two, but make sure she does more damage than you<br />
<br />
check hunting grounds for those areas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fumeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ive done quite a bit of PLing with my shaman.  Slow it, or not and heal letting the person work on defense, and when the mob hits 49% beat it, nuke it, or send in your dog.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ive done quite a bit of PLing with my shaman.  Slow it, or not and heal letting the person work on defense, and when the mob hits 49% beat it, nuke it, or send in your dog.<br />
<br />
ackkk don't nuke<br />
<br />
Even if the mob is at 49%, if the nuke does over half of the mob's full hitpoints you WILL KS.  Dotting is a bit safer, but you have to be wary of our poison nukes as oftentimes the DD component will push our dots over half of most green-con's HP</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Denero Creed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I usually pull with a low lvl slow and then some sort of malo.  Then I usually through in a cripple as it usually turns a yellow mob into a green type.  She will be able to hit it much easier and do more dmg melee wise.  Buy her as much hp gear as you can give her at the low lvls...  Everything else doesn't make that much difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Take her to unrest, that should work until around 35 or so.  Plus most of the mobs won't run when low on hit points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>JESTER</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">thanks all for the help I will try it andsee how things work</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">just let her tank and melee with 2 dogdog, it will more fun and help her raise defense/weapon skill in this way; use only same level pet as her pet so don't need worry about outdamage her or mob agro on you.<br />
<br />
also you better don't slow mob at low level, you need mob hit her as many as possible so can raise defense skill, since she will level up fast with pling<br />
<br />
<br />
all you need to do is buff, pull, root and heal; add slow/cripple at higher level when fight last too long or mob hit hard<br />
<br />
for Pling zone :<br />
<br />
1-15 : Field of Bone(1-9), Kurn's tower(this zone rock)  !!<br />
15-25: Padual Cavern, unreal exp zone in game<br />
25-35: SolA goblin<br />
35-40: SolA gnome(best spot, endless gnome), SolB window, Lguk;  <br />
40-45: lots of place, hard to find a good dungeon for solo/pling so go outdoor zone like Downshawl Peak, Juggspine, EW, OT, CoM, DL.. exp is decent compare to 35-40; Lguk spider/bed room is ok spot too <br />
45-50: LoIIIo bloodgill.(easy mob+huge exp bonus+12minutes repop+raise your swim = don't skip this zone)<br />
50-55: HHK noble/name (easy mob + huge bonus + fast repop = best solo/pling spot)<br />
55-60: exp slow again, go get group for fun</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>fifidong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">1-24: Padual Cavern<br />
25-37: Solusek A<br />
38-45: Katta Guards near Tenebrous Entrance<br />
46-51: HHK Noble<br />
52-56: PoD<br />
57-61: PoV<br />
62-65: BoT</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I would switch that up a little...<br />
<br />
1-24 paludal<br />
25-37 highkeep guards<br />
38-40 pleveled highkeep nobles<br />
41-48 grouped with her on highkeep nobles<br />
49-55 solo highkeep(I hate to keep saying nobles, because realistically you should be doing bosh, bards, 3rd/4th floors, that wizzie chick, etc)<br />
<br />
At 55 she should be able to do whatever area you are in really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Maybe it's just me, but I don't like to kill guards.  Yeah the loot is nice, but I hate taking faction hits.  Probably because I don't have PoP yet and don't have access to the ever convenient banks/spell vendors/Guild trainers in POK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Are you sure she really wants to play a shaman?  I would suggest something that complements your character instead of duplicating it.  <br />
<br />
I went with a bard for my second box, myself.  The bard can pull (with lull -- works indoors and outdoors) and do crowd control (with mez or charm, as you please).  The bard can also increase your mana regen, your health regen, and provide songs to increase your direct damage and damage over time spells.  The bard is also useful for a variety of utility skills (fast movement, levitation, enduring breath, invisibility, and more).  As if this were not enough, the bard is *also* a middle-of-the-road melee.  Well, middle of the road might be too generous.  The bard is a slightly-better-than-dogdog melee, anyway.  I've only got my bard to level 55 so far, so I'm expecting her to get alot more useful in the near future (feign death, invulnerability).  <br />
<br />
One of the nice things about bards is that you are not forced to rely on their melee; put a instrument on, and you can output acceptable damage through songs alone.  At 55, its around 200 damage per tick, and gets slightly better as the bard levels.  This is not alot, but when you factor in the melee damage and the fact that unlike the shaman the bard can keep outputting that damage forever, its significant. <br />
<br />
The only downside (and its big) is that playing a bard is annoying -- without buying some basic gear (a weapon-drum, a weapon-brass instrument, and a non-weapon stringed instrument ring) you will be forever switching gear in and out.  Its gotten to the point where I'd rather fight my way through a zone than put my stupid flute in my hand just so I can invis myself.<br />
<br />
The point that I'm slowly making is that there are many classes that can compliment the shaman, whereas two shamans gives you nothing all that special.  After you malo a mob, then slow it, you'll just be slowly dotting it to death.  Thats fine, I guess, but choosing the right class could make your little duo that much more effective.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I agree with Deria actually.<br />
<br />
The fact that she wants to play a shaman is probably because she's seen you play, and that's what she knows. It's somewhat flattering, but it doesn't mean that it's the right class for her to play.<br />
<br />
Firstly, when she catches up with you enough to group together, shamans don't stack too well in groups. Your grouping needs will be much better served with a character that you can group with with at all times.<br />
<br />
If she picks something that you can duo with, and yet forms the foundation of a larger group, that means you can always play together. Pretty much any class can duo with a shaman, so it depends if she would rather play melee or caster, but that's a discussion for another place.<br />
<br />
There are other reasons why it might be better for her to pick a different character, less related to game mechanics.<br />
<br />
Naturally, I don't know what you're like as a couple, but there could be some problems with rivalry playing the same class. I speak from experience - I know it may have nothing to do with your situation, but it may be worth thinking about.<br />
<br />
If she picks shaman, she'll be following in your footsteps. That might be good, and might be a great introduction to EQ for her. However, it might also be restrictive after a point. If you can convince her to try something different, then you can still help her start out, and can teach her a lot about the game itself but she can learn her class and have *different* knowledge to you. I think it might help if she can learn the game from a different perspective.<br />
<br />
Personal experience stuff: When my brother started playing, my main character was a ranger, and he created a ranger because that was what he knew from me. He got quite competitive about it (more so than me, but I still responded to it) and although at first he learned from me, before long he resented any advice I gave (and as you might notice, I'm one of those people who tries to help and give advice, whether asked for or not!). There was definitely some rivalry going on there, more so with him, but then he's the younger of us. On top of that, we were also in the same guild and to some extent were competing for some of the same drops. When he joined a different guild and also later when I changed main to shaman, it made things a lot easier. I also saw similar happen with a friend who played an enchanter, when *his* brother picked an enchanter and joined the same guild.<br />
<br />
Also, another experience, I was dating another ranger (who I met in real life before I ever met in game), for about a month - and there was definitely a certain amount of resentment when I made ranger-based suggestions there too, even if they were perfectly reasonable things... Of course in your situation, she's starting out from scratch, which wasn't the case here, T was already around 55 (my ranger was 60, shaman was 52ish) when we started seeing each other.<br />
<br />
Like I say, it's going to be different with you but it might be worth thinking about these things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">1-15   FoB/Kurns or Warrens<br />
15-23  PC<br />
23-35  HK basement (exp mod here is almost as good as in PC, with Malo she can land spells easily)<br />
35-45  Tenebrous Mountains, Mines.  Good exp, GREAT cash,learn to deal with caster adds and how to control the pet indoors<br />
45-54ish Seb- Get resist gear and go to town.  Be ready to be dispelled.  Goodplace to learn to manage mana without KEI<br />
55-60ish PoI  No caster mobs, melee only.  <br />
60-65  get access to BoT, HoH and Tactics.  <br />
<br />
When you PL her do not use Turgurs from the get go; she needs to get her Defense up and learn the importance of AC.  Malo/sinia for her, but let her use her own slows.  Cripple also is a very nice spell, because against greens it can have a noticible effect.<br />
<br />
ANother strange effect that I have noticed that I think might be only in my head, but worth sharing; I regularly PL alts of my own to play with and it seems to me that they actually get skill increases in defense and weaponskills faster when I don't buff them to high hell.  I will usually toss only the buffs that are a single spell level higher than the character is and it seems to generate good results.  I'm always there to heal or root if necessary, so I don't feel like Im losing a whole lot. Once the characters get to about 30ish I can go full bore buff on them and it doesnt seem to affect anything.  /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I would highly advise AGAINST PL'ing up a shaman for her. When you get her to 55+, will she know how to play? No. She'll be asking you how to do everything, and not feel at all confident. She won't be having fun with you telling her what to do constantly. You also won't stack at all decently in a group. You will have to either duo together, or make all your own groups, because no one else (except friends) will ever want two shamans at once in a group. <br />
<br />
And, on top of all that... will she even like playing a shaman? Is it the style of character she really wants? <br />
<br />
I think it would be MUCH better to describe all the character classes to her (maybe you've already done this), and have her pick whatever sounds the most fun to her. It would probably be VERY good to have her play 3 or so different characters up to L 15-20. This is quite fast if you do most of the leveling in Paludal or the Warrens. Each time she starts over, YOU start over as well, with a complimentary class. <br />
<br />
Once she knows which character she really wants to play, and has a basic inherent understanding of how to play it, THEN you might want to PL her up to near the level of your shaman. Or just keep playing your duo together, and play your shaman when you're not playing with her. <br />
<br />
This'll take longer, but there's a MUCH greater chance she'll actually enjoy the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Maybe it's just me, but I don't like to kill guards<br />
<br />
<br />
You're a troll! You are supposed to kill guards!<br />
<br />
But I guess if you don't want 3-4% per solo kill through your mid 30s guards aren't for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Mascoma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I would have to agree with Kriel.  I also just started gettin my g/f into eq. Now she is a fiend! I play a Paladin and she plays a shaman.  I also have a level 60 enchanter, level 52 necromancer and a 40 monk.  I told her that she could pick out any class she wanted, then i would pick a complimentary class for her to level with. So she chose shaman. then we went from there. we are both Frogloks(she thinks they are cute) and i have been buffing her with c1 and all the extra buffs to make it almost like KEI. I also told her that we are going to start over again and pick out different complimenting characters. She has already decided that she likes the Cleric Class as a backup/alt, and we have been going to the bazaar and picking out weapons that are good for both classes. I have told her the importance of having a bigger manapool and also hp, so she has been going nutty grabbing stuff in the bazaar that has the +mana stats on it. *** its her character, like the saying goes you can lead a horse to water but.  We are currently level 24 in ECHO CAVERNS( cant say how much we like that zone) also we have been levelling with another 2 guildies too, Pally and Cleric. And she is getting the hang of chatting and playing at the same time=) (thats been her biggest problem) anyway If I were you and you were me would we still be the same people? I think not. All i can do is offer you my anecdotes and have you peel the lesson from them, granted my postcount is low but i have been playing since jan 2000.<br />
