<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Beezle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well I stopped playing EQ about September of 2003. I have a 65 Froglok Shaman with epic, the rest of his items aren't anything great. I saw that the new expansion was coming out and there adding a lot to the game, looks like I could have fun with EQ as I used to. The question is though, you think I should come back now? Or you think it's to late? Should I just wait for EQ2? Thanks for your opinions.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">on no.. i know where this one is heading.  Seriously.. do want you really want. Some people are having fun (like me) some people aren't.  I love playing my shaman and prob will be fighting till the day the game goes down.  If you think that you can play it again, then you should.  As far as EQ2 goes.. I think it looks alright, but I honestly don't want to start another game and have it control my life like eq has :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KumoeSpearbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Question is what are you coming back to?<br />
<br />
Are you coming back to a guild that is progressing into the Elemental Planes, or are you coming back to a guild that is stepping into GoD?<br />
<br />
If you are coming back to the former, you will have a much easier run of things, because of the backflagging system that exists on many servers. It is easier to get into the planes than it was a year ago, and LDoN is a great balm to use when the raiding get to you. <br />
GoD however, is a pothole. You need stellar gear and a great group of players to advance into it. After taking a year off, you might find the distance between your gear level and what is needed to be a problem. <br />
<br />
If you come back: Best bet is to either raid a lot in the planes, or spend a fair chunk of your time in LDoN gearing up. You will progress pretty quickly that way. <br />
<br />
Ok, to answer the question: its a good time to come back, with the caveats I mentioned above. But, with WoW and EQ2 around the corner, the time you would need to invest might be too much. <br />
In the end though, the choice is up to you :)<br />
<br />
Happy hunting,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Beezle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well when I come back I probally will be coming back to nothing. I'm probally not in the same guild a year ago, if it still even exists. If I came back I would try to get into a good guild right away. Oh yea, also, you think EQ has a much longer life to it or is it near the end? Thanks for all the replies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Umm.. not really Kumoe.  It's pretty damn easy to get geared up quickly by a GoD guild.  Hardest part is prob getting flagged for the areas, but that can be done pretty easily (minus the smith rondo event).  Enough equipment around exists in GoD that you can get just about a new item for every slot before you finish the Ikk trials.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>KumoeSpearbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Beezle: <br />
Eq has more life left than people give it credit for. It would be naive to think that WoW and other games won't hit the playerbase pretty hard, but with at least 3 more expansions, there is a lot of game left in it. Just not as many players in the near future.<br />
<br />
Valsuvious: Moot point now, but yes, that is true. As he is not coming back to a GoD guild, gearing up will be a lot slower.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you don't mind half empty servers, other than that problem the game is fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Were it me, I would wait until they actually release the expansion (in July).  This way, you know exactly what you are coming back to and what to expect in terms of difficulty/worth or character/etc.  <br />
<br />
I wouldn't say they are adding much with the expansion except level 70 and a bunch/few craptacular AA's/spells and some broken quests and events and so on.<br />
<br />
In terms of life left in EQ.  I don't see them ever shutting down the service until it is losing them money (5+ years most likely from now til that is an issue).  However, I do see the number of players dwindling as time progresses and customer service (if there is even CS now..) ceasing to exist.<br />
<br />
Personally, I see EQ as more of an addiction than a fun form of recreation.  If you are off it now, stay off it :)  That, however, is only my opinion.  You are free to decide for yourself, as is mentioned above my post somewhere.</div></div><hr />
