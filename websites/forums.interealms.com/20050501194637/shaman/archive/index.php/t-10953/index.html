<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Flargly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was wondering if anyone here plays an enchanter. Looks like end game soloing with a chanter is where its at. Levled my 57 shammy alt to 57 but now I'm thinking of maybe trying an enchanter and see if its as good as it sounds.<br />
<br />
Question is if anyone has any practical experience with a chanter. Sounds almost like its too good to be true with an AA ding every 20 mins ,ect?</div></div><hr />

That's because it is too good to be true.  There are only a very few enchanters on every server that can charm solo for great experience.  It is difficult to learn and even harder to master.  Even the enchanters that have absolutely mastered it do not get an AA in 20 minutes.  Not even close.<br />
<br />
Normal, run of the mill enchanters are fairly bitter at the moment.  Their crowd control has been removed from the post-60 game, for the most part.  They have become the buff whores that we hate to be.  They can still slow, to some degree, but charming is their only really good skill that they have left.  <br />
<br />
Of course, I don't play an enchanter, this is second hand information.  Take it with a grain of salt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I do play an enchanter, so I read the enchanter boards.  There are a 'few' enchanters reporting AA ding over 30-40 minutes.   It's dangerous.  There's only a few places you can do it, etc...<br />
Most of the enchanters that do it, do bother to wait for a rez because they can get the exp back faster than waiting for the rez effects to wear off.  (or perhaps they exaggerate to make eveyrone jealous....ya never know).<br />
<br />
The feeling of power and usefulness in doing crowd control is awesome.  It's also frustrating as anything :-)  Trying to target mobs that are in a pack around the MA and only being able to target the one the ma is on can be extremely frustrating.  In zones that have skeletons for example, I've taken to mem'ing an AOE mez and just standing way back and letting fly iwth that because skellies are so hard to target :-)<br />
<br />
If you are going to solo the whole way then it won't be such a problem for you, but then if you try to group at 50+ you'll suck at mezzing :-)<br />
<br />
If you are going to an enchanter solely for the solo ability at high end, I'd wait a month or two until the charm adjustments are over with.  You never know what the next patch is going to do to the ability to charm solo.  Also as a long time shaman you'll find you hate not having SOW up and hate having to use sow potions or acquire j/t boots.</div></div><hr />

I disagree strongly =)<br />
<br />
Its just a case of learning the tactics and being half awake (Come on, its not THAT hard to pay attention), if the ench isnt interested in loot, then I I'd bet they could get suprisingly close to 20 mins per AA if they had the right spot.  The hardest thing is simply getting the spells to do so.<br />
<br />
Crowd control removed?  Get out of PoN/PoD/PoV already, enchanters can't slow?  Whomever told you that needs to grow a pair or get 60+, I know several enchanters that can put a lot of shaman to shame as far as getting xp mobs slowed goes.  Granted, pre 60 its pretty rough for an ench to slow effectively in PoP, they simply havent got the mana regen and survivability for it, but come 60+ with a hearty helping of AA's, the power curve is utterly off the charts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Being an Enchanter is sort of like being a Free Safety in football. You, and only you are often responsible to clean up and correct the mistakes of your teammates.<br />
<br />
Overpull? Lock it down.<br />
Broken Mez? Re-mez.<br />
Non-assisting type? Explain the concept of mez.<br />
Running MOB? Root.<br />
<br />
Charm soloing is A LOT of fun. It can also lead you to pull your hair out. If you're going to go the route of rolling up an Enchanter I recommend: www.castersrealm.com and go to the Enchanter section.<br />
<br />
Realize that even with Rune, Bedlam, arcane Rune,etc you ARE in robes.I have yet to cast through 3 MOBS beating on me. Stun, does nothing but buy you 4-8 seconds. (And place you even higher on their aggro list)<br />
<br />
You WILL die a lot. You think Shaman slow has aggro? Now imagine Tashing a MOB and then dealing with it. You WILL die due to the mistakes of your teammates.  <br />
<br />
Enchanter is a fun class. Only you can decide if it's for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Or how about, if you want to solo post 60, you better pick a chanter. If you want to farm spectrals/drops in BoT, pick a chanter. <br />
<br />
CoD is an amazing spell for an always core class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I played a chanter for a long time and I can tell you it is the hardest class to play in EQ.  <br />
<br />
Someone breaks your mez cause they werent  assisting, you get the beat down.<br />
<br />
Tash and slow a MoB cause there is no sham. you get a beat down.<br />
<br />
AE mez and a couple of the MoBs resist, you get a beat down.<br />
<br />
Being a chanter is alot like being a shaman,  lots of buffing and hoping someone doesnt screw up and get you killed.<br />
<br />
I like being a sham better cause I always had such bad luck with charms and not being able to heal yourself sucks.<br />
<br />
They are also hard to PL since they dont really have any offensive spells.  I dont mean they dont have any just that what they do have is not very practicle.  <br />
<br />
I liked playing a chanter I just got tired of dieing cause people dont pay attention.  <br />
<br />
ps - It has been a while since I have played a chanter so my opinions may be a little dated.</div></div><hr />

Was wondering if anyone here plays an enchanter. Looks like end game soloing with a chanter is where its at. Levled my 57 shammy alt to 57 but now I'm thinking of maybe trying an enchanter and see if its as good as it sounds.<br />
<br />
Question is if anyone has any practical experience with a chanter. Sounds almost like its too good to be true with an AA ding every 20 mins ,ect? <br />
<br />
Can you get an AA in 20 minutes?  Yes<br />
<br />
Can you sustain an AA every 20 minutes ... I cannot but then I tend to be a grouping enchanter.<br />
<br />
With the change to Affliction items it is even more difficult now.<br />
<br />
I generally duo a 65 enchanter and a 65 shaman, both with 90+ AA.  A little low by todays standards but still enough to cover the core AA abilities on both classes. <br />
<br />
NOTE: I am not a shaman, I can play one in a supporting sense only.  I use my shaman to complement my enchanter and I can handle a shaman in a group/raid scenario but my enchanter is my primary focus ... at least until he dies :)<br />
<br />
When I solo, I use my shaman exclusively as a buff/heal BOT who is generally parked outside the zone I am soloing in.<br />
<br />
Abusing the shaman for heals/buffs/invis/SOW/Levitation ... pretty much everything to spare my mana possible.<br />
<br />
I have a cleric I can log on as required to buff me and ress me and some higher end gear and sustainably I estimate an AA every 45 mins to 60 minutes.  Charm is VERY random and thus on a given day I may approach an AA every 20 minutes on the next day I might hit an AA every 60 minutes thus the wide estimate range.<br />
<br />
Some enchanters claim sustainable AA every 20 minutes and perhaps they can but I cannot ... even with a shaman and a cleric at my beck and call I cannot sustain an AA every 20 minutes.<br />
<br />
The funny thing is ... 2 nights ago I was grouped with:<br />
<br />
65 warrior (roomie)<br />
65 cleric (roomie)<br />
65 enchanter (me)<br />
65 shaman (me)<br />
<br />
Using charm to kill Ogres in Tactics for J/C components and we were averaging about 1 AA every hour with each of us duoing 2 characters and my pet not hasted.  The warrior pulled and help a little on CC when my charmie broke ... the cleric healed my pet and the shaman helped keep him debuffed.  Both healers healed me.  Had our regular cleric been present, ie not a BOTTED cleric, I would have hasted my pet but he was not.  Given a hasted pet, we likely would have made about 1 AA every 45 minutes.<br />
<br />
So, can I guarentee that there are no enchanters out there that can Charm Solo for an AA every 20 minutes sustainable?  No ... I can merely say I have better than average equipment with all the useful AA, spells and I have buff/ress BOTS and I cannot do it sustainably.<br />
<br />
I have a wand of tranquility for C3, I have my Epic for Haste, I only have a mana preservation 3 item (mitigates slow but not charm).  My affliction extension and affliction haste items no longer work so I will be swiching to Mana Preservation IV in my ranged slot.  I can even break out a mana robe and use my shaman for healing while I robe on a horse to regain mana.<br />
<br />
With a good cleric, in the right spot I might be able to approach this rate duoing using heal for aggro transfer allowing a safe recharm.<br />
<br />
Shrug, I am not a soloing enchanter by nature, I much prefer grouping so I cannot say my opinion is the be all and end all of charm soloing :)<br />
<br />
P.S. Bards are the most difficult class to play :)<br />
<br />
