You earrings are fine for your lv imo. <br />
Try and get an Imbued Ivory Collar for your neck slot<br />
Mushroom veil isnt too hard to get and would be a nice face item<br />
Get another Velium fire wedding ring for your other finger.<br />
Try and buy a dragon bracer from WW, and a JBB for your other<br />
Stick the Regen in a bag and get a PSC from DN. Might be kinda pricy on your server, not sure. <br />
Get to kael arena and try and grab some Gladiator's Chain leggings, or do the Quest for Kromrif Military leggings.<br />
For your range slot, try and grab a ToB, highly doubtful at your lv, or the reward from 3rd shawl quest is fairly nice too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Disagree, keep the regen on, dont bag it!<br />
<br />
Youre not doing too bad, the only thing I'd change as a matter of urgency would be the serp bracer.</div></div><hr />
