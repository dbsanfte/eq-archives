<br />
Im 40 now with a WURM FANG and a IKKY REGEN BP, if that changes anything.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">long time ago, I ususlly slowed Gornit and let my dogdog(lvl49 pet) solo it while I canni dance to recovery mana for seafury; a good dogdog ususlly lose in fight if don't regen it or can still win if I assist with 1-2 JBB nuke. with regen(and haste of course) on, my dogdog alway win the fight :)<br />
<br />
Gornit have lots hp that is main problem for you. if you can solo mid level mob at DL, then you can take this Gornit easily</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jagara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i think you'd have trouble at 40 - not only will gornit be a close fight - but you have to put up with all the other deadbeats on the island, such as kiting/training druids who will dump seafuries on you.  It's also very out of the way and heavily camped.  I think its better to come when youre able to do seafuries (probably around 49 or so), and if you find Gornit open, then camp him, and do seafuries between spawns.  This way, if Gornit is camped (and he's always camped) you can do seafuries until he opens and you didnt waste the trip.</div></div><hr />

Lvl 40's high end now? =) jk man.  He's a tough one at that level I think, but you should be able to handle him easily once you figure out a technique that works for you.</div></div><hr />

And we had to walk from Halas to Freeport through the snow, uphill BOTH ways, ot stand in line for 35 years to have a chance at waiting in line for 6000 hours to kill in Najena.<br />
<br />
And we LIKED IT.</div></div><hr />

Actually...<br />
<br />
I think that describes the old Rubicite armor camps pretty well. Except maybe the &quot;liking it&quot; part. ;)<br />

<br />
I'd say 45 or so, plus or minus a level depending on your gear.<br />
There are one or two seafuries who wander close by with pathing, although I don't remember ever getting aggro due to radius from them.  At 44 you'll pick up a better pet, Alacrity, Agility, Guardian, Stamina, plus Talisman of Altuna to help your self-buffline.  These spells will make you more capable of soloing, especially with a new dogdog that has alacrity.<br />
<br />
The other soloers in OOT are a serious concern for you, especially at 40.  One unwanted add while you are cannidancing between ( 6 minute) Gornit spawns would likely send you running or kill you outright if you get stunned before you can slow it.  Add the tainted/corrupted Seafury bouncing around plus Quag the mana-sucker, and you could be looking at negative exp if you aren't careful.<br />
<br />
The pirates near Gornit are a well-used landmark, as is Gornit's spawn point, so soloers frequently pull to either side of the tents.  The stone ring is another popular pull-to point for those hunting Seafuries.  This means your escape routes if something goes bad may be populated.  You don't want to accidentally train others, and heading up away from the water's edge could entail an untimely death.  <br />
<br />
Remember, OOT is good for solo exp up until 54, then things really start to go light blue.  It is likely that the people you train one day will be there the next.  Building friendships with your OOT neighbors is a good policy.  I always immediately sought out soloing mages and swapped a full buff line for their pet (and sow for them) in exchange for a focus ring/bracer.  WELL worth it for you.<br />
<br />
By the way, Quag Maelstrom is actually very easy.  His mana-drain is a proc, not a cast, so just make sure dogdog keeps all the aggro and you should be fine.  But I wouldn't risk it with the dog you have at 40.  He'll drop too quick.<br />
<br />
The distance concerned to OOT shouldn't be a problem for you.  Bind at the firepots in Timorous Deep.  This puts East Freeport within easy reach no matter where you roam.  Waiting for the boat gives you a chance to self-buff and get back to full mana before you head out.  <br />
<br />
My personal trick to get the Gornit camp was to always cast levitate and then scale of wolf on myself as soon as the boat came within sight (while looking off to the right from docks) in EFP.  As soon as you zone in to OOT, jump off the boat and start running across the wavetops to Gornit.  Gornit's loc is pos600, neg5700.  The Sister Isle dock is at pos275, neg9200.  This will give you an edge over any other boat passengers in the race to Gornit.  Of course, if it is already camped, you are SOL. :o  Once you are there, summon pet, give him haste and chloro and you are good to go. :)<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. :D<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />
