<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shamolite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all I have been playing my shaman for about a year and a half now. Started with a pally and got him to 35 and then made a new shaman and havent left him since. I dont play very much so my shaman is only level 53. And i guess i am just a stupid noob, as i cant seem to make money hand over fist as everyone else seems too. or find those fantastic items to make myself the uber shaman.<br />
<br />
I cant even figure out how to make a magelo profile as everytime i have loaded the software it never seems to send it off to them.<br />
<br />
I wanted to thank everyone for their posts here as some of them have been really helpful in helping me find things to work towards. Like JBB, and epic.<br />
<br />
I have actually completed most of my epic and am up to the point of doing fear for the tear to finish it. Like some other posters I have seen I am not a member of any uber guilds so my access to this particular part of the quest is limited. And as i have limited funds available in game cant really pay someone to help by doing the Multiquest turn in. But there have been numerous instances in game where i have been helped by the EQ community as a whole in doing different parts of this quest. Such as the Mistmoore raid for black dire. and the killing of Neh Aisheer. So I want to say thanks to everyone.<br />
<br />
I Greatly appreciate all the helpful hints you guys provide and Willc ontinue to Audit the boards for more useful information.<br />
<br />
Thanks Again.<br />

Ps: if anyone has any ideas for cash making , would love to hear em. Though I much rather enjoy doing something the hard way than buying it. It does prove usefull to have some cash for some things.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Dont worry, Shamolite. Not everyone has loads of plats. I've been playing 3.5 years and usually have only around 8-10K max in the bank. Most of the time it's far less. Spells kept me broke when I was a youngin', then it was alchemy and other tradeskills. I'm 62 and never had a fungi tunic or JBB. They are probably nice toys, but a skillful shaman can survive without them.<br />
<br />
As far as a decent coin spot, lately I have been killing everything in Dulak's Harbor for cash. That might not be as profitable at your level, but you'd get the added bonus of exp there. All greenies to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">OK , well your NOT a stupid newbie to start with , at 52 my gear was pretty weak and i was pretty damn poor, you just need to commit yourself to making cash if you really wanna buy things. <br />
<br />
A few places i can think of to make cash off the top of my head for your level.<br />
<br />
<br />
#1 High Hold Keep - The guards in the zone drops fine steel and plat each. The fine Steel you sell to a mechant on the first floor who just happens to not be affected by anything you kill in the zone. The bottom is easy and gets a lil tougher to kill each floor you go up, beware of the nobles and the roaming female which i cant remember her name right now. <br />
<br />
#2 Old Seb - A really good option for you though maybe tough, would be to get a group and go to seb and farm these items. Seb is a gold mine , even if your not camped where you wanna be there is a good chance that something there will drop that you can sell for good play or atleast gems and PP will make it usualy worth hanging out there for a few hours , plus itll be good XP for you.<br />
<br />
#3 Old world planes - Hate, Fear, Growth are all good places that drop ALOT of gems worth selling , i can usualy clear around 1.5k solo when im there.<br />
<br />
#4 Rathe Mountains - Well i have mixed feelings about this place, while killing the Hill Giants here are great to make cash, its very over populated and farmed. You will no doubt find your spawns being ganked and people yelling alot, its a very volitile zone and personaly i hated it, but its really good cash. It is streaky though, sometimes the giants wont drop for quite a long stretch, then suddenly they do.<br />
<br />
#5 LoY - The new Expansion is pretty good for cash , some good drops if you farm areas to force the named spawns and all those swords and shield that drop sell for a few plat too, probly not my first choice to farm for cash, but as said above, you will getnice XP still as you go.<br />
<br />
#6 Everfrost Peaks - There is 3 Static spawns of ice giants on the way to permafrost dungeon ( vox lair ) and they drop a nice amount of cash also. The trick to alot of these places im naming is to talk to the people that are currently camping it and get on the waiting list so that when they leave you can move in after them, i got NG camp so many times that way im Seb.<br />
<br />
#7 Tradeskills - This i cant directly point you to, but if you go to www.eqtrader.com you can find out what trades are used alot or even just ask around in game. Farming up those supplies and selling them in the bazaar can be very lucrative.<br />
<br />
#8 Crystal Caverns - This is a tricky area, while its a excellant source of cash and velium bricks ( sell in bazaar ) i would suggest you  becareful to not over run people leveling there and drive them out. For a 30-40ish player this place is godly on the XP and cash, one of the best dungeons for its level in the game IMHO and it would be unethical if you ask me to come in and deprive a XPer a good area so you can farm cash for toys. oddly enough there is usualy places to kill things in here which isnt camped.<br />
<br />
#9 Mob hunting - If you complete you stoisicm quest you will be a very good soloer for your level at which this point you might wanna do what i do. Track mobs and kill them. At this point in my career i dont enjoy hours of farming cash, i tend to check on key mobs that i know i can solo and sell the loot i get form them in the bazaar. Very very fun for me and very rewarding.<br />
<br />
#10 Vamp Castle in TM - At your level i dont see why you cant get a group and go farm the vampires in the castle in TM. The named have a chance to drop some really good loot and ive always been happy when i walked away from there after a hour or 2 of soloing.<br />
<br />
<br />
there is other places , but i dont know if they fit your level and i cant give away all my secrets ;)<br />
<br />
Anyway , good luck and i hope i was helpful. Peace..</div></div><hr />

You can't use the Magelo update program to auto update your character if you haven't paid for their premium service. You will have to manually create and update the character. If you are a premium subscriber, I'm not sure what could be wrong. Maybe firewall or something...would need more info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>hdaana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">OOT seafurbies are good xp at your level and if the gem drops are good a couple hundred an hour of pp.also if you can get gornit hes basically a misplaced giant from RM.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shamolite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks for all the info I will try out some of these suggestions next time i log in. <br />
Didnt know about the magelo premium service restriction thanks. I guess i will have to do it the long way and add each item manually. Which is what I started to do until i saw the program they had for it and thought I was doing something wrong.. <br />
<br />
Thanks for all your help guys and I will continue to audit the boards to try and make myself the best shaman I can be so as not to cast any shadows of despair on my fellow shamans of Norath</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>xDeMeNtiAx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">if u have SoL, go to DSP and farm the rockhopper caves ( if its not the simbatas ) the hides sell well to tailors on my server...used to make at least 1k an hour when clearing a lot, at ur level its exp too still i believe...would be easier with the 55 pet, but doable</div></div><hr />

I'm not much into gear or farming for plat, so I have some cheap items that you might try.<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=542861<br />
<br />
In particular, try:<br />
Metal linked crown<br />
Leaf scale gloves<br />
Large smoothmetal torque or black sapphire velium necklace<br />
<br />
All these items should be well under 1k each, probably closer to 500 plat or much less.<br />
<br />
I don't have one, but you might check out crystal spider eyes for face.<br />
<br />
There are plenty of upgrades from there, but they'll get you started.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Hagle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Money will come but if your smart you wont waist much time on getting it till your higher lvl. At lvl 61 950ac 2k hps I got sick of waiting for torpor to drop off a dragon at a guild raid so I solo camped Emp. 2 weeks later I walked out of seb with JBB/Hiero cloak torpor sells 70k  Malo sells 45k SS sold for 30k 3 other spells each sell 10k and about 5k worth of crap spells had like 20 of these hehe. I was very tough and sometimes frustrating but well worth it.<br />
<br />
<br />
PS. tag along with a group and then log once in emp tomb till they leave can do the same with crypt. CR's sometimes take all day but its worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bilei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If you dont mind doing some faction work, head on over to Odus and wack some kobolts around in the warrens for a while. It will get you faction to get into paineel. Hail one of the skellie guards outsdie the gate near the newbie area and say &quot;i need keyz&quot; . If he gives ya one, you are good to go in town. Head down the elevator and look for skellie guards. Start wacking them. They drop a couple pp but also a sword and shield that sells for like 7p combined, which you can sell to the vendors there since the skellie guards have no faction hits at all. Beware of the guards near the necro hall and the bard skellies dancing in a bar. You can get adds which can be pretty nasty if you pull near that area. But there are tons of guards around town you can wack trouble free.</div></div><hr />
