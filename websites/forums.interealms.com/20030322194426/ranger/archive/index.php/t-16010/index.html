<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Adonna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wondering what good places there were to go to at 55. I have my hs key and os key. I dont care wether its grouped or solo. The griffons of JP are almost all light blue now and frankly im getting tired of JP all together. So where else is there? I know at 54 Velks exp seemed to go by slower then soloing blue/light blue in JP so I am guessing its even slower at 55. Thanks for any input.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dranex Tical</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yeh, grouped Velks will be slower than JP. At 55 JP isn't bad as long as all you do are anacondas.<br />
<br />
Not sure how it would work out at 55, since I didn't try it till 56, but you could try fear kitting the PoJ rats.<br />
<br />
Anywhere you group old world is gonna be about the same, though Velks is the best bet, since people don't really inhabit Seb and other places much anymore (at least on my server).<br />
<br />
FG is cool if you can get a group there. Umbral in a group. Maiden's has always been the worst kind of crap xp for me, but people always seem to recommend it, so I guess you could try there. Scarlet Desert can be good xp in a group, as can the Grey (although I saw a little more movement in Scarlet). Siren's Grotto is kinda cool in a group. Dragon Necropolis can be pretty good too.<br />
<br />
Check out the Continentaly Levelling Guide thread, has some good spots.<br />
<br />
If you can steal someones cleric (or a fungi would do I suppose) Velks can be awesome solo XP (provided it doesn't look like Disneyland on New Year's Eve in there).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Razuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you can get a healing partner, I would suggest Ketta guards near the Twilight Sea zone. They are good all the way to 59.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">For PoP zones, I've found PoInnovation to be pretty good, even the &quot;yard Trash mobs&quot;  I've gotten 40% into 54 in about 4 hours there w/ a good group (Cleric, Shamen are musts, chanter/bard optional though 2 tanks w/o)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If your guild has a chanter between 57 and 61 or so, ask him/her if they want to duo with you in PoN.  You assist them with thier charm kiting by shooting (you do have a Tolan's Bracer, I hope; not feasable otherwise) and by ensnaring both thier pet (before charm) and the pulls.  GREAT xp.<br />
<br />
Despite what people will tell you (or me) I was doing this last night with 90 percent of my xp going to AA.  In an hour and a half of that, I'd gotten 2 yellow and 4 blue AAxp bubbles.  Honestly, I've not seen that kinda xp in a full group in PoP yet (though being only 55 myself makes it a tad hard to get into the good camps, unless friends are there).  We broke up a couple trains last night, as well.  I was partnered with a 61 chanter; he told me that 57 is when he started charm kiting PoN because at 55 his spells wouldn't last long enough to make it feasable.  He also told me that rangers and druids are the best partners for such an endeavor.</div></div><hr />
