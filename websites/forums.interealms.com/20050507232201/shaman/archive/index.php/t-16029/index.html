<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Yhakfiend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all, I was wondering if anyone knows if the &quot;Wandering Erudite&quot;, who is Etumer, de-spawns after transporting you to the battleground for this event.  I may have some late-comers tomorrow night, so I've been trying to figure out if I can get some groups in there to give it a few shots, or if it's a one-chance only deal.  <br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ScRuBbA</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i dont think he despawns, but the event starts as soon as the first group enters... that being said, latecomers wouldnt do much good, since only 4 groups can be in there maximum, and if you dont have enough people to start with, things can get pretty ugly... usually 3 groups take the wings (east/west/south i think) and 1 group can travel to whichever side needs help, usually south from experience...<br />
<br />
but yea, if latecomers come its unlikely they could get in, as it counts by groups (2 people = 1 group) so if your guild has already started the event, the likelihood of you having extra slots for groups is not high, or if you have 3 (little riskier), all latecomers would need to be in a group and get to the NPC to get into the event with you guys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>writher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Pffff....my guild did this event with three groups the other night and we're nowhere near uber *points at new earring*.<br />
<br />
Hint: It is possible to split Mujaki from the servants on the platform with him to get Mujaki alone.  Think hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Yhakfiend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks Scrubba, I guess I phrased it wrong.  I plan on taking in a full 4-group force.  <br />
<br />
I'm trying to instill a little discipline in raid-times and coordination with my guildies, so I told them that since it's a limited number, I'm going to take them in on a first come-first serve basis.  But I don't want the people who have viable excuses (school, work, etc.) to be left out if they have to be late because it's only a one-shot event.  So I told them to show anyway, and if Etumer stays up after the first 4 groups try,  we'll form up new groups and take a second (and if need be, a third) run at it if possible.  <br />
<br />
Best case scenario would be, win or lose, the trigger mob stays up and we can try again.  But I couldn't find any info on whether this is the case or not.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for the help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Was pretty fun figuring out this event, we usually do with less than 3 groups as well and concentrate on one gravestone only, then split Mujaki from his friends and beatdown.<br />
<br />
The three 'areas' you fight in are near enough to each other (bring up map if you have them downloaded), that we just levitate/sow everyone and run up the sides of one of the buildings, then run over to the wall and you can go across to the next 'area', as long as someone goes to the normal corner where you are ported to it will start the next Mujaki (bring it up on map to see how they are close to each other).<br />
<br />
If you end up trying to get to the next 'area' and you overshoot the wall, you will go underneath the 'areas' and you can run up through where the gravestone is that mobs spawn to join your raid in the next 'area'.  Before we figured this out we just had people agro stuff from above, die and drag their corpse back to the group through the ground.<br />
<br />
Not sure if this is considered an exploit, but saves everyone having to leave and come back and the issues of Etumer not sending your groups to the same Mujaki area.  He will run the event 3 times and I think Mujaki is a 3 day spawn (for each area).<br />
<br />
Not many know about the event or care (was always up unless we took him down), great reward for the risk, he isnt too hard except for the fear part.<br />
<br />
edit- he does despawn.</div></div><hr />
