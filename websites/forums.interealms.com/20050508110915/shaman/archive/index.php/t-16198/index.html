<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>RangerKeaianea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is there any sort of formula one can use to derive resist rates when comparing caster level versus mob level?  At level 51, let's say, what level would a mob be that a person would get a 100% resist rate on all spells cast, assuming average resists?  Trying to see if there is a general sort of way to figure this out.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

First off, bout time you dumped the ranjah and came to the real powah.<br />
<br />
Second, its a pretty safe bet if its RED con, you will get bounced pretty much without a debuff of some sort.  Malo line is your friend.  It seems there is a separate slot for shaman spells for resist checks hehehe.  Oh, shaman casting?  Gonna resist at least 1 of the three spells you attempt there wanna be prophet.<br />
<br />
Third, Yellow..pretty much see above.<br />
<br />
Fourth, Whites and Blues should slow on first attempt depending on mob.  There used to be a great list of slowables floating around here somewhere.  Maybe its sticky up top.<br />
<br />
Fifth, again, welcome to the wonderful world of shaman.  I hope some woodie ranger gets you in trouble as much as Bala, that pali and you got me into hot water ;)  It was well worth the fun though girlie!<br />
<br />
edit: Found the slow link.  Figured the Slow guideline will work on the rest of your spell lines.  You a smart girl so you can figure most of this out.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's pretty straight off a 5 resist modifier per level.<br />
<br />
So a lvl60's turgurs would be at +30mr compared to a lvl65 casting on the same target. <br />
<br />
However, when you start to approach an eight level discrepancy between target and caster, the resist rates become much more nonlinear.</div></div><hr />
