<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fireonyx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Wondering which duo would work out the best... currently my shammy is 53 (horse, JBB, ikky bp, tae ew shield, standard 1-3k gear for the rest).  I was thinking HIGH DPS, lower amount of twinkage (initial 2-10k o gear or so, as they level, and we get more drops, the gear will go up.), 2 boxer :)  And what has been your experience /w 2 boxing?  Worth while?  Fun enough w/o adding to much complications?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grixx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've been 2-boxing for a few years now and I've tried Shaman/Monk, Shaman/Ranger, Shaman/SK to some extent or another.  By far, the most effective combo I've found is Shaman/SK.  The other melee choices I mentioned are fine choices - and would work just fine in most cases.  The difference between those choices and SK are that the SK has superior tanking ability (crucial if you ever plan to duo in PoP Tier 2), a decent FD, the darkness line for snaring (crucial for runners - and very handy for keeping agro), and some self-healing ability with their procs and lifetaps.  My monk and ranger worked fine before PoP - but with mobs hitting between 250 and 600 in the planes, I don't think I'd ever choose anything but a plate tank as a duo mate at this point.  The Shaman/SK duo is a force to be reckoned with.  Btw - I chose Ogre for SK - the frontal stun immunity is so nice.<br />
<br />
G'luck in whatever you choose.</div></div><hr />

I really enjoy 2 boxing, that is why I do it.  I dont get much time to go and XP lately, spend most of the time raiding.   I also 2 box on the raids, sometimes being the MA and if the only shaman on the raid the main slower too.  Yes, it gets kind of hectic, and after 10 hrs you are completely exhausted.  But to me its fun.  Only thing I havent been able to do effectively on raids is being the main slower and puller at same time.  It just gets too distracting.  In XP groups or duo its fine, since you are typically pulling and tanking.  But when you have to pass off tags, split, etc., it gets kinda messy.<br />
<br />
Only thing else to say, is twink your SK as much as you can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kaneex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I feel the complete opposite, shammy/pally is best combo, why?  I'll tell you why...<br />
<br />
Pallys can buff big time, they can give symbol, heroic bond, and Brells Barrier...they can heal in a pinch (sk sure cant), they have lay hands that can save your butt, they can rezz for 90%, they can maintain aggro over you, and over all i fell they make a better tank because they can buff themselves to have alot more hps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>JomoMojo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I would go with a magician as your duel box partner.  You won't need to spend much money at all to twink them, as they are not very dependent on equipment, where as a melee is fully dependent on their equipment.<br />
<br />
Both shamans and mages get pets, which can easily tank the mobs you'll be exping at your level now.  My shaman is 61, almost 62.  I've been pulling my mage through his low 50s in the Plane of Innovation, with turgurs on the mobs my 51 earth pet can solo the mobs with a heal here and there.  The mage DPS is also quite nice, when you find yourself in a situation with an add it is fairly easy and feasible for the mage to dump his mana into nukes and burn the first mob to a crisp.<br />
<br />
As the mage gets higher, they also get some realy nice focus items and even better pet items.  My parsed DPS of my shaman pet and my mage pet was around 50 DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What point are buffs from a pally?  If you are going to be casting all them, odds are you will have to get Kei anyways, or gonna be alot of downtime.  Virtue/Aego just as easy to get while getting them.<br />
<br />
You get into pinches more often with a Pally due to inability to FD when a bad pull happens.<br />
<br />
Better tank arguements are usually concerning PoP.  Staying out of PoP and a monk would do fine for a tank.  In PoP, an SK/Pally are better.  Which meaning you are in PoP, a rez is not an arguement since there are graveyards and its usually no problem finding a rez.  If you are having to be rezzed often, you are doing somethign wrong.  Dying often is not how its supposed to go.  Dying once a day is a bad rate really, unless you are raiding.  Then as far as raiding goes, sometimes I am happy to only die once.<br />
<br />
Pally weaknesses:  No Snare.  Unable to FD on a bad pull.  In a bad situation with an SK, you can gate the shammy, and FD when shammy is clear.   Having 5k or even 10k Hp only matters in how fast slow is landed when your biggest heal is only 2k.  Then it just means if you kite it until slow lands or not.  If its not a mob hitting for 500+, then it doesnt matter, which means you wont be getting great XP at 65.<br />
<br />
In my opinion, the weaknesses outweigh the benefits.  SK is the only way to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">As my arguement was for melee class, I agree that best class overall is a mage partner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Mage and SK are the best.<br />
<br />
I play a lot with my brother who's a 59 Mage and it's easy to take down most anything. I don't need to rely on heals so much and if things get nasty he can always chain pet. Though that's only if I get a ton of resists on slow which rarely happens since my brother pulls with his malo line. I prefer the earth pet for it's chain rooting, though lately he's been enjoying his air pet for the stuns.<br />
<br />
As for SK, I've been playing a bit with a 61 friend who has his epic and it's just downright silly. In PoN we can chain pull the yard trash and I'll only have to slap a gimp CH on him every 5 or 6 fights or so. I can make half a yellow in about 45 mins with him.  And I rarely drop below 70% mana even without KEI.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 lol little biased with your sk/sham combo eh? heheh.  Hps matter and hps go on my shaman and my pally. You forget the pally strenghts too. When a slow is resisted i can buy health time by stunning the mob for a few seconds while i recast slow. I have a couple stuns that can land and i can keep the mobs attention from a distance while getting it slowed and i can also root with both chars. <br />
<br />
    An sk can save his ass when things can bad but so can a pally. Root /da and never having to look for rez. I have a 1100 point heal , heal over time and a 800 point quick heal that will go up with heal aa's. <br />
<br />
   I'll give ya the snare and fd. I can pacify but that only works up lvl 55 mobs. Root is ok alternative though snare does rule. But my pally and i can also kill healers easier and deal with gaters easier. Sk's do have more uitily in pulling and snare and better dps with the taps and dots and nukes they get but dont write off pallies as being useless. Pally can give you options also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Fireonyx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I never limited it to mellee :)  Doing research sucks, but so is saving money for gear for the mellee.  Im not looking to take down the biggest baddest mobs out in PoP, but more for exp stuff.  Can a mage pet tank mobs in PoP?  Tier 2 stuff? (When I get slow on them... I dont mind a few rounds of combat being beat upon, but then again, havent been to tier 2 yet, and that will be quite a while.)  Or will necro pets be able to tank?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">But my pally and i can also kill healers easier and deal with gaters easier.<br />
<br />
I hate gaters.<br />
<br />
SK's also get Harmshield, which does same thing as DA.  Pacify is nice, but rarely do I need to split mobs that are 55 or lower anymore.  Mobs that Gate and CH are the only ones that I try to avoid.  I don't like FD splitting nukers either.  <br />
<br />
I know shaman that duo with SK's and Pallies.  The biggest arguement for the Pallies is that they have rez, and have buffs so they die less.  Heard it over and over.  When asking the ones that duo with the SK's if it would be easier to have a class that can rez, most reply they almost never die, so it wouldn't make any difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I never meant to imply a pally is not an option.  It is still a very good option as a duo partner for a shaman.  Some people would rather shoot their own foot to playing a palidan over an SK.<br />
<br />
Slows go bad, an SK can tap.  SK also has dot/taps.  And then there is the ugly /disc leechcurse.  Which will heal you for like 12 sec, all the damage you inflict.  Yes, if you miss alot, that can go bad.  But I have got 1200 HP of healing from it before too.  Then there is the pet thing.<br />
<br />
But if you want to take the palidan arguement, get an SU3 pally and go hunt undead.  Each class can really shine in their own environment.  They can do different things in different places.  Overall the SK is probably less limiting, but if you choose your hunting grounds carefully the Pally can be just as viable of an option, sometimes even better in some situations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Monks tank just fine in PoP, I don't see all the big deal.  I've helped get 3 monks to 65 now duo'ing or trio'ing (2 monks + me) with them while they tank in PoV, or any mob in BoT.<br />
<br />
Obviously if you want the best duo, you need to be Iksar, so that rules out paladins.  I have a couple of Iksar SK friends, and they're pretty good in a duo situation, but I'd probably take a monk over them most of the time duo.<br />
<br />
And as far as 2boxing goes, it's probably easier to box a monk (no mana, just sit or fd if you need to canni up between fights).<br />
<br />
In the end, either one will work well for you (as long as they are iksar), it's just a matter of personal preference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Taking damage is inefficient.  Necros are dominant duo partners.  Massive damage, amazing pullers, freakish utility and almost perfect synergy with shaman abilities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Btw let me just clarify before i read anything else. I wasnt doing the pallies rule and sks suck thing. I group with a friend alot and he is a higher lvl sk. I just feel sometimes what pallies can do is often over looked and they can be underrated. Sk's are very good two box choice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Hehe nukers suck to pull. Take a week to get to camp and when not resisted take a nice chunk of my friends health. Sk's also have that burst dps that a palidan will never have. Putting a proc on my weapon helps but sure isnt the same heh. <br />
<br />
  To answer more of part of the original question. I love 2 boxing and wouldnt go back. It can be busy but more reason why i like it. When i play one for breaks its alot less work but can (to me) get boring when i play one which i do sometimes. There are so many combos that can make work and sure we all can give you sitations where our combo works the best or better. But really what appeals to you? like to cast alot? Like to kung fu stuff til it drops? like running a pet? like dotting? like nuking? figure that part out and can make almost any combo work with a shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Profundo Basso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">After doing research for about a week (can't actually play this week, so I'm occupying myself with thinking about playing) I've narrowed it down to the following duos -<br />
Shammie/Monk<br />
Shammie/SK<br />
Shammie/Necro<br />
Pallie/Wiz<br />
Shammie/BL<br />
<br />
Shammies are all about buffs, dots and slows.  Ideal for partnering with melee types.  But how about stacking dots with a necro?  Or buffing a BL, the BL pet, your pet, and you - then beating up a mob?<br />
<br />
I've seen the holy wars over Monk vs SK as partners with Shammie.  Either one is a fine choice, with some interesting facets.<br />
<br />
I have a 58 bard which I've primarily soloed outdoors.  If you haven't tried that, its fun, but a little strange.  I've gotten full levels without taking a single hit,  and while suiciding 3 times in 3 hours to get FOM. <br />
<br />
But all that time, there were dungeons I never set foot in, which I'd love to hit now with a duo designed for dungeon crawls.  One thing's for sure - 2boxing with a bard means not using 70% of the bard's capabilities, and you could replace a one-song bard with KEI pretty easily.  Bards are best when they can be played actively.  A Shammie/SK combo multiplies each chars effectiveness, rather than decreasing it.<br />
<br />
I'm picturing this kind of scenario - Shammie buffs SK pet, own pet, and SK.  SK single pulls with FD, SK snares and tanks, Shammie slows and dots.  Shammie sends in buffed pet.  SK sends in buffed pet.  Mob is dotted, snared, slowed, hit by 3 hasted meleers, lifetapped ... dies.  Am I missing any nice strategies.<br />
<br />
I'm planning on making a shammie with all the WIS, STA and Mana he can get, and an SK that can take a beating and  keep aggro (can you say OGRE?).  <br />
<br />
Here's a question - how long does it take for a high WIS shaman to med from 0-full?  Would it be worthwhile to camp the SK and bring up the bard for AE manasong during medding?<br />
<br />
Bards hate summoning mobs and casters.  Anything that doesn't snare, root, or nuke and is oudoors fell to the beating of my drum.  Tantor (61)and Stronghorn (63) were easy solo kills at lvl 53.  Would a Shammie/SK duo have any mobs to avoid, or any soft targets?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Only ones I try to avoid are ones that gate.  Other than that, almost anything is worth a shot if slowable.  Big boss mobs not being considered.<br />
<br />
Pick 2 classes that are fun to play together and fun to play individually.  Do that, and you will be happy.<br />
<br />
I think a mage/shaman combo would be alot of fun.  I really might consider trying that someday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Not speaking in a PoP-tanking sense, but I've found the ranger/shaman combo to be pretty good.  I also have a monk the same level as my shaman, but it's nowhere near as fun, and the ranger does practically the same damage, while providing the same tanking, but way more utility.  I've all but retired the monk.<br />
<br />
Ranger has good DPS, with his epic and decent main-hander.  He has nukes/DoTs/Damage shield to compliment his damage.  Snare is just awesome... keeps running mobs from running, and keeps the fight in a close territory.  Snare makes dungeon crawls much easier.  Tracking is great for locating named mobs or just scouting the area out to see what you're up against.  Ranger gets some decent buffs that stack with shaman buffs.  In outdoor zones and dungeons, rangers can single-pull easily (in fact, easier than FD splitting) with Harmony.  He can spot heal (300-pt heal) and root adds.  If my shaman is getting beat on, a ranger can grab agro real quick with snare/taunt/damage/root.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, the shaman compliments the ranger's damage with a decent pet and good DoTs.  Shaman buffs are right up a ranger's alley, and they do need buffs.  The biggest thing to the ranger that a shaman can provide is slow and debuff, as even a ranger can tank most slowed mobs if he has decent gear.  Together with slow and the shaman's decent heals, it keeps the ranger happy.<br />
<br />
With a ranger/shaman combo, you got:<br />
<br />
- Slow (Turgur's)<br />
- melee/resist debuffs (Cripple/Malosi)<br />
- Good enough healing (between the both of them)<br />
- Tracking<br />
- Snare<br />
- DPS<br />
- Root<br />
- Haste<br />
- Damage shields<br />
- Pet (throw some weapons on a shaman pet and help his DPS)<br />
- Regen<br />
- DoTs<br />
- Decent buffs<br />
<br />
It's just a great system: get buffed up, ranger single-pulls something and snares it, shaman slows/malosi's/cripples, send pet in, DoT, and let ranger and pet and DoT eat up the mob.  Keep health topped off, and do it again.  If you got KEI on both toons, there's almost no down-time.  If you don't have KEI it's not a big deal --- shaman canni's and down-time is still not bad at all.<br />
<br />
I have considered a SK combo, and I think this might be really good for high-end content once you're able to get your SK a Windblade or equivalent, but until then... the SK is gonna lack in DPS...  a ranger rips through stuff pretty damn quick, but I'd need a serious weapon for a SK to keep up.  No question that a SK can tank better, but with slow, things are very doable with a ranger.  If you start getting into high-end content that is untankable by a ranger, grab a cleric and plate-tank and you're set.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that a duo is meant to be efficient --- but they just aren't built to handle extremely tough fights... there will always be situations where a bigger group with a cleric, enchanter, plate-tank, DPS person will do a much better job than a duo: but there are many situations where a good duo can do some big stuff if you know what you're doin'.  There isn't a duo out there that can cover every angle.<br />
<br />
I do like the necro/mage, necro/rogue, necro/shaman --- necros make good partners simply 'cause of fear-kiting... but there are many situations where fear-kiting isn't feasible.  The ability to stand in one tight spot and take stuff down via a tank/healer combo is pretty valuable.  If you're looking outside the tank/healer duo... then just make a necro and be all-in-one hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Profundo Basso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Poguk - I hate you.  I was all set on an SK/Shammie.  Now you have me wanting to do the ranger.  i guess it just goes to show that there are a lot of good combos and you just pick the classes and races you like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I did the shaman/monk route for a long time, but the huge monk nerf last September pretty much ruined that combo and the &quot;un-nerf&quot; a month or two ago has still left monks as pretty much &quot;rogue lite&quot;.  Their ability to pull aside, they get creamed in PoP unless you have superb gear and perma-slowed mobs.  Monks are the only class in the entire game w/ an AC penalty at present- best part is they can't even loot efficiently or their meaningless AC gets even worse.  They also hold aggro for crap, which means if you want to slow early (which you'll have to) or load up the dots prepare to be tanking.    So, I retired the now fully gimped 60 epic monk to start an sk...<br />
<br />
Where to start, like others have said- this is THE combo.  At L52 I parsed the sk's dps at only 10 under the monk's (adding spells + pet) and the sk has way more hps and tanks like a champ.  I have 2 FD spells AND harmshield, so if I'm splitting something nasty I have 3 ways to avoid dying.  In addition, snare splitting is huge as is right-click invis (circlet of shadow).  PoN yard trash w/ the monk required me to hit mend or stone stance discipline instantly on slow resist, plus the mob is now on the shaman.  Nowadays, the sk has the mob glued to her and on a slow resist, just chain lifetaps until the slow lands.  Immediately afterwards I can drop bane on the mob and chain JBB, never worried about aggro.<br />
<br />
I could go on and on and on about how much I love the shaman/sk combo and wish I'd discovered it earlier, but this &quot;short&quot; post has turned into a novel.  SK is an excellent choice- the OT gate hammer that will let you gate out of the deepest dungeon is just the icing on the cake.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Ahpok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I am a 2box player with a lv65 SK. I seldom Duo with other classes and lack of their experience so I dont' wanna to give any comment on them. But I wanna to share my experience here.<br />
<br />
I don't have any problem on Xp with 2box even on PoEarth. SK is a good couple to shm. FD pull is much helpful. SK's dps is not weak with pet. Snare is mostly a must on Xp place to avoid aggro.<br />
<br />
The weak point of SK/Shm is lack of overall dps if compare with other couple. Use Bash/Slam to interrupt when the mobs wanna gate. However, seldom or none gate mobs at POP xp zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">My usual SK/shaman technique:<br />
<br />
Shaman buffs SK.  I don't bother with buffing pets. Both pets (58 SK and 55 SHM) are alphaed - supposedly it doesn't matter but I do it anyway. SK will have mental corruption, grim aura, torrent of hate recourse, vampiric curse recourse, HoS, regrowth and alacrity up at all times.<br />
<br />
SK pulls and turns on incoming. As soon as he gets hit, his pet engages.<br />
<br />
Shaman stands, assists SK, sends pet, slows, retargets SK, sits (9,8,7,2,8,9 with my hotkey set up). I've started to canni when slow lands before I sit. I try to keep shaman at 60 health.  Shaman has regen BP but does not regrowth himself (he will at 56 when I get group regen, he probably should now).<br />
<br />
SK tanks down mob.  With the shaman partner, I run vampiric curse constantly (lifetap DoT) and I have highest level lifetap up for patch healing (when I use cleric as off box I switch lifetaps to spears because you lose a LOT of DPS without a shaman backing you up - it's painful).<br />
<br />
Shaman heals when SK drops below 80.  As I get a sense of the pace of the camp, Shaman will either take on more healing (if the SK is having mana problems tapping life back), DoT (If both have mana) or do nothing if both are holding steady over a spawn cycle on mana.<br />
<br />
With this combination I've tanked down troopers in Kael, did a veteran (level 57) with a 51 druid who was in the area for heals. I spent some time in Torigan mines and liked it a lot (had a 55 warrior along as well). SK is level 58 with RS3, regen 3, SCF1, CF1, CA1, ~2900hp unbuffed and ~1150AC unbuffed. Shaman is level 55 with no AA, ~1700hp unbuffed and ~900AC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Dasgood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I have 2 boxed since the beginning =)  My first real duo was cleric and warrior.  Took the cleric to 62 and the warrior to 55 then decided that shammys kick butt so I started playing my shaman ... grouped her with monky, mage, bard ... stuck with monk.  I think this is a great team but then I started reading about PoP and how monks are gimped .. blah .. so I worked them both untill my monk hit 50 and my shaman hit 45.  I then grouped my shammy and 55 warrior.  What a big difference taunt and 3000 extra hp do for ya.  I have lvled the shammy to 51 now and can easy out aggro the warrior who has decent procing weaps SO while I think that warriors rock ... I am considering another change.  My tank will never be the MT if I am 2 boxing .. just to much can go wrong =) so I think that a mage would be a great combo (2 utility classes) or an off tank or a MT in a x group.  I know that pallys and SK's can MT I am just being realistic about what I will be doing.<br />

So mage might be fun (already have a lvl 35 twinky) or an SK ... I have tried paladins and just dont get it =) .. post 60 pallys can rock ... but before that, dont get me wrong I have many paladin friends, they are juat a bit lacking.  Took a pally to 24 once and then 35 .. delete/delete =)<br />
<br />
Getting back to the original question ...<br />
...HIGH DPS, lower amount of twinkage (initial 2-10k o gear or so, as they level, and we get more drops, the gear will go up.), 2 boxer  And what has been your experience /w 2 boxing? Worth while? Fun  enough w/o adding to much complications?...<br />
<br />
Fun = well fun if you like to hug yourself and do all the looting.<br />
HIGH DPS = mage/monk<br />
complications = well until you get a second set of eyes your complication factor just increased by 2 =)  BUt for duo you should be fine with a good set of macros and simple pulls =)<br />
worth while = its very worth while if you dont have any friends, play at wierd times, or for short durations.  I guess if you think play EQ is worth while - yeah so do it what ever way you can =)</div></div><hr />

I don't have any problem on Xp with 2box even on PoEarth. SK is a good couple to shm. FD pull is much helpful. SK's dps is not weak with pet. Snare is mostly a must on Xp place to avoid aggro.<br />
--------------------------------<br />
<br />
Seriously, I have not attempted it but can you really 2-box efficiently in PoEarth?  <br />
<br />
I would think the mobs there hit too hard for fast constant pulling with shaman healing power.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Mudcrush Durtfeet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I have found a Paladin makes a wondrous duo partner for my shaman.   Overall I'd take one over any other melee class if I had to duo and didn't know where I would do it.<br />
<br />
   The ability of the paladin to stun a mob when slow is resisted or to heal a shaman who is getting beat while pulling is a HUGE help when duoing a pull that's just not going right.<br />
<br />
   I sure do miss snare though.  FD... well... that's not as needed as you'd think in the end game, but when you need it, you need it.  If so, find an sk or monk to join your shaman/paladin duo.  :-)<br />
<br />
   Still... a ranger can harmony many mobs in PoP, this makes for an effective substitute for FD in most cases.   You get a better snare and much more dps if that's your 3rd character for a shaman/pally duo.<br />
<br />
   OtoH you are best off not focusing on any particular class beyond your two boxed partner, it's best to learn how to adapt to what you can get, in the long run you'll do much better.  A shaman that can work with ANYONE is much more desired in the end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Mudcrush Durtfeet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Oh yes.  A paladin/shaman duo has far more hp/ac than any other shaman/melee combo due to the buffs a paladin possesses.<br />
<br />
   In addition, a paladin has a natural hp advantage over any other melee class in that they can get more hp from buffs than any other class, period.<br />
<br />
   Heroism, marzin, BMB and their self buff is huge for duoing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Bahamute</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Monk shaman all the way. I duo in PoS with my monk and we are both only 61. Its easy fast and im not that uber.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Alyss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I duoed a monk to 60th, then monks were shafted.  Went SK and have never looked back.  FD/snare/all the other SK tricks for pulling, my debuffs, very good tanking ability (don't tell him that though, he's got ego issues as it is), massive aggro generation, surprisingly good DPS (average well over 100 DPS with 64 SK pet).  We've duoed the partially slowable 700 hitting frogs in PoS without too much difficulity, and we're both in pretty poor gear (SK only has 6.2k HP and 1520 AC buffed and Windblade for weapon, I'm on 4.1k HP buffed).<br />
<br />
Mages are an excellent choice, huge DPS, fastest mana regen in the game ... not sure of the upper limit of mage/shamina duo, but I suspect it's pretty impressive.  Lacking in pulling options though.<br />
<br />
Pallies ... well, pallies are pallies.  They're for cooking and eating.  Seriously; some nice utility, good buffs, tend to be lower DPS than SKs, no FD, stuns are massively nice however, as is back up healing.  Lacking pulling/splitting options though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">True, Pallies don't have FD, but they do have the Lull line to avoid drawing 2 in the first place, and roots to help with cc if it does come to that.<br />
<br />
So they're not exactly lacking on that count.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Mudcrush Durtfeet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Well the places I duo...<br />
<br />
   IZ plane of earth against mobs that hit for up to 900+, Fire IZ, castle 1 mobs IZ (though I don't normally duo there I could do it).<br />
<br />
   Plane of water roamers and frogs.  I have done castle one in fire, with no healer and no mez and no fd puller with pally and shaman in a group, on more than one occasion.  We even beat four mobs that way... (at once).<br />
<br />
   I was not at all a believer in pally/shaman duos until I made a frog twink by happenstance.  Once that pally got PoP spells my eyes were opened in a friggin hurry.<br />
<br />
   SK dps or pally dps... neither is really good compared to a true dps class so that's not REALLY the concern here I think.   If you want fast killing and high dps, don't duo... add at least a dps class to a knight/shaman combo.<br />
<br />
   The problem with shaman/dps duo is sooner or later your gonna have down time due to 'CR'.  Sometimes the shaman needs saving and a dps class can't do squat to save him, and once the shaman's down that's it.<br />
<br />
   With my paladin, even IF the shaman dies if the paladin does not that's CR done right there and back to whatever we were doing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>AlynaRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I two box my shaman and mage.. <br />
<br />
The mage pet does quite well tanking in HOH, POS, and POTorment.<br />
<br />
I haven't tried any of the other zones while 2-boxing, I gave tactics a whirl once first level and it was doable, but not worth the effort. I also did Sol Ro entrance, again doable, but not worth the effort. The pet just required too much healing, but I have a feeling any tank would of required the same about of effort to keep up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>BomBoom Babatbatbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">CR ?  Monks and SK's both can FD.   Mages have a pet (and if epiced a better taunter than most melee).  I duo Shammy / Monk.  This was started before monk nerf and continued after nerf. It isnt until my monk hit 61 that The combo is hurting.  But once my Shaman gets up a few more lvls (58 and then 60) Tier 2 PoP will be nothing.  Currently I can kill in CoD with this combo but the down time after 1 kill is about 7 min.  Once I get Shamans version of CH and then Torpor Im in business again.  <br />
<br />
If you are thinking SK FD is even close to Monk FD your sadly mistaken. I do like the tank / snare aspect of a SK though.<br />
<br />
Rangers arent a bad choice but again imo DS's kinda go against the Shamans Bread and Butter (SLOW).  TRACK/Pulling would be his best attibute in my eyes.<br />
<br />
I have a higher lvl Paladin also I can group with my Shaman.  Im interested in this combo and there are plenty of zones where I can go that dont require an FD puller.  As it is most of Pre pop and some of Luclin  My monk can take on a good 2 or 3 mobs anyway while the shaman slows. Agro is not a problem as I kill 1 mob to 95% then target the next mob to 95% and then kill the third while the shaman slows. Then Shaman unleashes on the 3rd as well ect..The Paladin could also do this I just think it would take a lot longer to kill than with my monk.<br />
<br />
The only problem I see with a Mage partner would be Agro.  I know my friend with his epic pet would have no problem with the duo but im interested to know what happens with regular pets in reguards to slow + cripple + dot's.  I guess the Shaman can tank too.  Mages have a lot more DPS than Monk so would be cool to test out.  <br />
<br />
My vote stays with Monk.. But im Biased :)  What are you going to be 2 boxing on? the same computer or 2 seperate computers.  Reason I ask is a Mage would require TLC as would the shaman..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Alyss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I was thinking the other day, that putting aside shamans, possibly the best duo in the game right now is enchanter/druid.  :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Grubbnubbnubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I run a shammy + mage duo on da 2 box all da time, anda I gots ta say I was suprised how powerful a combo it turned out ta be.<br />
Mah roomy runs a SK, anda most da time in exp groupers I enjoyed a SK orra pally tank.<br />
I started runnin da mage cuz I wanted da DPS anda mages offer great DPS fer a small amount of attentions.<br />
Few hot keys anda away ya go.<br />
What meh realised later as I played was dat da mage plays ta da weakness a shammy has, anda vis vera.<br />
Mages git fire nukes anda solid melee pets so I kin kills stuff dat as a solo shammy I could not due ta resists or what have ya.<br />
I most places, da shammy + mage duo kin kill as well assa group.<br />
A nice benifit is any zone ya kin CoH in, ya kin git flawless split on ya own if needed, root + CoH = singles once ya git it down.<br />
Da mage pets tank pretty darn guds too, anda well dun really bother me iffa dey die =-)<br />
<br />
As to da agro thing, I find I always gots ta tank da mob a bit once I slowed it, but afta 3 taunt messages or so if I back off slowly da mob turns to da pet pretty regularly.<br />
I jus gots da 65th Earth pet, it has no issue keepin agro once da root procs.<br />
<br />
Also, as pointed out, mages pretty low cost ta git up ta speed, der pets do all da dirty work, player made anda guild rot (if dat happens fer ya) git dem to da point were dey do da job anda I happy.<br />
Sum FT would be handy, but so long as da pet issa up, dey contibute damage.<br />
Mage + shammy duo also easy ta use onna raids, groups etc, cuz ya kin give ya attention ta doin ya shammy stuff, but still out put guds DPS wit da mage.<br />
Fer raids /pet hold is a must me thinks fer mage_bots, it avoids da icky &quot;Master, I am following the random AoE'er to the lair of many deaths&quot; syndrom.</div></div><hr />
