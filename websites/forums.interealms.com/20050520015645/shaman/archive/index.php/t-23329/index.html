<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gromble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi Everyone, although i havent posted much over the years, i have read the forum almost daily. I offer forth this tip i use to get more usage out of your spell slots.<br />
<br />
Ok, i dont know about you, but i usually have a set 6 spells that are always memmed, and i have 2 slots in which i swap out spells. Also, while i like the 10 spell sets you can mem, i only use a few of these regularly (mostly after death, auto mem your standard set). <br />
<br />
I have set up a bay of hotkeys for the spells i swap out on a regular basis. <br />
<br />
so lets say you have your spell sets as follows..<br />
<br />
1. your regular lineup<br />
2.-10 favorite swap out spell 1-9<br />
<br />
or how ever many spells you want to set up to hot swap.<br />
<br />
Now in spell sets that you can memorize put fave swapout spell in your normal swapout spellgem slot and nothing else. (ill use shrink as example)<br />
<br />
Now, in hotkey do:<br />
line 1 /memspellset 1 (assuming that is where u just did shrink)<br />
<br />
do this with the other frequent spells you use and all to go into that same spellgem slot  and you have a very quick and easy way to ease up the tedium of swapping out.<br />
<br />
ya can almost switch on the run since the process is automated and will be done much faster than when you do manually.<br />
<br />
Hope this is clear, i am afterall just Ogre 8)<br />
<br />
Cheers everyone, and thank you all so much for the information this forum has provided over the years!!<br />

but thanks for the reminder, I still need to set up some spellsets.</div></div><hr />
