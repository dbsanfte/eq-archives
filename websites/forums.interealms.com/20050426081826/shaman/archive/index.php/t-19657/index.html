<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tsuyoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">One zone that I see overlooked a lot is The Deep.  I use this zone quite a bit when I duo my 65 monk and 65 shaman for a few reasons:<br />
<br />
1)  XP is still decent<br />
2)  It is convenient to get to and from when you don't have much time<br />
3)  It has drops that generally sell well in the bazaar<br />
4)  It has plenty of mobs and no competition<br />
<br />
At 65 it is easy for the monk to get a single mob or maybe 2 on each pull.  Some areas do require a bit more work but aren't that difficult to learn.  The mobs don't hit that hard (maybe 150 at the most) and have been easy to slow.  Some do have high resists, though, so having Malosina handy can help with those.  I just chain slow in those cases since it is around 1 in 20 mobs that are a problem.  Likey this was done to reduce AoE groups since otherwise the zone would be a wizzie's dream.<br />
<br />
Generally when I go in I have the place to myself so I buff at the entrance and get dog-dog ready.  Monk pulls from the tunnel to the corner furthest south at the ZI.  This is because 1/3 of the mushrooms will run at low health.  Having root or a DD handy for these cases is recommended.<br />
<br />
Clear the tunnel to the T then start heading right (north).  This has the lowest concentration of mobs and leads to the DU camp.  The DU camp is nice since all mobs there are warriors and there are 20+ that are in reach.<br />
<br />
My strategy is to pull with the monk then immediately sic dog-dog and do a slow.  Shaman will get agro, but it's not bad.  At this time I'm dropping BoS right after the slow so I keep agro and the monk gets to hit from behind.  Given enough defensive AAs slow may not be necessary and you can double dot to speed things up.<br />
<br />
Mobs have 10-12k HP on average.  Common drops include:  words, runes, food (miraculous meal), drink (2pp whistle wetter), throwing items (150' and 170' range or 3pp at vendor), and other vendor loot (3pp on average).  The Acrylia is nice, I see about 40 pieces total in an hour (75 mobs).<br />
<br />
I'm 100% AA and I see 25-30% of an AA per person per hour.  If I can get the DU camp I also expect to see a few K worth of bazaar loot.  Definitely not overwhelming but nice when you only have an hour or so to play.<br />
<br />
There are tons of other places to XP here.  You can use invis to get around pretty well, although 1 in 50 mobs will see invis.  Some other places to camp:<br />
<br />
1)  Head left at the 1st T and left at the 2nd.  This will dead-end at a spot with a non-kos mob.  The pulls are harder here, but same beasties.<br />
<br />
2)  Head left at the 1st T then right at the 2nd.  There will soon be a branch that will head south.  Go into it a few feet and you should be out of agro range for all but a single wanderer.<br />
<br />
3)  Head right at the 1st T.  At the 2nd T going left will take you to the DU camp.  Head right instead and go to the T there.  This camp has 2 wanderers and is in the Thought fiend area.  Not really recommended to camp here, but if you have good DPS you can do the loop by going right.<br />
<br />
4)  From #3, head left (west) and follow the tunnel to where the fake bridge is.  Head right on the ledge to the north most point.  Nice spot for 1 shroom and lots of thought fiends.<br />
<br />
5)  Cross the invisible bridge (use LoY map) and head full north.  There is an ancient shrieker camp that has a few named spawns.  Use the ledge heading into the chasm to help split the shrooms.  These shrooms have 15k on average but are a little better xp.  Also rarely drop the component for Seru bane weapons that sell very well.<br />
<br />
6)  From #5 you can invis into the tunnel to get into some areas that are nice for pulling thought horrors.  The mobs here can drop Luclin shards and gems so better PP here.<br />
<br />
7)  After crossing the invisible bridge you can head south to tunnels with thought horrors in them. These are the most often camped since they drop luclin shards for VT.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps some of you,<br />
