<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is there any way we can formally request to have Rep point bumps signed by the system.<br />
<br />
The anon crap that people do just foisters a bunch of virtual griefing. And good or bad I want to know who and why people are giving rep points. The why is normally covered but the who is left blank more often than not when someone has something snide to say. And the cowards that do this are escaping any ramifications for thier being twits. <br />
<br />
If someone disagrees with me sure. let it take a hit. But at least make sure we can know who disagrees so we can strike up a dialouge witht hem under equal footing in the future.<br />

<br />
i wouldnt mind having 12 red bumps with a flashing warning saying DO NOT READ</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well Sullon its kinda like when your at the bar and you really gotta drop a load and all the seats have pee all over them, you would like to know who the ignorant arse was who did it so you can take appropriate action with them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The rep system is flawed and that is why it is pretty much meaningless.  Don't sweat it! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">From what Ive seen from the neg rep's that Ive gotten most of the people that will give you neg rep for an opinion dont have enough rep themselves to do anything to your score.    And of the people that could hurt your score (heavy hitters like Faern, Litgruv, Glori, Blazz, etc) arent petty enough to dink you for stating what you think.  <br />
<br />
You've currently got 3 green rep pips; I think thats about 190-200 rep points.  You dont really have much to worry about.  /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Scurvey Pestilential</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Neg rep bump for bringing up rep bumps AGAIN!<br />
<br />
You see, this is the kind of thing people give rep bumbs for, so what you should really be asking is, &quot;why do I care?&quot; I couldn't give a flying f*** if a complete stranger doesn't like my posts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Pos rep bump for posting a good idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've found that I generally receive green for my humor, grey for my advice, and red for my opinions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>dennman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">we dont have anything better to do than worrying about who is giving who reps?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I've found that I generally receive green for my humor, grey for my advice, and red for my opinions.<br />
<br />
Which is this, Sam?  I need to know how to bump you...<br />
<br />
But yeah, old fogies bump things that make us chuckle, newbies bump things that helped them, and grumps negatively bump things that generally apply to them.  I see the same pattern, but for the most part they're grey.<br />
<br />
I wonder if there's such a thing as &quot;box envy.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">P.S.  Jinheim, get your mind OUT of the gutter.  That is NOT what I meant by &quot;box envy!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Piwacket</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'd give you a pos rep bump but I don't have enough rep to affect yours :D <br />
And to everyone ...I read the boards every day and I appreciate all the advice...some good , some bad...but at least you guys make the effort to put it on the board. I don't have any advice cause I am not that great a player...I'm very slow to learn how to do the things we do as Shaman.<br />
I love the bantering and even the arguments..it gets very interesting at times.<br />
I just wanted to let people know that someone appreciates their efforts. And I do.<br />
Thank you =^.^=<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">You know what is amazing.<br />
<br />
Folks leaving stuff like &quot;I will pee on your grave&quot;<br />
<br />
Arn't the posting rules explict about anon postings and other forms of griefing?<br />
<br />
Now I am laughing off this stupid stuff. But when the anon kiddys have the ability to be punks they use that ability in the most pathetic manner. And with no reprocussions they can get away with it.  And while the stuff might be funny a couple times it, I feel, really doesnt have a place here at the crucible. <br />
<br />
Again I reiterate my request that The Rep system be made accountable Or removed.  This is just sad. <br />
