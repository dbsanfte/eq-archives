<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Taldaorfa Spiritcaller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been reading alot of posts and find that it seems JBB &gt; all for soloing, and people have obtained this (along with decent gear)  at 48.  Can anyone tell me how you can work up 15k at 45 or so?  I can only think of hill giants, which are Overcamped and constantly taken after engaged.  Help =  much appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thank you for putting up with my stupid newbie questions lol:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This might sound crazy, but making stat food might be a fairly decent money maker these days.  I was able to skill up to 191 cheap on patty melts and I looooove Halas Meat pies, I buy them stacks at a time.  I had left my character overnight in the bazaar, when I went to bed this one guy had over 700 Halas meat pies for sale, when I woke up, he had 50.<br />
<br />
If I wanted to raise money, I would also put a bunch of stuff that people might need right in the bazaar...portal fragments, hate/air stones, bandages, all at above cost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Exodus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">At level 39 or so, you can head to the ry'gorr fort in Eastern Wastes and farm the armor they drop while still gaining exp. The mail they drop sells for 300 minimum on the Mith Marr server, and has some decent stats if you wan't to wear it. You can also try farming Upper Guk and maybe Permafrost at around the same level, or head to Crystal Caverns and farm the herbelist pack the herbelist drops and  the Crystal covered shroud and BCS the foreman drops. Herbelist pack sells for 100pp each, but you can only carry one at a time because it's lore, and crystal covered shroud sells for 200pp, not sure on the BCS. I've also hear an oracle pack or something drops off of the oracles in CC, but I have yet see one. Hope this helps. - Exodus</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Taldaorfa Spiritcaller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hmm, I never thought of baking but one time I put 21 points into the skill baking, and never got started on it (too busy racing to 50 :p)<br />

<br />
Also heard about CC and EW, I might look into that, too.<br />

More tips are also appreciated, a right clicky nuke does seem nice. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Biggest advice for gaining cash - level.<br />
<br />
At higher levels you will find it easy to make the cash you need.  Grind up and level.<br />
<br />
I didn't get my JBB until lvl 51 or so.  Had I stopped grinding at 45 and gone cash-only I probably would have gotten it at about the same time, or maybe a bit later... but I would have been 45.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>fieryfist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Soloed in CC from lvl 30 to 40 and made 2kpp in that time.  I did terrors and ry'gorrs and between the 5pp average coin drop each kill, gems, and misc items (CCS, crstalline robes, foreman skullcap, etc.) not to mention selling the velium (I didnt as i need it for smithing) to farmers some where offering 25p per small brick and up to 50p per large and blocks of velium.  Its not a gold mine but definately a good source if your looking, im sure there are faster ways, just an idea tho</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My suggestion is, get to 49 without it and start farming ice giants in everfrost.  They die to 2 ebolts, 1 plague and a bit of dog biting, and you can basically kill one every respawn (6 min) if you canni well.  By the time you are 51 (about Sunday afternoon, the experience is great till 53) you have the cash to buy your jbb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've been trying to answer the same question of how to make the cash for the JBB since I hit 44. I did levels 39-44 in Dawnshroud soloing, so the exp went fairly quickly, but I was left with about 600Pp in the bank. Then the Bazaar opened and I couldn't sell a 10 dose sow potion for 100PP to save my life, and I will not undercut the market and screw over the rest of the class that is just starting to work on alchemy and can't afford to sell their potions for 80PP a pop, which I have seen on my server, Povar.<br />
<br />
I went to Rathe Mountains. With my less than 100% efficent tactic of pulling with slow, siccing dogdog, dotting with poison, wading in with 2hb melee and tossing in a nuke I can kill an average of three before having to take a canni break. ( I'm soft, and like seeing my health and mana full for a few seconds before heading back to the wars again...LOL) Considering the money I was making I was happy with the exp I made there. I've upgraded some very outdated gear with Jaundiced bone vambraces, helm, gauntlets and boots for about 1500pp, and still have 3k in the bank. Now I just have to stay out of the bazaar for a couple more levels until I have that built up. Only thing I might be tempted to blow some of that money on..at this point it would be almost all of it, would be a regen breastplate<br />
<br />
I've been real lucky...only had two pulls taken, and both at least had the courtesy to apologise afterwards. And I have also benefitted from having my slow land and dogdog get his first bite in just before a druid/ranger hit one of their root/snare spells on it, helping me out. It also helps that I spend most of my time in there definately in off-peak hours...staying up after midnight Pacific, or waking up mornings from about 7:00-8:00 until noon.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the food suggestion Gloriana. I never knew there was that big a market for it.<br />
<br />
I wish you well<br />
