<br />
Actually, the yard has been there since we moved into the house - about 3,000 square feet of dirt, blowing into the windows, making mud in the rain and snow and generally being unsightly for six months. This Saturday, the landscapers are coming to put in grass. Two weeks later, my parents are coming down to install my son's cedar wood playset with a space shuttle fort on top. (Their delayed birthday present to him.)<br />
<br />
I'm so excited I can hardly stand it! No more dirt, no more mud, I can finally send my son OUTSIDE to play and not have to hose him down before he comes in.<br />
<br />
I do have to wait a year or two for the deck I want though. With a new baby coming, we have to concentrate on remodeling the basement instead, so we can move the computers out of her room.<br />
<br />
I'll post pictures as soon as everything is in.</div></div><hr />

HER room? <br />
No confirmation, it's just a feeling - intuition if you will.</div></div><hr />

If they are putting down sod, make sure to water the hell out of it until it establishes a good root system. <br />
This is why the automatic sprinler system went in last week.<br />
<br />
I'm not much of a landscaper. The more than happens automatically, the better.<br />
<br />
Our front yard was put in with sod on October. It's really beautiful now - the best lawn I've ever had.</div></div><hr />

I believe in intuition, Myrea. I knew mine was a boy from the start. I did too. With my first pregnancy, I just knew from the moment I bought the prengancy test at the corner drug store that I was going to have a boy. At every ultasound, he was modestly covering his privates, but I was sure just the same.<br />
<br />
I'm just as sure in my heart this time, but I'm not picky. Having two little blonde boys would be great too.</div></div><hr />
