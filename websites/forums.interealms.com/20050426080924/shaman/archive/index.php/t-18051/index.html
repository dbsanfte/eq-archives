<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ok, Did I miss something?  I have read like every thread on the first 3 pages of this forum (30-40) and I have not seen any mention of OT (overthere).  This was THE place to hunt when  I did these levels with my druid, and I am doing them here all over again with my shammy.  It is simply insane how perfect this place is.  The one complaint I will yield to is that the zone gets boring fast, but you fly through the levels so fast that your not there long enough to complain about it.<br />
<br />
There is always a group or two looking for peeps at the SF ramp (a fast zone out spot if things go bad), has a plentiful aray of mobs from 31-39 (depending on if you want an easy or tough pull), and is wide open land which makes for easy root/rot if you pull to the sides (if your so inclined).<br />
<br />
I just hit 34 yesterday, and dog dog can solo the blue cons with nothing but haste and str buff (not even in alpha mode) if you pull with slow.  Heck, I was soloing yellows and a few reds here yesterday...  only had regen haste and str up on me, str and regen up on pup, pulled with slow, and tanked with dogdog hitting from behind.  By the end of the fight, I was at 80%hp and had medded back the mana from the slow.<br />
<br />
If i wanted to be more effecient I could simply throw on a few dots and watch them drop faster, but I was trying to prolonge the fights as i am trying to work up my pierce skill.  Ok, i will grant that I am pretty twinked, but with a temp anyone at these levels can match my hp/ac (though maybe not my regen) and handle this place with just a slight bit more downtime (like 1 minute every 30 instead of never).  <br />
<br />
If you step back every once in a while (letting dogdog take agro) and throw on your dots, you can plow through even conning mobs in about a minute each.<br />
<br />
Quick tip:  If you like tougher fights, take the rhino's and sabertooth's as they hit hardest and have most hp (rhino's run at near sow speed so watch out).  If you like medium fights, the sarnaks don't hit too hard, have low hp's, but are harder to hit and they hit fast (slow really helps on these guys).  The easiest fights are the thorny(whatevers) and the cockatrices as they are weak, easy to hit, and have little hp.<br />
<br />
As for grouping here, it was the fastest exp I ever got with my druid (DL being a close second).  I am only soloing right now to work on my melee skills, but I have thus far noticed that with my shammy, the exp is almost the same (though I have had some amazing groups there that are double pulling/split tanking.  In those groups I probably doubled my solo exp).  Anyway, I am at work so I am naturally rambling, but just thought i'd mention it since i didn't really see it mentioned here.</div></div><hr />
