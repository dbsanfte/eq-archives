<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Beranor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am curious about good ways to make money.  Possibly timed spawns with good drops, or camps i can solo where items drop.  I know that HG's can yield cash, as well as solo in PoG, but I am looking for other advice.  I am also looking for a good places to solo for some beastlord equipment for my friend.  I was thinking the coterie castle possibly?  Or killing the Great Saphoryte sometimes.<br />
<br />
I am a 61 shaman with torpor, jbb, no horse / epic / fungi ... I would like a nice spot to solo for money / items to sell / BL items.  Thanks for your time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The real problem with farming cash is everyone else is too.  <br />
<br />
HGs are good if you can get there when there are less than 10 people in the zone.  Any more and the profitability drops off considerably (and the frustration goes up even quicker).  <br />
<br />
IGs are good if you can get the camp but that's a dream on high population servers.  <br />
<br />
Never been to PoG but it sounds good since it's harder to get to.<br />
<br />
Coterie castle is over farmed to the point that all the good droppable stuff can be bought in the bazaar for c.100pp each.<br />
<br />
Great Sapprophyte is dependent on luck.  He's a 2 hour 45 minute spawn so you don't get that many chances in a day.  He is also camped quite a bit since he's the only one who drops a spell used by several classes.  If he drops the spell you can do well, if he doesn't nothing else he has is really that good.  Spell drops about 1 time in 4 so figure 2kpp/12 hours.  Not the way to go.<br />
<br />
The place I go for cash camps is Stonebrunt Mountains.  The Highland Kobolds drop fine steel weapons, etched iron, blue wicker, and wicker armor.  If you can keep the camp cleared (and at 61 that should be trivial) you can net 150pp-200pp an hour.  There are two camps and both are open 90% of the time.  You can sell to the kitties in the zone, in Gunthak or in Paineel.  You also get Heretic faction so after a few hours you will be amiable in Paineel for better prices.  If you can clear both camps (might be doable but I've never tried) you could likely exceed what you can make from HGs.  Bring lots of weight reduction bags though, the stuff is heavy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Spiritmarked</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My method involves East Karana.  Kill everything in the zone.  There's a couple HG spawns, though this isn't where the money is.  You're after the crag and carrion spiders.  (Haven't tried this with my shammy yet, but I assume it's the same principle as my rogue).  Maybe faster with SoW.  Collect silks until your eyes bleed.  Combine 'em into swatches (never failed one of these yet, even w/ 0 skill) and take 'em to the bazaar.  They sell fast on Luclin for 10pp each.  (That's 200pp per stack.)   Good for 5-600 pp an hour.<br />
<br />
*Important* Kill everything!  If you only kill the spiders, their spawns will fill up with other stuff.  Killing every sorry mob that crosses your path will ensure that the spiders keep spawning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Worgulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would say grey and solo the front of the temple, golems and shissar all of them.  The shissar have a chance to drop a scale that sells for 19pp as well as shissar organs sused for the eb necklace quest in Katta. After a while you would most likely get a named shissar/ and or named Golem.  I farm here for cash on my druid because the named shissar drop all the shissar scaled armor, and the golems drop grey flesh items (mainly the sleeves which I sell for 6k each) there is also the chance to get the golems jawbone which if you had better can sell for around 15k.  I made over 40k here in less than a week on my druid so I think a shaman could do it easy  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Podunk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Sanctus Seru ring, upto 22pp a mob and easily soloable and should still be dark blue cons to you at 61 they have a fair number of hps but can easily be done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Some of the fastest cash farming Ive found is in Dulak.  Things there are 60%green/lt blue and 40% blue at 55.  I was averaging about 1K an hour there from cash drops, Gem drops (got a BD from a greenie...go figure) and weapons.  I stopped colelcting weapons after about 2 hours, cause its a pain to have to carry them around. No downtime, cause dogdog and my jbb go through them pretty damn fast.  Im sure at 61 everyithing is green, and with the 61 pet you should have no trouble making the cash.<br />
<br />
I dont know the population of your server, but on mine there were usually only 3 or 4 other people in the zone, and they were on the boats.  Your tactic is to hunt the buildings along the waterfront and back to the &quot;shipyards&quot; area.<br />
<br />
Also a great place to PL a melee class BTW...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>kudamorfa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Whelp one really nice place to solo is paineel. Only catch is you need to keel kobalds for about 4 hours for faction for the key but otherwise te gaurds have around 600 hp hit HARDEST 70 and drop finesteel and a good 4pp a kill. So about a good 10pp a kill and they have very weak hp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Teneb mountains,  grimlings, Have lots of pack space available and pick up the runes, acrylia, windstones and other gems,  sell windstones and acrylia in bazaar.  My enchanter made 3400p in levels 42 and 43 with a cleric partner (who also made 3400p!).    We couldn't keep the cave clear so concentrated on keeping the front clear.  I'm sure a 61 shaman can keep the cave clear.<br />
<br />
You want the cave with the laborer in it.   You can also occasionally have the runner wander into the cave and kill him, do the turn in for the pattern (if you have the faction ogres and trolls probably do not) and then sell a rallic pack as well.<br />
<br />
I can't wait until my shaman is high enough to hunt there :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I can't wait until my shaman is high enough to hunt there :-)<br />
<br />
Well you are almost there as I started soloing there with my shammy at 38 (could have done it at 37 though).  And the plat was great I'm now looking for my JBB after all that financing from there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Go to where the loot is, the new expansion.  usually what happens is a new expansion comes out and the loot tables are upped (giving people incentive to go and check it out)  then later they nerf the drop rate.<br />
<br />
So far in Nadox, Gunthak and Torgiran Mines I have been making a ton of cash of the relatively new drops, and the upped drop rate.  Some nice gear drops in these zones and you can sell the average drop for about 2k or so (I'm talking nice drops not vendor loot stuff).  Also mobs all drop up to 6p and a weapon that sells for about 5p.  Cash loot also drops that can sell up to 30-40plat.<br />
<br />
Of course sometimes you can get lucky and see an FT item drop :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gludorp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Beyond hunting in a particular zone, there is a lot of money to be made in the bazaar. Here's what you can do:<br />
<br />
1) Keep a running list of items which you think you have a very good feel for as far as how much they're worth. Periodically check their prices in the bazaar and snatch them up when they're priced low, then sell them high for a nice profit (you can use a mule permanently stationed in the bazaar for this). As you gain more experience in the bazaar, you'll be able to do this with more and more items.<br />
<br />
2) Take a gander at Eqtraders.com and look at what kind of items--of the type not normally sold by NPC vendors--tradeskill folks need to make their high-end items. Go out and farm those items, either through hunting or finding things players have sold to NPC vendors, and sell it on the bazaar. I don't want to give away my particular trade secrets, but I've been hauling in 5k per week doing this by just devoting a few hours per day to farming stuff I know tradeskillers have a great need for. And I'm not just talking about spiderling silks. ;)<br />
<br />
3) Dabble in tradeskills yourself. You don't have to be a grandmaster tradesman to make money through crafted items. Again, do a little research and you'll find you can make some items at low skill levels that are in demand. You won't make huge profits all at once, but you will get a steady stream of income that adds up over the long run.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I haven't seen any FT items drop.  What item are you referring too?<br />
<br />
I did spend a lot of time in Nadox farming Darkwater Pearl Rings until the market mostly dried up.  I got enough to buy myself a Fungi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hill Giants and Ice giants are a pathetic source of cash, and have been for quite some time, its pathetic that not only are they still camped, but sqaubbled over as well. HHK guards are better by a longshot. Dulak harbor is pretty good for cash. Or go to the docks near Hate's Fury in Nadox and get some good loot to sell to other players.<br />
<br />
And yes, trade skill items are a good source of coin. Leather padding, celestial essences, mistletoe tempers, heady kiola, spider(ling) silks and pelts all sell very well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Leather padding is good if you're on in prime time and hate standing in line for spawns (like me).<br />
<br />
Hunt rockhoppers in Marus Seru for LQ padding - my 61 shaman got three stacks in an hour.<br />
<br />
Hunt spiderlings in Innothule (since it was reworked there are lots of spiderlings there now) or anywhere else for spiderling silk.<br />
<br />
Then in a tailoring kit:<br />
2 silks -&gt; silk thread<br />
silk thread plus LQ rockhopper pelt -&gt; leather padding<br />
<br />
Trivial at like 22, sells for up to 30p EACH PIECE in the bazaar on Rodcet.  That means one hour hunting pelts + two hours hunting silks yields 1800 plat, 600p per hour.<br />
<br />
You can do better on some of the more profitable item camps, like the Crypt in Seb, but you have to fight for the camp and probably bring friends.</div></div><hr />
