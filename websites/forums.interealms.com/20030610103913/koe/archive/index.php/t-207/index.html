I'm currently under the recruitment process of KoE, meaning I am not yet a member.  As part of the recruitement process, we are encouraged to join the guild events with our sponsor.  I do not have a set sponsor, yet I predict to have one soon.  But this is my concern: most of these raids seem to be very high level, and I am only level 37.  Should I still actively join you guys on dangerous raids to places people my level wouldn't be paid to go?  My concern is not about my life or experience, I certainly do not care if I die several times on the raid because I am low level (it's all for the fun, and I would love the experience, real life experience I mean).  My concern is about how much I would help on the raids?  How much would I add, or would I just be a bother?  Maybe you guys have lower level raids, but I was just thinking that if not should I still join you all and experience a full blast raid and accept any consequence of my decision? hehe :P</div></div><hr />

There's mosty high level raids here, since the higher-level raids require more planning. However, there are lower level raids in here now and again. If there's nothing in here at the moment that fits your level, then you've got a golden oportunity to post an event yourself. Pick a time and a zone, and post away. Or, you could post here for suggestions on where to have a youger level event. The main purpose of this forum, in my opinion, is to help people organize their gameplay, and that can be done for players at any level.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Yadilu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thank you very much Baracus, and I hope to do exactly as you say soon enough.  However, I fear lack of interest in others due to my non-membership.. but I hope to provide a small raid for small lower levels or alternates soon for KoE to follow and judge my ability and membership.  If not, then I accept my inability to join KoE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I will be playing my Cleric a lot this week in the OT. Feel free to give me a tell. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Baracus Baraculous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It would certainly reflect poorly on us if we did not take advantage of a well-planned younger generation event. I'd suggest starting a post to solicit times and zones to see what people would want to do. Also, there's a 20s group on Wednesday night, so they might be a group interested in an event.<br />

As for being too low for the Keepers, there are plenty of secondaries that are a tell away from logging in. I'm usually one for logging in a different character if there is something doing that better fits a character than the one i have logged in. Just make your presence known and ask someone to ask for you in guildchat.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cubman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">As a fellow applicant to KoE, I would be happy to join you on any event or raid.  With 7 characters, hopefully I will have one that is of appropriate level.  I also happen to know several fellow applicants (all coming from SOS) that would be more than happy to participate as well.  I have been hesitant to post anything as well, not for fear of lack of participation, but because I wasn't sure if it was kosher.  However, I've been applied to KoE for some time now (and I thought the test of patience for the shammy epic was long) and I've grouped with enough KoE to know they will participate and help in any way they can...after all, that's one of the reasons I applied in the first place!<br />
<br />
my characters include:<br />
53 barbarian shaman<br />
46 erudite wizard<br />
28 ogre warrior<br />
12 wood elf druid<br />
6 dark elf necro<br />
6 human monk babe<br />
6 high elf enchanter<br />
<br />
Look for me in game and let's get something started!<br />
<br />
p.s. not trying to slam disparage or dis anyone in the recruiting area with the pitiful attempt at written humor above.  you guys do a great job!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Yadilu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I look forward to working with all of you guys, KoE members and non-members!  Perhaps by soliciting events for my own application, I can help other applicants by including them with the KoE members that join me!  It's a win-win situation, hehe :)<br />

37 mage, Yadilu</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Atokal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I will be on this weekend in my other form as Ominnous level 34 warrior in OT.  So send me a tell if you like Yad. Hey Bem perhaps we could hook up.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Take a look at the roster. The do a who all keepers 30 40, or 40 50, or whatever and see who is playing. I am usually on playing one of my characters.</div></div><hr />
