<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wendar</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 09:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) Developers need to keep in mind that they WILL be increasing the level cap after an expansion or two. Even if they don't, they need to keep in mind that they WILL be increasing the level cap. - We all know it will come sooner or later, they need to be ready for it, with firm ideas at the get-go so that the mess of EQ1, post Kunark, doesn't happen again.<br />
<br />
2) Listen to what the players want in their classes. Take a look at rangers, a great number of us want archery as a primary melee tactic. Why wouldn't they do it in EQ? Imagine a wizard with limitless mana... what that means is, wizards do a lot of damage with very little (in comparison) aggro. Why? Because of their range from the target. Same with archery. And with Endless Quiver / Tolan's Darkwood Bracer, you don't have the limitations that a wizard does (running OOM). Now, if they listen to all the rangers asking for it, and design the basics of the game around this, it won't be an issue, and many rangers will get what they've always wanted.<br />
<br />
3) Give more diversity among classes. With the final class decision coming at level 30, I think it's safe to assume that many classes will not be nearly as individual as in EQ1. At least, that's what I fear. But it also gives 70 levels of character, and class growth. What's more, they need to ensure that players of a class have some margin for individuality in their class. Perhaps, rangers for example, would sacrifice some melee (or archery) damage, or a few more spells. Or vise-versa. The point is, give the characters some margin for change within the class to make the game more interesting.<br />
<br />
4) Don't do camps. Well... some, I'm sure will be involved. But things like *ducks* stormfeather, or lodizal. Some people do get lucky... other don't. Make the quests longer, with more content, but generally the same estimated time to complete. This opens up the quests to be a hell of a lot more interesting than looking at gnomes playing craps all day long.<br />
<br />
5) Improve CS, and that includes PR from the dev team. I really don't like hearing about the next thing I can buy from Varent (PoP), before I have everything that my SoL game manual says is included. I don't like to hear about cost increases when I still haven't recieved what I paid for. We wouldn't put up with it at a fast food resteraunt, why should we here?<br />
<br />
6) Give more content that single groups can take on. And I mean early on. a group of lvl 95-100's might not be able to do the biggest encounters in the game. I get that, sure, but give more interesting content to single groups. xp groups suck ass in EQ1, for the most part. Very few times have I walked away from a group and said, 'Wow.' What I mean is, if they are going to continue this ring of fire stuff for the high end encounters, put some in at lower levels, single group doable, with decent loot, but nothing to compair to the big stuff. And do a lot of it. Keep the low and mid level grinding interesting, with rewards. - Probably the least likely to happen... as it would involve a LOT of content, but still, just ideas.<br />
<br />
7) Increase group size. 8 minimum for a full group. As group sizes increase, the difficulty of mobs in relation of same level PC's goes up. So the max group size can't be too much, but 7 or 8, I think, would be healthy.<br />
<br />
8) If you are going to make tradeskills a more important part of the EQ enviornment, don't go overboard. And make them more interesting. I know some love to do it, I hate it. Specifically, things like the coldain shawl quests. Huge time sinks. Anyone who's looked at it knows that. I don't think tradeskills should be required for high end items, in such a way that EVERYONE that wants it, has to do it.<br />
<br />
I'm fine with dumping some cash to a smith to make me something for a quest. He put a lot of time and effort into his skill that I wasn't willing to do.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
That's all I can think of at the moment. But I think a lot of these suggestions will go a long way to helping EQ2 become a game worth playing, and continue playing after a few expansions. Let's face it, EQ1 is on the downhill. Every expansion MUST improve characters, and improve them in a world not designed for that power. So it's revamped and nerfed, and about the time it works well enough, players are more powerful again. EQ started down that road it's first expansion, and hasn't let up since. And I really hope that it's a mistake they are ready to correct in EQ2. Be ready for stronger characters and have a system set up so that things don't get nerfed.<br />
<br />
To somewhat put it overly simplistically; I hunted orc pawns once for the cash drops that were missing off bats and wisps. I no longer have any interest in killing them. I didn't need to be ported out of the zone if an orc pawn aggroed on me while I was a couple levels higher, I just, had no desire to continue the hunt.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sorronn</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 10:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your comment about orc pawns clearly refers to Naggy/Vox compared to higher dragons.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the comparison is inaccurate because the loot from those &quot;orc pawns&quot; (Naggy and Vox) is the same as the loot form your next higher level up mobs.<br />
<br />
I know people that are 60 with lots of AA pts and more than one of them has told me that he has spent alot of time trying to figure out a dodge to farm Vox and Naggy. <br />
<br />
Why? Because a Cloak of Flames is still worth alot of money on the open economy, that's why. Because the paladin frost and burnt books are worth alot of money for MQ on the open market, that's why. And because the mob that drops this stuff is cake compared to the alternatives (Gorenaire vs Vox, for instance).<br />
<br />
Verant's solution, in this case, was weak and it came specifically because, as you point out, they did not prepare for the eventual level increase. If Vox and Naggy had been L60 dragons from the start, they might not have been done as early but then we would not have the silly restrictions on them that we have now.<br />
<br />
So I agree completely. They need to design for the high end game now and be thinking about the level limit increase and how it will work now as opposed to back fitting it onto and existing engine. In other words design for 200 levels now and release 100 levels at the start. Then release 20 or 25 more levels per expansion pack. Designed that way from the start, there won't be any misgivings or mistakes along the way.<br />
<br />
If that had been done with the current game then maybe we'd have seen 51-60 in Kunark, 61-70 in Velious, and 71-80 in Luclin.<br />
<br />
But the key is to have a &quot;vision&quot; (there's that word again) and then stick to that vision through the entire design process so that the relative balance between a group of level 30s is the same as the relative balance between a group of level 70s and between a group of 150s.<br />
<br />
<br />
And here's a clue Verant... use 32 bit ints for everything this time at least or be brave and for some server side stuff go with 64 bit ints. ;)</div></div><hr />
