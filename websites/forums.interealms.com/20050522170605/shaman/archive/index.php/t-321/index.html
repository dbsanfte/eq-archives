<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, your stuff looks pretty good.  I'll give you the standard...you got tons of wisdom, try adding some more hp and ac.  I don't really know much about iksar equipment but...<br />
<br />
Switch your wisdom rings for AC/HP (Velium Fire Wedding Ring, or 1 of those and a Shadel Bandit ring).<br />
<br />
Take your friends to do the rare cycle in Traks Teeth.  Pickup a Ceremonial Iksar Chestplate for the regen, until you can get a Fungi.  You could also get a Meditative Blanket(shoulder item) or pickup a a tattered mantle for cheap to replace lizardscale.<br />
<br />
Go to Chardok, get Sarnak Battleshield, also decent earrings drop here with ac, hp, mana and wisdom.<br />
<br />
You could replace that Supple Scale Armband with ... WW dragon bracers, Velious Quest Bracers, Bracer of Hammerfall, Sentry Bracer, Iksar Hate Bracer, Umbral Plains Bracers, etc.<br />
<br />
The iksar Hate cloak is real nice.<br />
<br />
Legs are a tough slot to fill, even harder for iksar I imagine since no JB.  KML are pretty good at 52... upgrades are pretty much just Velious Quest, WW dragon leggings or Gladiator Chain Leggings from Kael.<br />
<br />
best of luck<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">By replacing the Hate BP I have now with a Ceremonial Iksar BP, I lose a lot of AC.  The Hate BP has 26 AC on it, while the Iksar BP has only 19 and no other stats (STR+10  AGI+5  WIS+16  HP+10  MANA+50  SV POISON+10  SV DISEASE+10  SV MAGIC+10 on the Hate BP).  That Medatative Blanket is one I have been trying to get as well.<br />
<br />
I am hoping to get some Hate leggings and cloak tonight, but I am not expecting them.  :)<br />
<br />
As for the rings.... I can see getting the HP/AC ones, especially if I can get the Hate leggings and cloak.  But I prefer to have a larger initial mana pool instead of canni dancing.  That could change when I get Cann 3 though.  <br />
<br />
Hmm, interesting thoughts on the bracers.  I'll look into it.  I've got the Corroded Chain Boots sitting in my bank waiting for gems, so I can replace my Black Fur Boots with Thurg Boots.  Just hav eto get the gems.  :\<br />
<br />
Thanks for the thoughts.  I'll check into it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only things I saw was the lizzy mantle can be traded out for Tattered Mantle.  And a SBS or Clay Guardian Shield instead of the epic shield.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Need to get some buddies to Trakanon's Teeth for that Medatative Blanket.<br />
<br />
Of the bracers listed, besides the Hate one, which are obtainable by a Dragon/Dwarf aligned person?  Looks like the Bracer of Hammerfall is possible, but I am not sure why I would do that one.  How about the WW and Sentry bracer?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are a SHAMAN.  Your HPs are your mana pool.  Canni3 and Canni4 will only make that more apparent and make regen and total hps even more important for you.  :)<br />
<br />
regarding the bracers...<br />
WW dragon bracers mean you go kill WW dragons.  Which is bad dragon faction.  You can kill almost any dragon out there with a few groups of 55+, most with 1 group of 55+.  They are very nice bracers though.<br />
<br />
Sentry bracers drop from Sentrys in Skyshrine which means bad dragon faction.<br />
<br />
btw - bracer of hammerfall is uber.  It can summon hammers.  We can throw the hammers!  Hammers!!  That is why you should have it.   Shattering Hammers make for excellent corpse holders.  ;)<br />
<br />
It's better to wear than a supple scale armband at any rate, more ac, wisdom and hps.  I am sure you could do better with a Hate bracer, velious quest bracer or dragon or whatever... just a suggestion for a easy upgrade.<br />
<br />
Loradenn - Gladiator Chain Leggings seem pretty common off the <br />
inner arena Gladiators and nameds.  I've seen several pairs rot.  They don't drop off the regular mobs out in the main arena area(legionares, troopers, etc)... but the ones behind the PoZs near the clerics and priests of Zek.  hrm, I think this is right... heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'd rather wear my crummy enshrouded veil (7 AC 2 wis 30 hitpoints/mana, 10 fire) than a Tobrin's eyepatch.<br />
<br />
There are a lot of arguments for wis vs. AC (or regen!) but I've found the majority of shaman on this board are pro AC or pro hitpoints or pro resists, very very few are pro wisdom.  So, this might not be the best place to get gear advice for you.  Maybe the druid board? :p (that was a joke!)<br />
<br />
To me, max mana pool is secondary to how quickly I can get mana back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Grotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">1000hp canibalized equals 400 mana or 40 wis at 50. That same 1000hp does multiple duties...it can be mana, it can be damage taken without dying, it can be a buffer on AoE spells, etc. <br />
<br />
My guess would be a minimum of 1100-1200AC and 1800-2000hp for a level 50 shaman. I'd run around with 150wis if it meant making those two numbers. I do the same thing with my monk...I sacrifice all stats for 1200ac and 2000hp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think that's pretty optimistic for a level 50 shaman! I remember I finally crossed the 900 AC line sometime in my low 50s and I thought that was great.  I'm a level 60 shaman now with decent gear (nothing NTOV but full SS, lodi, talisman of ben, etc etc) and I have around 1100 self buffed AC, at level SIXTY with GREAT gear!  <br />
<br />
At level 60, I have also just recently crossed the 2K unbuffed hitpoint mark. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Level 50 shaman with 1200ac and 2000hps!<br />
I think at level 50, 800-900 ac is pretty darn good.<br />
<br />
I don't even have 1100 ac fully buffed at level 60.<br />
nor do I have 2000hps unbuffed...working on that though.   With my ac over 1000, I devote my life to the worship of hit points and stamina.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">No level 50 shaman is going to have 1100-1200 AC unless they are in a high level guild that is going get them gear they couldn't normally get at their level.<br />
<br />
Even in full Kael quest armor they'll barely be over 1000 AC and 1700 HP.<br />
<br />
The average level 50 shaman would be in the 800-900 AC range and 1500-1600 HP.   The average level 60 shaman would be in the 900-1100 AC range and 1700-1800 HP.  (bit more hp for ogres and bit more AC for iksar)<br />
<br />
I didn't break 1200 AC and 1800 HP until I had half my gear as NToV gear.  Even now I only have ONE piece of Kael armor left on (bracer) and the rest is either from NToV or Ubers and at level 60 I'm at 1315 AC and 1900 HP.  I'm in the top 10 shaman on Brell in gear, so you are very off if you think the average level 50 shaman will see those numbers.</div></div><hr />

What is the point of asking for advice if you are going to argue constantly with the suggestions? <br />
<br />
Didn't realize I was arguing.  Thought I was offering a fairly well thought out, and polite, discussion about the pros and cons of certain swaps.  That and trying to understand the reasoning behind some of the suggestions.  /shrug  Besides, I said that kicking the Wisdom addiction is tough.  :D <br />
<br />
And I am taking all the suggestions to heart.  The only ones that I have to disregard are the bracers from the Dragons.  If I could get the bracers in just a couple kills I would do it in a heartbeat cause I can get the faction back pretty quick in Kael.  Heck, maybe I can do it without worry.  Hmmm.<br />
<br />
Grotte must be an uber shaman in an uber guild!  (j/k!).  Cause I don't see how that is attainable otherwise.<br />

Gonna do some research in game about prices and such.  Thanks for all the advice (I mean that Jaradis!).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seriously, I dont see myself wearing JB Bp (as if I'll ever get one :p ) over Iksar regeneration BP.  Prolly trade it for fungi.<br />
<br />
I found myself trading my Jarsath bracer out for supple scale sometime though, since I was told 900ac is almost equal to 906ac.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Well, me trip to Hate did not net the items I had hoped for (cloak and leggings).  But I did get the helm (16 AC, Wis +10, Sta +5 , svCold +5 and svCold +5).<br />
<br />
I can see Regen being greater than Wis Avalach, but I am getting a conflicting feeling.  A lot of people are telling me that I should concentrate on AC/HP, then say I should trade my Hate BP for an Iksar BP with less AC.  Is Regen &gt; (HP + AC + Wis)?<br />
<br />
Just trying to understand something that I thought I knew so well.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>siden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Crappy regen on an Iksar(i.e. the BP) is probably not worth chasing.  Good regen almost certainly will be, fungi &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; All BPs until you're 60.  Iksar BP on an Iksar is nice, but probably not worth ditching your current BP for, with one proviso.<br />
<br />
Are you often going OOM and cannying to a low health level often during a fight?  If you are then get regen, if you're not then I wouldn't worry until you can get a Fungi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Your priorities will change as you level up and as you can see everyone has a different opinion as to whats best.<br />
<br />
I wore a Ceremonial BP until 57 or so when I got a fungi, the advantages of the regen outweighed the loss of ac for me personally. Do you know anyone that'll lend you a regen tunic for a day or two, you need to try one to understand how useful they are. I got so used to the regen I had a really hard time taking mine off at 60.<br />
<br />
The equipment game is game of gaining items and then balancing them. A high ac item in one slot, a regen item in another. Choose your goal and work towards that, make a magelo profile then make different versions with items that you can realistically obtain and have a play to see what you can get.<br />
<br />
214 wis at 52 is on the extreme wis side for a shaman, I had 207 wis in partial Skyshrine quest armour with epic at level 58. If you can get some of the end game stuff when you are 55+ then you will be wallowing in wis even if you try and cut down on it, for now try for more of a balance - you wont notice a bit less wis in every day play but you might notice the difference some more HP or ac makes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Personally, I think it is.  Assuming he's using regrowth all the time:<br />
<br />
Iksar (5hps) + regrowth (15hps) = 200 hps/minute.<br />
Fungi (15hps) + regrowth (15hps) = 300 hps/minute.<br />
<br />
That makes the Iksar Chestplate 2/3's as effective as wearing a fungi.  Add in his natural regen and the difference is even less.  On some servers, the fungi is going for 100k.  When you can get 2/3'd the effect from a 5k item, that's a good deal.  <br />
<br />
Zatris, your chest slot is too important to waste on stats.<br />
<br />
Regen &gt; AC &gt; WIS.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Ok, let me toss another wrench into the monkey works.  I think I can agree that the Ceremonial Iksar BP's (and thus the Fungi as well) regen is better than the AC and Wis I currently have on the hate BP, but what about the resists?  +10 to Magic, Poison and Disease is nothing to sneeze at.<br />
<br />
So is it:<br />
Regen &gt; resists &gt; AC &gt; HP &gt; Wis ??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Ogreshm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I would keep your hate BP in a bag, and swap it when you need the resists. It's not as if resists are vital in most non-raid situations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Resists can be situtational, regen is never situational.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying throw away that iksar hate bp, it will be GREAT for Trak raids and such. <br />
<br />
I actually carry around 4 bps:<br />
<br />
JB - AC buff<br />
Fungi - swap it off and on even at 60<br />
Vindi - awesome hitpoints, awesome resists, high AC - perfect for raiding AOE mobs<br />
SS - a great compromise bp - high AC, high Wis, high mana, a few resists and the all around bp I wear most often when exping (Plus, I look fabulous in it).  <br />
<br />
The resists on the Vindi are great (+15 to all) but I'm not so worried about resists killing frogs in OS or whatever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Cantiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Dude screw all this, get what you can while leveling. LvLs &gt; than time wasted getting minute gear improvements. Get 56+ join a decent guild, do PoG. While getting PoG gear get 60 Period. Once your 58+ get in a guild that does HoT or west wing and get Wolfcallers or Spiritcallers (what i choose). Shamans AC is capped at roughly 1150-1200 so no point in going above that, so plan on that in the future. If you get your levels up you will get nicer gear with out forking out stupid amounts of cash. Fortunatly for shamans, the chain drops on quest armor is only for 3 classes, Shm, Rng, Rogue. Not a lot of competition like the Plt classes have. Wasting time gettting some item that is only marginally better does not solve the problem in the long run because you are removing yourself from EXP group and only keeping yourself 52 that much longer. 54 and 59 are nothing short of sick time sinks that go on forever so dont make 52 one when ya don't have to. <br />
I'll give you a brief story about myself. I was 52 with realitivly decent gear but not great. I bug a good guild on my server to tag along on some raids. A little cash of my own for resist gear and i was set. long story short, I ended up with the inny drop iksar cloak, torpor, full PoH armor and the mask of war all by the time i was 55. Now at 60 i have full Spiritcallers, tormax belt, epic, ToV bracer Yeli ring...blahy blah blah. By getting 60 it paved the way to some of the best gear in the game. Look at teh Burrower parasite and tell me the hat off that mob is not as nice as they come? Don't mention Mithril helm to an Iksar, we can't wear it :(<br />
You can't do much when your low 50's simply because the spells are lacking, the mobs are to high to cast on and you arent beneficial in a lot of circumstances. So..get more lvls. <br />
Regen,AC, Wis, Hps, Mana? get 60 then worry about it.<br />
<br />
<br />
PS HPs/Mana &gt; than all when 60 !!</div></div><hr />
