<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hannduvdeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I haven't used a click item to buff people for like 20 levels, and now that I'm considering buying an Ornate Tunic with click SLTW, the question hit me whether or not my SCR AAs will affect it or not.  Will the haste last the baseline 16 minutes or 24 minutes because I have SCRM?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A related question:  Would extend enhancement type focus effects work on it?<br />
<br />
A cheap way to check would be to bust out any old Jaundiced Bone item (helm, boots, arms, gloves) and cast a buff from it.  Time how long the buff  lasts, then give the JB to some other shaman without the AAXP, and see how long their's lasts.  Likewise, if anyone out there owns an Extend Enhancment Item and a peice of JB gear and can test this, they could do pretty much the same thing except instead just take the EE item off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My Amulet of Insight (Ext Enhancement 3) glows when I click my SoW boots, so I suspect that EE Focus Items will work on all clicky buffs.  No guarantee though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>vaniar luclin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes, your items and AAs will work to extend your buffs.. I have 50% AA extension which makes my SLtW 24 min. I got a belt with pacience of eternity (20% duration focus beneficial, 46 sec min so no topor quin) and my SLtW is now 27 min 20 sec. It also sparkles when I use the BP so I knows its active.<br />
<br />
Im really starting to get to much focus spam though, they really need to make it so you can turn off focus msgs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">SCRM and 8th shawl buff extension both work with clicky velious BP (Riotous Health), and with Black Fur Boots, so they should both work with Ornate BP.<br />
<br />
However, 8th shawl effect doesn't work with the goblin earring (grim aura) or the 8th cudgel (carnage), and I don't know why not. SCRM still works.</div></div><hr />
