Some of you might sniff at that ... &quot;It's just design, not healing or slowing or ...&quot; Bah to that, I say. Dialogue has got to start somewhere. He has proven that he reads our boards and isn't afraid to talk to us, IMO, and that is definitely a good thing. If you won't go so far as to say good, then say &quot;encouraging.&quot;<br />

Kudos to you Brenlo. Keep it up!<br />

Brenlo isn't a bad guy, but he surely isn't the person who needs to realize that our class is fading pretty fast.  We can only hope that his message will carry a little weight with the Devs.  I appreciate the effort, but we should not settle with anything less than results IMO.<br />
<br />
BTW, I promise not to rag on your picture from Tech Board ever again if EQ and Shaman actually get out of this funk Bren :D  J/K bro, CSR is a beeatch of a job and its good to see someone trying to wake the Devs up.<br />

<br />
Maybe one day I will come back to EQ. Never know. There are some very good friends still playing. But No matter how good the memories are of the old days. Those days will never be captured again by the likes of the current crop of people at SoE.<br />
<br />
They just don't get it. Chats and graphs and math is all good and all. But the mathmatical perfection is not what I am looking for. (and they certainly are not even withen earshot of perfect) I am looking for the soul. The feeling of wonder and camraderie that old EQ engendered. And SoE can't make that it seems. They have encounters rather than the sandbox.<br />
<br />
There is no feeling of discovery left with EQ. It is just another encounter. Served up for consumption, balanced or tweaked or Designed for X level with Y DPS and gear. <br />
<br />
It would be like listening to funk music. But without all the slap and tickle, Sure the music might be technicly good. But it just doesnt get you &quot;there&quot;<br />
<br />
My opinion. And I don't trust Brenlo one god damned bit. That One voice Post has been on the board for what 6 months. And he is finally referenceing it. <br />
<br />
I call bull****. Reguardless of the outcome, reguardless of any tuning to come. Don't **** with me or mine. And all you have done since your inception has been to marginalize, dither, and twiddle over any of the things that we were intrested in. (As players and more specificly Shaman)<br />
<br />
Shaman may at some point be fixed to the point of usefullness to the outside worlds perception, but much like a dog who has been beat too much I now cringe at the sight of you. <br />
<br />
Thanks but no thanks Brenlo and the company you represent. You tugged my chain too many times and I am tired of your lies and half truths and time buying. <br />
<br />
I just wish that there was some way you could feel even 1 tenth of the disgust of all the people who have spent years enjoying a product that on your watch has become a sallow dessicated husk of it's former self. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dekurgen Heyokah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I, for one, am also glad to see Brenlo reading the boards(which he may or may not have done previously)and occaisionally adding input. Just as important as staying in tune with the player base, is letting the player base know it.<br />
We are aware that Brenlo is the liason between us(the consumer) and the devs(the class killers). As long as he continues on the recent discourse with us that I have been seeing recently, he may actually convince me that SOE is realizing that while we may be 'EQ addicts' to varying degrees...we are not incurable, ignore us for too long and we will tire and leave. <br />
The damage is already done to an extent, as many of the most skilled and knowledgeable shaman in the game have already quit. The question is, how is SOE's CS damage control and can they prevent the rest of us from moving on to Blizzard's Bandwagon.<br />
For myself, I am not overly impressed with our class anymore. My toon is an officer in a great guild and I play for the friendships I have made. I would be just as happy playing any other class but my shaman is the toon I have poured my effort into, so switching now would be too much of a pita.<br />

Note: I probably shouldn't even post this right now as I am tired and grumpy after another full night of having my ass handed to me in Ikkinz. Wth, I can always edit later...</div></div><hr />

Props Brenlo. Please keep it up. You might get me to re-enstate my account if you keep this up.<br />
<br />
Sorry Litgruv to date ive pretty much agreed with most of your posts but on this ive got to disagree.<br />
Maybe Brenlo is trying but hey hes there to take the flack for the dismal devs.<br />
He was our liason with the devs when they &quot;upgraded :(&quot; our heals then he went totally silent even though he must have seen that the majority of the Shaman community wasnt happy.<br />
Although I dont think anyone should be launching personal attacks on him (ie as you quoted &quot;hate&quot;) I still think he is pretty incompetent at his job.<br />
I get the impression that when he took on his role he thought he would be dealing with people the likes of who post on The Newbie Zone regularly who seem to be the sort of people who are either <br />
1.SoE apologists.(A turtle pet is good example here)<br />
2.People who think that because a sony employee replies to them that that makes them special in a way.<br />
Like i say although it is not his fault GoD etc is screwed up that unfortunately for him is what he is there for.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I am reminded of what &quot;The Wolf&quot; says in a situation that is still dangerous to the two killers he helps clean up the bloody car in &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;  -- let's not all start sucking each other's [word deleted in advance] yet, gentlemen.<br />
<br />
It's easy to get excited at the merest hint of Brenlo or anyone saying anything -- it's kind of hilarious how predictably it happens here and over at Sony's boards over and over and over again.  All Brenlo has to do is show up and he adds hundreds of die-hards to his fan club even if nothing has been done or will be done.  It's enough merely that he shows up for the accolades to begin and the lickspittles to all jump on the bandwagon.  Oh well, hero worship and blind reverence for authority figures in general is something you'll never get out of the basic human monkey.<br />
<br />
Which is to say -- cash-on-delivery sounds a lot more balanced and objective to me than leaping for joy every time we get a new promise or some celebrity pops his adorably famous face into some thread somewhere.  Gimme the goods, and they'll be judged.  Promises -- what am I supposed to do with promises?  Posts?  Theories?  Whatever.  <br />
<br />
Now go do the work and let's see what you come up with.  I'd just as soon not hear much more P.R. till then, thank you.  It's coming out our ears by now.  You have work to do.  So go do it already!  Sheesh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I believe we have about 5 posts from Brenlo &amp; Rytan in 5 months, since the December/January One Voice poll and post.

<br />
<br />
While I neither hate nor love Brenlo, it always surprises me how grateful folks are that he deigns to reply to our posts.  After all, that is what he is paid to do.  What really surprises me is not that he ignores the flames, but that he often ignores the reasoned arguments.<br />
<br />
I don't sign his checks, but if I did, I would expect to see more from him on the boards.  <br />
<br />
Customer relations for a creaking, 5 year old, bug ridden game is a thankless job.  And from the companies perspective; producing new content certainly generates more income than making the old content work properly, leaving Brenlo caught between the clients and his management.  But you will notice that threads seem to get REALLY ugly when they are ignored.  Some false sympathy would go a long way.<br />
<br />
And despite everything, this board is generally nice.  I can only imagine what happens on some of the nastier boards though - might be fun to troll the SK boards.</div></div><hr />

<br />
LOL probably.  But fawning over his replies is probably as effective too.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think he should be a valuable part of the community, and be treated as such, not someone to flame or fawn over.  Then we can have meaningful interactions.  <br />
<br />
I dislike reading the fawning even more than I dislike reading the flames.  Neither add to the discussion, but at least occasionaly the flames are amusing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Ditto.  I find neither the flames nor the fawning particularly helpful or worthwhile, but think the fawning is less constructive by far.  If you are going to fall in love with and reward someone for merely saying hello or that he's heard of something or is thinking about something or might tell some people some stuff to think about or whatever, I'd like a few hundreds dollars, please, for, oh, thinking about painting your house, maybe.  Or at least having heard of the idea of painting houses.  Or at the least, I'd appreciate 12.95 a month and the purchase of a few perhaps quite buggy pieces of software.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Dirtnap or whoever you are, back off Snoww.  He's one of the oldest shamans from this board.  He was helping to define our class and perfect shaman strategy from the beginning.  People like him have a RIGHT goddammit to their opinions, and if those opinions are negative, they should be carefully considered and weighed, perhaps argued with in an intelligent manner, but certainly not ridiculed.  <br />
<br />
Snoww, I too am playing CoH right now.  Surprisingly fun!  It's a breath of fresh air and I like how you can come and go as you please, solo or group, either is rewarding.  Intelligent game design and fun play with a game engine that doesn't require you to turn off the spell animations for it to be playable.  <br />
<br />
I just came to this board to see if EQ was fixed yet.  I still care for the game, if only nostalgically recently due to my inability to engender any interest in a game that destroyed my class.  If they fix shamans and FIX THEM WELL, I may return.  If not, well there are an assload of neat games on the market. I'm sure my time will be spent well just checking them all out . . if indeed I could do that for every one that looks interesting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is safe to say that shaman want changes. Change requires dialogue. Dialogue has got to start somewhere, and if it starts here on these boards with a simple back-and-forth over the Epic 2.0 design, well ... that's where it starts. Be grateful that it has started, appreciate it, and encourage more of it.<br />

<br />
I think Lando hit the point well and it should be said.  The johnny come lately's taking a snotty attitude is not exactly becoming, nor convincing neither.  Not that snotty attitudes are ever good anyway, but some of us were around back when people thought shamans were more or less druids, and helped to change that, and deal with and work positively for change regarding shaman issues for literally YEARS before some of you guys even rolled your characters.  Have an opinion if you want, nad that's fine, but that doesn't in the slightest way mean you've earned the right to sneer down on your elders who have seen much, much more of the class and the game than you have, done a lot more, done a lot more to try to fix it, and earned a lot more than you have.<br />
<br />
You're barking up the wrong tree and being disrespectful and stupid when you cop an attitude and tell your elders to shut up.<br />
<br />
There are very few people whom humility doesn't make a lot more palatable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">EQ may be pretty well killed for me, but I still check this board for 2 reasons.<br />
1) old habits die REALLY hard.  EQ is a hobby I've been practicing from work via this board for over 3 years now.  <br />
2) the approach SoE takes to EQ just CANNOT be too far off from what they're going to do in EQ2.  Their stance on customer service and satisfaction has created in me a hefty bit of loathing and disgust.<br />
<br />
Simply put - if EQ is allowed to deteriorate and degrade as it's been doing (the leeching of all fun from the shaman class being the aspect that I'm the closest to - hence the one I base my observations on) - there's not the slightest chance I'll waste money on EQ2.<br />
<br />
Brenlo's actions here will likely determine whether I bother spending any more money with SoE.  My hopes aren't high, by any means.  Same ol song and dance, so far.  We've seen a few E3's - and they've been bombs for a while now.<br />
<br />
(my vote is still to bury the shaman class without any further tormenting of the corpse, combine them with beastlords, and use the autopsy to determine what you should NEVER EVER do to a class again)</div></div><hr />

<br />
And Blarg, I don't really know who is taking a snotty attitude here, or who is telling folks to shut up, or who is being disrespectful, or stupid, or who is sneering down on their elders. Your post confused me ... <br />
<br />
But I remain grateful for the dialogue and encourage more of it. Plain and simple.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Megara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">The devs and designers are absolutely the problem at this point.  The entire feel of the game has been radically altered in the last year or so.  I have heard McQuaid, one of the original EQ designers, is creating a new game;  I'll be interested to see what it is like.<br />
<br />
However, I do love my characters on EQ, so I sure hope Brenlo or somebody can wake up the Sony devs soon!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Tordail, my apologies that my post might have made it look like the whole thing was addressing you.  In fact almost none of it was.  The only part that was, was my trying to get across that your previous post had been a kind of fawning in its own way, in that it seemed to on the one hand say that someone popping his head in for an occasional post was actually meaningful dialogue and something on a level we haven't already been exposed to already, with no signifcant follow-up action to show for it, and also that you advised someone to go re-read someone's post if they didn't agree.  I am certain that agreement regarding the importance of someone showing up and making reassurances is really based on reading comprehension.  If they disagreed as to how important that really was, it's not because they hadn't considered it or read some post.<br />
<br />
The rest of my last post was on some of the attitudes I've seen here in general lately, and had nothing specifically to do with you at all, Tordail.  I wasn't thinking about you at all when I wrote it; it was a different subject.  <br />
<br />
I was saying that the people saying &quot;take it easy, everything's great&quot; are at least as aggressive and prolific as those who don't, and I'm kind of tired of people trying their darnedest to cast as whiners, losers, or name-your-negative anyone who doesn't toe the party line that things are fairly great and have always been and always will be fairly great.  I guess I do feel a little worse when it seems it's so much more often than not some shaman bot or newbie shaman who is leaping at the opportunity to tell the old timers they should all shut up and they all suck.  The mind-control shut-up squad is annoying and self-contradictory at best, but it really steps up the level of aggravation when it starts to get insulting, especially toward some of the old-timers I respect on the board, some of whom might have forgotten more than their johnny-come-lately smartypants critics will ever even know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I figured i would check back after a couple days and see what has happened. <br />
<br />
Same stuff as always. the negitive get a few posts attacking them. And maybe a post or two with some support.  And a whole lot of static in between.<br />
<br />
Simply put. The peoples whose opinions matter to me i care about. the other.. Meh.. No worries say what you will. and I certainly expect my words to carry little weight.<br />
<br />
That being said. I am not by far the most prolific of posters. Or the oldest. And certainly have never thought myself the best or even close to uber.. But what I am is a customer. Who has the ears of several other customers. Who will value my advice from up to 5 years of close personal contact every day. And a whole slew of others whom I may not know all that well but after many nights of playing this silly little game and reading thoughts and emotions from years of shared experinces we might have more thatn a little in commen. <br />
<br />
I do not expect people to be swayed by any posts I make and by speaking in such manners I am stand out some and therefore am a target.. So be it.<br />
<br />
Brenlo. Simple Questions. What is the time table. What are the intended changes being reccomended. What are the chances of the reccomended changes.<br />
<br />
Any Devs that come by. What is the intent of shaman in the future. Are we to be First class healers and support or are we to be a mismash of abilities which the sum is overshadowed in the direction that gameplay has gone?<br />
<br />
And to everyone else. Why is it that you will turn a blind eye to the past. Brenlo is nto a friend of ours. He is a fuctionary of SoE used to get out the corperate line and to take polls so to speak.  <br />
<br />
Do you thank the Ticket taker at the movie theater for actually looking at you? What about for doing the absolute least possible in every situation to help your concerns? What about if every time you finally  Come to the theater he looks at you like a ticket thief and constantly wants recipts and Proof of purchase. <br />
<br />
My only problem with Brenlo per se is that he has not talked more with us. He has not communicated nor empthasized with us unless it is required.<br />
<br />
My problem with SoE is that we are simply accounts with credit cards attached. And they don't even liquor us up anymore before violating us. (Yes that is an exxageration Sue me I speak colorfully) Will SoE change my life or something with the treatment i have seen? Nah. But what they will do is change my opinion of them as a consumer and at the end of the day I base descions of where my entertainment doller goes. And as of late EQ has not been worth the very small upkeep fee even.  As for a new expansion. Not a chance in hell. With the current situation<br />

 ... someone popping his head in for an occasional post was actually meaningful dialogue and something on a level we haven't already been exposed to already, with no signifcant follow-up action to show for it, and also that you advised someone to go re-read someone's post if they didn't agree.<br />
<br />
Yeah, I thought it was meaningful. Brenlo read what we had to say about the Epic 2.0 and said he'd pass it along to the designers for their perusal. Works for me. After all, what more can he do? He's not a designer, or a dev, he's simply the CSR that has to take crap from the masses, lol. As for the follow-up action ... if there is any, I don't expect it this month, or any time soon, heh. These things take time. If nothing comes out of it, THEN we have something to go on about. Sure, I suppose folks could argue I'm taking one of those laid-back wait-and-see type attitudes (and yes, folks could argue we've waited to see in the past and nothing has been done) ... well, for the time being, I am. I think folks have to admit the dialogue between we as a class and SOE through Brenlo (and Rytan) has really picked up the last couple of months. <br />
<br />
Change begins with dialogue, and I suppose I'm in the minority when I say I'm encouraged -- if only slightly. Just because Brenlo has made a few posts ... well, it hasn't stopped me from making /feedbacks, and it hasn't stopped me from emailing SOE when I feel like I have somethin' to say. It hasn't changed my jaded attitude about the company and the quality of their work, nor has it changed my frustrations with this class. But it's a start. And that's all it is, a start. I find it an encouraging one, and I'd like for the dialogue to continue.<br />

Its like selling someone a car, and two weeks down the road the brakes fail..So to fix the problem you install a moon roof..The brakes still dont work, but damn it looks awfull snazy dont it...<br />
     As of late sony has been grinding out expansion after expansion with little thought to the what effect it will have on the game..Right now the biggest example of this would be GoD and the four week old hell patch that allowd every tard from the four corners who didnt dish out the loot to enter pok.. Just that one patch has those who suffer from it up in arms!  And in a big way. If you ask me, Sony needs to go old school and get back in touch with the hard working folks who send em that 12 bucks a month.. Customer service is at an all time low... If you need help they send you to the chat desk, who inturn sends to the phone support who inturns..well, you cant ever get through so that step is a mute point..<br />
     I really dont care which trained monkey SoE put in front of me to tell me whats up as long as its something viable..And its a little late to try and safe the ship when its allready resting on the bottom of the ocean.. Brenlo has done a ****ty job up untill now and tossing us a few bones isnt going to change it now..  To sony...You broke it, you fix it!...I leave for Iraq in about a month..Hopefullly when I get back in a year a new game will have come out that gives me the same amount of satisfaction that EQ did when I first started playing it...Now Im lucky to get through pok without freezing..</div></div><hr />

expansions aren't free.  I would be very happy if the developers working on new content fixed the current content first, but I suppose we would not shell our another $30 on top of what we pay monthly for fixes to the current content.  If we did, they would probably fix the current content.  And that is the problem with SOE.  <br />

Brenlo has a tough job because the company he represents does not work for us, but for Sony.  So return to the parent company overrides our needs.<br />

At 5 years EQ is in the 4th 'mature' quadrant of a business model - the 'cash cow' region.  You don't invest in a cash cow - just milk it.  Moo!<br />

<br />
I just don't get it.  SoE admitted they made mistakes with GoD.  They also admitted they have problems with the new engine (and, in their defense, before the engine was released, they basically stated problems were likely.)<br />
<br />
In both cases they are taking steps to fix the issues.  The content of GoD was just revised.  There have been numerous patches to fix collision issues.  They just announced they can now reproduce the PoK crash in Development and they hope to have a fix for that in the near future.<br />
<br />
What more do you want?  And before you say &quot;get it right the first time&quot;, keep 2 things in mind.  <br />
<br />
First, they are a business and they are there to make money.  If they don't have this mindset, they lose money and the game folds.  So, they have to constantly walk a balance between stability and features.  They screwed up on stability recently and said so.  They are fixing the situation and they can't go back in time and undue what they already did.<br />
<br />
Second, EQ is a massively complex set of code.  There will be bugs whenever they try and make any changes.  That's life.  If you expect bug free software (or error free anything in life), get used to disappointment.  (anyone remember the Mars lander crashing due to calculation error in the software??)<br />
<br />
Doh...gotta go back to work...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not true at all in this case.  They have an extremely dedicated playerbase that supports them quite well.  This game has been in NO danger whatsoever for quite some time, if it ever was.<br />
<br />
They were not at all in peril of crashing and burning before putting out the new engine.  What more do you want? you ask.<br />
<br />
Well, only in computing software would anyone even think to ask if you wanted your product to work before you bought it.  Industry standards are so horrible that one company made a substantial part of their name and loyalty just for having a relatively playable, bug-free series of games at a time when misrepresentations by game developers about the stability or even usability of their games had seemed to hit an utter rock-bottom -- Blizzard.  The sheer RELIEF people felt at feeling that whether they liked a Blizzard game or not, at least it would WORK was enormous; it's hard to overstate how much it came to seem almost revolutionary that a game development company actually put out games that worked reasonably well!<br />
<br />
How the hell did the gaming industry ever sink to such a low state?<br />
<br />
Would you accept half-cooked food at a restaurant, or a car whose power train wasn't hooked up so only some of the wheels could spin?  With computer games, that kind of shabbiness is what people by and large came to expect.  It's gotten better in recent years, but a fundamental and fundamentally normal and reasonable expectation that consumers have regarding the products they buy hasn't:  if you buy it, you want it to work.  Like the product, don't like it, whatever.  But it should at least WORK.<br />
<br />
I have ZERO sympathy for a game company putting out a buggy engine and making its customers its beta testers.  It is not in the slightest incumbent upon customers to be indulgent about being sold product that  is broken or unreliable or just in any particular way simply shabby.  If Sony wanted to verify the workings of its engine better, that's what the test server is for.  Even though they often don't even use it, or listen to people on the test server who find problems anyway.  And they do and should use their own internal testing, as well.  This is not a problem of customers attitudes -- it's a problem of corporate irresponsibility, incompetence, and greed.<br />
<br />
Some companies have been held in courts of law to have a &quot;warrant of merchantability&quot; such that bringing a product to market implies its fitness to be sold.<br />
<br />
So what people want with EQ as with any other product is, at the very most basic level, that it works.<br />
<br />
Sony is hardly the poor little put upon orphan being kicked about by cruel elders when people point out their buggy work.  They're a company who knowingly stuck it to their customers.  <br />
<br />
The idea that they should need sympathy and understanding for doing just that?  Ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Get it right the first time - and here's why:<br />
<br />
I have spent the last 28 years working in or around software production, and watching the software industry mature.  While expecting bug-free software is an unrealizable dream, the industry has matured to the point where tools and procedures exist so that we can expect a quality product delivered.  We are not getting that with EQ releases.<br />
<br />
Bug fixes are expensive,  It is far cheaper in most cases to do it right the first time.  That is why so many software houses are working to get CMM certified for quality.  There are a number of steps to producing quality software - this is not the forum to discuss them.  But the biggest one is to test all your changes.  If EQ has a rigorous tesing program, we would not see so many problems in game.<br />
<br />
Clearly, a 5 year-old system that has had the radical changes EQ has will be harder to modify - changes to one area ripple throughout the system in unanticipated ways.  So you have a system test to detect those before your users find the problems.<br />
<br />
The problem (as I see it) is that SOE made a business decision that the losses to its loyal customer base caused by buggy code do not override the costs of producing quality code.<br />
<br />
I am not talking about poor design issues like GoD here - just the software work.  The design issues for new content are far harder to detect in testing.  But getting stuck in trees in PoK, the random lockups, and the indoor rain reintroduced with the new engine are all problems that should never have gone to production.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">A hypothetical scenario:<br />
<br />
SoE has a new engine. They know it is likely buggy but they also know they do not have time to find all the bugs on test (of course it would also help if they fixed those bugs they discover on test - but that another issue).<br />
<br />
They state in a patch message that next week the new engine will go live for a week or two and to feedback every glitch and bug in that time. After the two weeks are over they repatch the old engine and work a month or so on fixing the new engine, then patch the hopefully bugfree engine back to live servers.<br />
<br />
The patch load would be similar given that we patched this engine a couple of times already, the development time would be the same and the customers would probably a lot happier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Wilcas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Interesting idea. But I suspect that backing out an engine in the live environment would be a non-trivial task - our characters and the environment change constantly.<br />
<br />
Quality software takes time and recources.  I see no real external pressure to rush software out to us, the clients before it is ready.  The only motivator I can see is internal and profit centered.<br />
<br />
The idea of testing in production is abhorrent to me from a professional perspective.  I know it's only a game, but really!  We are the paying customers!<br />
<br />
When you think about it SOE already has an advantage most of the rest of the world doesn't.  Where else can you get people to pay for the opportunity to test your software on your test server?  If they do not do an adequate job, SOE needs to find ways to either test adequatly themselves or incent people to use the test server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">A hypothetical scenario:<br />

<br />
The patch load would be similar given that we patched this engine a couple of times already, the development time would be the same and the customers would probably a lot happier.<br />
<br />
And then SoE has another code base to maintain because there are a lot of non-UI engine changes being done at the same time the UI engine changes are being made.  This approach would significantly complicate an already complicated situation.  (believe me, I've been forced into this situation on a few occasions - it almost always causes more problems than it solves)<br />
<br />
Wilcas  - don't get me wrong - I think SoE screwed up with the Dx9 upgrade, and overall the quality level of their patches is not where I would like it to be.  I'm only taking exception to the people stating SoE should be delivering bug free software.  I also work in software development (SQA manager in fact  ;) ) and I am very aware of the changes in our field.  I'm probably a bit touchy on this subject because I've been in the situation of having people at my company complaining because we could not produce bug free software (on an ironic note, some of these people were put in charge of various development efforts and soon came to realize that &quot;bug free&quot; is not close to realistic with a commercial company that produces even a moderately complex product.)  <br />
<br />
All I'm asking is for people to be realistic in what they ask for - and bug free software is not realistic.  The reason I think people should be realistic is because I think it's generally more effective than ranting.  (of course, both are needed at times  :p )</div></div><hr />

We have made it clear that you will not be receving immediate answers on these issues. We are compiling the lists to take to the team after E3, one for each class.  Yes you may have posted it all 1.5 years ago, but what does it hurt to repost it now?  The poll is to prioritize the issues based on what all of you feel is relevant, not one or two of you.  Let us see what we can do with it.  <br />
<br />
And no these are not being gathered to use as AA fodder, I asked for these to be compiled so we could present clear points for each class and let the team decide how they want to handle it.  I will be taking the poll down and we will use the 10 points as they are.  <br />

Any further rants or flaming on this issue will be deleted and the offender will most likely lose their ability to post here.<br />

I have to go to the customers all over the world and stand before them and answer for our products.  You think we are a demanding bunch?  Try working in semiconductor where the customer just paid $10 million for something.  I get beat up.  You know what I do..I go back to the people responsible for the mistakes and beat them up until it gets fixed.  I also keep the customer up to date on an ETA for it being fixed.  Many times just an ETA will make them happy.  I'm not seeing any of this from SOE.  Maybe he is beating up the developers and programmers..but he could make lots of people happy by giving us updates and ETA's. <br />
<br />
I don't expect bug-free code.  However, I do expect MINIMAL bugs and for found bugs to be fixed in a timely manner.  I CERTAINLY expect the bugs from a newly released expansion to come before a new expansion. <br />
<br />
The content stuff I can understand. Sometimes you can tell exactly how content will be until real groups and raids try it out.  Balance and content aren't black and white. These are things that are up for debate and such.  Bugs either work or don't.  I don't think we should have to stand for getting yanked around on bugs.  <br />
<br />
Brenlo, if you are reading this...DO YOUR JOB.  If you can't fix the problems, you can atleast give us an ETA or an update on where things are in the fixing process.  It would make your life/job much easier.  All this is assuming that you are actually doing your job and that you are beating up the programmers and such...If you aren't..then disregard all this and take your beating like a man..you deserve it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">I don't think anyone is asking for code to be perfect, so it's misleading and perhaps a little disingenuous to speak as though they were.

<br />
What we do probably all want is something not perfect, but without too many notable bugs.  That's pretty fair to expect.  <br />
<br />
If it takes them a while to do their testing, so be it.  If it costs them some money or they have to hire extra people -- I'm not exactly crying in my beer about it.  Honestly, that's none of my concern and I don't even want to hear about it.  I pay money every month -- how they mismanage it is their problem and their responsibility.<br />
<br />
I'm the one paying THEM, not vice versa.  I'm not here to provide sympathy and excuse every screw up or cheap-out.  I'm not the guy to come to when you're looking for approval for screwing up things for me.  Why on earth would I be or be expected to be in favor of Sony's choosing to keep their own comfort level high at the cost of my own?  They're barking up exactly the wrong tree on that one.<br />
