<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>nornez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">just trained scr3 last night &amp; i gotta say i definately notice a diff in buff duration.<br />
<br />
well was all pumped to get those next 5 aa pts for scrm (according to castersrealm) when i noticed today in the AA section of the inventory window that scrm is listed as 8 aa pt cost... is this correct? if so i guess i will hafta suck it up &amp; got for 8 now.<br />
<br />
was thinking QB2 (for a near 3 second Q) next then ND3... any thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Notgurck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">All solid choices, whatever order you get them in won't leave you hurting.  I did nd3 asap after getting canni5, but i'm a lunatic hp freak.  Have qb1 and currently working on scrm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">SCRM is 8 points.  You read that right.  It's still very much worth it.<br />
<br />
Get QB2 and some quick buff focus item.  That, or get QB3 and never think about needing to get a quick buff focus item again.<br />
<br />
Your magelo AA list is out of date.  It's hard to tell what you want to go for as such.  Try searching for info about different AA routes to go.  It depends if you do a lot of healing, or tanking, or want utility clicky AAs, or if you raid.<br />
<br />
Assuming you have:  run3 regen3 mc3 c5 scr3 scrm qb2<br />
What you absolutely MUST HAVE is RC1 before you go on to anything more.  It's amazing, and only 2 points.<br />
You'll probably want to go for SCM3 to save yourself a whack of mana regardless what route you go down.<br />
<br />
then this is what you might want to go for:<br />
raiding:  MGB, CA3, LR5, CS3, ID5, ND3<br />
healing:  HG3, AHG3, RC3, HA3, AHA3 (whichever gives you critical heals first, then RC3, then bigger normal heals)<br />
clicky:  SC1, VP1, SM2, Pet Disc, then finish working up to SC3 and VP3<br />
<br />
Don't bother with Rabid Bear.  It blows.<br />
Don't bother with better nukes until you don't have much else to buy.  Shaman don't really nuke much to make it worth while.<br />
RC1 is an absolute necessity for so much of POP.  Higher levels cure more counters, but also give you a better chance of removing annoying effects like Malo and stuff.<br />
Don't bother with higher int/wis or increasing your int/wis cap or your physical stats until you have all of your raiding/healing/clicky AAs bought.  You just don't get much benefit out of it compared to the other stuff.<br />
<br />
Personally, I basicly only had run3 regen3 mc3 c5 mgb before POP.<br />
I went the clicky route a bit to get sc3, vp1, rc1, then jumped over to the raiding path to get LR5 and CS3, then jumped back to the clicky where I'm working up stuff now.  I most recently bought VP3 and SCM2 because I personally always had enough mana for what I was doing, and I like clickies!  I've liked the path I've gone down.  I'm going to finish the clicky path, then finish the raid path, then start working on the healing path before I get the &quot;fluff&quot; AAs like rabid bear and bigger caps on my stats.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And yes, 8 points for SCRM is worth it. And dont forget to add an item with another buff extender effect. Shawl adds 20% more. Ceramic Shield of Valor adds 15%. And there are lots of other items out there, depending on what you have access to.<br />
<br />
QB3 removed one of the games annoyances for me. I hated (hated with a passion) the insanely long cast times on our buffs. QB3 brought them back down to something close to being reasonable.<br />
<br />
ND3 is nice. CA3 then LR5 are really nice. CS3 then ID5 after those enhances your survivability by tons.<br />
<br />
Shaman get a fair number of good AA's. Mostly, its just a matter of getting the points for them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is highly dependant on your playstyle and how you spend you time.  I didn't get rc1 until I had 130 aa, and I never missed it.  It's handy, I find uses for it occasionally, but I still don't use it very often.  Still haven't gotten vp1 either.<br />
<br />
SCRM and qb2/3 are well worth it, as is finishing up nd3 and working on ca3/lr5 skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">OTOH I use RC1 all the time, both in grind groups and raid parties.  Yes, some of the stuff I'm curing is stuff we would have just lived with before, like Boiling Blood, but now we don't have to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you never face a caster, you might not need RC.<br />
If you don't ever raid, you won't need it either.<br />
But the ability to cure malo, tash, root, snare, poisons, diseases, heat blood line, enchanter dots, curses, slows, and any number of other effects that can only be dispelled from your entire group for zero mana cost, that is absolutely incredible that it only costs 2 points.<br />
I would happily pay 6 AAs or more for such an AA and still be very pleased with it.<br />
<br />
Sure, you could work on other AAs without getting RC1.<br />
Just like you could work on other AAs without getting C5.<br />
*snicker*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rakji</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I wanted the same AA's first that you are shooting for. I got Can5, then did scr3 to hold me over for better Q, then did nd3 for a can5 safety margin, and now back to scrm. Will do qb2 next and thinking of getting mgb after that to get class title. Mgb will be handy too, but as I don't raid a lot, its not that important to me.<br />
<br />
Edit: After thinking about it and seeing others opinions, I think I will get rc1 before I do mgb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">When I finish SCRM, after 90 AA or so, I'll finally be an Elder!  <br />
<br />
You don't need to raid to love RC1.  It's great all over the place.  A borderline must-have AA, and for only 2 AA, it's the best deal for AA choices.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Agree with the others, RC is a nice convenience in most situations and a must for certain raids, and for 2 points, no reason not to get it.  SCRM is also very well worth it and I finished it before I even started ND, I reported to Casters Realm ages ago that it was 8 points instead of 5 as Im sure many others have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Do not underestimate SCM.  Contrary to popular belief around here, shamans are in fact a spell casting class.  Listen to what people are saying about RC.  RC1 would be a bargain at 8 points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Currently working on scr3/m myself.  I went for RC2, better chance to get rid of some of the nasty &quot;magic&quot; debuffs, like thunderblast in NToV. Also got VP1 and SC1 for clickies.  I'm a bit disappointed in VP, I got it for the knockback, but it does not seem to stop most gating mobs, even when it lands.  Is VP2 an improvement there?<br />
I have QB3 next on my list, is that 3/6/9 cost?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I would call removing my root more than a minor convenience!  But then again, I love to pull.  And I love fighting casters.<br />
<br />
Here's my vote for most underappreciated AA - pet discipline.  Pets can pull better than any level 65 toon.  Trust me.  My dog single pulls from places where I'll get 3.  <br />
<br />
VP has interrupted no small number of gating critters.<br />
<br />
Really, it depends on where you're playing and what your style is.  If you spend all your time exp grinding in Valor with full groups, you'll probably have about zero use for RC or PD - so you'd want to go for general use stuff.  *shrug*  Every bear's gonna take different stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Going to add my vote for RC1 as terrifically cheap for the ability.  I use it all the time, and not just in raids.  There's probably not a better use for 2 points once you have Canni.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">This is highly dependant on your playstyle and how you spend you time.

SCRM and qb2/3 are well worth it, as is finishing up nd3 and working on ca3/lr5 skills.<br />
<br />
In CT when soloing RC is really handy, and on grummus raids you'll see everyone asking who has rc.. and in the eplanes specially poe you need it to remove a lot of those crappy dots etc..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Notgurck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Pets can pull better than any level 65 toon. Trust me. My dog single pulls from places where I'll get 3<br />
What exactly is the technique for doing this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Dread</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I agree with many of the shaman here.  Quick buff, SCRM, ND, SCM, and CA / LR5 are all great AAs.<br />
<br />
RC is absolutely essential.  But, don't just get RC1, go ahead and get RC2.  RC1 might cure things about 25% of the time, but RC2 has 80% or so cure rate.  So many of the PoP and SSRA mobs have nasty curses and DoTs.  I play on a pvp server and zoned into PoN and started running along the wall north toward the hedge.  After a few steps, I am snared, CRAP, I didn't see that group of &lt;enemy guild X&gt; camping the zone in.  Well, 1 click of RC, and I was on my way.<br />
<br />
SC should also not be underestimated.  It is a non resistable source of damage that can stun and interrupt.  Works great on players with 300+ MR who are trying to kill you.  Don't forget to VP them first - muahaha.  But seriously, I once got 3 spirit calls off on SSRA emperor ( we had small turnout but had to drop him for rifts / c-block ).  Every bit of DPS helps, don't leave home without it.</div></div><hr />
