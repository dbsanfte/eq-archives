<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Elindra_BB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm thinking about doing alteration as a spec, however i was wondering if people thought this was a good choice?<br />
<br />
Is there another type of spell that is more useful?  I'm not so worried about what types of spells i use most in the mid-levels as the type i'll be using in the 50s.<br />
<br />
Alteration good or should i do something else?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Definitely go with Alteration. There really is no other option, though I suppose if there were a second place it would be Conjuration. Don't worry about sitting there and casting spells over and over to be sure that Alteration is your specialization: simply playing normally should take care of it, as Cannibalize is an Alteration spell and is probably cast at least 10 times as much as your other spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Alteration is the ticket.  You'll cast more Alteration spells than anything else . . by far.  Even disincluding canni, slows are alt, heals, talisman buffs, HoS, Focus, roots.  A shaman in a group is not the main damage dealer.  We're lucky to be able to get much dmg done at all actually with our other responsibilities at hand.  <br />
<br />
Actually tho, now I have canni5 I wish I was better at turning that mana into damage.  I still wouldn't switch from alteration spec tho.</div></div><hr />
