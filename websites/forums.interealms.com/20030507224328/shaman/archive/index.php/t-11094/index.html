<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GroutRavenPaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone have any ideas on where the best place power level my n ecromancer would be? I have him up to lvl 53 currently (rogue pet).<br />
<br />
Don't care about loot at all, just looking for fast exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">pay off an enchanter to charm duo with him, or try and convince a chanter that you will help him charm more efficiently somehow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tragik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Forget the enchanter.  I rarely see mid 50's chanters that are good at charm kiting and those that are probably don't want to waste time duo'ing with anyone.  Besides, necros can charm undead which can be used in Maiden's Eye, Howling Stones, etc..  If you know a 65 chanter willing to do this then throw the rest of my post out the window.<br />
<br />
Ditch the 53 rogue pet and buff up the 49 pet.  Hit Chardok, Sebilis or any old world dungeon and just have the pet tank slowed mobs while the necro drops splurt and ignite blood or plague followed by dooming (just to snare) at 60%.  Use cascading if you want the snare to act as another decent dot.  Pet's no longer take exp so the necro doesn't even need to outdamage the pet.  <br />
<br />
49 nec pet has 2350HPs and ~35DPS unbuffed and it is a serious undercon.  More than enough to use this method and much easier if you're two boxing.  Summon up shaman 55 pet, alpha and haste it to make kills faster even if not grouped with the necro.  At 56 the monk pet sometimes tanks better due to it's level (44) and avoidance skills even though it only has around 1600HPs.  Really depends on the mobs you're fighting.<br />
<br />
This should even be doable in the planes on the lower level stuff.  Prisoners and low level sentries in PoJ, the goos and rats in PoD,  for example.  Don't stop at 60 though, ding the nec to 61, even 62 for new spells.  Legacy of Zek pet is a level 60 warrior that comes with a dot crazed feign death caster.  Add a shaman with Kragg's Mending and you can do nearly anything in the 1st tier planar zones, including running out of mobs.<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Just went back and saw that you're 65.  Definantely get the necro to 62.  Spells are easy to get and his DPS will improve greatly compared to 60 for typical short group kills.  Especially in the higher tier zones.<br />
