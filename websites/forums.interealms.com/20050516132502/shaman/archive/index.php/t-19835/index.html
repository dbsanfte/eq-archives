<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Patito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey, just so you all know, Science of War a PoTime guild on Stormhammer has just released all of their old raid guides up to and including many PoTime bosses to the public. These are very useful guides that if followed correctly will tell you the best ways to take down many PoP, Elemental and even PoTime gods. Check out the Public Library in the forums on http://www.scienceofwar.net even if your guild is already a PoTime capable guild, these guides might give you some ideas on how to do some things more effectively. Please post any ideas or strategies that may be missing to help others out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dugok Grumblehawk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Thank you very much for that huge amount of knowledge! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">woot, a way now for every guild to use someone elses strats instead of actually working together on their own to find one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Give Patito a break, he voluntarily offers up a lot of information. Something very few around do nowadays. If people dont want hints/tips/guides they can just stay away from the SoW messageboard. And I seriously doubt that all the top guild never used any kind of outside information. Its particularily suspicious how close some of the top guilds were in taking down end game mobs. Either it was really easy to figure out or they got &quot;inspiration&quot; somewhere.<br />
<br />
Thanks Patito (though I doubt I will ever get to use any of it hehe).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The public library in the forums doesnt seem to be public anymore ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I just registered and logged in about 2 minutes ago, so I think it's still public.<br />
<br />
you do have to register on their site, but you don't have to be a member, and you don't have to do the annoying wait-for-an-email-registration that some sites require, so really it just takes about 30 seconds and your surfing the forums</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">++ postive rep inc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Very nice thing to do. For those hating its not like strats are hard to get, I'm sure many guilds have done mobs using other guilds tactics wether it be new members, raid invites or whatever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grubbnubbnubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ahhh yes, surprised dis has not been posted ta here yets.<br />
Yes, those are in fact the libary anda strats we made fer our own private use.<br />
Da information should be compleat enough fer most folks ta win da encounters.<br />
However it was never da guilds intention ta have these made public, but da board fell out of our control and was made public against our wishes.<br />
Contary ta da sad miss-information on da front page, we did not quit EQ.<br />
We re-formed anda are still enjoyin da game.<br />
Fer those happy ta git da information, well enjoy it and do try ta learn as ya advance, guides alone will not git ya der.<br />
As fer all ya that are miffed dat this information will make it simpler fer sum ta advance, well dis was dun by one person out of spite against da wishes of the guild, so talk ta him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I wonder if that person was the same one that was banned from here.... Hrmmmm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Sweet way to get some e-mail addys for spam! :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Patito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Sciek: yep<br />
<br />
Nagruuz: I highly doubt the owner of the webpage would ever use it for spam, and even if you're worried just create a fake hotmail account or something. I have a hotmail account I use for exactly that purpose, I only check it when I subscribe to something like that. <br />
<br />
And, as Grubbnubbnubb said, we didn't voluntarily give out this information. The old guild leader (who's been gone for quite some time) owns the webpage and decided to make it public viewing for everyone and force our guild members to create a new guild without him. I just figured that I'd pass the word along since it's out of our control, and that way hopefully he'll have some major traffic to the site (can we say extra site fees?).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Ok yes you can just create a username/password and get in to the site with no hassles.  Oh and just use a fake email if you're worried about it, I did and can log in and and surf around just fine.<br />
<br />
As for the strats,  yes they will help some who have the power to get to and survive these encounters, but you still have to have the manpower and willpower to get up to this level.   It's not like just any guild can walk in to elementals/time with this information.  Most guilds have thier own strats and insider info from word of mouth so info like this is really only useful if you're stuck (or you suck).   And in the case of suckage you probably wont win anyway! :)</div></div><hr />
