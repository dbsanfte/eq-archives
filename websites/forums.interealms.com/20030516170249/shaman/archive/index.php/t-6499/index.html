<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">how much they go for on your server ? is that the only item ?<br />
to me that would be gold</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Meecham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Cheap man, like 500-800 pp in bazaar, and pretty common.  There are 5 on sale in the bazaar on AB as I type this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>lionheart3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">yep i have one too and they can be pretty nice at times, on saryrn they go for 500-1000 plat, and there are generally a few for sale almost anytime in bazaar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Meener</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Do they proc rapidly enough to be useful?<br />
<br />
I don't want to stand there taking a massive beating while I wait for a tash so I can slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">with 200 self buffed dex , im sure it wouldnt be that bad , i was thinking more along the lines of beating on raid mobs till chanties either woke up or till it proced , then slow ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">my gf's monk uses one of these when we don't have a chanter. i'd say that if you have a chanter, they're going to get their tash-whatever off before this thing procs, but if you buff up your dex, you shouldn't have too long of a wait. it's a nice stick, the dmg/dly isn't bad, and it's something that i carry around in my pack if i'm not with her.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>deien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">hmm get a trash orb and give it to a bard to use to trash that works what alot of bards do</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">well , this is for me bro , not anyone else  ;)<br />
I wanna have the ability myself</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>FloppyDisks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I always carry two of them with me.  One for me, and another to hand out to someone.<br />
<br />
Unlike Malo which has almost no aggro, Tash is just sick.  It is just silly how much aggro they get from it.<br />
<br />
NOW, with that said, many times I get tired of waiting for tash.  My goal is to get the mob slowed, (these are raid mobs, exp mobs never need malo or tash since the resist changes awhile back) so I will jump in with my stick sometimes if the enchanter is playing it to cautious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ictus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Damage isn't all that good compared to alot of stuff out there, but wouldn't these be pretty decent to have main tank dualing to keep aggro?<br />
<br />
Ictus</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Litgruv, go take a group to the crypt in seb and camp a tash stick. Will need you, a cleric, a near to 60 tank, a rogue and a mezzer 55up for the ICG. add an evac or extra damage for slot6.<br />
<br />
The Baron guy is a rareish pop in one of the 4 rooms, I think he drops KD too. Also, Heiro cloak JBB drop down there etc and 60 spells from emp chottal are possible (need a 60 to safely get chottal solo, fight him by door to his room so he won't gate)<br />
<br />
Crypt is fun, once you get a feel for it do it with less people for more fun.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">the ratio isn't that bad, and pro is ubber taunt right ? wonder what happen if warrior duel wield this compare to Fleshgrinder ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Lovista Atreides</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">These used to be the best weapons in the game for a MT warrior, two of those and they would NEVER lose aggro.   Around 2 years they patched all procs so they had notably less aggro(mostly to nerf this item).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tulurean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Tashani is a neg 23 Unresistable Magic debuffer. Good intro debuff to set up other debuffs.<br />
<br />
When duoing with my monk, I start all fights dual wielding a Journeyman's and an Anklesmasher (procs snare). With 200 dex and 81% haste (epic + celerity), I can usually get both to proc within first 25 to 35% of the fight.</div></div><hr />
