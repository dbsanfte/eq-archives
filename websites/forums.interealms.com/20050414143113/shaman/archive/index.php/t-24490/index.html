<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Eisgeist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was looking at a few different companies for a new computer. I put this one together this morning on Dell's site. It's $500 off right now so the price is $2,058.<br />
<br />
I would like this computer to last me maybe four years or so with little if any upgrades.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.<br />

5) 2 x 160GB Raid 0   -   ((Do I really need Raid 0 or would one hard drive be enough?))<br />
6) Floppy drive<br />

8) Sound Blaster Audigy 2</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Thats a nice computer. I personally wouldn't want a flat panel monitor. But if you going to get one, dell makes some of the best. The price for a pre-built pc is good too. I wouldn't plan on it taking you for 4 years though, I think within 2 years 64 bit will start to move into games with longhorn and windows XP both comming in 64bit versions for consumers. <br />
<br />
If you were building a computer I would definatly recomend AMD, but its hard to find a good amd pre-built, so for the money, I'd say thats a good deal.<br />
<br />
As for the raid 0, you wont notice it all that much. I run raid on my machines<br />
<br />
p4 3.0ghz 1 gig ram, ati 9800 pro, audigy 2 zs.,  3 sata 200 gig drives(raid) (windows xp) and a p4 3.0ghz 1 gig ram nvidia 5900, audigy 2 zs , 4 sata 160 gig drives (raid) (debian unstable)<br />
<br />
You will only notice the raid 0 on disk intensive applications. <br />
<br />
In any case, i'd say if you have the money, and dont want to do it yoruself, thats a good buy.<br />

I think I'm going to drop the Raid and go with a single drive and use the savings to upgrade to a ATI Radeon X800 XT. I don't even really need the screen but it's a free upgrade so I may use it or just sell it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gorg Grimm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I went and looked up your basic system, getting good at this now after three weeks, and it looks good save for the monitor.  I realize it's a free upgrade but sometimes free isnt the best.  It has a response time of 25ms.  If you play first person shooters or graphic intesnive games your gonna get ghosting with this monitor.  I would recommend dumping the monitor, theres a button saying no monitor and it will save you 90 bucks on your system.  Then go to newegg.com and type NU in the search screen.  Nu makes a flat panel monitor with the exact same specs as the sony's but cost only $250. It has a refresh rate of 16ms which is ideal for gaming unless you can afford a 12ms refresh rate monitor.  If you really didnt want a flat pannel at all bank the $90 and buy some coke's.<br />
