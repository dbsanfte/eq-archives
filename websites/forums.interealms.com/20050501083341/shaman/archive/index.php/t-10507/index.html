Apparently this guy WAS alevel 56 Bard by the time i got there he was 46 and while i was there he turned 45. What he had been doing is grouping with a necro and gettin him to cast a spell which kills you but gets you a type of emerald(forgot exact name) that sells in bazaar for 300pp to other necros as they can use it to so a 93% rezz. Basically this guy undinged 10 times for a plat?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Julean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Essence emeralds, necros use for self-rez.<br />
<br />
It's called sac-ing -- sacrificing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's also used as part of the quest for the Vex thal key.<br />

Not a bad use of a char you quit playing really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">People do this a lot, except most of the time they are considerate enough to do it in a deserated area so that no one gets lags by the corpses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Getting 500pp for each death from 56 to 46 is quite a bit of pp the person inherited a bard and realized it is too much work playign one so they made good use of them :)<br />
<br />

<br />
Aye, most of the time.  Maybe its something about AB tho, a few attention-seekers seem to love leaving their corpse army in Nexus or Bazaar to annoy people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hell, doesn't matter where you do it if you LOOT YER FREAKIN CORPSE!  People who do this crap piss me off...  When I sac'd ny twink for VT key emeralds, I looted every one, to avoid just thus happening.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've seen a couple incidences where it's done for the sport of art.<br />
A true waste of thousands of plat.    A 60 shaman (did quit the game, but you know they always come back) I knew, was used in this fashion to make a pretty circle.  :rolleyes:  Now, he's level 46.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bilei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">self-rez<br />
Not self only. A necro can rez anyone, same as a cleric. Altho it usually costs alot more than an cleric rez or is only used (because of the component cost) when a cleric rez isn't available and then usually just rez the cleric and let the cleric do the rest of the rezzing.<br />
<br />
My main is a level 59 necro. If I sac someone numerous times, I make them clear the corpses, mostly because it will lag me out...execpt for 1 time. My sister and her boyfriend both play. Her boyfriend had gotten burned out on playing his wizzie and let me sac him down a few levels. Sis and I knew he would be cringing too hard to have him be on the wizzie while I sacced him, so sis got on the wizzie. We spent the next 2 1/2 hours in GD near the PoK book saccing and arranging the corpses to spell out the wizzie's name.  Took a bunch of screenshots from atop a rock and she put one on her desktop. Was a rather fitting tribute (we thought) and the corpses were spaced out enough to not cause too much lag. He wasn't as impressed as we thought he would be =(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Went from 60 down to 51 and twinked another character with<br />
the 55k I got from the exp bar.<br />
<br />
Then I quite the game for a while.<br />
<br />
Currently I am 53 again and grinding aaxp like mad.  It is very nice to have torpor / malo and such scribed in the spell book instead of taking up space in the bank.<br />
