<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Draznar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How can I get the Iskar outcast to spawn. I spent two hours in the sewers last night and never had one spawn in the last room.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xatrei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">As far as I know, it's just a random spawn.  Just keep clearing that room &amp; eventually one should pop.  I'll find out for sure (hopefully) tonight when I begin work on my cudgel quests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Epyx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Trust me he will spawn just can take a hell of a long time. I have found though that the outcast (at least for me) only spawns at the left hand static spot as you enter cave. <br />
<br />
It doesn't seem to be necessary to clear any of the other spawn points just hammer at this point. It worked for me and I didn't have to get dizzy clearning the whole place every 30 secs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Draznar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Is it worth visiting all the rooms? Is one better than the rest?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Draznar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Also is it quicker to get these guys in the Swamp of No Hope?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>xano</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">trust me he spawns any where down there as long as u clear fast enough. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Draznar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hey, I am nolonger a Lurker. :) But I am  not quite up to a rambler.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Go to the very last room when you swim into the sewers.  There should be a room there with a see-thru wall on one side and an invisible wall that leads out to a hole in the roof on the other.  I nailed down all the skulls I needed in about 30 min and just helped someone last night do the same.  Great thing I noticed was that another PH or the Iksar Outcast will spawn immediately after both roamers die.</div></div><hr />
