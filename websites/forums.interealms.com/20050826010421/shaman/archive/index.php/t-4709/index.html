<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sorry guys for asking this here, but I couldn't figure out a better place to ask then here.   I recently have fallen into a Stone Bladed Axe of Dismay  2hs  44/44  + 75 HP, War, lev 51 req.  <br />
I am wondering what this fine specimin would be worth.  I am on Rodcet Nife, btw.   I would love to trade this for a OoIV (even if I had to add a little cash).  Let me know if that sounds reasonable.<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />

Not much desire for a 2hs on a warrior.  especially with only 75hp and no proc.<br />
<br />
you could always list it at some outrageous cost and see if someone is dumb enough to buy it.  Lower your cost gradually if it doesnt sell.<br />
<br />
The only real reason a war would go 2hs is to avoid riposte damage on high hitting mobs (1600 hitters, etc).   <br />
<br />
The strat is to tank with 2 1handers to gain agro and once established change off to a 2h when your defensive disc fades.  Go back to 1handers when disc is back.  That way you can try to minimize the dmg you take from ripostes when the warrior isnt protected with /disc defensive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I recently sold one on Emarr for 16k.  I had it overnight in the Bazaar for 2 nights at 20K, it sold quickly when I reduced the price.  :)<br />
<br />
It is one of the best droppable warrior 2 hand slash in the game, but I have no patience for buying and selling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Egads man, what the hell hits for 1600? Hardest we've seen is Avatar of War, and he's like 1200ish?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zugugg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Some of the wurms in VP hit for 1500</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">2hs or not, it's an awesome weapon.  Not something I'd recommend for an MT who would hit too slow to taunt initial aggro, but not everyone is an MT.  <br />
<br />
Excellent weapon I'd say, not to mention nice eye candy when you score a crit and your guildies are like WHOA!  And I do believe some people appreciate compliments.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Great weapon to use if you are not MA or in small exp group, it will outdamage 9/16+ 17/28 weapon easily, it will better damage for most warrior's 1h combo; <br />
<br />
also, MA's agro mainly come from Pro and DPS, fast delay only mean more DPS; a monk with high damage 2hb can easily cause more agro than duel wield 1hb</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Shamam:  Love you sig... for some reason it makes me think of xmas.  :)<br />
<br />
When the axes are listed (in the bazaar on Karana) they're generally in the 10-15k range.  I've never seen one below 8 or 9k.  I wouldn't think they should list for much more than the price of a Reaver (40/40, +12 to all saves, a little more class general.)  Right now they're usually a little more, but CT loot is still depreciating.<br />
<br />
Can't believe the prices on those Heavy Rubi BPs... they're down to 23k already and still not selling.</div></div><hr />
