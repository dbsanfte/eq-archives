<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ousal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a 60 shaman and I never really nuked much with him.  His abjuration skill is only at 188.  With the fast poison nuke spells, I gt alot of fizzles.  I tried last night by chain casting innerfire to raise my skill, but after an hour.  It went up maybe 2 points.  I would like to be able to help nuke to get him through the trials, but he fizzles way too much to make it worth it.  Would anyone have a suggestion.  I consider any advice valuable.  Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fenora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nukes are evocation ;) <br />
Grab a kei and either chain cast Burst of Flame on yourself, or load it and chain cast on mob while you are casually group hunting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ousal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Not all dd spells are evocation.  We have a spell, Blast of Venom, that does about the same damage as Ice Strike and it uses conjuration.  I would also like to appologize for using the wrong skill in my post title.  BoV is 3 seconds faster than IS and does the same amount of damage.  My conjuration skill is 220 and I still fizzle alot to cast BoV.  Doing a trial takes great DPS and good mana control.  With alot of fizzles, I will be oom before the first wave is complete.  I have been using summon drink to build up my conjuratino skill and like abjuration.  It is not climbing.  I have a 255 wis with KeI and it doesn't appear to be helping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Abjuration: Inner Fire and/or Fleeting Fury<br />
Divination: True North and/or Sense Animals<br />
Evocation: Burst of Flame<br />
Conjuration: Summon Food / Summon Drink<br />
<br />
My Conj maxed in my 40s from DoTing, I'm surprised yours isn't.<br />
<br />
Yes it takes hours of nonstop practicing to get max casting skill. Break it into chunks, an hour a day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>ludgurorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">do you have any training points left?   I found at 60 that I had not trained in ages and had over 50 points to train with.  Used them to max out the past points of evocation and abjuration. <br />
<br />
still have not maxed out divination.  its at 218 ish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ousal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for all of the advice everyone.  I will use it wisely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I had like 130 points at one time when I remembered around lvl 55 to go and check it while in katta.  Just spent alot of them using on the free tradeskills, figure that maybe someday I will get around to doing that.  Anyways, Nytmare it depends on what each individual person does at their respective lvl.  I found that since I soloed a lot, my skills in alteration (well, prob. the same for everyone) was high as well as conjuration, because I doted the mob alot.  But, when I tend to group with others, I usually don't dot as much, I go for nukes periodically if I even use dmg based spells at all.  This is just me, and might not be everyone, but it explains how someones skill might not be so high.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well, I have rarely had the benefits of cleric buffs when exp'ing, so i always cast the shammy ac buff on myself when soloing. That kept my abjuration pretty high. Not maxxed myself, but pretty close.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You can fish while casting.  Helps to break up the monotony and makes the time go faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mazirus Slaymaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I love the rare times where we get to do resist buffs.. and i get an abjuration point. think im like 204 only haha</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tallanas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I generally find that my play style let's me max a lot of skills - I tank solo, so alteration, evocation and conjuration are right up there... But I expected my abjuration to be higher than it is - I always have an AC buff and a talisman on me and the dog, and I keep Fury up at all times... Yet my skill is a trifling 151... Hmmm :( <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Wolfborn01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">My abjeration was at 138 the other day so made a hot key to cast inner fire on my self after hitting hotkey for 30 min its now at 155</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I get a 'protected player&quot; message when I try to nuke myself..does that still give skill-ups or has it been nerfed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Wontonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Your skill still goes up as long as your spell eats away your mana. By the way, I don't think nuking yourself will bring up the &quot;someone is protected&quot; message, it only happen when you cast on someone else.  Or, you can nuke your pet instead. ;) <br />
<br />
By the way, a quick way to solve the problem is have an enchanter to cast Intellectual Superiority on you.  Greatly reduce the fizzle rate.  My Evoc is below 200, used to fail almost every single time when cast Torrent of Poison the 55 AE. After this buff I get 1 fizzle in about 10 attempt, or less. It really DOES help alot.</div></div><hr />

I tried for a while to keep blasting myself with Burst of Flame, and was getting nowhere...until I realized I was in PoK.  Seems most offensive activity is removed in PoK/PoT (aside from dueling).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Actually I had this happen to me in Kaladim just today, I was there working on brewing (Kaladim Constitutionals anyone?) and a pali friend of mine was cooking up some racial armor and we were goofing off and /dueled some.<br />
I started with a blind and then somehow got myself targeted and tried to slow getting the your target is protected message with the Helfdane has tried to cast a spell on you message. <br />
Oh yeah just for future ref, paladins are tough in duels LOL :P<br />
Very odd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Laziness comes now back like a boomerang, eh? When I levelled, since level 1, I always maxed out all spellcasting skills, swimming and sense heading, before I went out and levelled again. Friends used to call these my &quot;levelling rituals&quot; and asked me &quot;Why?&quot; all the time, I didn't even bother to answer with an obvious answer. In the end I had ALL spellcasting skills maxed, along with swimming and sense heading and so on, while they still struggled at higher levels with their newbie'ish skills. Then it was my time to make jokes on their sad attempts :D</div></div><hr />
