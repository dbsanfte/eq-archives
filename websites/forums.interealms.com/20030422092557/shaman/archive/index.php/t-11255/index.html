<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bonemance</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I recently got my tear from PoF and im now planing to do rak soon. I'm a bit worried since i have heard that mag pet no longer work vs rak AOE. So what strategy do you use? Bard playing resistance and warrior for MA?<br />
<br />
Also, how many hps (aprox) does have lord rak?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vulash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">We did him the other day.  He ate the shaman's tear :(  but we killed him anyway just in hiope he would have dropped the piece anyway.  We just had 2 mages there and used the old way of fire pets.  They took a little dmg but we killed him like.  We didn't have but like one cleric, a couple shaman and a druid.  In fact early in the fight when he went in the water one pet didn't follow and the mage didn't get another on him till the end so we did most of the fight with one pet<br />
<br />
Btw = We also had literally a 70 reaver chain.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>hillaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Its ture the fire pets are not as good as they used to be but they still work. All you have to do is 2 fire pets 2 clerics, druids and shaman will work also. You just have to stay out of the way of his aoe and you will kill him . It takes a while but he will die. <br />
<br />
As far as him eating the tear most of the time its because people did not turn in the diary from Neh Ashiir first. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vadmir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Don't bother with the pets.  When I did mine had a 61 SK and 60 war tank him and it took about 3 min for him to die.  I was the only death as I was trying to debuff him and did not heal myself.  Make sure you have a druid for CoS and a bard for elemental chorus.  Get FR above 200 (mine was 217 at time of fight).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jarren Icewulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Did him a couple weeks ago. <br />
1 Fire pet<br />
3 Clerics (60-62)<br />
Pet never died. I guess with Virtue and the 3 Clerics taking turns healing.<br />
Though I died from AoE, then a couple Ice Comets.<br />
I was rezed from one of the clerics almost instantly after I died. I just looted my body, sat there and med. By the time I was 60m, Rak was dead. Still a long fight.<br />
We fought him in his room up the elevator, while  we had about 6 melee (Warrios, Rogue, SKs) hang out on bridge outside.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Standard fight with buffed melees and healers. The higher level your main tank, the more he'll resist and the easier it will be. If you want to add fire pets, fine, but I think it would be a mistake to rely on them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Iranicus Spellbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Did Rak last Sunday for my epic, consisted of two groups (was total overkill) 2 rogues, 2 wizards, necro, 2 clerics war, me 60 (shaman) monk and 2 druids. me and the tank resisted each and every aoe that rak threw out at us, the monks and rogues almost died at the end but the result would have been just the same. One group can easily kill rak especially if you have a lv 60+ tank. Overall had no deaths and fight was done in 25 seconds.</div></div><hr />
