<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm seeking clarification on two points that I wasn't clear on after searching and reading this thread (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=18501&amp;highlight=intricate+wooden+figurine).<br />
<br />
1.)  Will the charm upgrade if you get access to a particular zone by virtue of level or do you have to complete the flagging event for the zone.<br />
<br />
2.)  Does the charm automatically upgrade or do you have to speak to someone or do something?<br />
<br />
Side question:<br />
<br />
If you complete a flagging event after you gain access to a zone by virtue of level do you still get the bonus/free AA?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1.) The charm will only upgrade if you gain access by flag or key to a new PoP zone.  This does not incude &quot;b&quot; zones afaik(CoTT doesn't).<br />
<br />
2. It auto upgrades, but you have to zone.<br />
<br />
You still get the aa</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thought you had to speak to Gram Dunbar and 'Tell him stories&quot; to get the AA and charm upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">you only need to tell stories for the AA, not the charm.<br />
The charm upgrade comes automatically after you finish a zone opening flag, if your charm doesn't upgrade you're most likely lacking some preflag somewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you're lacking a preflag, get it, then go see the Seer in PoK, sit down, and say &quot;unlock my memories&quot; until the message you get tells you you didn't unlock anything useful.  Saying &quot;guided meditation&quot; will give you a list of phrases that tell you what flags you have.  See the following URL for more info:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Just as a minor point, it appears that you do not get an AA for gaining entrance to Plane of Fire. You do however get the stats upgrade on the charm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I could be mistaken, but I believe the AAs were only for zones that had a flag requirement removed.  The idea was to give a benefit to those people who actually completed the flag requirement as opposed to merely getting in with level restrictions.<br />
<br />
Only a few zones had their requirements removed--PoStorms, PoTorment, PoValor, HoH, CoD, BoT, and . . . hmmm.  One more, I think.  I think only 7AA are free.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">That makes sense Chutoi, thanks. And I believe the zone you are missing is Tactics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Trivial point, but I've found that when I get upgrades to the charm augment through hailing the necessary NPC after getting the required number of LDoN successes - I can see the changes simply by removing and re-equipping the charm.  I'm supposing this will work the same for flagging upgrades on the charm itself?  *shrug*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Chutoi thats partially wrong, when i got access to Tactics which still requires flag i also got an AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">telosk, you could get the AA by doing the alternate quest though and not by killing MB. I think that is what he means by removing the requirements, at least I hope so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Actually, I believe Tactics was a carryover.  It was originally slated to be included with the other open zones.  However, a lot of players expressed concern about the presence of complete n00bs in the zone being able to hose up the RZ script, and it was taken off the list.  I believe it got as far as the test server before being taken off the list of zones to be opened.<br />
<br />
I believe the AA skill point was simply not removed before it went live.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">You also get an AA for Tower of SolRo access, however, that's the last one (total of 7).</div></div><hr />
