<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rxman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello everyone,<br />
     I am a level 52 shaman, atm I came over to a new server with a friend from Saryn server where I had a level 58 Cleric as a main and a 52 necro. I decided to make a shaman so we can duo rather efficiently, him being a SK. So far I love this class more then my necro even, I love slowes compared to fear kitting as well as my added abilities that I give in a group with my buffs. I am mostly a solo person being that my school schedule and work schedule really don't permit me to dedicate time unless on the weekends. I have been soloing nobles and bards in HHK and loving it, the xp is really nice. Although I ding'ed 52 and switched to strait AA at the moment while I wait for my partner the SK to catch up. Well anyways I was wondering about any other solo spot's that I can look forward to at say around level 55, I plan on sticking with nobles and bards until then. I read a post some time ago about some guards in &lt;Katte&gt; ? I might be spelling that incorectly. I heard that that was a slow and boring camp but good xp, I dont mind grinding out in slow camps as long as the xp is nice, I can read or work on homework while I grind  :)  Anyways I have been killing geo's for loot so that I can see about purchasing a lizard along with my level 55 pet spell. That is leading into my next question, anyone have any ideas where I could be looking for loot at ? Am I to low level to even try Old Sebelis ? Well anyways I wanted to say Hello to everyone and drop a line on how much I absolutely love this class and really look forward to the upper game with him. Thank you for any respone anyone can give, I am sure I will be posting more in the following days as I get more question about the class. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hehehe cling to the bards and nobles and say hello to the 50's.  You'll find pretty soon that grouping in tier 1 is better exp than soloing.  Especially later on when you get into PoV where you get a percent per kill grouped, which is reminiscent of hpass experience.  Soloing is still a decent option though, try PoJ zoneout, Veksar goblins, Katta guards, Old Sebilis (I've never had good luck here, bad connection+chain dd'ing froggies= hungry and thirsty at bind point), and of course learn the Dulak boats.<br />
<br />
I never did it at the optimum level, but the 8 elementals on the gunthak zoneline side of nadox are supposed to be very good exp for high 40's low 50's.  I would try this out first, as it is most like hpass except you get the chance for some nice little drops on corpse spawns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Blarney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Didn't catch what level your SK friend was, but I'd suggest dulaks harbor, and also with an SK partner I've done rats and stuff in POD for 1% every other kill with not too bad killing time.  Whoever is pulling you must be patient.  Goos hide rats well and 2 is 2 much at low 50's.<br />

Tsetsian flies can be soloed pretty easily with a shammy.  Takes time but other than that, with stoicism, not really that hard.  Pull with malosi,<br />
sick pet, slow, I stand after slow and take the few licks the flies lay on ya.  Cripple and Ebolt. then instill or whatever root it is you have.  Takes a little less time to kill if you use other poisons or I prefer diseases.  But in POD they have an above average disease resist, and I found I was wasting 20% mana to get the 3rd one on and that's 30% mana for one disease spell.  So I stick with cripple.  Pretty much use the same methods when partnered with a tank, may go easy on the Ebolt.  Every time it wears off, I replace ebolt and root, whether or not root broke, cuz it will soon.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>eepjr24</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you are a good race, just kill Nathyn's guards in Katta instead of the regular. To find them, zone in from TM, follow left wall (two left turns). You will see a dead end with two guards at it. On your left through an entranceway will be a mansion looking thing with 2 wolves and 2 guards. On your right is a large courtyard. You pull to the courtyard. The wolves can be single pulled easily. The guards usually can (at your level, later they come solo easy) by pulling from max range with a debuff (seems random, sometimes both come). Once those four are dead, open the door they are guarding, there are two more in sight to pull. If you get through those, there is a hidden room on the right of the first room, just inch in and autotarget, there are 1 or 2 back there. Lastly, the two doors at the back of the room offer a couple more guards to play with.<br />
<br />
All of these give good Katta faction, negative vampire faction. Be careful, keep root and sow up and you should easily be able to make the zone if you run into any trouble.<br />
