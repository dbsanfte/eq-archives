<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Atokal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Almost a year ago I began this quest for my epic. First attempt at Begurlgle was 7 hours of frustration with Humfrey and Canoe. Next attempt was 11 hours with Dexail/Aseid and various others coming to stop by. After this the next steps went quite fast then I hit Lord Gimblox, total of 40+ hours at different times and finally the kill with Zelfani and Rizz. Then Ixiblat, the overking in Char and finally Rage. As you can see there was a tremendous amount of support from so many folks, Koranna, Serlina, Halvard, Kilrain, well the list goes on and on. To everyone of my family in KoE I am truly grateful. To my friends in the Corps again thanks so much. You are all looking at a dwarf who stood in awe with hands shaking at the response the Rage pop got. When all is said and done I am more touched by the effort of everyone for one person than the ownership of this awesome item. Because time as we all know is the greatest gift of all.<br />
<br />
Cheers my family and thanks again.<br />
<br />
Your friend Toker (Jeff)</div></div><hr />
