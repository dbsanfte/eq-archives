<br />
What was i thinking i could be getting some made play time.  This place is dead. Only like 15 people here and there leaving one by one never to return.<br />
<br />
BTW 5 inches of snow here is alot and these peole dont have a clue on how to drive on a good day, so its completly nuts !!!<br />
<br />
<br />
Think I surf the boards then go home, not like we building any homes today!!<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Knarlz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have seen the dump trucks here in Buffalo leaving town full of snow. I guess we know where it is going now.<br />
<br />
Last week I got hit at home for &quot;only&quot; 60 inches of snow and Lady V got hit for the full 80 that fell in the worst spots.<br />
<br />
People can't drive here either, every snow there are dozens of vehicles in the ditches. Mostly SUVs  who forget that 4 wheel drive is great for accelerating on snow and ice but does little to help you stop.<br />
<br />
Enjoy the snow day.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now we not only have snow but traffic doesn't move because there are high lifts, machines and dump trucks trying to widen the roads to the full width so we're down to 1 lane of traffic. It's maddening! Took me 40 min to get home from work for a 15 min ride last last night!</div></div><hr />
