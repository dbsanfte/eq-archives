Did the trail today, got to the boss killed him without any deaths, decided to invis past the last couple of mobs to the hail NPC, invis drops I get pounded into the ground before I can hail  :mad: <br />
<br />
Everyone else who needed the flag in the group got it, which im glad of and the chain bracer dropped, which I won the roll of, but damn it I wanted the flag.<br />

bracer &gt; flag...<br />
<br />
at least to those of us that have done tipt many times and never even seen it drop...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Nine times through Tipt and I have never once seen that damn thing drop. Be glad you got it. You can easily go back through Tipt and get your flag. That bracer should be cherished.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I was 0-14 on Tipt until the other day. Of those, 10 were at the gate. Of the 14 losses, 13 were just plain bad luck or bad timing (someone had to log, charm broke on pull, someone LD at bad time).<br />
<br />
Stay on it. Its worth it. The bracer is awesome, wish I got one. I am still going to do more runs for guildies and important guild alts so I can get the 30/30 aug and the FT2/Regen2 aug (got the Aura of Battle one, lost EVERY other roll)<br />
<br />
Its harsh, and discouraging. But hang in there, in the end, its like anything thats hard. Worth the effort.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the encouragement, its just my guild isn't doing GoD content at all (family guld who is concentrating on getting everyone Sol Ro / EP flagged) and so I have to rely on pickup groups or friends in EP guilds for m2 groups and I hate to ask people who have done it 30+ times before to do it again  :( <br />
<br />
On a side note I found a way behind the blocked passage which is the m1 / m2 zone in tonight  :D  Should be safe from trains there, so I can stayed logged in to keep the pet weapons I have, while I sleep (will /bug it though at some point)<br />
