<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xyndra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm sure you have all heard the phrase &quot;so who's slowing?&quot; many many times when in a group... and since LDoN emphasizes group play over anything else... I shouldn't have been surprised to have heard this last night when I grouped my 60 shaman with 5 other 65 characters... But to get argument and doubt etc. when I explained that I thought I would since I had the 75% slow... first the beastie wanted to argue the superiority of his 65% slow, then the druid doubted that I could handle the aggro... etc. Sheesh! Well, we have a good group and win the adv. Shammy doesn't die, but beastie and druid do (actually he died 3 times, but was a good sport about it). When beastie died, he wanted to know &quot;who was buying his rez?&quot; Think he was still unconvinced about my slows... anyway we offered 90% pally rez.. his response &quot;hmm don't usually do 90%&quot;... again with the Sheesh! He's level 65. In all likelihood, all his xp was going towards AAXP, which a rez doesn't give back. <br />
<br />
Saturday last, I must have had the worst day of my Everquest life. There I was, 3 blues from the magic level 60. I thought to myself, if I can get one or two good LDoN adventures I will level... WOOHOO!<br />
<br />
My first adventure went like this... enchanter (50 something) didn't believe I could slow, so kept attempting to slow, got resisted, tried to mez, got resisted and died... like 3 times. I commented about why the chanter kept drawing so much aggro on multi pulls... and that's what he told me.. essentially becaue I couldn't slow, he had to. So he stopped mezzing..., causing me to die thus negating any xp gain for that adventure (pally 90% rez).  Anyway, we STILL nearly completed the adv, falling short by 30 secs. <br />
<br />
My 2nd attempt was a group put together by a 55 cleric... I wanted Guk since I still haven't got Pack Shrew, and he agreed... cool I thought, can kill 2 birds with one stone.  But.... this cleric picked a hard adventure, don't know why... anyway while we are buffing, I ask the standard questions &quot;Who's MA, who's pulling, how are they pulling, how we handle CC, etc...&quot;. No answer... the cleric says &quot;all Full mana let's go!&quot; I say &quot;whoa, hold the train, what about...&quot;, too late, they all zoned in. Well, once we in I ask again. Finally got a reply... &quot;I don't care, just pull!&quot;. Oops, well I knew we were in trouble then. Needless to say, after several deaths and lots of finger pointing, the adventure was over (in about 20 minutes or so). At this point I gave up for awhile, went and played an alt, did some chores around the house etc.<br />
<br />
Later that same evening, I tried again, I gave up on LDoN, and was soloing in The Grey, had my LFG up anyway, since 2 blues take forever while soloing... after about an hour (almost a whole blue xp gained) I get a tell from a cleric wanting a LDoN. I think to myself, why not? I've just looted my third snake organ (for Amulet of the Grey), and I'm less than a blue away from lev 60... WOOHOO! So I zone to PoK, get new c and head to BB. Get there, join group, etc waiting on last 2 members... cleric up and says &quot;oops I gotta go to work&quot;, and leaves group! Well, I finally have had enough. I disband group. Get to work on putting my OWN group together... 10 minutes and I have a group ready to go. Lay out who's doing what etc... and we have a great adventure, I ding 60, we get phat lewtz, all are happy. <br />
<br />
Moral of the story??  There are a lot of uneducated EQ players out  there, guys who don't know how to play there OWN class, let alone know what other classes can do. No big surprise I know, but I DIDN'T really know until I started doing LDoNs (mostly soloed or did guild stuff before).<br />
<br />
I think I am good shaman. I can get multiple pulls slowed, even with a resist or two (a mad one beating on me). I have good AC, decent atk, FT4, can self buff to 3100 hps, a nice 2HB blunt weapon that I can tank with if necessary. I backup heal when the cleric or druid goes down... I rarely die... <br />
<br />
Anyway, just wanted to get this stuff off my chest.. thanks for listening.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Baz4</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">lol, <br />
yeah, I know this story.  Been dere, done dat, as dey say.<br />
<br />
most of my guild now avoids pickup groups for LDoN, and we are not even close to uber (only killed TT and Grummus once each, heheheh - far from uber).<br />
<br />
At lvl 60 with a group of 65's, all you really had to offer was the slows.  You can take a few hits from those mobs, even if they do con white or yellow to you.  <br />
<br />
like most LDoN stories, the moral is to learn who to avoid in the future, and go on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah, you meet all kinds in pickup groups - I generally avoid them. ;)  Anyway, I just wanted to point out that Pack Shrew comes from MMC...  Well, I'm pretty sure on that anyway, since I've pondered buying it at the vendor on occasion, and I've yet to do a guk adventure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Eluj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's funny how crappy groups go in cycles. I was on earlier this week, waited for about an hour for the last member to show up only to have him go LD when we were ready to go, or something.<br />
<br />
Same thing the next night except after waiting for the chanter to get kei we find out he's leaving us for a guild thing... at that point I just got an alt on and leveled him twice...<br />
<br />
It's all phases... hopefully when I go this weekend, I'll get a couple good LDoN groups and level my poor shaman</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Xyndra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">so after reading some other threads, I guess my story is old news.. hehe. Don't treat me too harshly please, LOL!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah groups with friends and trusted guildies are &gt;*<br />
<br />
I have not done a pick up LDoN in quite some time because it is hard to stomach.  I know it may sound snobbish or something but really as close as I'll come to a pick up group is with members of other top tier guilds, friends of friends, that kind of thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Eriadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">LDON highlights incompetency moreso than outdoor pull, kill, repeat-typr groups.  When you find a good chanter, cleric, tank, etc ... hold on to them.  I have been playing chanter since release, and I am generally amazed at the ability level of many of today's players.  My shaman is my alt, but I put just as much research into learning to play the class competently as I do my chanter.</div></div><hr />

Shammy pack comes from Guk, I thought... will go check again, but I have had 300 pts from MM and never seen shammy pack shrew for sale.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Just to double-check, I looked at the LDON Item Database (http://www.squidbox.com/skp/eq/ldon/list.cgi) and Lucy (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=59609).  They both seem to think MMC too, but it certainly wouldn't be the 1st time there was incorrect info on the 'net. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Vladigar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It's rare that I do an LDoN pickup group that I haven't put together myself. Usually it's just because most people just sit on their arses and wait for groups to come to them. After about 20 adventures, of the people who frequent LDoN on a regular basis, I learned who is good and who is not. <br />
<br />
On a side rant, nothing irratates me more than when I send a tell to someone asking them if they want an adventure but they won't commit unless the group is full or has specific classes. I know one enchanter that won't join a group unless it already has a tank and cleric in it. I've now stopped asking him regardless. Funny thing is, most of these people are still LFG after I've run 2-3 successful adventures.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Eeek.  Some horror stories for sure.  I've never had that much bad luck with LDoN (consecutive) groups...although I think most folks, including me, could tell a story or two. <br />
<br />
Pack Shrew comes from the BB/MM camp - it's 32 or 36 pts.  Been so long I forget exactly.<br />
<br />
Spirit of Shrew comes from the Guk/Sro camp - it's 14-ish pts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I backup heal when the cleric or druid goes down... I rarely die... <br />
<br />
<br />
This is just a sugestion, but you might want to modify that behaviour to instead backup heal *before* the cleric or druid goes down.  Some may not appreciate you stepping on their toes (ie: the oversensetive or bad players) but in the long-run your groups will be more durable if you watch the health of the other healers and key group members.  A well timed heal from you might compensate for a poorly timed heal from the cleric/druid, or it might save the cleric from a beat-down so that he can in turn save someone else.<br />
<br />
No matter what level you are you always want the mob beating on someone other than the healer.  If that means you have to pull agro and let it beat on you (either by healing or by pulling agro with an agro inducing spell) then so be it.<br />
<br />
Also, regarding the question of &quot;who's slowing&quot;, I would say if you have a beastlord in the group and hes not slowing then hes not pulling his weight.  Beastlords make excellent preslowers, even when there slow is only 30 percent or 50 percent.  I've kicked a beastlord out of my group once before for refusing to attempt to preslow mobs.  Sure I can do a better job percentage-wise, but he can do it faster and if we both do it then we get the best of both worlds.  Alas, he didn't see it that way.  <br />
<br />
His replacement did.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  I also like it when bards pull with occlusion of sound to lower magic resist, or pre-slow the mob while its incoming.  Its not something that I would necessarily *expect* them to do, but it sure is nice when they do it.  They're pretty busy during pulls, though, so it cant always be managed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Why do you want Pack Shrew?   It is exactly the same as run3.   Not to criticize or anything I'm just wondering why anyone would get this spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Best group ever. Me as tank/puller/healer, 5 mages in tak. I think it took 15 minutes to win our series of adventures.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Why do you want Pack Shrew?<br />
I've thought about getting it for my twink of the week, since I usually PL in dungeons...  Other than that (or if I were a lower shaman, perhaps), I dunno why one would want it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jallainin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Not everyone is level 50+ with AA.<br />
<br />
Pack shrew is for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Popu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Personally I've always appreciated having an enchanter or beastlord back me up on slows. And why shouldn't they? Occasionally I have gotten 4 resists in a row on mobs in Tak. <br />
<br />
Just like I'll backup heal. Cleric/Druid is usually concentrating on the MT - if somebody else can stand a heal, I'll toss it their way. I haven't met a cleric yet who when they went LOM didn't like it when I said I'll cover for them for a few mobs if we can keep the pulls down to 1 or 2 for a few minutes.<br />
<br />
If you want real confusion on &quot;who's slowing&quot; I've done a few adventures with a 2nd shaman (and we still have a cleric) and managed to just rape the mobs.  Note: this was a guild group.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know when I cast SoW on poochie, he not only moves faster, but appears to respond to commands faster. I'm hoping that Spirit of the Shrew will have a similar effect indoors. Since Pack Shrew is a group spell I don't think it will work on pets.<br />
<br />
I don't have either yet, could anyone that does have them both confirm this?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Since Pack Shrew is a group spell I don't think it will work on pets.<br />
Hey, soon, for the low price of 20AAs, your pack shrew will be able land on dog-dog.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Fibonacci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Why pack shrew?<br />
<br />
Ask about when to stop for AAs and the majority answer will be &quot;65, then AAs.&quot;  So sould I not expect to find a lot of 51-64 toons without run3? Besides, 36 points for a spell is chicken feed even for a level 34 shaman.  You do know that pack shrew is a level 34 spell, right?  Not many level 34 toons around who have run3 yet.<br />
<br />
Why is that that when people reach 65 they believe they know the game inside and out (which they should by then) yet suddenly forget that there exists a pre-65 game which can be just as challanging and rewarding for those players still experiencing it for the first time?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>AtommWarbird</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I can definitely empathize with getting some crappy groups.  I don't know how many times I have grouped with Pallies that don't stun to get aggro, warriors that don't know what the hell ENGRAGE is, and the occasional second shaman who hasn't ever hit his Cann button.<br />
<br />
As for pack shrew, I think it's a valid option for someone who doesn't want to stop leveling.  Getting 3 AA's around Level 51 isn't all that trivial, with each toon I did that with my normal adventuring buddies got 2+ levels of real EXP before I dinged RUN3.  I still recommend RUN3 though, Level 54 won't save you as much as RUN3 will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I did just fine without shrew before I hit 65,  in fact I did just fine on 3 other classes before 65 as well!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">After a number of bad LDoNs, I started managing my own. Very few losses since then. I much prefer setting up my own group for LDoN. It has taught me a lot about the game. I have mlearned that in some situations, a necro can keep me better supplied with mana than an enchanter. I have learned that good druids are fine LDoN healers. I have learned that levels should be within 3 for majority of group. I have learned different strengths and weaknesses of various tanks and dps. <br />
<br />
It often is fastes to set up a LDoN on your own. Second, I always friend flag really good ldon players. When I start looking for ldon folks I check guild and friends first. Finally, it gets mostly better at 65 with all 65 players.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Well, reguardless wheather it is LDoN, PoP, or any other pick-up group you can think of...you find all types.  Personally, when Chanters and BLs feel they need to attempt my job in a group, I sit back and nuke/dot away and have a blast.  I've even been know to heal them every once in a while when they get aggro :P  I refuse to be LoM from healing them tho, so usually after about 2 heals, I let them die.  Call it coincidence, or the 6th sign, but 99.99999999% of the time when the slower dies, the GL or dead slower hands me the job /shrug  I've been playing too long to get irritated by the &quot;wanna be ubahs&quot;, so I let them entertain me when the opportunity knocks.<br />
