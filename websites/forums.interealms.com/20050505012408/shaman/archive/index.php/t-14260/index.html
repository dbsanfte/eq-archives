I love this I got all choked up</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just hope the time involved in switching spells is much shorter than individually memming the spells (but without the searching time, mind you).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zilansis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">guess i'll find out tonight, but had few questions...<br />
if you select one of your saved favorite sets...<br />
does it re-memorize the spells that are already scribed from that set?<br />
what state are your spells in if you have to interrupt the memming process?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think this is a good solution to the issue of not having enough spell gems. SoE can keep their idea about the mind only holding so many spells and we have a easy to to swap spells., now instead of searching and meming spells that fade in 15 min , i just click. Very acceptable</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>icebain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It does not try to re mem spells you have already memmed, its a great tweek, /em respect Sony</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tunami</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I tried it out at Lunch and it is awesome. Set up a group buff, self buff, group, and a escape load. Escape only has gate &amp; Blind (just in Case). If they load fast, which I really didn't try yet will be nice. click on my escape load if it loads quick but mob is too close blind him back up &amp; gate. This feature looks to be pretty promising</div></div><hr />

I agree with this 100%. This new feature demems and mems spells very quickly. I used it quite a bit tonight on raids and am very happy with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It is a great thing.. The only sucky for me is that I dont have the book to click on with my Vert UI so I have to find some update for it :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">One thing that I found really annoying, and I'm not sure why this kept happening...is that sometimes while in my spell book for no reason at all I just all of a sudden got out of it without getting the chance to click on the spelll that I wanted to mem.  This happened several times and I was never sure why.  I think that it had something to do clicking on the spell icons more than one time, but I usually have to do this with my stupid way the mouse works.<br />
<br />
Should see me when I'm trying to loot my corpses, takes like 10 clicks for each item...really really unsettling.  Anyone know how to fix this?  Not sure if it's something to do with the mouse defaults or if it's just my computer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Foggy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It is a great thing.. The only sucky for me is that I dont have the book to click on with my Vert UI so I have to find some update for it :/<br />
<br />
<br />
Salorm - open ip the EQUI_CastSpellWnd.xml file from the vert ui directory in Notepad.  Then find the section at the end called : <br />
Screen item=&quot;CastSpellWnd&quot;<br />
<br />
Change the CY value from 236 to 260.  You may also want to change the x value in the CSPW_SpellBook section to move it across to the right a bit if you do what I do and move the gem window across so the names of the spells disappear off the side.<br />
<br />
If you have any probs let me know and I will upload mine for you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Will try as soon as I get home Foggy, thanks alot. <br />
Very appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'd have to say this is one of the most useful features in the history of EQ. Absolutely love it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>kowalsky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I also have noticed that Valsuvious. was wondering if it was a bug or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I agree, fantastic feature.  So many things done RIGHT that could have been done WRONG:<br />
<br />
   1. Doesn't rememorize spells that are the same between the two lists<br />
<br />
   2. Forgets the changed-out spells before attempting to load the list so you can have the same spell in different slots in the different lists (if they didn't forget them all first, you'd end up attempting to mem a spell you already had memmed).<br />
<br />
   3. Instant lookup of the spells, all you pay is the mem time.  You're standing until you hit the button.  In many cases this means you can mem a good bit of a new spell list in the time it takes the mob to charge you due to sit aggro.<br />
<br />
The other area that nobody is talking much about is the right-click menus for the spell gems.  Empty a spell gem and right-click on it and you get a list of spells BY CATEGORY, with their level listed, and you get the insta-lookup insta-mem behavior of the spell lists but for a SINGLE spell.  IMO this is gonna be very useful for swapping out debuffs and/or swapping in DOTs during combat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">My right click menu was bugged yesterday btw.. I had Talisman of the Boar on Str buffs and not on Sta buffs :(</div></div><hr />

I love this, especially after last night. Zoned into Veksar for the first time, sitting at the bottom of the stairs waiting on some friends to arrive when someone &quot;pulls&quot; 4 or 5 mobs. There are 3 or 4 of us here (not grouped) so we start to clean it up. I start slowing and rooting the mobs when I realize I'm now by myself, lol. Head up the stairs and get summoned. Try again, still summoned. After bouncing a few dots and getting low on mana from heals, I finally remember this feature. Load gate in about 2 seconds (gotta love lvl 5 spells) and I'm out of there. I rarely, if ever, keep gate memmed but it's nice to know it's now only a right click away.</div></div><hr />

I noticed this yesterday when i tried using the favorites. odd how you never notice you are missing a button untill it actually does something :)<br />
EQinterface.com already has a vert update for this, easy to download zip file with 3 files zipped up.<br />

I was using this yesterday quite a bit on raids, it was a bit slower for me to actually FIND spells (probably will incraese the speed with familiarity with the system) but the actual time spent sitting to mem it was incredibly low ! <br />
<br />
Great improvement :)</div></div><hr />
