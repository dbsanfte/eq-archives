<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>agnol_reborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So far a little news has escaped from beta about the new AA's that are going to be released. This is an attempt to inform some of a disparity that is occurring that without feedback may very well make it live. <br />
<br />
Critical Affliction AA - Level Required 65, gives a chance that each tick of a dot will do critical damage. 3 levels, costs are 5 10 15 for each of the levels. <br />
<br />
According to parses this skill at level 3 looks like it will deliver between 6 and 7% chance for a critical tick. <br />
<br />
There are 3 reasons that this is wrong if left untouched before release.<br />
<br />
1. Level requirement: Direct Damage spell crit AA's can be purchased at level 55. Why make a DoT caster wait 10 more levels to earn critical dots? <br />
<br />
2. AA cost- why do DoT casters have to pay over twice the amount of AA points for roughly the same percent chance to crit as a DD caster? Spell casting fury costs 12 AA to max, gives a 7% chance to crit vs 30 AA for a 7% chance to crit on a DoT. <br />
<br />
3. AA structure - There are currently two sets of AA lines that allow a greater percent chance to crit and a third line of AA's if you are a wizard. For the non wizard DD caster you can earn for a total of 30 AA a reported 13% chance to crit. Lastly, a third AA line is reported to be introduced with GoD that allows for an even greater chance of crits on DD spells. DoT casters should be given the same type of AA's that allow for this type of progression. <br />
<br />
Please note, I am not asking that DoT casters be given a greater chance to crit a dot for less AA. We have been waiting a long time for this, true - but that does not mean I expect more for less. I only wish for parity. <br />
<br />
If you feel this is unfair, I urge you to email eqfeedback@soe.sony.com and let them know that DoT casters should have parity with DD casters in terms of cost, structure and utility of their AA lines. <br />
<br />
For the argumentative I will include some of the oft repeated arguments against Critical Dots:<br />
<br />
1. Critical Dots are overpowering and will unbalance the game!<br />
<br />
A1: Critical Dots are already in GoD, obviously the devs don't think its unbalancing. <br />
A2: Doubling the damage of a spell that takes 30 seconds to approximately 2 minutes is no more unbalancing/game breaking than a 2.3k nuke having its damage double in an instant. <br />
<br />
2. Critical DoTs will do more damage since they are calculated per tick therefore they dont need the same % chance to crit as DD spells.<br />
<br />
A: (This is lengthy) It does not matter if DoT crits are calculated on a per tick basis or a per cast basis. <br />
<br />
Case 1 (Whole DoT spell crits)<br />
If dot crits were calculated at the beginning of the cast, and the whole dot did critical damage:<br />
[I'm making up this dot damage and duration for ease of math] <br />
<br />
A 10 tick dot, that does 100pts each tick, 100 casts at 7% chance to crit =<br />
93 dots dont crit = 930 ticks of 100 pts of damage = 93,000 points of damage<br />
7 dots do crit = 70 ticks of 200 pts of damage = 14,000 pts of damage.<br />
<br />
1000 ticks of damage (930 no crit + 70 crit) = 107,000 pts of damage.<br />
<br />
Case 2 (Each tick calculated seperately)<br />
1000 ticks of damage at 100pts of non crit damage times 7% chance to crit = 70 crit ticks of damage.<br />
1000 ticks of damage (930 no crit + 70 crit) = 107,000 pts of damage.<br />
<br />
Its the same either way.<br />
<br />
Lets compare a DD spell:<br />
Base spell damage is 1000, 7% chance to crit means in 100 casts you would get 7 crits.<br />
(93 x 1000) = 93,000 <br />
(7 x 2000) = 14,000<br />
Total = 107,000. <br />
<br />
Actually, I know myself I would prefer that crits be calculated on a per cast basis, but that is my personal preference. I am not going to fight that issue at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I agree, every shaman is much better off maxing out DD crits then spending it in crit DoTs.  <br />
<br />
The only exception I could think of is if you are a strict root and DoT soloer who does not group at all.  Good luck farming all those AA's quickly soloing though &gt;&lt;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That wasn't the argument Walruss, agnoll is saying that the AA's for DD crits cost less for SAME amount of crit %.   I agree that this is way out of balance and should be corrected.   Why should dot casters have to pay twice as much for the ability to crit and wait 10 levels longer?   It's stupid and obviously a big oversight.<br />
<br />
Feedback it please!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have stated again and again that DoTs don't even come close to nukes anymore and that a chance to crit per tick is totally stupid in terms of balance, since the biggest advantage of critting with DDs isn't the 13% overall DPs increase, but the up to 100% burst dps increase you gain from it.<br />
That said, I heard that unlike SCF+, Critical Affliction will plain double the amount of the DoT per tick *after* any DoT foci are applied. Did I hear wrong?</div></div><hr />
