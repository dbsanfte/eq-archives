<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As I started using my level 54 spells, I noticed something odd.  When I used the old AC spell, guardian, I got awful fizzle rates.   Sometimes I would drain 3 bubbles of mana trying to get it to cast.  It was really frustrating when I was soloing and trying to rebuff myself and i lost so much mana trying to get my silly AC spell up.  I was really dreading the fizzle rate on shroud of the spirits.  I figured it would be the same thing except even worse.  Oddly, I have cast shroud at least 30 time since I dinged two days ago, and I have yet to get a fizzle.  My first thought was that shroud was an alteration spell rather than abjuration, so i checked.  but its not.  its abj just like guardian.  anyone got a rational cause for this, or is guardian just a gimp spell?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Guardian is exceptionally difficult to cast.  We don't get many Abjuration spells, so your Abjure is probably lower than it needs to be.<br />
<br />
I fixed my fizzle rate by doing the following:<br />
<br />
1. Self-buff with your best DEX buffs.<br />
<br />
2. Get Inner Fire up.   I put it in slot 8.<br />
<br />
3. Define a hotkey<br />
<br />
   /stand, /cast 8, /pause &lt;n&gt;<br />
   /cast 8, /pause &lt;n&gt;<br />
   /cast 8, /pause &lt;n&gt;<br />
   /cast 8, /pause &lt;n&gt;<br />
   /sit<br />
<br />
You'll have to figure out what number to put in place of &lt;n&gt; so that you can successfully cast the spell before the next cast attempt.  When you don't get the &quot;can't do that command right now&quot; message you have it right.<br />
<br />
4. Push the hotkey and watch TV or read a book for 30-45 seconds until you sit down.<br />
<br />
4. Push it again.<br />
<br />
5. Push it again.<br />
<br />
6. Push it again.<br />
<br />
7. Push it again.<br />
<br />
.... you get the idea.  My Abjure is now at about 189 and I can cast Guardian successfully about 3 times out of 5.  The cool thing about this is that Inner Fire heals a bit of damage, so you can cannibalize every once in a while and do this forever.  Do it in EC or another good sales zone and you can auction SOW potions every two or three cycles and make some cash, too.<br />

Substitute True North for Divination and Burst of Flame for Evocation if you need practice there.  Target self or pet for BoF.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>blakkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I keep my abjuration maxed and rarely fizzle Guardian, the one that got me the worst on my last shaman was the lvl 49 self buff though. Its painful but worthwhile in my opinion to keep all the spell skills current to level as you go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Abjuration has been maxed at 235 for at least five levels, but I still fizzle constantly as well with Rage. At least it casts very quickly so I can recast it within the same tick as the fizzle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wontonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">For those young shamans out there, once pass level 30 or so u will rarely use spells that have abj.   But after level 50 there're some nice spells use Abj skill.   The group resist poison and disease spells are two good examples.  So try to keep your abj skill max while you're leveling.  Or when you pass level 50 and got those spells you will have a lot of catch up works to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Twoflower - why bother buffing DEX for that? DEX has nothing to do with spell casting skill increases. WIS is the only stat that will help a priest class with it (INT for the casters).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Raikor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Noticed this just last night after buying my 54 spells. Guardian just stinks for fizzles and I hated trying to cast it. Now, SoS hasn't fizzled yet...tried 15-20 minutes for a fizzle and none.<br />
<br />
Abjuration skill is one of my many weaknesses. :) Always working on it when there is nothing better to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Azmodai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've got my abj skill maxed out and I always fizzle bad on those types of spells.  Torrent of Poison and Talisman of Epuration are really bad.</div></div><hr />
