<br />
Besides, recruiting and advertising is kinda frowned on here, but judging from your post count im guessing you dont care and probably wont be back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah it seems a bit premature to me too but on the other hand it is often a good idea to be the first one out of the blocks in games like these :) If only it had been a request for european players for WoW ..... ;)<br />
<br />
Is recruiting and advertising really more frowned upon here than anything thing else? I think we are really good at frowning at almost anything around here. &lt;- That was an attempt at the difficult art of mixing truth with sarcasm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I wouldnt mind, but it's a ranger posting...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nydara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ebonlore is an EQ2 guild. Been recruiting for nearly 6 months now... guess they want an early start  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ulver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ebonlore was a Shadowbane guild. They've been around probably before that too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nydara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah. I know there will be a Aggressors guild on EQ2. They have been on most mmo's to date. Just figured I'd throw that in just for the fyi that others are doing the same already.<br />

<br />
One of the earliest Euro-based EQ2 guilds is of course The Watchers Guild (with a heavy emphasis on roleplaying/family).  I believe this was formed back in the Summer of 2003.</div></div><hr />
