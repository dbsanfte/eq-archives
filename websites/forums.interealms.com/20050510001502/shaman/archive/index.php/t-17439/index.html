<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey,<br />
<br />
<br />
My friend bought a burning affliction 4 item and then took a break from EQ, hes now back and the item has been changed from slot7 to slot3. He is wondering if he can get a refund for it (points) or not?<br />
<br />
<br />
Any help is appreciated, thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If not mistaken they have not implemented the refund process on the augs but plan on it at some later date.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vulgarr Disruptor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">bought one of those myself on the last patch day before the merchants went down and the type change was made. spent the majority of the next 3 days with my &quot;escalated&quot; petition in the queue.... was finally told by a GM: &quot;you'll just have to keep it untill you can use it&quot;<br />
typical worthless GM response... he did suggest, however, that if that answer wasn't satisfactory; that I should use the /feedback window to plead my case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I petitioned two times, both times some GM told me to hold on to it until they do a correct refund procedure, basically I keep 0.00000005% of hope for next patch for refunds, but that's it. Must be really hard for that GM to punch in some command to erase that item from my inventory and give me 1150 points ... Goddamn incompetent CS.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, your friend might want to get an item with a type 3 aug slot in it. Depending on his/her gear. I wouldn't bet on a VI refund, since only a small number of people were affected.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Siddail beat me to it, but Ive sold back lots of augs to the gnome in SRo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Oukast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Would be nice if you could do this with armor also...or augs that are on armor...<br />
<br />
I like how SoE rewards dumb peoples mistakes in the augs that they buy, yet if you bought LDoN armor and put augs on it....but then you get an upgrade down the road and no longer need the LDoN armor / Augs, there is no recourse for you...GJ SoE, you are retarded...</div></div><hr />
