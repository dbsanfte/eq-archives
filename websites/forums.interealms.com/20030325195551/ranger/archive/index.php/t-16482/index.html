<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>derfrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've never been 100% sure on what to focus on when looking at Gear upgrades.  Maybe we can have a thread that sums it all up so the question doesn't have to be asked again.<br />
<br />
I'll start with what I think the stat means.  I know I'm not a number cruncher, I know my assumptions will be off.<br />
<br />
STR - This number is used to calculate your Max Damage.  At level 22 this Max Damage cap increase.  Helps increase your ATK value<br />
STA - equate to HPs.  For a Ranger, 1 point of stamina is equal to 4.2 hps.<br />
DEX - Helps determine how often your weapon will &quot;Proc&quot; (if the weapon has an effect, higher dex will increase the changes of it going off), also increase the chance of having a Critical Hit with a Bow.<br />
AGI - Not sure on this?<br />
WIS - Relates to your Mana Pool for Casting<br />
<br />
AC - Defensive; use to determine how much damage you will receive from an Mob Attack.<br />
ATK - Offensive - Determines how often you will hit.<br />
<br />
I am curious about which stats effect things like;<br />
Minimum Damage; tired of hitting for 1 point.<br />
Misses; is there a stat that reduces the misses<br />
<br />
<br />
ok then, I'm sure I've missed a lot of good infomation.  Please add your comments and I'll edit accordinly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">STR ~ affects your attack but points gained here dont mean much, also affects weight you can carry, backstab (rogues), and archery dmg<br />
STA ~ once over 100 means that yellow bar means nada, affects HP total<br />
AGI ~ speed, minor AC<br />
DEX ~ proc rate, archery dmg and skill ups (1hs etc..)<br />
WIS ~ mana pool and fizzle rate<br />
<br />
AC ~ higher = better dmg migitation (i.e take less per hit)<br />
ATK ~ better offense</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Drienne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">In my experience, here's what I've learned (both from others and on my own).<br />
<br />
STR - Increased ATK; more available weight to carry stuff; archery damage.  The ATK increase tops out at around 220 STR.  Any more than that and you don't gain much.  Also effects skill-ups in Blacksmithing as a (I think) secondary stat.<br />
<br />
STA - Below 100, when you're fatigued your melee stats are decreased, and you swing slower.  From 100 on, it's straight HP.  At level 60, it's 4.2 HP/STA point.<br />
<br />
DEX - Crits with melee and bows, melee-based skill increases.  Most useful when using Trueshot for extra crits during disc.  With a large increase, there's a very pronounced increase in procs and crits.<br />
<br />
AGI - AC, to a very small degree.  Below 200 or so, it's about 6 points of AGI for one AC.  Above 200, it seems almost random (IE, with 130 AGI, using Feet Like Cat gives me 3 AC, while at 202 the same buff only gives 1 or 2 AC).  Also seems to have an affect on damage avoidance.  There's a noticeable difference in the number of hits I take self-buffed (149 AGI) and fully buffed (255 AGI).<br />
<br />
WIS - Mana.  Fizzle rate also seems to be linked to WIS, but to a small degree.  Fizzles seem more dependent on the level of the caster compared to the spell level (a spell you just got at your current level will usually fizzle more than a lower level version of the same spell), and the skill in that particular spell school (higher level spells have a greater chance to fizzle at any given skill level).<br />
<br />
AC - Damage mitigation.  When you do get hit, this determines how hard it is.  It's also compared to the innate ATK of what you're fighting.  There's generally thought to be a &quot;soft cap&quot; for AC.  At Rangers, it's rumored to be around 1300-1350.  Above that, you there's less of an improvement in mitigation for the same amount of AC gained.  So, 50 AC makes a bigger difference when you have 1000 AC than when you have 1350 AC (kind of obvious, if you consider the % of AC gained at 1000 and 1350).  There's also an innate damage mitigation for classes.  Warriors, Paladins and Shadow Knights have a better innate damage mitigation.  So, a Ranger with 1250 AC usually won't mitigate the damage as well as a Warrior with 1250 AC.<br />
<br />
ATK - The higher your attack, the higher your sustained DPS.  However, your ATK is compared to a mob's AC when damage is calculated.  Very pronounced when you compare Luclin mobs to Kunark or most Velious mobs.  Fighting Itraer Vius, for example, even a Ranger at 1500-1600 ATK is going to be hitting for very little damage most of the time.  Compare that to an equal level mob in Velious, and you'll see that same Ranger doing a bit more damage, on average.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>derfrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for your response, but I feel a bit silly now.<br />
<br />
There's a Sticky on this forum that says, Read before posting.  Well, if I would have read it, I wouldn't have to post this thread.<br />
<br />
It seems most of questions have been answered in that FAQ.<br />
<br />
It's a good read</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>SwordMage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">STA ~ once over 100 means that yellow bar means nada <br />
STA over 100: an empty yellow bar limits you from jumping (escape speed)<br />
STR - Increased ATK; more available weight to carry stuff; archery damage. The ATK increase tops out at around 220 STR. Any more than that and you don't gain much. Also effects skill-ups in Blacksmithing as a (I think) secondary stat. <br />
Actually affects Blacksmithing as the primary skill: http://mboards.eqtraders.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=31<br />
<br />
AGI: AGI affects skill-up rates for defensive skills (dodge, etc.) High AGI also limits or precludes the low health &quot;death march.&quot; It has been reported that if you can keep your AGI high enough, then you will not slow to a crawl when your health goes down (you can see the effect also when encumbered).<br />
(also see: http://forums.interealms.com/ranger/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=8587 )<br />
<br />
WIS: usually the stat that affects skill up rates for non-combat skills (unless your half-elf has higher INT).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Darach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My general observations are this:<br />
<br />
STR:  <br />
Increases the likelyhood of hitting<br />
Increases the Max damage potential in Melee( you hit for more damage on average)<br />
<br />
STA:  <br />
Increases your hitpoints<br />
Also as long as you have 100 sta your attacks don't slow down<br />
<br />
DEX:<br />
Increases the likelyhood of hitting with a bow shot (I have observed this repeatly when buffed over 200 dex vs Unbuffed under 200 dex on the same mob)<br />
Increase the amount of Crits<br />
Increase the amount of Procs<br />
<br />
AGI:<br />
Small AC boost: helps reduce the amount of damage if hit<br />
DAMAGE AVIODANCE!!!!  Drasticly reduces the amount of hits you actually take (Seems to proc your defensive abilities such as Dodge and Parry as well)  I have seen this on numerous occasions<br />
<br />
Just wanted to cover the combat side of the stats here.  Drienne did a good job with his explaination as well<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>TheRiov</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Agil: Also affects skillup rate of defensive skills (parry, Dodge, Reposte, Block, etc)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Romidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just to address your question about minimum hit... nothing will affect what your minimum hit is except the damage bonus on a weapon.<br />
<br />
That is, as you level your damage bonus on weapons increases (only for the primary handy for dual wielders, I believe) so that your minimum hit will go up.<br />
<br />
For 2handers (and I would assume the primary weapon for a dual wielder), minimum hit is:<br />
<br />
Damage bonus + INT(delay/10)<br />
<br />
At 59th level, Windblade's damage bonus is 33 and the delay is 44:<br />
<br />
33 + INT(44/10) = 33 + INT(4.4) = 33 + 4 = 37<br />
<br />
At 60, the damage bonus changes to 37:<br />
<br />
37 + INT(44/10) = 37 + INT(4.4) = 37 + 4 = 41<br />
<br />
There is no stat that will change the minimum damage, but higher ATK will make you hit for minimum less frequently.<br />
<br />
The only thing I've seen that will increase how often you land a blow is to get a higher level. My hit rate is 70% against green mobs and under 50% against 55+ mobs. Strength, dexterity, etc. will have no impact on how often you hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sassy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I am looking for new armor, should I focus on stamina mainly when looking for upgrades?   <br />
<br />
Very helpful thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Fadetree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yes, direct HP and stamina, then dex, in my opinion. I have found str (and agi, for that matter)  to not only be pretty worthless but also str is very common on gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Epiphany EQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I try to point this out, but I seem to have difficulty explaining it right.  Here's another try.<br />
<br />
You probably want to look for HPs and as many of them as you can get.  One of the ways to increase your total HPs is to increase your STA.  How many HPs you'll get depends on what level you are and where your STA is already.  For someone like me (level 61 with 170 STA), each point of STA represents 4 shiny new HPs.  Once you hit 255 STA (don't forget to count buffs), each STA point is only worth 2 HPs or so, and once you are capped (depends on level and AAs) STA becomes worthless.  For someone at level 1, STA isn't worth very many HPs.<br />
<br />
So all I can really say is take a close look at the HP value of STA when looking for gear.  You'll see a lot of things that have like 5 STA and 20 HPs.  Remember that could be 40 HPs depending on your situation.  If you are comparing that to something with 30 raw HPs, your choice is obvious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">To clarify a couple points: <br />
If youre heavily encumbered, your AGI goes down (and thus your AC does) and you dont run/walk as fast.<br />
<br />
If you are blacksmithing, the highest of your WIS, INT or STR is the determining factor on how fast you skill up.<br />
<br />
STR and DEX on gear is for the most part worthless, as both those stats are increased quite a bit with very simple, common buffs like Focus. <br />
AGI is mostly worthless as the AC increase is very very tiny compared to Raw AC increases on new gear.<br />
For Rangers, INT is pure worthlessness. Dont even consider it.<br />
CHA is only important for buying/selling to NPC merchants (easily fixed with 2 Opal Encrusted Steins) and It increases the chance of non-aggro when you use Harmony of Nature and it gets resisted.<br />
The only stats, in my opinion, you should worry about on gear (apart from HP, mana and resists) is STA and WIS. Everything else is easily fixable.</div></div><hr />
