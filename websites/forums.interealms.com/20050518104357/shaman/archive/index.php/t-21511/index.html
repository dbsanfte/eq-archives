<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">One of my sisters asked me this question last night, and I posed it to a few of our other friends who had quit as well. It was an interesting question. <br />
<br />
The general consensus was that first and foremost we'd have to be assured that Sony Online Entertainment was going to give us a quality game. A close second was class and content balance.<br />
<br />
I thought I'd be alone when I said there wasn't anything that could bring me back to EQ, but a few people had the same sentiment, be it because of WoW Beta, CoH, or just a general enjoyment of life without EQ.<br />
<br />
So, satiate my curiosity ... if you quit, or are about to, what would it take to bring you back to EQ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Honestly, nothing would bring me back after I quit. When I do decide to quit it will be because there is nothing in EQ that I still want to do, not because I am unbalanced, or peeved at a bug, or feel useless.<br />
<br />
I have a set of goals that I want to achieve and I am slowly crossing them off as I get to them, and I am still enjoying playing (most of the time).<br />
<br />
When I'm done, I'm done.</div></div><hr />

2. Friends who like having a shaman around.<br />
<br />
Thus, I reactivated this week.<br />
<br />
We still have a good class and it's still a good game.  I paid a visit to every class board and pretty much everyone hates everyone else.  I elect to not be part of that.  I'm just going to goof off and kill things.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">SoE deleting PoP and GoD and SoL from all its servers ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
Seriously though. If SoE stopped trying to run this rat race to keep up with the up coming games and just listened to the people i might.  A very HUGE issue with this game right now is that this is supposed to be a online RPG designed for playing with each other, but right now its made as a , power level yourself to 60, then grind 65 before anything is fun, game.<br />
<br />
SoE needs to focus on making grouping more powerful and easy without hurting the soloer. Soloing is fine, its all some people can do, but if you up the group bonus even more and make it faster to group together then to PL yourself with a 65 druid in SolA and PC and make some decent cash and items drop so its worth it for the treasure seekers, then i might hop back on one of my lower level toons and climb the ranks again. Ive just power leveled too much and i cant do it no more. The only thing ill do is play to have fun, but like i said, once you hit 24 and lave PC, the game becomes a powerlevel fest to 60 so you can group again. Thats a HUGE gap in grouping, 24 to 60ish.<br />
<br />
I dont know, there is alot more ofcourse, but i think thats the core. That and making this world not centered around raiding. Raiding is great, but my 65 shaman cant do a damn thing with a single group much less even find one cause everyone is grouping with guildies only and i had no guild. Thats a problem IMHO. Im not sure how to fix it either other then adding more single group doable content. I mean wouldnt it be fun to have a crushbone 2.0 ?  Places with character like that or black burrow with triggered spawns that are poped via zone dropable items ala veksar dragon or cleric epic span of ragefire.<br />
<br />
I guess that would be a start.</div></div><hr />

What it would take for me to resubscribe:<br />
-Tech support available 15/5 or greater.<br />
-GM to player ratio of 1:1500 at all times.<br />
-Top 10 populated servers split, new machines bought.<br />
-Server Transfer service is $5, $10 for a whole guild.<br />
-Everquest code altered so maintenance can be done on the fly aside from major updates.<br />
-A real public relations staff<br />
-A method deterring guilds from raiding content that they do not actually benefit from raiding but raid for the sake of blocking another competitive guild (most commonly known as c*ckblocking).<br />
-A team of balance representatives that actually play everquest in the early-mid and late level groups. This person could be chosen by the players, elected. <br />
-expansions intended for raiding content thoroughly balance tested either by a skilled group of testers or by some mathematical means (I could do it, why can't you?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">&quot;People who quit because their class is 'unbalanced' are trivial morons.&quot;<br />
<br />
People are not trivial.<br />
<br />
I might concede that the &quot;moron&quot; label should be most readily ascribed to people who think they are.<br />
<br />
I'm sitting out a spell.  Still playing.  Not sure when I want to come back.  Gave my walking papers to the raid org I'm an officer in.  No final decision made, but I can't help thinking that SOE will do nothing to stop it from being a final decision.  It was only with extreme reluctance that I left the game.  <br />
<br />
What would bring me back?  If my skills were valuable to groups again.  Beastlords being essentially just as good as me on slows due to slow mitigation and GoD mobs being sometimes unslowable pretty much woke everyone on my server up, finally(it seemed to take forever!) to the fact that beastlords are functionally just as good as I am on slows, and can add much more DPS than I can, besides.  So now,  if any beastlord is available, shamans pretty much can forget it.  Chanters can also slow functionally just as well as I can, which finally sunk into the noggins on my server too.  I knew I had a brief time until everyone realized that shamans bring essentially nothing to the equation, and I tried to savor it as best I could, hoping that something, somewhere, somehow would be done.  But I knew it wouldn't.<br />
<br />
At this point, there is no place I wouldn't recommend getting a BL or a chanter with almost any level of gear and AA instead of a shaman no matter how good.  And people seem to agree.<br />
<br />
When they advertise for slowers, they want a slower with CC(chanter) or a slower with DPS(BL).  Or a slower with CC and DPS(chanter who charms).  The shaman, best slower in the game, comes into the mix in 4th, and only very, very reluctantly.<br />
<br />
I am still valuable for malos(yay!) and MGB focus(yeah, yeah) on raids.  But outside raids, I basically have no utility unless I want to solo or duo or such.  Any full group would be better off replacing me with someone else.<br />
<br />
This is quite a come-down from a toon who in kunark days used to be able to melee slowed mobs toe to toe, slow FAR better than anyone else, heal sorta well, and even do some sorta DPS.  Now, I can't take more than a couple of seconds of DPS from even a slowed mob at best and face many mobs that can't be slowed or mitigate slow, I can't heal for beans, my DPS in the lowest in the entire game, and my heals are around the level of many mobs whose one hit can be quad'ed on me and my pals.  From being able to melee, melee DPS, melee take hits, heal, and slow, I now am able to ....not do any of the above.<br />
<br />
It's QUITE a shocking and complete bring-down.<br />
<br />
If I were to come back, I'd have to have at least a shade of my former glory and not be dead last on the list in virtually every category.<br />
<br />
It's one thing to be the worst DPS...but the worst healer, terrible in melee both giving and taking, trying to slow mobs that are mitigated or don't slow at all....and if they do slow, there are others who can not only slow pretty much as good as me, but bring SO much more to the picture....why would you invite a shaman except out of friendship or some kind of guild loyalty?<br />
<br />
This is the first time I've quit the game in five years.<br />
<br />
The least I would need to bring me back would be making my class not invited into a group out of pity or a sense of obligation between friends or guild mates.<br />
<br />
I'd like a real class, in other words.<br />
<br />
That seems to be the least thing imaginable to ask, really.<br />
<br />
If we can't get even that...then Sony has an almost surreally, fantastically bankrupt imagination.  There really is no excuse for making such a great class such a bunch of total lame-o's.<br />
<br />
If they get their act together, it will be long past due.  I'm not sure I'll still have interest by then.  Many people have already lost interest, and I don't think Sony can realistically expect anything less.<br />
<br />
Not that they necessarily care.  As long as you switch over to a holy trinity class and keep playing, all other arguments and expressions of opinion are irrelevant.  You're a credit card number, not a customer, and certainly not a person or someone whose needs should be respected, rewarded, and cultivated.<br />
<br />
Frankly, I can't see any reasons why they won't just let the class go to hell in a handbasket.  They pretty much already have, and I see no imaginative solutions being proposed to fix a thing.<br />
<br />
At least we have glory as a &quot;feeder&quot; class. Our skills were valuable enough to be vital priorities to feed to others; but once that was done, there was really no reason for us to exist, and not much motivation to keep us.  We were vital until they figured out how vital we were and then whored out our skills to so, so many other classes, hollowing us out and reducing us to nearly nothing to the player base smart enough to exclude us.<br />
<br />
To get to anywhere near our old value to groups from Kunark through a great deal of PoP, they would have to completely redesign the class, which they've basically never done to any class, so I doubt we would be the first.  <br />
<br />
They've always had the power to keep us; they just haven't chosen to exercise it.  What would bring me back is just exactly what they aren't willing or concerned or imaginative enough to do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Missing the friends I had made.  Plain and simple.  I didn't come back to kill XXX mob, get XXX spell or gear, or finally see XXX zone .. it was my friends.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Like BlargX I'm burned out, can't progress and have taken a break.  If by next week my feelings haven't changed, I'm going to end billing along with the rest of my crew who have already done so.  It finally hit me while farming greens in SF trying for the stupid cleric epic shards- this isn't fun and is a complete waste of my entertainment time.<br />
<br />
My friends and I recently joined the 3 million other people who purchased the Diablo 2 expansion and are having fun again playing that.  I guess Blazz was right- EQ isn't for people like us that just want to play casually and have fun.<br />
<br />
What would it take for me to come back?  No flagged content.  Ability to get groups and not have to 2 box.  Class balance.  Quests that aren't mind-numbingly boring for poor rewards.  The ability to get something done with a play time of 90 min or less.  But most important of all...<br />
<br />
have fun.  At least for my friends and I, EQ is no longer fun.  We have nothing to do and nowhere to go.  C'est la vie.  We're pretty pumped for WoW and at the rate we consume content, Diablo 2 oughta keep us busy for quite some time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">1) all my old friends returned<br />
2) mitigation was &quot;retuned&quot; for slow classes<br />
3) Alt access through quests was provided to see more content (not raid content though)<br />
4) level the playing field more between the casual and hardcore players so that gear doesn't matter as much.<br />
5) make stats matter more<br />
6) provide at the very least, as good of customer service as the phone company.  I like the 15/5 hour always on rule.  I want non-automated replies to email within 3 days.  I want responsive community representation that doesn't just respond when everyone quits or their parent company posts lower than expected revenue.<br />
7) STOP TESTING IN PRODUCTION!!!  I expect bugs and other crap, but not so much of it, AND I expect more CSR support during patch days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Snowfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Nothing could bring me back to this game.  I have quit twice and 2nd time was final.  EQ is off my machine, Snowfoot parked overlooking young barbarians leveling and my cleric I believe is parked somewhere in a plane (2nd account).<br />
<br />
Sony has trashed this game hard.  I am not talking about class balance because I never had an issue with it.  Issues I have are:<br />
<br />
1)  Constant broken expansions.  It is amazing how each expansion is so poorly tested and when released it is patch hell days.  Years later for some and months for new ones still busted and broken content.  Do things change?  Nope SOE just pumps out more expansion further expanding the broken content.   Fixed the damn content for change.  Make the current stuff stable and 95% complete instead of the 50% complete and a mess.<br />
2)  Flagging.  ***!  That killed so many guilds, broke friends and what not.  Worse idea ever.  I was in an uber guild and I tell you it really drove a hard line between those that played hardcore vs casual.  The constant backflagging was a pain.<br />
3)  Raiding.  Why is raiding like a job that I don't get paid for?  I got tired of 12 hour raiding days.  Has things changed?  Nope.  Still same old grind.  Where is the fun in that?<br />
4)  Better customer support.  They have so toned down CS so much that is a bad joke among players (what is the difference between a unicorn and SOE CS....you have a chance of seeing a unicorn..).  They have offshored a good chunk now to way lower costing areas.  Great..add more support then.  Can't be hurting that much on the bottomline.  That leads to 5...<br />
5)  SOE relationship with customers.  Wow talk about a screw you attitude.  Worse...the sheep most of us are let them do it because no one really cares.  The untested patches or ignored problems on patches (ie Directx 9 fiasco as one example) are just insane.  If a problem gets introduced, they don't roll it back but tell you to suck it up.  ***?  Oh that is customer caring all the way.  I am not asking to be spoon fed but dammit I expect better than told:  you will like this, you do this and ye gods you will suffer for it.  Haha I finally woke up to that and realized I have standards too and I will no longer take that crap.    If you introduce a bug roll back patch, fix and redo.  People will respect that more than suffering a problem because SOE tells you to.   <br />
<br />
Nah nothing will bring me back to this game.  It had its moment in my life but time to move on.  I will not be a sheep anymore to any SOE game.  I suggest the same to everyone else..take a stance, tell SOE change or bugger off.  Quit being a sheep!  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Snowfoot,<br />
<br />
You hit the nail right on the head!  Exactly the way I feel.  Love the game, love the class, love my friends, detest SoE and their horrific attitude towards quality control and their customer base.<br />
<br />
As I've said before, they have killed the golden goose.  I can not in good conscience continue to give them my money, even if there are things I enjoy about the game, there are too many I do not.  I will be playing City of Heroes full-time (been playing on the side since release), since I have a lot more fun playing CoH than EQ.  Don't get me wrong, I prefer a D&amp;D environment, but that alone is not enough to keep me tied to EQ.<br />
<br />
Take care,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>powderfdb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I have been gone since Nov '03, played a warrior since day one. I did not have enough playing time to keep up with everything going on around me. Maybe if warriors could ever solo, I might consider coming back. Hell, even right now I have an itch to come back, but only to be a casual player, lvling at my own pace. The casual players are lost after lvl 50 or so b/c no one has 4 to 5 hours to log on, hunt for a group, maybe get 5% exp, then if u die you are talking 30 to 60 minutes more depending on where u died. Like everyone said PoP, GoD and even SoL a little are geared to high end gamers, SoE somehow forgot the little people. I have read that you can accomplish something with even an hour played on EQ2, something EQ1 failed at.</div></div><hr />

If by some miracle, make an option so it would not have to be to much of a timesink.<br />

Yea, I think thats about it.. I've eatin 3-4 deaths in the last few months that I played from bugs and only once did I get a gm(which by that point it was too late).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Seeler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Not quite ready to quit EQ yet but unfortunately have somewhat sidelined my Shaman for now. I am only level 61 and unguilded so it is not a matter of no usefullness in high end (at least not yet). What has happened to me as a casual player is that I have hit a wall. Not really game content persay just the fact that many spells that would still make me vialble for solo and even PoP groups are outta my reach (torpor is too exp unless I spend hours farming which I cannot bring myself to do) and I do not think that good ole stoicism is gonna keep people up. Poison dot upgrade is expensive and rare, and I just don't enjoy sitting in a PoP zone for single pulls hoping to win the role on a parchment. So the only way for me to advance my character is to A. Spend hours in an expansion I don't really care for because that is the only place the spells I need drop. or B. Spend endless hours farming the mobs I can effeciently solo.<br />
<br />
As I said not really the &quot;content problem&quot; persay just an example of how this casual player views the &quot;Post 60&quot; EQ of today. As a side note and a little background, I have been playing for 5 years albeit off and on. I do not expect an easy ride to the top, hell the fact is it is by far an easier ride now then ever.....but only if you are willing to follow the prescribed route and zone list to achieve it. I still fire up Magnon now and then to duo with a friend but I miss the days of being able to &quot;take it on the chin&quot; while dog dog gnaws away and I could back out and drop a &quot;stoi&quot; on me and the dog and move back in. Heck I quested for canni 2 mostly solo, and stoicism as well. There is no way I can solo mobs that drop torpor and the PoP zones are my only option for 61-65 spells. Kind of depressing actually.<br />
<br />
Crap....I started to ramble so I am off.<br />
