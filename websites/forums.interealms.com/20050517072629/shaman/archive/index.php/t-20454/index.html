<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Winno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all,<br />
<br />
just wanted to know how you get your defense maxed especially on higher levels. I am just level 26 and I am absoulutely bored soloing aviaks in SK just to get this silly skill up. Its so slow. And from what I read it gets even worse on higher levels. <br />
/rant on: I would like to group with my shaman and get her on 29 asap, but I am forced to solo. Are the people at Verant stupid or is this just another thing to keep people on lower levels as long as possible? This is a game for grouping and I have to solo. If I need that long on level 26, I dont want to know how the other levels feel! Thanks Verant. Ok /rant off!<br />
Now my other question is: Will defense increase more if I have attack off and just let the mob beat on me? I would even let my shaman die and level down if I could get my defense up faster (its 122 now and if I am not wrong I need to go to 135, my DEX is full buffed 125). <br />
Would it work if I let my Magician friend summon a pet of my level and duelling his pet? Will I get skill increases? (I doubt I will but I had to ask:)<br />
I know you dont get skill increases from duelling other players but his pet is an NPC.<br />
Thanks for your help!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">At level 25 to 30 there is a wonderful mob for you to fight that dramatically increases the speed at which you get defense skillups - the needlites in Echo Caverns. They hit extremely quickly, but not very hard. Have your mage friend cast a damage shield on you &amp; pull them with something from our cripple line, Disenpower or whatever the highest for  your level is.</div></div><hr />
