<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Warriors on Steel Warriors are debating whether they want focus or shield of the arcane as a regular buff in their lineup. http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=6617</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zorash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Greetings,<br />
<br />
Personally, I don't find this nearly as humorous as I find it sad.<br />
<br />
Our one HP buff is soon to go the way of the do-do since it's no longer enough HP.  I'm still trying to figure out why it's only 544HP, as opposed to 650 or 700.<br />
<br />
I don't want to buff HP like a cleric, and I'm not sure why I shouldn't buff as well as a druid in the HP department (and mana regen, ***?), but I'll conceed that point.  Now...make me buff CLOSE to a druid in HP...please?  At least make the one remaining group buff that's at all viable....wanted.<br />
<br />
*shrug*<br />
<br />
*starts trying to see if stores near him have a copy of CoH available*<br />
<br />
Be well,<br />
<br />

<br />
Nah, the &quot;REAL changes&quot; will more than likely happen after we've all jumped ship, or right around when WoW comes out, whichever comes first. (and judging by history... right around when WoW comes out)<br />
<br />
It'll be too late by then for a number of us, but hey... their loss.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wonder if the new Graveyard zone is where they're going to put all us Shaman when we die because we stink so bad now.<br />
<br />
...Wait, I'd take that as a class improvement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I feel really sorry for the shamans who have been paying a ton of money on Legends server now.  That's a lot of money down the drain -- god forbid they are playing multiple accounts too.   Dunno, but those shamans might be the only ones Sony is paying attention to anyway, and they're bound to be as stumped as we are -- just with a much bigger financial investment in their toons going belly up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can agree to that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Bah, even is all the servers lost 50% of the Shaman players base, most people wouldn't notice.  When is the last time you took more than 3 Shaman to a raid and a game of Cleric ping-pong didn't ensue? :P<br />
<br />
Our class has slowly become a joke.  When Necros become more useful than you in a raid, you are officially on the back page of &quot;**** to upgrade&quot; in the SOE agenda folder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Heheh I have to agree.  Necros stack much better than we do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">/agree (almost) to just about everything...and frankly, FINE dont take my Fo7....more mana for me less hps for you &gt;&lt; I personaly know that i am still usefull as i get begged to get to the raid ASAP because there is only 1 or 2 shammies there.  <br />
<br />
I think a big part of our prob is YES...SoE forgot us or just doesnt care.  BUT i think a part of the shammies problem is also in the fact that most of you are so dishearted and disenchanted with the shammy class that you simply dont look at the posatives anymore.  I personaly know that i am a damn fine shammy, i play with skill and intelegance (even though i cant spell for poop).  I once in a hard ldon kept the whole group alive after our cleirc and chanter (thank god for bards :) ) both died. there were 3 mobs in camp and i was only healer with a 10k war tank.  I dont call that broken, i call it skill.  That is just one example of what a shammy can do....sure a druid could have done it (if the bard can keep the mobs slowed and others mezzed)...but a SHAMMY did it, yes..a shammy with NO GoD spells only Q and tnargs.<br />
<br />
In a nutshell:  If you wanna stop being a shammy fine.  If you wanna bring to SoE's attention what needs to be done fine.....But stop whining ;)  SoE doesnt care when we whine as has been proven for how ever long we have been....so just stop :)  (not trying to be a bitch, just trying to open a few eyes maybe)<br />
<br />
Edit**  i know it doesnt totaly apply to the topic the thread was started with....but its in response to some of the other replies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It says a lot about the inability of shaman to buff people when warriors are talking about skipping focus in favor of the caster shielding self buff line (although i still think the nearly 200hp extra from focus is probably better in a majority of circumstances)...</div></div><hr />

Im sorry, but when i read this i see someone that doesnt understand a lot.  LDoN is not  where anything is concerned. The only time LDoN is ever referenced is so that people that dont play GoD or are not elemental flagged can get a small taste of whats going on in places they dotn see. LDoN hard nothing.<br />
<br />
The only eyes i see needing opening is your my friend, its not a flame, its a opinion. If you look around at who actualy does get the oil, its always the squeaky wheel. SoE has proven it by the way they upgrade classes and by the way they respond to posts on their own forum. We have tried calm reasoned discussion, perhaps you missed the long post that was ignored just last week at the SoE forums or maybe you missed the shaman proposal that was completely ignored which took a MASSIVE community effort to come together and agree on things and it got closed if i remember right at the SoE forum with no real reply.<br />
<br />
How long do you talk calmy? How long to you pretend that they will listen if we just stay coolheaded about it. There is a time when enough if enough a time when patience is worn thin and a time when frustration is VERY justified. I dont know how long you been around here and beyond that, taking a active role in the change for this class ( active as in trying to get something done and not sitting on the fence saying &quot; do this and that &quot;, but real effort ), sending e-mails, tracking devs down, running parses, talking in LONG AND ANNOYING debates trying to cool people out and get unity and agreement to come to the surface so we can present 1 voice that SoE will listen too, cause according tot hem, thats what they wanted.<br />
<br />
To have it all fail and beyond that, to have zero real communication, not &quot;throw the dog a bone so itll shut up&quot; posts, to have nothing come of your efforts and to be shown that intelligence is ignored, HARD work is wasted and stupid flameing posts get the only responses. Well im sorry, but like i said, there is a point where anger/frustration becomes a justified entity.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sorry, but the bitching and whining is justified around here IMHO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Very sorry to have offended.  I wasnt trying to do that.  I know that there are a LOT of usefull, helpfull, and well thought out threads about what needs to be done with shammies. I applaud your hard work, and respect your opinions.  I too have posted, i have e mailed, just not as publicly as some of you. <br />
<br />
 I am not a 'high end' shammy in that i am not into GoD, i get drafted into EPs still (oh so close to flag though &gt;&lt; grr), BUT the problems effecting the high end shammies effect us all.  The only thing i meant by my earlier post was, dont whine.  If you have a prob, that is ok, state it, then maybe even offer a solution, but dont make threats and dont whine.  untill reading a lot of these posts, i have not noticed how broken some people think we are.  I never looked at that stuff in game.  Maybe it is because im not in GoD or PoTime.  Maybe its because i refuse to belive that we are useless.  Maybe its because i know that i put a lot of time and effort into a char that i care about and dont want to think about the fact that we are starting to suck....i dont know.  All i know is that there needs to be more posts about solutions to the prob rather than repeating the same whiney rants all the time.   <br />
<br />
Again sorry to have offended those who do not whine, i didnt mean that post for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Cascet, a lot of these people HAVE posted well thought out posts about the problems we face, ever since the begining of PoP.  These problems haven't yet changed, they have simply been amplified to the point that we cannot overcome them with our skills.<br />
<br />
  We have ALL provided potential solutions, many of them incredibly well balanced and even proper from a RP aspect without stepping on the toes of other classes.   Many others balance content to fit all current classes.  Some simply help define us on our secondary abilities.  Some were just real simple coding fixes or spell changes that would be able to be added in an emergency patch even.<br />
<br />
<br />
  The point is, it has been nearly a year that these people have been being cool headed about things.  We did see what was coming based on the general trend and attempted to stop it.   On occasion we THOUGHT that we were getting through to them (like when they upped Nihil from 45 seconds to a minute somethin, or when they completely changed the ancient canni.  But the ratio on the slow never changed, and it wasn't till live that we learned how far into the expansion the ancients really are... PAST all the broken content).<br />
<br />
   And as for your experience in LDoN.  I am quite sure that 90% of the level 65s who have been posting about these problems or retired could easily do the same.  I personally did something similar, but I was also the tank and it was only 2 mobs at the time.   However, the problem they state with LDoN hard is that you could not possibly pass the mission with you attempting to main heal the entire time.  The problem in GATES is that you cannot even play healer in an emergency like that.<br />
<br />
<br />
  But don't mistake the frustration of these people for inability.  You really are debating with some of the top shaman in some of these posts.  People who have taken things out solo that everyone claimed were impossible.  Some of them have done stupid things JUST to see if our class can (short ways into PoP someone solo'd the WW dragon with no AE wearing only a grummus shield and epic).  And even discovering how we can function best in groups as tanks/healers/whatever.<br />
<br />
  Assuming sony doesn't actually do anything (safe bet), just remember your attempts to cheer us up in 1 year when we are all gone and you are the one posting to try fixing us.  Someone will invariably come along and let you know that it is just a lack of skill or love of the class that makes you jaded.</div></div><hr />
