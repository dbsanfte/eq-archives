<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm looking for some good dungeon(or out of the way) areas to get some good solo xp at 58.<br />
<br />
I've never really traveled the worlds before, so kind of want to expand my horizons.<br />
<br />
I have epic, no jbb and decent gear with about 952 ac/2100hp buffed<br />
<br />
I'm wondering if Akheva would be a good spot, or other low traffic places :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grayskies</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You will be able to single pull everything in both the ZI and the ZO tunnels in Chardok. Pet tanks for me and one Ebolt and one BoN generally drop any opponent in either tunnel.<br />
<br />
ZO is a little harder to break, but is doable. I generally buff up at ZI, invis myself then head to ZO. There will be a mob on either side, I generally root the one on the left and then slow the one on the right. After these two are dead, I bring pet up. When using this strategy, it is good to con the dogs as you go, as some of the Chokidai Sniffers will see through invis.<br />
<br />
Some people like to work their way from the fort/gate side of ZO tunnel towards the actually ZO, but I find that fighting too close to the fort/gate to be problematic, and having to zone right after you've given puppy 2 precious Gnoll whips really sucks. :)<br />
<br />
At 59 I am not able to single pull from the fort/gate yet.<br />
<br />
There is also a very good guide to soloing in Charasis posted on this board.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">at 58 with a ac over 1k and a good conection you can solo the mobs at POI entry.<br />
<br />
I soloed a couple at lvl 56 (mobs were 52-54 lvl range)<br />
<br />
Its NOT easy, but is real adrenaline action!  Only an option if u are WIDE awake, and redy to think quick.  <br />
<br />
YOu need aegolism. KEI. horse and jbb or epic.<br />
<br />
Id recomend trying to duo it with a 49 druid- who can snare mob (after u debuff it)  ds yer pet, and keep pet healed.<br />
<br />
Also you may want to invest in the bazaar on some nice dd weapons for the pet.<br />
<br />
maybe not the fastest exp , but wow its sure is a RUSH<br />
&lt;maybe i just had too much cafeine thatday LOL&gt;<br />
<br />
ps  this is only an option at OFF peak times, i have seen some awful trains at POI entrance- one ranked as the 3rd worst i have seenin 3 years of EQ !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Chardok is nice like Gray said and on my server it's usually empty. Velks is another option but you need to hit that place at off hours else it's packed with peeps fighting over spiders. You can solo seb entrance but with people coming and going spawns dry up because people kill those spawns on their way to other camps.<br />
<br />
Chardok gets lonely but there's no shortage of dark blues so it's probably your best option :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Drachen183</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I got a horse and went to KC... Cappy. Those dogs are sissies and have like no hp's. Just Dot and bracer, exp starts to suck at 59 tho...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">At 58 Katta is starting to get light blue - still real easy exp and pretty nice cash flow, if ya loot/sell the weapons.  With horse ya don't even need KEI.   Since PoP came out, Katta is no longer crowded.<br />
<br />
You can also do the archers in Echo Caverns.  Two archers each drop a pair of bows, so 4 bows that I sell for 23 pp each every cycle.  The archers and the 4 scoundrels each drop plat as well, up to 6.  At 58 you probably will not get to the skeletons in the tunnel (arisen soldiers?) unless you have KEI (no horse here).  If you do try the skels, at 58 I would root one in the middle so that only one would come.  First time I got two, and had a tuff time finishing them off.   Once they are split they are cake.  skels can drop up to 8 plat.</div></div><hr />
