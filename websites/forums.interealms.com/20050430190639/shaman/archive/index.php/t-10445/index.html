<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fumeden Ex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, against my better judgement, I spent the AA for Virulent Paralysis. My small usual group of hunting partners would benefit from a mana free root with a knockback effect, right?  Well maybe they do, except for the 4/5 resists Im getting.  Is this typical?  And does anyone know if the save is checked against magic or disease?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Where are you hunting?<br />
<br />
VP has been more than worth the points for me, I can't count the number of times I use it to position mobs and get 600 flurriers off me after they resisted turgur.<br />
<br />
It's check vs DR, so useless in CoD and probably some places in PoD, but I've had great success just about everywhere else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yah I'd wonder where yer using it.  Mobs with high DR aren't going to be affected by it.  I use it a lot in HoH, also on stuff in PoV like the beasties in the caves.  The golems are unaffected by it as they are very DR, but the crystal crawlers can be rooted effectively by it.  It works well in BoT against lightning and hurricane giants, but not at all against sand giants and less well on tornado giants.  <br />
<br />
I love VP and I use the hell out of it.  It works brilliantly in the old world zones too.  It lands on pretty much everything in VT first try, which can really be a bonus when clearing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I trained it a couple weeks ago and have yet to see a resist.<br />
<br />
I think it's an excellent AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">just a question on this since i'm looking to get it .. (maybe)<br />
<br />
does the root work just like normal root, as in it can break every 6 seconds ? .. or is this different in some way ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If it's disease-based can you improve your odds by casting Insidious Decay or the new DR debuffer first?  I would assume so, but just want to make sure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have been using it in NToV and lands 95% of the time.<br />
<br />
There are some situations VP is great for.<br />
<br />
1. Puller brings mob into camp and the MT calls for everyone to PUSH THE MOB in a particular direction, I get on opposite side and VP, it knocks the mob back a good ways and saves a whole lot of pushing.<br />
<br />
2. Mob is pulled that is a gater, when the mobs HP's are down to nothing and I see the mob start to cast gate, I use VP and it interrupts the cast 100% of the time, thereby preventing a mob from gating.<br />
<br />
3. Mob starts thumping on me due to a resisted SLOW, I VP it and it knocks the mob back and roots it long enough to get it slowed.<br />
<br />
VP rocks in a lot of situations.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Runak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm personally disappointed with VP.  I didn't do my research and wasn't aware that it was just a knockback and root.  I thought it was our first stun!  I can't use this spell on raids unless the mob is already in the corner.  I don't even like to knock things back in exp groups.  The only purpose it serves me now is a last resort while soloing.  Wishing I had just started my healing AA's with those points.<br />
<br />
-R</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I agree with everyone else.  VP is very useful, I don't often mem root anymore.  If you are root parking, it's a great to use in conjunction with your root spell.  If you have two mobs, it immediately puts one of them out of the fight, so you can concentrate on the other.  The fast casting time is nice.<br />
<br />
Downsides, in addition to DR, is that has a 2 min recast time and has a pretty short duration at level 1 (which I have).  Additional AA points can be spent to make it last longer.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Btw, as with all push back spells, where you face is where the mob goes.<br />
<br />
Your position relative to the mob is inconcequential.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: Awsome dueling/pvp tool when used near cliffs. Trueshot? HA! Manaburn? HA!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It's two AA points.  You can knockback many mobs, while they're trying to kill you.  You can cast it quick to control adds. Even if it's resisted, it's not high aggro.  What's not to like?  It's one our most entertaining AA's.   :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Just picked up VP. So far only had much time to play with it in PoV. I found it moderately useful there. The golems seem to be fairly high resist and the spiders are too frequently immune. Playing with it on the razorfiends it seemed prety effective tho. The knockback is definitely noticable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">It's been almost useless for me as I spend most of my time hunting in Bastion of Thunder.<br />
<br />
South and North resist it completely and East and West require debuffing before it will stick with any reliability.  <br />
<br />
Pity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">It's excellent for pushing people off of steep cliffs, now that the knockback stick is always resisted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">If you think VP is worthless, chances are you're not getting out of PoV, PoS(giants), or BoT much.  And even in BoT there are only two wings of giants that resist it.  On the stuff that doesn't have insane DR, I rarely if ever get a resist.  <br />
<br />
Try it in the old world, it just flat out rocks in so many situations.  ESPECIALLY when there are multiple highly MR mobs you need to deal with.  Or you NEED to stop a gater.  Or you wanna root park something, can't think of a better root parking tool. <br />
<br />
Today I got a new toy, Ring of Immobilization, from VT.  It casts a 2.0 second Immobilize, unlimited charges.  Well, between that and VP, I'll never have to mem another root spell again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">What golems are you talking about that are supposedly highly resistant to disease in PoV?  I've been root rotting golems here and there when I haven't picked up a group, and I've seen VP resisted once in about 100 golem kills or so.  I'm leading with DR debuff but it doesn't matter all that much.</div></div><hr />

VP is one of my favorite AA when I AM on a raid or soloing. It is VERY useful in mob control. <br />
<br />
'just a knockback and root'?<br />
<br />
/boggle<br />
<br />
VP was one of my first PoP AA I put points into. I had a gut feeling it would be useful based on the concept and has been far from disappointing.<br />
<br />
Virulent Paralysis is one of the must haves in my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Sirap</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">What is the cast time of VP?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">bout 2 seconds.  It's very reasonable in that regard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Fumeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">thx for the replies. guess i figured it out when i finally left cod. it rocks in PoS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Ya.  CoD is HIGHLY resistant to disease.  That's why you had the **** luck.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for this tip. I learned something new. Very cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Coralie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">yes in fact the pushback option + root is very good for CC<br />
you can for example remove a mob that was on a rotation cleric or who hit someone in his back<br />
<br />
an other thing Root desease may work on mob imune magic but not imune snare/root<br />
Example: like the last wave of Giant in the 10th coldain ring event</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">If yer gonna use it to interrupt an almost dead mob, make sure to debuff his disease first, you don't want this resisted!</div></div><hr />
