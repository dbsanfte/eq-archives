<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jannia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">When to leave a Guild... <br />
<br />
I love the friends I made in the guild that I joined. We had a ton of fun goofing around in dungeons and hunting mobs. The guild is pretty new so there are only a few post lv50 members. A few weeks ago a lot of the guild members decided to start up a wave of new alts. At the time I only had my main so I soloed for several levels. Now I'm sitting at the edge of reaching lv50. Instead of pressing on, I decided to wait it out and start an alt. As the weeks go by, I noticed that the general guild attendance has been pretty sparse. I'm finding it difficult to find fellow guildmates at my alt's current level to adventure with. <br />
<br />
I just feel like a heel if I drop my Shaman from the guild in the hopes of finding a guild geared to lv50 and above. Eventually I would like to go for my Epic but I don't believe my current guild can help for a extremely long time. I'm not looking for riches or uber loot, I just want to find a new guild which my Shaman can fit into. Am I being a schmuck in wanting to leave?</div></div><hr />

You dont play EQ to keep others happy, you play to entertain yourself.  now in part that is done by being friendly but you can still be friends with the old guildies, but if they are not doing it for you find a guild who is more suited to what u want.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Been in about 5 guilds myself and pretty much just followed my friends, RL and other, around.  When I was not able to do bigger things with my guild, I joined in pick-up raids to get familiar with what was out there.  Grouping lots with people you don't know is an excellent way to get invited to other players guild raids and pick-up raids.<br />
<br />
If your guildies see you out doing bigger things mebe they will want to join in and if not, you will be in a better position to move into another guild.  Just focus on what is fun for you :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jamorea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Showing loyalty is good but somtimes, you have to leave in order to advance.  My advice, talk to the Guild Leader, say why you're leaving, then deguild.  Be polite about it though.<br />
<br />
I stuck around my first guild a little too long.  I was amazed at how much I progressed once I left it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">my first guild was a small one. i was the 4th person to reach 50 and it soon became boring. it took a while, but i left,  and found a guild that suited my desires to see new things, kill bigger stuff, and play farther into the end game.<br />
<br />
i've never regretted it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Chukzombi Astrocreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">When all your friends in guild retire from EQ or  quit to join other guilds. Thats probably a good time to move on.<br />
<br />
The guild i was in during Kunark was a very small guild but they were all my friends. One by one they stopped playing and the guild leader kept spam inviting idiots to fill up the ranks. One day i realised it was just me in a guild full of retarded strangers. That was the day i left and Joined Da`Kor then later reformed to Magister.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">guilds are like schools.  when you graduate its time to go to a bigger and better school until you get your degree.  <br />

confuscious pwns me =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>jannia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">For over the past week, I've only seen 2-8 guildmates on at any time. It use to be a lot more then that. What I'll do is have my Shaman leave the guild but keep my alt in the guild. I hope the guild will start to grow again. Thanks for the advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Yesferatu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Honestly, the guild does not make that decision ultimately.<br />
If you hardly group with them, and aren't having any fun, why are you even in the guild?<br />
<br />
I am in a few guilds with a few alts and if I am not having fun, generally, I switch over.  I solo alot, so it doesn't really matter what guild I am in, but when you do want to group or raid, your guild should be there for you.  That's what it's there for.<br />
If you can't group because few of them are on, or you want to go other places your guild can't go, then leave.<br />
<br />
It's just going to frustrate you more to spend time in a going nowhere guild wishing you where somewhere else.</div></div><hr />

<br />
hehehe...somehow I always get draged into being an officer...always made it tough for me to leave, even though I sometimes wanted to go after other options.<br />
<br />
Was a little easier in last guild...all the officers,the leader and a few other high level people disbanded and left the newbs behind...remnants of a disbanded 55+ guild merges with 50+ guild = OMG we can't to **** to the higher levels.<br />
<br />
Would have skiped the last guild and went bigger, but all the guilds that would be upgrades required at least have cann5 and I was still 7 aa short at the time.</div></div><hr />
