<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>LoudMule</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">but haven't played in about a year and a half and was wondering what new stuff is in the game since I left. Recently, I have been playing EQ 2  and a little WoW and I am impressed with both games, esp EQ 2 which is just blowing me away right now. But unfortuanately all my friends are still playing EQ (these are RL friends btw) and I'm thinking about getting back on.  Its kind of tough decision cause I have to say, once you've played EQ 2 then EQ seems like a pretty achaic game both visually and in terms of depth and especially in the combat system.  So what gives?  Besides hanging with my friends in game, any cool reasons why I should resurrect my old shaman?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">How about you read all the posts on this board and get back to us with any specific questions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shiuna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If EQ2 is blowing you away, you won't enjoy coming back to EQ1. Put all your RL friends on your IM contact list and chat away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">there are several reasons, but only one reason that matters.<br />
<br />
do you still enjoy EQ?<br />
<br />
EQ is a game, and games are meant to be enjoyed. if you don't enjoy it, don't bother.<br />
<br />
EQ may not be as graphically in-depth as EQ2 or WoW, but it has a certain freedom about it. the only reason I still play is because I enjoy it. I have friends that play, and if I moved onto EQ2, they have a /tell system between games.<br />
<br />
just see if you still enjoy EQ, and that should be your reason to come back if you do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>LoudMule</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Okay, thanks for the replies. I'll probably end up playing both games any way. But yea EQ 2 is really incredible but I felt the same way about EQ for a while there too so who knows.</div></div><hr />

*yup... and a few people still enjoy playing Pong™ too.  :p <br />
<br />
I have stayed because of my friends and the comunity in general, the game does not have the magic and flair that it once did, but I play there socially.<br />
<br />
Hey, that's just me though.  With the package deal for being in both games you can decide if you want to go back or not... I liked the friends list to chat, but the odd adventures together are part of the fun too.</div></div><hr />
