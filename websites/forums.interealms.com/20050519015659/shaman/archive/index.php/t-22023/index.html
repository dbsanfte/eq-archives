<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Healing - group heal<br />
This is the first poll to this thread (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=21999). As I am limited to 10 options I will post this as three polls, please vote on all of them. I will edit this post and add the links to the other polls.<br />
<br />
Shaman need help in the following areas:<br />
* an upgrade to Daluda's. It is simply too small.<br />
* some sort of emergency heal to recover from a resisted slow.<br />
* some sort of group or AE heal for raid usage.<br />
<br />
That said these seem to be the options we could ask for. When voting on them please keep in mind that simply asking for the biggest numbers in each category does not solve anything. Ask for what you think shaman need to be competitive and no more.<br />
<br />
Daluda's<br />
a) improve amount healed to 1800, improve OoW heal to 2100<br />
b) improve amount healed to 2000, improve OoW heal to 2500<br />
<br />
emergency heal[/B]<br />
a) targetable stonestance<br />
c) single-target divine arbitration<br />
e) spirit shifting - drains HPs from shaman and gives them to the target<br />
<br />
[U]AE/group heal<br />
a) group HoT, Torpor style<br />
b) group HoT, Quiescence style<br />
c) direct group heal<br />
d) AE heal, heals 4 injured players in AE range to target<br />
Obviously the HoTs would be MGBable which SOE does not seem to like. The AE may be hard to keep your group alive with but being able to cast direct heals on a cleric group or tank duo may have it's own advantages on a raid.<br />

Direct group heal was my vote, too, but I will be satisfied with an MGBable one similar to Paragon (which I think we should HAVE WITHOUT A DOUBT)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I like the AE direct heal.  It can't me mgb'd so SoE won't have that kiniption fit, and it's unique which is also nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Seems to me that MGB Q is the only one that's in our range of abilities.  Since we were first with the heal over time maybe we should have had that line extended and more defined for our class.</div></div><hr />

Well by that logic, you don't need tnargs either, or Q, or DD's, or Dots, or Slows, or pets etc. etc.<br />
<br />
I thought that Rytan or Brenlo already said that a MGBable heal over time will not be considered for the shaman class, since they didn't intend for them to work for the other classes to begin with.<br />
<br />
I can't vote on these 4 options since I think the first 2 of them won't even be considered, the 4th one seems a little unworkable, theres just a big question mark on it since no spell that anyone has works like its being described.  The third option will be a pathetically small heal, enough so to be pretty useless, or it will compete with what a cleric has.  It somehow doesn't fit in with what a shaman should be able to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I still really dig Ryan's idea of a &quot;chain lightning&quot; style of healing which could heal  multiple people in close proximity.<br />
<br />
It just sounds really different and cool!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tudani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I voted for direct group heal, as I can already keep a group quies'd if I want to, just casting more often.  I also doubt we'll get a group Q as the devs don't want us to be able to mgb a heal.  My personal favorite in the realm of group healing is an AA that lets the next heal be a group heal, non mgb'able, doesn't take another spell slot, and lets me choose between a direct or a heal over time group heal, dev's could also make the recast something that they like. &lt;shrug&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I have always Liked the Idea of a Rain spell type.<br />
<br />
<br />
6 Waves Up to 4 people. Say 300 a wave every 3 seconds or so.  But they have to stay in the area of effect. Could call it Wave of the Heyokah or something and have the area saturated with Spirit shapes. <br />
<br />
It fits shaman over time healing idea very nicely and wouldnt take a buff slot. Or a circle of Puppys All howling towards the center. <br />
<br />
<br />
Make Critical heals affect it.  Along with The Heal increaser AA. Seems intrersting Idea really.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I picked the targeted ae. It cant be mgb'd, which is what they said we are opposed to. If it can be cast centered on monsters, even better. I love stuff like that in City of Heroes. The targeting and assist system in that game makes me hard.</div></div><hr />

/agree</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Pinot Noir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I will vote Gloriana's idea.<br />
And in my feeling, rain type healing should go to Druid...<br />
How about Karana's rain? it sounds to be suitable for druid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Toppo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">A group Q would be incredible :) <br />
Not likely to ever happen though imho.<br />
<br />
The &quot;chain&quot; idea, perhaps centred on the target, might be very nice.</div></div><hr />
