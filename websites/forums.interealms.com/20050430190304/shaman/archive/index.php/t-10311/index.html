<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Currently my macro for canni V is:<br />
<br />
/target myname<br />
/alt activate 47<br />
/pause 24<br />
/cast x<br />
<br />
First line targets myself (myname is whatever your name is).  Targetting isnt needed till later in the macro, but doing this here removes the need for an extra pause.<br />
<br />
Second line activates CanniV<br />
<br />
Third line is the pause I need before I can cast<br />
<br />
Fourth line casts spell in spell slot x (where x = 1..8), basically whichever healing spell used after CanniV<br />
<br />
I need one more line.  My CanniV buttons are on the second bank of hotbuttons - where I won't accidentally hit them.  So I want to swap back to the first bank after activating this macro.  Does anyone know how I do this within the macro?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">To the best of my knowledge, there is no command available that will do that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Not possible.  I have my C5 hotkey like this one on Page 9, hotkey #9 slot.  When I want to do this, I hit shift 9, 9, shift 1, and it's all taken care of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Be aware that there are many times that you'll want to cast Torpor/Quiescence BEFORE you Cana, to sacrifice 300 HP's and land FM after the heal's done.  Therefore, the macro will be backwards for THAT one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kaalisti_Painstorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Coming from someone who also plays a high level cleric as well as a shaman... please consider adding the following line in your macro<br />
<br />
/g Canni5 INC - HP Dropping fast, I'm fine!<br />
<br />
or something like that :D <br />
<br />
Canni5 is enough to give a cleric a heart attack when the shaman's HP drops that low that fast *laughs*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My cleric warning hotkey text is &quot;OMG GET IT OFF ME&quot; <br />
<br />
they usually tell me to just hit canni5 instead of my text macro</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">haha I just got canni V last night.  Its so fun watching the druids freak out and start spamming heals even tho I say I am cannibalizing....<br />
<br />
I already have most of my guild clerics trained to ignore my health bar unless i hit 1 bubble of health.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thats odd, my guild clerics just ignore my health all the time...<br />
<br />
Think they trying to tell me something? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Recommend not using the term &quot;Inc&quot; unless you are pulling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Don't add a line of text to your hotkey.  After about the 13782th time you hit it, everyone in your group that sees it is going to want to shoot you.<br />
<br />
Once the cleric knows you have canni5 and you use it, you should be ok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Walknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I say: &quot;About to Cann5, this is gunna hurt me more then it does you&quot;  Then cast Cann5<br />
<br />
Problem is, as stated before, after the first time it gets on peoples nerves.  So just yesterday, I let everyone in the group know that I have Cann5.  Cleric still wanted me to say something if I cann5 during a fight.  Other then that it worked out fine.</div></div><hr />
