<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Finally getting to see NToV. Killed that big sont look alike that guards the entrance, and basically on xev, once you do that the other guilds letcha clean NToV out. (My understanding at least)<br />
<br />
First impressions: Its a damn easy zone. Most of the boss dragons are freeking easy. Of course, we are talking a force of 60 people here, quite a few primals and sod's as well, so im sure that skews things a bit. <br />
<br />
Flurry drakes: Cooooooool. Lol man these things will but the beatdown on you FAST, even when slowed. <br />
<br />
Most mobs seem to be slowable with tash/malo, save the lava guardians/firey defenders which seem to need malosini. <br />
<br />
Some of the areas have INSANE lag, and im not talking FPS either. During one of the fights 15 people went LD! lol, im sure they were on aol or something cool like that tho. <br />
<br />
Seen a sheild of wurms drop, and I think it was off a named drake. Anyone confirm?<br />
<br />
Lastly, one of the monks in the guild has the weapon from tunare which procs root, and it fekkin got me killed on 2 of the dragons. I run up and hang out under the belly of the dragon, /wave at the MT, wait for malo/tash call and then cast malosini.... in the spam I notice &quot;wussdragon_05 has become entangled with roots&quot; and all the sudden its, WELL HELLO THERE MR SHAMMY THAT'S STANDING UNDER ME!<br />
<br />
Lady Mirsomething was the coolest fight so far, with some sorta aoe that spins you around like a highschool girl in a tequila chair in some border town in mexico. unfortunatly I didn't realize it was a dot until I was gimping away to hide from the aoe when she reached out and smacked me for 400 to finish me off.<br />
<br />
All in all, this zone seems to be candyland as far as loot goes. Few more dragons to clear tonight, we'll see if they are as easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Lol.  Aye, NToV is fun.  There are only about 3 really hard dragons IMO.  Aary, the gatekeeper, Vyemm, and Zlexak(sp?).  Zlex doesn't have a lot of HP, but he has a nasty disease AE--we eeked though with 4 clerics, but he can be rough if you're short on healing.  He's one of the triplets in the back.  Many of the other mobs in NToV aren't that hard but just have a butt load of HP.<br />
<br />
The shield you mentioned, the Shield of the Wurms is actually a drop off the yard trash, not the named mobs.  Well, let me restate that.  There are a few of the flurry drakes that have names, but they aren't really 'named' mobs.  By named, I mean the big dragons like Aary, Fesh, Dagarn, etc.<br />
<br />
You probably already noticed, but when you are clearing the drakes and stuff out of the way, all the flurry mobs have capital letters in their names--ie A Lava Defender is a flurry, but a lava defender is not.  Any of the mobs in NToV other than the true named and the little chickens right before Aary can drop a Shield of Wurms (or any of the other class stuff--rogue and warrior necklaces, barrier of sound, druid shield, ring of superiority, etc).<br />
<br />
Welcome to NToV!  Glad you had fun!<br />
<br />
Chutoi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">NToV is definitely an interesting place. I think rooting several of the mobs a while back actually made things simpler to deal with in alot of ways.<br />
<br />
Yeah the shield is random drop of the &quot;yard trash&quot; and guards for the actual named dragons just like all the other class shields/necklaces.<br />
<br />
Roy is definitely the first real fight and is the key to getting into the rotation on my server also. Vyemm can be a real pain and not everyone actually manages to kill him now. Zexlak or what ever his name is can be interesting. You and either just beat the ever living daylights out of him (our last fight with him was parsed at about a minute 30) or you can actually use some positioning to make him worlds easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I figure I am allowed to ask a dumb question every now and again... here we go!<br />
<br />
What does it take to do this zone? Full group.. Two Group... 3 group ... 5 group?<br />
<br />
I am wanting to push my guild into going into the zone.  We have been doing Keal, but the drop rate is bad.... think 99% of us have max CoV faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">CoV faction doesn't matter.  Almost everything in NToV is KoS to you anyway.  They are on a different faction--think of it as their private reserve, no one else allowed.<br />
<br />
As for a minimum . . . well, that's darn hard to answer.  Equipment ranges pretty widely at this point.  For a guild that is in NToV equivalent armor and weapons, I'd say you could probably make it with 5-6 groups, though you wouldn't be able to take vyemm down with that.  For a first time run, in not quite that good gear, I'd shoot for at least 50 people.<br />
<br />
Both guesstimates on people assume at least 75% of the folks would be level 60.<br />
<br />
Dunno, others may disagree.  :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Flurry drakes: Cooooooool. Lol man these things will but the beatdown on you FAST, even when slowed. <br />
<br />
Flurry drakes are one of the hardest things to deal with in NToV. <br />
<br />
If their name is in CAPITAL Letters then they flurry.<br />
<br />
Most mobs seem to be slowable with tash/malo, save the lava guardians/firey defenders which seem to need malosini.  <br />
<br />
Butterlies like the rest require POI.<br />
<br />
<br />
Some of the areas have INSANE lag, and im not talking FPS either <br />
<br />
Have not noticed it. Prob peeps computer/connection.<br />
<br />

<br />
Shields Amulates drop off of named drake/guards. Here is a good link for you.<br />

<br />
Lady Mirsomething was the coolest fight so far, with some sorta aoe that spins you around  <br />
<br />
That is Lady Nev, not M. It is spin the bottle she is a chanter dragon. Lady M silences.<br />
<br />

<br />
Well depending on your server....It is very bad form to move into NToV untill you can kill the gatekeeper Aaryonar. You are just riding tailcoats.<br />
<br />
As for amt of groups depends I guess. First time we did Aary we had like 50 and wiped 2 times before he went down. Now we can do Aary and his 2 guards at the same time with about 36.<br />
<br />
Vyemm is a different bread all together and problably the hardest dragon in there. We have killed him 3 times over the past few weeks. If you cannot kill T-Max, Yeli flawlessly expect to get stomped. His knockback is a bitch till you get your strat down.<br />
<br />
Zlexak is also pretty tough till you figure out the pull and what is needed to kill him. 1200 point AE hurts big time.<br />
<br />
Pretty much the rest of the dragons are gimps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Irksome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you wanna see if you are ready for NToV, go in after the named dragons are down.  Try out your force on flurry drakes and moving thru.  Make it a goal to get to Plane of Mischief, which is up near the triplets spawn point.  Get maps, and work out routes and timing and such.<br />
<br />
For sure, Aaryonar is the price of entry.  He is one mean mofo.  If you cannot kill him, and go in when he's down but other nameds are up, you are gonna be considered gimps.  For sure, work out how to handle flurries and the rest of the yard trash up there when the nameds are not up, it will save you time on your first run, and will also help you evaluate your readiness.  Also, some guilds that have been in there forever may not care about some of the lesser dragons, you might be able to work a deal with them to test yourselves on Koi or some other named (assuming he wasn't up for their clearing, and popped the next day or something like that).<br />
<br />
Flurries should be crippled, too.  My experience is that you get a noticeable drop-off in the flurry rate once you land cripple.  Typically, we do Malo, Tash, OOS, and a bard with tash stick, mages work on Malosini, shaman work on Turgur's, then finally try to cripple.  Sometimes you nail it on the first cast of everything, sometimes you die trying the 4th slow.  If you fail two slows, put on Torpor before trying the 3rd, it MIGHT save your bacon.  Even the best outfitted shaman will likely die to a double shot of flurry.<br />
<br />
I love that zone.  Always a challenge, and the rewards are great.  If you walk thru to PoM, you have a good chance of getting at least 2 'minor' rewards.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Zlexak is nowhere near difficult as people make it out. Only MT should be getting hit by AE. Basically you park him on the edge of a ramp, it has a large hitbox, DPS and other melee fight somewhere on the ramp safe from AE, healers stay around a corner avoiding AE. We killed it with 18 people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Zorlac, wouldn't all the melee attacking from the ramp push Zlexak out of position pretty quick like that? How do you keep Zlexak on the spot at the top of the ramp for a long period of time?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">There is a spot to &quot;pin&quot; Zlexak. A fire pot near a corner to the ramp leading down to the Trio.

You will notice I didn't quote anyone, it was a generalized comment that people think Zlexak is tough because of the AE. <br />
<br />
Oh and we got him easy on our first attempt (after one hour of trying to pull it solo). Thank you for inquiring though. However that doesn't make it hard or &quot;uber&quot; or anything.<br />

Oh and point out where I pound my chest saying you suck and I &quot;pwn&quot;.<br />

Had to get CoH out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Xican</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">&quot;avoiding zlex's ae like that is an exploit...not that i've heard people getting warned/banned over it, but it totally trivializes him and isn't meant to be like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
No, it's not.  It doesn't 'travialize' the encounter at all.  That main tank goes down, and he's gonna ping-pong, and your whole raid is F*cked.<br />
<br />
I'm sure if VI wanted to stop caster's from 'exploiting' to get around AE they would have stopped it by now.  From the time ToV was implemented with Velious people have been exploiting the range of AE's.  From WToV fire pot sitting for casters in armor farming, to the nameds and corner-running, to the NToV named positioning/cornering.<br />
<br />
Granted, they helped to discourage this with rooting some mobs a while back.  It's also by definition an exploit.  However, VI has tolerated it for a year now, and they sure as hell won't be busting anyone's chops for doing it.  Hell, my server's GM hung out with me a while back while in WToV, and she called me a &quot;Pothead&quot; for cowering in the corner.  Then went on to make fun of my zone times.   :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Basically, no it's not an exploit.  As for NToV, oh hell.  I've only been there once, and it was during a faction bug.  Fearing an alternate faction would find and toast me, I didn't get too far.  ;)</div></div><hr />

avoiding zlex's ae like that is an exploit...not that i've heard people getting warned/banned over it, but it totally trivializes him and isn't meant to be like that. <br />
<br />
How many guilds can kill the Cursed in Ssra without Avoiding the AE? How about Aaryonar?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I agree with Zorlac. I didn't perceive his comments on Zlexak to be bragging about how easily he kills it. He was merely pointing out an easier way to do it. If you don't block Zlexak's AE, he is easily the second hardest dragon in north, behind Vyemm.<br />
<br />
As for blocking AE's being an exploit, I strongly disagree. Some mobs are just not possible at all without blocking the AE. Doing Aaryonar with healers/casters standing in AE would pretty much make him unkillable. What's the difference between blocking his AE and blocking Zlexak's AE?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">the difference is that while casters hide around a 90 degree corner to avoid all ae's in ntov, the ramp-trick on zlexak allows melee to hit him with almost full power, AND avoid the ae. that is clearly an exploit. not saying i think you're gimp if you do it, i don't give a ****, but it's not how he's meant to be done.<br />
<br />
he is hard, but not THAT hard even if all melee take ae.<br />
<br />
as for the raid being fuxed if MT dies....well, zlex is slowable and doesn't hit for much, so there's not much risk of that happening.</div></div><hr />
