<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kenlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is very strange. I was playing  on Tuesday just fine, but when I wanted to log in this morning, the game stopped loading midway through getting to the character select screen and I received a message saying something to the effect of &quot;EverQuest has run out of memory and has been forced to stop. Check out everquest.com for help!&quot;. Of course, the site has nothing of help to me. <br />
<br />
I reconfigured my options so that the one model I did have on is now off. No dice. I have 191 RAM on my  computer and that has held me up so far...and help at all? Thanks in advance..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gruog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Bad ram perhaps? Go to www.memtest86.com and download memtest.  It creates a boot floppy.  Boot to floppy and let it run awhile. If you don't get any errors then your good to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Question, did the error message specify whether it was RAM or virtual memory?  If it was ram and it worked before check to see if anything new is loading at startup and eating ram. If you're using Win 95/98/ME use Ctrl-Alt-Del and look to see what's running in the background. After boot up all you need running in the background is Explorer and Systray. Also you might want to run an updated virus scan to make sure you don't have a worm or virus running in the background using resources.  If it's virtual memory check to see if the disk is close to full, if it is windows can't allocate enough disk space for EQ to run and you need to clean up the disk a bit. Good luck. BTW the website Gruog mentioned is excellent and highly recommended for checking RAM, just be prepared to leave it running overnight, software checking of RAM is really, really slow. :)</div></div><hr />
