<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Willowwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wanted to say that it's great not to hear the banter of some of the geeky stuff I heard outside the theater room following the LOTR first installment movie.  I wish some people could just enjoy a movie for it being a good movie.  I loved every minute.  My wife who also loves fantasy who by the way only knows of the story from me and the animated movies thoroughly enjoyed it.  I personally was amazed at the craftmanship and painstaking attention to detail on all the sets, metalworking and tailoring of everything in the movie.  I felt like I was taking a tour of Middle Earth.  I think for 3 hours I had my mouth open in awe the entire time and yes I even cried a few times too. :P<br />
<br />
My only bad thing was after the show walking by the gathering of geeks/purists and hearing the &quot;you know they shoulda blah and blah in this swordfight scene.&quot; I got some of this at work a lot from many people at work :( I guess like they say know matter how hard ya try ya cannah please everyone.  This was one place I was glad to not have heard that and I thank you guys for seeing what I did, that this is what it was a cinematic translation of a story we all grew up with and still enjoy.  I have to say that this movie is the only movie I have ever saw that followed its book to the T in it's storyline and plot.  If Peter Jackson doesn't win every movie award known to man I'm gonna be upset :D</div></div><hr />

I was so close to physically removing him from his seat.</div></div><hr />
