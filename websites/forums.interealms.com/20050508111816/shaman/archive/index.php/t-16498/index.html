<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Yayo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a 65 shaman and a 58 rogue. I think I've been noticing inconsistancies with the LDoN dungeon difficulty(or have I?) at these 2 lvls but kinda wanted you all to give me your input...<br />
<br />
My shaman has 96 AAs, is elemental flagged but has very poor gear for my situation. He has gear that would mediocre on a 55 shaman. My rogue has 3 AAs (run3) and has mediocre gear for his lvl.<br />
My shaman is 7-0 win/loss in LDoN while my rogue is 2-4 win/loses! Those 2 wins on my rogue were down to a couple minutes.<br />
<br />
I have noticed that the people in my rogue's groups seem to make little mistakes. They do stupid things like forget to snare a mob, panic on over-pulls, tanks tagging ALL the mobs on FD pulls and just generally take WAY too much time to get pulls under way. They like to scout to see what's in the next room and I'm keep thinking to myself &quot;just fookin pull already!&quot;. But to be honest, it's to the point where if 4 mobs are inc, we'll most likely wipe!<br />
<br />
On the other hand, my shaman, we can handle ourselves on a 5 mob pulled quite easily. Everyone know's what to do and when. Nobody asks questions on who pulls, who tanks, who's doing CC.. we just do it! Pulls are always inc and there's no downtime whatsover. We usualy finish adventures with 30mins to spare. These include pick-ups groups as well. Oh yeah.. i should mention there's has been zero deaths on these.<br />
<br />
So what is the problem with my rogue's groups? A lack of AAs making a considerably difference? Lack of knowledge of your class pre-65? General stupidity? Not having ever played in heavy trained zones like BoT or KC? Poor gear? Poor buffs? is dungeon difficulty not scaled properly? or perhaps its a culmination of all of the above.<br />
<br />
How has everyone else experienced LDoN in the high 50s? Anything similar to my situation?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tallanas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Experience.<br />
<br />
AAs.<br />
<br />
Gear (other people's since your own is moderate)<br />
<br />
Those are my 3 likely candidates.<br />
<br />
And of course, the best of the lot, luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I kind of had the opposite impression, really.  Well, at least in the 60's range.  My normal group has been sufficiently high enough (65,65,65,65,62,63) that we get the hardest level mobs on normal difficulty.  We've generally fared pretty well, but it's a reasonable challenge.<br />
<br />
Last night, we skewed down a bit (65,65,65,62,60,58) so we got mobs a notch below the top.  We cruised through the dungeons generally in about half of the allotted time.  It was a complete walk in the park compared to the higher one.  HPs were noticably lower, and the mobs hit for about 2/3 of the mobs we were used to fighting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Did you have a shaman in your rogue groups?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Yayo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think Tuffy may have nail it. No i didn't have a shaman in my rogue groups now that I think of it. We always had a slower but it was a chanter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Also the difficualty of the missions is directly related to the levels in your group.  Most everyone knows this so far but not sure alot of people realise the affect one the difficualty.  I think were people are running into alot of problems is that they are forming groups with alot of support classes that are 5-7 levels higher then the front line classes taking the brunt of the NPC contact.  (AKA: Tanks/Meele)  Having one person of a much different level does not ussually change the Average level (used to determin Mob Level) enough to make them harder to kill for the lower levels.  However, one you get 2-3 people that are 4 levels higher then all the rest then the difficualty of the mission starts to increase by alot.  This is most noticeable around the 55-63 level range.  The problem is not so noticable when the groups are top heavy level wise but when the levels are Low level heavy.<br />
<br />
Basicly be careful adding non-melee that are more then 4 levels higher then your highest tank.  Other wise your tank is going be possibly fighting mobs that hit harder then they are able to handle.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Definitely.  I made the mistake of adding a 65 cleric and 62 wiz to our 58/59 group - with me tanking (warrior) at 58.  We survived but didn't win because we didn't have enough dps.  Basically the mobs went from the equivalent of goos in PoD to pest or swamp rats with the occasional crawler thrown in.  <br />
<br />
On the flip side, I got 3.5 blues on that adventure which is pretty sweet for a troll in an hour at 58.  :-)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">One of the things I&#8217;ve discovered is there can be a huge difference in difficulty between camps.  Thus far I&#8217;ve always grouped with the same 61 warrior and 61 necromancer.  So half the party has remained the same.  Five of my first six adventures were from the South Ro camp, fighting frogs, and the other was in Mistmoore.  And my last two adventures were from the East Commons camp.  Since I usually fight in Guk, that&#8217;s what I consider as average.  During my one adventure in Mistmoore I found the mobs to be much harder and packed much closer together.  And our last two adventures from East Commons have proved incredibly easy.  The mobs were not as hard and they were spaced far enough apart that it was difficult to pull more than one or two at a time.  <br />
<br />
We&#8217;ve had levels as high as 65 and as low as 58 in our group and I can honestly say that I haven&#8217;t noticed any difference in the difficulties in our adventures based upon the makeup of our party.  If there was an increase or decrease in difficulty it wasn&#8217;t great enough for me to notice.<br />
<br />
The other factor that has made a great difference in our success is learning a different play style in the adventures.  We no longer take the time to pacify mobs.  We pull as soon as the last mob drops and we deal with however many adds we get.  I&#8217;ve found that when we have party members that know how to play their characters we always do fine.  We once had one mob escape and bring back friends.  I think we had about nine mobs on us at one time, perhaps more.  We each did our jobs, I slowed each one and helped with heals while three of them slowly beat on me, and not a single party member died.  And I must say it was a huge rush.<br />
<br />
However, we&#8217;ve also gotten party members that don&#8217;t know how to play in these adventures and they can really slow you down.  Last night we had a ranger who only wanted to shoot his bow and would run from mobs.  And we had a bard who refused to stop mezing the mobs even after being asked many times not to and to allow our pets to chew up the adds.  Thankfully we were in Rukarkian Hills and the pulls were slow and easy.  Otherwise I think we could have had some deaths.  <br />
<br />
I think these new adventures require people to learn to play their characters differently.  And it requires them to play them well.  If even one group member can&#8217;t carry his/her weight it can cause you to lose the mission and may cause deaths.  Hopefully people will either learn how to play in these dungeons or decide not to enter them at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I agree on Rujark -- I've done 3 runs there so far, and 3 is a rare event on a pull, as opposed to a normal pull for Mistmoore.<br />
<br />
3-4 is normal in Guk too.<br />
<br />
In any case, it goes back to my theory: LDoN is all about the 4-pull.  If your group can handle a 4-pull, you win, because you won't get overwhelmed by mob count, and you don't have to waste time finessing pulls.</div></div><hr />
