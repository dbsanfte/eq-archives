<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draeven</div><div class="date">05-08-2002, 01:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That IS better actually.  Shouldn't aggro nearly as much.  It's a lot easier to jolt off a chain nuked mob than a chain snared mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Olebass</div><div class="date">05-08-2002, 01:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm seems this may have been changed a few days ago, I had it stuck away in bank but found it under the equipment page posted yesterday:(<br />
Oh well, and to me yah, I'll take a damage proc over a snare one anyday if it has to have a proc on it.</div></div><hr />

Sounds like a cool change :)</div></div><hr />

Much better then snare, but ya still have to wonder what pipe verant smokes and why they don't share more often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fadetree</div><div class="date">05-08-2002, 01:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well Y'now, like us, not every single person at SoE can be up on all the class aspects. Some schmuck was given the job of designing that weapon, and figured, hey, Snare, Rangers, right gee I bet theyd like an 00ber blade with one of their own spells on it! Yeah!<br />
Either that, or they saw it as an upside/downside kind of thing to mitigate the high DPS on the weapon. Either way it sucked, of course, given the MOB they put it on. Hey, at least they are listening, and that was pretty fast turnaround for SoE really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Olebass</div><div class="date">05-08-2002, 02:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh and add +3 wis to the 5 for 8 total wis heh</div></div><hr />

<br />
eh maybe not...i have a vision in my head being in beholder maze with a 19 druid nuking with careless, watching the flash and the mob move back a lil bit.  jesus that was ...july - aug 1999 =)<br />
<br />
might be nice to help with interrupts =)</div></div><hr />

Good change, me like. No knockback either. All spell is &quot;Decrease Hitpoints by 94 (L19) to 99 (L24)&quot; with MR check. This is one of our level 39 spells.</div></div><hr />

Which is all this was to calm us level 60 rangers down after the improvements for rogues and making WP worthless.  <br />

<br />
It's amazing how people can harp on one spell FIX and ignore the good things happening at the same time.<br />
<br />
If you want to bitch about something, get on Verant for not fixing our other stackign issues, but stop beating stupid Warder's protection into the ground.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Olebass</div><div class="date">05-08-2002, 02:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree, although still not happy with it overall, it lacks HP's still but its a nice upgrade to those without primal or a horn of hosgra. <br />
The proc means nil to me taunt wise cause I am always nuking in combat anyways in raids.<br />
Wonder with focus what critical nuke is on 99 damage:)]<br />
<br />
Edit , ya has 25 hps still, but 55+ would be dreamy.<br />
I wont gripe though, it will make its way back into my packs once again.</div></div><hr />

Creator dagger got 55hp, mana vs 25 and FT2 range usable<br />

Anything that was proc and caster (Sun rev. hammer, THO thingie etc) seems to be right click and range usable.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Faelagund</div><div class="date">05-08-2002, 04:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I personally like this change as the crippling snare proc, while manageable, was useless. This should put this weapon at about the same level as a baton of flame, and definitely outdamaging primal assuming you have avatar on. I'm curious to see if its worth using swiftwind offhand for the atk and just swapping in primal for the proc now that we lost a bunch of atk with the wp fix, though.</div></div><hr />

Not really...</div></div><hr />

Is it Crippling Snare or is it Careless Lightning? Can anyone post an SS of the Careless Lightning version?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Same as if you cast it yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Feeldary</div><div class="date">05-08-2002, 05:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">another fog to try to make us forget ranger class broken :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Faelagund</div><div class="date">05-08-2002, 06:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How the hell is the ranger class broken? Because we lost 50 or so atk by them fixing our level 60 spell so it sucks? Sure, that spell sucks, but we still do a ton of damage, whether by dual wield, 2h, or archery depending on the situation, and we're able to fix any real weaknesses in our characters via aa points. Yeah we could use a few minor tweaks like fixing WP and a few equipment gaps like some bp/bow upgrades in Luclin, but we are far from broken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elodoron</div><div class="date">05-08-2002, 06:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What do you need  a BP for?<br />
<br />
We need weapons that are on par with those that monks/Rogues get (considering that they are supposed to do more damage)...and not **** that is worse then the stuff Zlexak drops!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nimroc</div><div class="date">05-08-2002, 08:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And even after the wepons choice that are close to nill think once more about WP that get overwritten even on our own spell CoE. <br />
<br />
They did not FIX anything they just took the stacking  bug off. <br />
<br />
Yes it could be seen as an exploit - well for me it was destiny and very good for rangers.<br />
<br />
I lost on my account <br />
ATK 1495 outdoor<br />
Atk 1445 Indoor dmg shield 46 and good reg <br />
to <br />
Atk Outdoor 1420 Wolfform and no FoN anymore<br />
Atk indoor to 1346 Sow and FoN<br />
<br />
And dmg shield  got down to 29 only  well i think this is a lot.<br />
<br />
Why do i have a dmg shield line if i cant use it anymore???<br />
<br />
Some can think that this were never meant to be - i may ask why not?<br />
I still dont think that our both best buffs (lvl 60) why should not both stack? Well if they should not, then give me a new Buff -<br />
alltogether a new one, or two. And shaft these two where ist is so dark they cant see when they are naked.<br />
/Rude Verant<br />
<br />
This is just a game i agree but if u think about all that stuff - why should or best Buffs dont stack??? Why give it altogether? <br />
<br />
<br />
Well get their boys to do the work that they get PAID for<br />
<br />
This is stupid - verant does not like rangers - or at least does not l like it as they like over Mellee Classes.<br />
<br />
And i think we should send them some info on that.<br />
<br />
And Sunmoon i believe that he is just leaving up to u when he decides to send some Info to Verant - it is the same u did a while ago! So  why do u flame him on that? It was not necessary at all. <br />
He has a right to his own opinion. IMHO even if u dont like it.<br />
U know why? Becvause if u worked very hard on your life, working hard to earn anything - do u think your children that gets more easy  from your perspective do believe they have it more easy? really ?- if u do u should know that u are  plain wrong.<br />
<br />
If they dont know, saw , experince, the sky as blue , how will  they  believe u? As such is his experience, and concerns now as valid as yours were long time ago.<br />
And no comparison will change in anyway his feeling about the ranger nerf this night brought.<br />
<br />
And it was a nerf IMHO too.<br />
<br />
<br />
/rant off</div></div><hr />

My opinion is that they couldn't find anything else to put on it.  I'd have preferred a small lifetap to the DD anyday.</div></div><hr />
