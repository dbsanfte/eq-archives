<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">anyone done this?  I'm wanting to try this soon, tonight maybe.  if anyone has any tips I'd appreciate it greatly!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">we've done it 1-2 groups, take a chanter or two, aggro the gnome when stuff pops so he doesn't walk off.  With POP mez's, I think you can mez everything in there now, the brown ones have a very annoying AE, doesn't do much damage I don't think, but a hard to resist slow.<br />
<br />
Follow, kill, repeat.  After being in POP, I'm sure you'll think CT is really easy now.  the last mob drops an item, a feather I think, follow gnome back to center and hand it to him, yields 1 droppable loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kieran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Only tip is that like - the n0me in PoI - if anyone gets in front of him at all, he's likely to warp, get killed, and thus waste a lot of everyone's time. <br />
<br />
Shrink everyone, and threaten them with bodily dismemberment unless they get their asses to the wall when the chanter calls the mem blur.<br />
<br />
Once you've dealt with an ambush, don't just blur the n0me straight away, take the time to pull ahead (if you don't know where ahead is yet, just pull any nearby rooms) to save having to constantly aggro/blur the n0me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Enapay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Did it with one group yesterday all of us lvl 65.  The main thing is to not lose the gnome.  He does not have many hps and will die quick if you let him get away.  As the shaman slow him and let him beat on you until all the mobs are dead.  When walking to the next stop have him targeted so if you get an agro you can cast on him so he does not get away from the group. Blurr him and move on to the next stop.  Only bad thing to look out for is the brown lizards spawning as you kill the other mobs.  They can spawn on top of the cleric or chanter and kill them quick.  At the end the gnome sometimes warps into the platform.  AE slow and get him out of there then blurr him to turn in the quiver.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>hdaana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">did this the other night and he poofed at the end. dropped a petition and the gm said that it is bugged sorry you wasted your time. . . . . gotta love ubah CS</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Did him with 5 people (2 of them 2 boxed), all 65.  Is pretty easy with pop out.  We had the same problem first time, got the feather, gnome started walking ... poof.  Guides kept telling me for over a week to keep petitioning for a gm, finally I happened to see one in the bazaar and just sent a /tell, after 10 minutes of bs, &quot;sorry I can't do anything.&quot;  Supposedly they fixed him up a little last patch, but I hear several other things didn't work in the patch either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have done Gimlik a dozen times or so on Quellious, usually with one group.<br />
<br />
Tips for Gimlik - you want 2 tanks, a mezzer, cleric and shaman (in my opinion). I have only done this at level 60, I have not attempted it since PoP and leveling to 65 - so it is probably easier now.<br />
<br />
The biggest keys to gimlik are recognizing the ambushes that he spawns and reacting appropriately asap. Learn where things will spawn and have your tanks standing in the right spot to get initial aggro. If the ambush jumps on the wrong person first, your success chances go way down.<br />
<br />
Ambushes he can spawn:<br />
<br />
5-6 mobs level 55ish (enchanter AE mez handles)<br />
4-5 mobs level 56ish (enchanter AE mez does not handle)<br />
3-4 mobs level 57ish (enchanter AE mez does not handle)<br />
1-2 mobs level 60ish (unmezzable at least with pre-PoP mezzes)<br />
<br />
All of the mobs have the same name and spawn on top of each other - so targeting for mez and slow is a pain.<br />
<br />
Tigir's Insects is fantastic for this event, I suggest keeping it mem'd. Group elixer from your cleric right as the ambush spawns helps a ton also.<br />
<br />
The ambush's with 5+ mobs are the tough ones. If you control those with Tigir's, mez, and group elixer then you will have no trouble. Which ambushs you get seems totally random. We have gotten 1 mob ambush's 3 times in row, and have also gotten 6 mob ambush's multiple times in a row. So - you can get lucky on this event or get unlucky.<br />
<br />
As shaman, my job was also to aggro Gimlik with Turgur's and tank him for most of the fight. This prevents him from wandering off and gettng killed while we are still fighting. Atone or Memblur once fight is complete.<br />
<br />
Pre-clearing his path through the maze is advisable.<br />
<br />
You only get one item as your reward. We seem to always get the 10 wis/100 mana earring or the FT1 range item - which sucks because we were always hoping for the 100 hp earring or the gloves that gate to nexus.<br />
<br />
Feel free to give me a tell on Quellious if you would like to discuss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">A tip for those interested in tradeskills, as the brown lizards he spawns drop items at a greater rate.<br />
<br />
You can respawn the ambushes by telling him &quot;I am ready&quot;. This will port him back to the spire and he will begin walking. Also handy if you fear you screwed up horribly and want to try again, as it wipes his aggro list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">thanks for the advice guys, i really appreciate it.  Ximix, I'll try to contact you in game.</div></div><hr />
