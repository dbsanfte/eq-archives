Be patient on this tragedy...I personnally accept this terrorist attack as an attack on my home...my family.  Why?  Because this this country is my home, the american people are my family.  I ask you to consider doing everything possible to take care of those that need the help first...retribution will come at a later time.<br />
<br />
Turn the anger into compassion for those that were directly affected by these terrorist actions.  Know that there are many people out there that want &quot;payback&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Remember...even as Kahn from Star Trek pointed out, &quot;Revenge is a dish that is best served cold.&quot;  To be very honest...this is not even about revenge.  This is about the blatant killing of citizens of a country that were non combattants and on a very large scale.  If I could turn my rage into phsyical force, I would be at ground zero of a thermo nuclear explosion.<br />
<br />
Alas, I wont let my feelings get the best of me.  Sleep well tonight keepers.  They will know fear as we have known loss.<br />
<br />
Always your friend in Norrath and in the US<br />
