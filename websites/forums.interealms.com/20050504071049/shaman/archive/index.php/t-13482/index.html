<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Asraguard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey Guys/Gals,<br />
<br />
Just wondering on the usefulness of this AA. So those of you that have it can you answer me a few questions please.<br />
<br />
(1) Is there a reuse time on this ability or can you Suspend and Resummon your pet anytime and as many times as you want as long as you stay in the same zone?<br />
<br />
(2) If you get one of those annoying situations where you cannot get your pet off a mob then can you just Suspend it to save it from dying?<br />
<br />
(3) If your pet is DoTed/debuffed then does Suspending it remove all those affects?<br />
<br />
(4) Whats the cast time on Suspend Minion?<br />
<br />
(5) I take it that once your pet is Suspended that you can invis yourself and still be able to Resummon it later?<br />
<br />
(6) Once you have your pet Suspended is their a buff slot used (or anything anything else) to indicate that you have a Suspended pet?<br />
<br />
Cheers,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sariash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1) No reuse time<br />
<br />
2) Suspend Minion doesn't Work if Pet is on Somethings Hatelist (like Summon Companion)<br />
<br />
3) no idea, have never tested it<br />
<br />
4) 4 seconds<br />
<br />
5) yes<br />
<br />
6) no Buffslot used or anything else... have to remember suspended pet :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Asraguard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hey Sariash,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the speedy response :) . Think I'm gonna have to put this on my list of AA to get. I like the sounds of no reuse time and unlimited uses whilst in the same zone!<br />
<br />
Cheers,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'd love this AA skill if it worked across zones. As it is its fairly limited in its usefulness; although I'd have liked it doing the wind camp in BoT.<br />
<br />
3) Is an interesting one. I know the 2nd level skill preserves buffs, and so I'd assume that'd include dots too.... but I'm only guessing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Sounds like a great AA skill that I hadn't really thought about before. Thanks for the questions, and answers. :)<br />
<br />
Sounds like it would be useful if you solo in a tricky to get to and break spot. Summon pet, buff up, then regain mana, suspend and go invis. Then get to camp spot, and get the pet back in 4 seconds and no extra mana, rather than the horrid cast time and mana use normally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">lvl 1 doesn't save &quot;positive&quot; effects (buffs) but it DOES save &quot;negative&quot; effects.<br />
<br />
also remember... you can suspend a pet and summon another and have 1 for back up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Is nice aa, I have suspended minion 2. Not everyones taste to buy it but for my style of play it was well worth it.  Its pretty quick cast time, well in comparison to summoning a pet from new. You can suspend any time as long as pet is not distracted.  Also you can have a pet out and a pet in suspense. The pet in suspense with suspended minion 2 will hold the buff timer in there, so for example you could cast haste on it suspend it, and when it bring it out again the haste countdown would rebegin. It is highly useful to me but again depends on your style of play it could be 100% useless and it is a fair few points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">has anyone tested whether a suspended minion retains project alpha? be a good way to save on some nice weapons to give it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">im pretty sure it does if i remember past conversations hrothgar.<br />
<br />
Id get this AA if only they would let you keep the pet when you zone. Till then its low on my AA list still.</div></div><hr />

Suspend Minion 3 keeps all equipment and buffs.</div></div><hr />
