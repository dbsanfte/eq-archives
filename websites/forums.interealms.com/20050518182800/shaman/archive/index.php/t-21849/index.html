<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">GoD was rolled out with an incomplete class thats still broken. It marginalized many classes by bringing back the almighty holy trinity. Its spell distribution model is absolutely the worst of any expansion. Any guild slogging through to the end was met by a brick wall of broken content. And the real kicker is, it was designed for level 70.<br />
<br />
I personally feel anyone who purchased GoD should receive a free copy of Omens as a way of saying &quot;I'm sorry&quot; for such a half assed expansion, as well as the horrible collision problems we've had over the past few months.<br />
<br />
Its all well and good for John Smedley to apologize for giving us garbage. Some flowers and chocolate might be nicer.</div></div><hr />

I read where Hyundai is giving out debit cards to people who bought their cars because they overstated the HP by like 2-5% or something.  ***, that is a sorry.  Granted, a car is more expensive than this game, but holy hell, why should we have to pay for GoD(broken) and OOW(probably broken).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">At the very least a discount on OoW for all GoD buyers would smooth some ruffled feathers. A lot of EQ players have very limited budgets, from my experience.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Sony is in a bit of a squeeze because W.O.W. will be making its appearance sometime soon.  They can wait and roll the next expansion out afterw W.O.W. debuts, thus giving their customers a better product, or they push it out like a mother delivering a baby and give us the usual bug-infested, further-separating-the-players, raid fest we've come to know and expect.<br />
<br />
I will buy W.O.W. I will also buy O.O.W.  <br />
<br />
Which one I play (and it will be only one) will be determined by a multitude of factors none of which relate to how &quot;good&quot; the game looks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Would it be nice? Yes<br />
<br />
Likelyhood of it happeneing? About as good as Nader winning the presidential election.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well I am certainly not going to save myself 30-40 stupid dollars by NOT buying the newest expansion to the game I have played for 5.5 years. Not when I have a BUTTLOAD of 30-60 dollar &quot;investments&quot; gathering dust on my shelves. <br />
<br />
That being said, I would like to see them price OoW at 25 bucks, as a gesture of &quot;good faith&quot; to all of us. <br />
<br />
However, I am also buying WoW, since it might just be &quot;The One&quot;. <br />
<br />
Shrug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">My guild raids, so its almost a requirement, but...  Anyone besides me NOT looking forward to grinding levels again?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">In a way, I am.  And I'll definitely be buying OoW.  <br />
<br />
I have this pathetic hope that OoW will something like Kunark.  I remember being one of the first guys in a lot of Kunark zones, exploring new things with a crew of friends.  It was awesome.  <br />
<br />
Velious was sorta like that, but Siren's Grotto was so frigged up on Velious release that there was a limit.  <br />
<br />
Luclin was just ugly.  With no loots. <br />
<br />
I want a Kunark expansion with loots.  OoW seems like it might be that sort of thing, but they got to do better on the spell distribution models and on a host of other things.  <br />
<br />
GoD was unquestionably a disaster, but it was PoP progression that wrecked the most long term damage on EQ.  It had a lot of highlights, but the fundamental design principle was stupid.  <br />
<br />
EQ is still the best though, and it's not even close with current contenders.  <br />
<br />
We'll see about WoW, but the cartoony characters suck so they have a problem right off the bat from my prespective.  Like Faern, I'll buy it and try it.  <br />
<br />
For me, the EQ magic remains formidable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">sadly, i feel like that magic is the old school magic of what the game used to be, not what it is now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">most unfortunatly, it will probably become necessary to get the friggin expansion if I want to be of any use to my guild.  Do I want to get it?  #&amp;$% NO!  I dont want to pay for it because of how horrible GoD's content was in comparison to the rest of EQ before it, even PoP was 100% better than GoD, at least it was original.  I like the idea of either those who paid for GoD getting OoW free, OR at least like a 50% discount, we deserve it for paying for the messed up and broken content of GoD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is only so much wow factor that graphics can have.  Before I started playing EQ I was really concerend with how games looked; now Im more concerned with content than looks.  EQ2 has a few nice looks to it (though the Erudites are just fugly) but I have serious questions to its gameplay.  WoW looks cartoony, but Im betting that its going to be a much more solid model than recent EQ expansions.<br />
<br />
That said, there is alot to be said for good graphics.  Take CoH as an example.  Game play (from what I hear) is fun, but the level of character customization is bordering on insanely cool.  That goes a long way I think.<br />
<br />
Im undecided yet as to whether Im getting OOW or not.  Ive bought every expansion faithfully up till this point.  In fact, Ive bought every expansion except GoD twice; once was enough with that cluster****.  However my interest in EQ has waned in the last few months.  Ive logged in twice over the last 4 days, and the second time it was for about 10 minutes untill I realized that there wasnt anything I felt like doing.  As someone that has been stalled at tier 3 of PoP since early 2003 theres not much reason to log in anymore.  Run another adventure?  Not likely, Ive seen every model and map that LDoN has to offer and its not interesting anymore.  GoD?  Sure, I can solo some of it, but thats all because even people Ive known and grouped with for years would still prefer a beastlord to what I can bring.<br />
<br />
If I do buy Omens it wont be upon release.  Im going to do research and get feedback before I throw any more money at Sony for an expansion.  I just did some quick figures and Ive spent more than $1400 on subscription fees and expansions since June 2000 when I bought EQ.  For more of my money, Sony has to inpress me.  Big time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">If they stick our class &quot;fixes&quot; in it and charge cash, then I will retire.  Just about the last ethical straw for me really.<br />
<br />
I am actually starting to enjoy GoD, but my guild thankfully took a huge timeout on new content when GoD released.  Hell yeah, OoW should be free.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I'm waffling on buying OoW, and for me it hinges on one thing.<br />
<br />
What levels is it aimed at? If it's another level 65 Elemental ++ expansion, no, I'm not going to waste my money on it.<br />
<br />
If, however, it has at the VERY least a PoP level range (46+) with rational encounters (please, no more level 40 mobs that hit for 300!), then I'll probably go ahead and get it on both accounts</div></div><hr />

<br />
You must be joking man. This is SOE we are talking about. You know... The ppl who cranked out expanisons like they were going out of style. These ppl want to squeeze out every penny out of you and you think they will ever give u anythign for free? C'mon. Smarten up. The only way to stop this is to pay with your wallet. Don't buy it. I mean what is the point. Eq is enormous. Where else do u need to go? Have u been to every zone? Do you have all the AA's you want? What is the point of it all? Oh yeah a couple of UBER zones soem more AA's to grind and more untouchable spells and items YAY. Le't shell out another 30 bucks for it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I've been playing since the game went gold back in '99.  I'm not in a raiding guild and I don't enjoy the end game much, but I do still enjoy logging on and playing.  When OoW was released I held off buying it for a while to see how it was going to shake out, by time I had gotten around to ordering it Sony had already &quot;accidentally&quot; charged my credit card with the expansion. A LOT of people here had the same problem. I have no intention of ordering GoD but if they accidentally charge me up with it again I will immediately cancel my account and lodge a complaint with my credit card company and the BBB.  If I feel I can't trust a company with my credit card I will indeed take my money elsewhere regardless of whether I enjoy the game or not.  They are on the hairy edge right now with a large chunk of their customer base, I hope they have enough wisdom to understand now is not a good time to screw around with their customers .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Sony making something free ?  :rolleyes:  Bah remember LoY ! They even sold LFG tool...<br />
<br />
        OoW will be as bad as GoD , i  sympathize with those who will buy it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Why not just wait a month or two?  By then, there will be 2 or 3 more expansions out, and Omens will be free via a trial account.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Moglyzok Moogleman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Personally, I'm an Optimist, and with all my heart hope that OoW turns out to be a pleasant suprise, but my brain tells me in the back it will turn out to just be another juicy expansion full of nothing worthwhile....<br />
<br />
I'll probably get it, I'll probably know I got it, I may regret paying for it, but hell I know no matter how horrible GoD would seem, I'd say I still have some fun it in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I'm very wary of buying OoW for its content, but I'll admit, the raising of the level cap does pique my interest.<br />
<br />
I'll probably buy it, but IF and ONLY IF the 66-70 spells aren't locked away in raid zones or are otherwise extremely hard to get.<br />
<br />
I bought LoY specifically for the expanded bank (though I was pleasantly surprised...I'm one of the few who actually LIKES the LoY zones), and I'll probably buy OoW specifically for the new level cap.<br />
<br />
Because I solo so much, I'd say I'll buy OoW immediately if the level 66 spells are easily obtainable...new pet spell at 66 = more effective soloing.<br />
<br />
I've already got my xp bar maxed, so probably I'd ding off the first healthy DB mob I face.  Buy expansion, ding, buy 66 spells, go give brand new dogdog a workout...I could go for that.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I will buy it.<br />
<br />
But I am not happy about it.<br />
<br />
It is the only viable means of advancing for my small guild. Even if it is raid only content. level 70 will allow us to do more with less. (After grinding away of course) <br />
<br />
Once my guild gets done farming ferubi. Heh farming. Yeah right. 2 group runs into there and we havnt done it is a week cause fo playtimes have not been working out. More like gardening. (Sigh))<br />
<br />
Then we have The sewers and Tipt and vxed. Once we get done with that they we run into the brick wall I belive. When it requires more than 12 people on a regular basis I am out of viable options.<br />
<br />
Ahh well. here is to hoping Wow comes out soon and somehow I can migrate folks over to it. Or make a new base of friends. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Once you get the trials, Snoww, KT opens up, and that should keep you busy for a long time. There is tons of gear there, spells, good Xp, etc. Its a solid zone for a skilled player, even if their gear is &quot;less than optimal&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Heh thanks for the encoragement. But skilled player doesnt matter much when stuff kills your warrior in 4 seconds. <br />
<br />
We don't need skill sadly. We need gear. But can't get much of it without raids. The gear we can get with 2 groups the raiders can go in and farm with an alt group who are better geared with thier mains. That or farm with a 3 box setup for alts and such. <br />
<br />
The only real upgrades come from mindless LDON farming. Or a fun run through ferubi that nets us one upgrade for one person in 4 hours time IF we are lucky and a gear dropping mob is up. <br />
<br />
Ahh well. Such is the game. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Didn't they say that they rushed GOD out for the 5th year anniversary, and when they could not include everything, they gave us a partial release?  This means that part of what we paid for GOD is actually in OOW.  We should definately get a discount, or at least get OOW free.<br />
<br />
What's OOW gonna do for me anyway?  Level 70 will only trivalize LDoN.  Imagine all your adventures with light blue mobs...<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, imagine doing that without all your GOD and OOW spells...<br />
<br />
-Fin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Finn,  you just got me thinking about LDoN's at 70... wonder how they will be implemented.  I think i read a quote from SoE somewhere that said you woudn't need to do any AA to get to 70... So.... How will LDoN's at 66+ be implemented, they can't do what they did before and have the hard be 1 average level step up, beucas there is no way a baz geared/low AA group could handle a current hard ldon if that's what they got for an average group of level 66...  <br />
<br />
Also wonder how many points will be given for an adventure.  If you got the points for a 65 hard, but it was easier the 1496 drops will become very easy to get.  If it gets harder and points don't scale people will have issues, if it doesn't scale even worse issues from lower xp/adv...<br />
<br />
I don't know, i just see a large can'o'worms here.<br />
<br />
I think the best bet is to keep the current scaling on content, ignoring hards at 65, give more points and introduce a new set of armor /shrug but that's just me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Fact of the matter is. I will continue to purchase what ever expansion they put out. Good, Crap or other.<br />
<br />
At least until I find something I like better, then I'll never buy/play the game again.</div></div><hr />
