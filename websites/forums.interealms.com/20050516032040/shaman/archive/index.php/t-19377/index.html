<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Haed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Or duo with a bard?<br />
<br />
If so, what strategies would one use?<br />
<br />
Neither myself nor the bard are beyond bazaar equipped.<br />
<br />
I'm 65. Bard is currently 44 but could be as high as 65 before the attempt.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts?<br />
<br />
I've searched the internet exhaustively, but finding solo/duo guides for Trak has been unprofitable.<br />
<br />
Thanks all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Trakanon banishes, has an AE and is pretty much unslowable, so that will make him a pretty difficult shaman solo.<br />
<br />
You can sit down and get summoned back from the banish point but the agro you get when banished will catch up to you when the mobs (shrooms, juggs and frogs) come training back to trak's lair.  I've seen it happen.<br />
<br />
Trakanon also runs when low on health.  After running a bit, sometimes he will gate back to his spawn and regain HPs.<br />
<br />
I'd say don't risk your bards epic pieces, get some friends to help you.+<br />
<br />
I hear two Shadowknights with all their Harmtouch AA can duo him.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I highly doubt it.<br />
<br />
Bring some friends.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You don't lose the bard epic pieces when you fail. Believe me. I failed on Trak twice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">but finding solo/duo guides for Trak has been unprofitable<br />
<br />
Heh, finding guides for something very few people have done is usually tough =)<br />
<br />
SK on my server has solo'd trak a few times, would seem to be more pain than it's worth though.  I don't think a shaman could do it.  You could probably duo it with the bard, but it'd take some testing out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I can't remember ever landing slow on trakanon.  He never lives long enough to give me more than 3 or 4 attempts, though.  An early slow would be 100% required to win, since he hits pretty hard and has a nasty proc.  Also, don't forget his dot.  I don't know if it will land on a well geared 65 shaman with Tali of Tribunal, but I remember that dot used to own me.  He banishes, but if you just sit down after banish you'll get summoned right back.  It doesn't clear aggro.<br />
<br />
Honestly, at this point, I don't think it is possible for us.  Maybe by the time GoD is beaten, we'll be able to do it but I think he is just too tough.  I do know a paladin that has done it, in addition to all the other kunark dragons.  Trak is undead, right?  Multiple SU3 crits for 5k+ will drop a 32k mob FAST.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">yeah, i wasn't able to slow trak the other day after several attempts at him (these were just me, chanter and cleric attempts, not solo attempts).  I do have a SK in my guild (Erodalak) who used to solo him frequently.  He isn't of course always able to do it every time, but he can do it and I've seen him do it before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Burzlaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">A bard and I duoed him.  Just had the bard FM/lull pull him to where he banishes you so you dont have to take that into consideration, then open up a can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">hmm I need to get me a SK then ... I want his tooth for VP key ... yea I know it's old but I want to got to every zone before I quit hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Karmie on the Nameless server solos him.  65 SK with full Time gear and a bad ass style.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">a druid has done it as well from a post I saw on the druid's grove, it's so much easier to just take a group of friends though</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Solo at this point in the game I say No. Duo with a 44 bard, agine No. Duo with a SK or Pal is doable tho providing they are 65 with good gear AA's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Haven't been able to land the slow either on Trak, but that's because he dies faster then I can get the slow off (target + cast + casting delay). Generally Trak dies within 5 seconds.<br />
<br />
As for soloing, then here are listed some reasons, which would make it very hard. Not saying impossible, never know. But with couple of friends? Sure, definately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Not shaman soloable I would think ... nerf SKs (KIDDING!!!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The thing is, with a mob like that, you need instant DPS, which is something the shaman class is utterly devoid of.  We just don't have any tricks to compensate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Zunayn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">its possible soloing if u clear banish room them pull him there, only problem would be him gating or running as we dont have anything other than spirit call to interupt him<br />
<br />
with bard it should be easier as u can mezz a shroom underneath him and he wont run<br />
<br />
and yea ive did it with 2 other people with this method but its definatly doable with 2</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I still want to see you channeling Heals and Nukes(DoTs won't land) worth 32k. 2 people can do it np, since the healer can heal without the need to channel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Maivia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">to deal with the aggro part of the banishment, try getting the shaman ring from sky first ? after trak summons you back just click it and say goodbye to aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">That ring isn't exactly easy to get. I can't see it being worth it just to solo Trakanon.<br />
<br />
You'd be better off pulling him to the banish location, as other people have mentioned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">The difficulty of getting the ring is kinda overrated, you can easily do the quest with one group or so.<br />
<br />
However, the best way to do this is to get lucky with an early Trak-Touch to the banish area which you have cleared earlier then stand there until Trak + train reaches you. Then you just need to fd (gating and then running back works too probably) and let everything but trak reset (trak will corpse-camp you).<br />
<br />
After that you just pop up again and un-suspend your pet and hopefully kill him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">The difficulty of getting the ring is kinda overrated, you can easily do the quest with one group or so.<br />
<br />
<br />
Or, you could bring that one group (or so) to kill Trakanon in 1/100th the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Sure, you could do that too, but that isn't what this thread is about. Also, the ring is very useful for other things too.</div></div><hr />

didn';t they also make that ring rechargeable as well?<br />
<br />
If not, 3 charges is too stingy for me to bother with this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">that isn't what this thread is about<br />
<br />
Well, the subject of the thread is very general, so on the one hand you can answer the question: &quot;is it possible for a shaman to solo Trakanon?&quot;<br />
<br />
However, Haed clearly has a specific desire to kill Trak for his 44 bard friend/alt, so I think it's worth discussing the practicality of a shaman doing so. So, sure, the FD ring may make killing Trak possible, but the effort to get that ring - the need for a group in particular - makes it impractical.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">didn';t they also make that ring rechargeable as well?<br />
<br />

<br />
Yes, it's rechargable with mana battery class 5 + box of the void.<br />
<br />
It has 2 charges btw.</div></div><hr />
