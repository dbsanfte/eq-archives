<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>grader</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, Id like to get some opinions on this.<br />
<br />
Basically from what Ive seen everything in PoP is pretty difficult for a warrior to maintain sufficient aggro. Im talkin about exp groups such as PoS , PoV. It seems to me Sk's , Pallies, and yes even Rangers ( flame lick, entrap) enable a group to tash, malo, slow every mob on incoming while snared. All casters I know tell me they have no apprehensions about casting those spells &quot;early&quot; when a hybrid is tanking but when its a warrior they  hold their breath. Lots of groups I know prefer to use a hybrid to tank these days due to this.<br />
Personally I think its terrible that a warrior has such issues keeping aggro since its pretty much their only duty. A possible solution Id suggest is for EQ to give warriors a &quot;shout&quot; type hotkey such that would provide them with some aggro point increase similar to some of these hybrid spells. I love flame lick  as much as anyone but casting a level nine spell and pulling off a level 65 warrior and jolting it back onto him just for laughs is and should be embarrassing to a class thats meant to do nothing but tank. Some taunt love is in order for Warriors Imho....<br />
<br />
Anyone agree? disagree?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Quebelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Warrior aggro has gotten better lately, but I agree that there is still alot of room for improvements.  A group I was in the other day asked me to tank over a 61 warrior because when I was doing it I never lost aggro when they cast, but he had a hard time holding it.  I definately think something is wrong when a 55 ranger is requested over a 61 warrior.  <br />
What can be done to improve thier taunting abilities is questionable though.  Maybe a button marked toe-stomp or one labled kick-below-the-belt that doesn't do any damage, but acts as an additional taunt button. :D  Seriously though, something probably should be done, but most likely it 'is working as intended.'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>RangerKeaianea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The main reason this is the case is because Warriors rely on building up aggro.  Flame lick, stun, SK debuffs are instant hate bringers.  AE taunt is a warrior AA, but can only be used once every 15 minutes and it is AE, so can be bad...  LOL  Warriors have been calling the Taunt key broken for a LONG time.  Yeah, they are due some sort of way to gain taunt quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Elwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Agree that Warriors don't have much in the way of ability to gain aggro quickly, but disagree that a hybrid is necessary.. often, root is sufficient enough for the mob to stay on one person in particular.. and almost every class in the game can root.

<br />
Root is not an answer.Many mobs cannot be rooted/snared/mezzed blah blah in PoP.<br />
<br />
Fact is with 500+ hitting mobs you need someone who can get and hold agro fast.And thats not warriors.There a few,very few,warriors I trust to handle MA duties in PoP xp groups and they are never on when I need them haha.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Viken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I agree. I always look for PAL or SK to tank instead of a warrior. Heck, I even prefer myself to tank because as you said, having the mob snared and slowed before it hits anyone is a major plus. The exception would be only the highest end warriors with 7k+hp and AoW + Ssra weapons. It's just not fair to them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Aizle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I find very few Warriors that can out agro me, unless I *really* gimp my damage output.  It also seems to me that mobs bounce around to the casters a hell of a lot more when the Warriors tanks as well.  Personally, I LOVE having paladins as the MT.  Stun is a great agro generator, and with KEI so mana is rarely and issue.<br />
<br />
The main problem with Warriors is that they are completely and totally gear dependant.  If they haven't been anal about getting the absolutely best weapon that they can, they will probably never keep agro.  Similarly, if they are lower level than I am, unless they have WAY uber items, I'll get agro unless I gimp myself.<br />
<br />
Personally, I would like to see things such as Bash, Kick and Taunt have more of a taunt effect to them for Warriors.<br />
<br />
Warriors are unfortunately a love-hate class to play.  You need 2-3 really decent warriors for a raid (Paly's and SK's can sometimes work, sometimes not) however they really bring very little to an exp grind group.  Palys or SKs tank better in those situations and are more versitile on top of it.</div></div><hr />

outtaunting your tank because you don't want to take the 1 second every 15 to cast jolt is kinda counterproductive if you ask me.  I'm sure the wizard could get aggro off the tank too, but that'd be kinda foolish.<br />

yes we taunt well and can hold aggro well, but we also have more than enough means to control it to the point you shouldn't be outtaunting a war unless you want to, or he's an ebaymonkey with a big 2hander and no taunt key.</div></div><hr />

We shouldn't have to spend 60 mana every 15 seconds (240 per minute, 14,400 per hour) in an experience group to keep a mob off us. It is extremely ineffecient, especially if you are the puller with no time to med. Even with KEI that's a -100 mana deficit per minute, 6,000 per hour.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zolina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">They should make a warrior item with clickable Tangling Weeds on it.  That'd help them hold aggro a lot better.  Or just lower the refresh time on AoE taunt.</div></div><hr />

That's why Jolting Blades is good.<br />
<br />
Personally I've had no probs grouping with a warrior tanking, but the warriors have always understood their role and chosen weapons that have high-aggro procs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Voronwë Nimbrethil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">depends on how well equipped your guild is.  BoC's etc....<br />
<br />
at any rate though, it is very tough for a warrior to hold agro compared to a SK/Pal, but i have to say if you are getting agro away from a warrior non-stop in an xp group, that is your fault.<br />
<br />
part of a warrior holding agro is rog/monk/rgr and casters managing their hate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>decairn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The agro a warrior gets is for the most part dependant on the weapons they have, good weapons help in a big way, more so than the hybrids who have their own spell powers to get instant agro.  With SoD, BoC, BF level weapons its not really an issue.  If your warrior doesn't have something of this caliber then it's your job to help them keep agro. Just count to 10 before engaging.  Use jolting blades for 'free' agro reducers, and supplement with a manual jolt if it isn't procing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>lotholeaffall2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Monks/rangers/rogues do a pretty good job avoiding agro IMO. And if they happen to get agro, they will take a couple of hits, then lose it np. The problem at hand is for slowers/debuffers in general. If you have a pally tanking, the shaman/chanter (specially chanter) is not afraid to land a slow asap. With a warr, well, prepare yourself for pingpong...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gwindor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Warriors are better tank choices even with agro issues for many reasons (mainly defensive what an awesome disc) for many encounters. That said, it is absurd that warriors have the most trouble doing the ONE THING they are asked to do: hold the agro and get beat on.<br />
<br />
Here is my proposed solution that i fedback a long time ago: 5min timer disc called Summon. Summon would have 2 affects: 1) wherever nearby the mob had run off to (to beat on a caster maybe), they mob would be summoned back to the warrior in a normal manner (we've all been summoned before) 2) the summon disc should have a hate component to it, and it should be HUGE since it is on a timer'd disc. enough that 2 or 3 snares isn't going to ping pong off the summon (you can only use it every 5 min anyway). This would solve the issue of taunt (with the increased agro) AND allow warriors to mitigate the negative affects of ping ponging (by bringing the mob back into appropriate position). Probably went into a heaping /dev/null full of great suggestions from all kinds of whackos like me =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Valencia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">/agree grader<br />
<br />
In PoP zones, as a puller with a warrior MT, I will usually get knocked down a couple of bubs of health -- even with Jolting Blades on and using Jolt.  With a Pally/SK MT, I rarely get hit.  There's a very noticeable difference.  Its also nice to pull with TW, but with a warrior MT, you just get beat on too much, so pulling with Jolt makes more sense.  Of course then the slowers are usually aggroed.<br />
<br />
I would like to see the Warrior Taunt skill increased significantly so it can generate as much hate as hybrid spells.  Also, perhaps giving them a SHOUT/WARCRY skill which generates spell-like aggro and allows them to do a &quot;ranged&quot; taunt would also be a great addition for warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>grader</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I was mainly talking about the effiency of a group with a hybrid as oppsed to a warrior not the ability of a ranger to keep or not keep aggro, its a given we can. Its just all out nukes and debuffs though when its a hybrid with no threat whatsoever of the mob leaving the Hybrid. With a warrior however its a cautious walkthrough of the debuffs , slows alot later than what is able to be done with a Hybrid. That is what needs to be fixed with warriors. I can shoot arrows all day and cast frozen wind every refresh in an exp group with a Sk tanking or a Pally, but with a warrior nearly even the very First frozen wind i pull aggro. Even casting a snare with the mob half dead pulls aggro lots of times. This brings down the effective dps of the groups as a whole and costs more mana  ( downtime ) haveing to do slowing at a slower rate. I know its nothing extreme but i just wish warriors would get something to fix this,  i like the idea of being able to summon lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Fufinski</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I think grader is right in that generally a hybrid tank works better for the debuffing of mobs in PoP.  However a warrior is a better tank.  I have found you can help the warrior manage agro for the debuffing cycle.  In one particular group we had a monk pulling.  The war would engage the mob while the shaman would be standing a little distance off.  The shaman would slow and the mob would head off towards the shaman.  I would stand my ground and throw a tangling weeds on the mob which would almost always bring it walking back to me with one cast.  While the mob was walking back to me the war would be beating it and taunting.  If he did not have agro by the time it reached me one jolt was usually enough to make it forget me.  This all sounds a bit timeconsuming but in reality took moments on incoming to get the mob slowed and interested in the warrior.<br />
<br />
As for warrior taunt ability I do wish there was a warrior usable RC item with tangling weeds on it.  It would make life easier for us all :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
  I was under the impression this is exactly what it did when it worked, and why it's broken.<br />
<br />
  It puts you one point above whoever is the top of the hatelist if it succeeds, and if it's you, it does nothing.<br />
<br />
  So if a warrior pushes taunt while he's getting hit, it doesn't do anything at all.  <br />
<br />
  Warriors had been asking for it to be changed to a straight +xxx hate increase instead of how it is now as a fix, but were shot down as the developers said it would trivialize too much if warriors had an easy time holding aggro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Well if getting agro was a contest you would be teh winnar 4 shoor.<br />
<br />
 Top geared Knights can definately make more efficient MT's than wars in exp groups. Been this way for a long time. In general though they hafta be better geared than the warrior in question. Just to absorb similar punishment. Sorta moot if you have a cleric with good mana regen though.<br />
<br />
 I personally don't have much trouble holding agro in exp groups, but that's more because the people I play with are pretty good at managing agro. I pity warriors that have to do pick-up groups and deal with the general populace of players. Of course most of the warriors I've grouped with on my rogue make me want to pull my hair out...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Sharidann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">last week end in pov, my group asked me to take over tanking over the warrior  64 in the group. I had  slightly more hp and well over 300 AC more than him and to quote the cleric, a very good friend of mine : &quot;At least I do not need to have my finger permanently hovering over the CH Button&quot;. And well, with me tanking, the mobs had one focus, little me,  and werent trying to munch the cleric or chanter, which made it well worth it for all of us. :)<br />
The big problem with this warrior wasnt his gear but the fact that he couldnt hold aggro. (And he was actually himself happy to see me tank and grab aggro and keep it as he was aware that he still had lots to learn about how to get aggro.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Warrior aggro has gotten better lately<br />
That was true for about a month, then they released PoP. Unless you're packing eb weapons taunt in xp groups sucks nuts. There is 0 reason from an efficientcy point of view to take a warrior over a paladin or sk killing xp trash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Northerner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Warrior aggro is horribly broken.  Warriors also have access to a number of weapons that make up for this.<br />
<br />
I personally do not think that is a very fair trade for Warriors.  Balance through equipment is one thing but such a class-defining role as aggro-management is really very, very equipment-orientated for Warriors.<br />
<br />
An EB+ or BBB Warrior has no real troubles in an exp group or raid and makes my life very easy.  Anything  less and it can be not only a pain but a severe one.  I think Warriors need a decent Taunt beyond AE Taunt and they certainly do not have one now outside of weapon procs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Toshiden Satori</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Hrm...I seem to have no issues at all with pulling and having the warriors in my groups get aggro. And if you are an archery ranger and worried about root 1/2'ing your damage.. simply drop a nuke on the mob, break the root, and go back to plinking arrows. I pull the giants in PoS non stop and it seems to work fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Celt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Sks can cast enraging blow style spells (+600 hate, its called terror of thule, a 63 spell, and the lower level version is 510 hate, called terror of terris) since they lost the agro of debuffs that they had for so long.  This makes them OUTSTANDING tanks.  Paladins have stuns, nothing likes being stunned :)  Rangers have flamelick/entrap/ensnare so....<br />
<br />
Warriors don't need taunt fixed, it already is.  Taunt just puts you on the top of the hatelist for the moment.  They need an aa skill (see: not just ae taunt) that costs 18 total for 3 levels to add 33, 66, and 100 hate to their kick/slam/bash.  Make furious bash III or similar effects work on that hate value.  Taunt is one thing, but for folks without hate weapons this would be a surefire HELP to holding agro, because after 7 kicks you have the equivalent to enraging blow, and after a long fight you can almost guarantee a decent lock if you are using hates on a raid :)<br />
<br />
Warriors have received band aid fixes for taunt for a long time.  It's about time VI gave them some +hate on their skill trees.  Yes, your tanks would still need time to lock a bit, but much MUCH less than they do now, and they wouldn't be chained to zero damage procs their entire existence along with anemic damage weapons simply because they need to keep the mobs mostly focused on them.  Every other tank class other than warriors has a way to add hate to the hatelist directly other than damage spells, Give warriors a means as well.<br />
<br />
P.S.  Having a dementing visions proccing weapon with sod's ratio that's warrior only would really rock in giving warriors some decent dps :P  More enchanter DD proccing weapons please, warriors need some teeth!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>timcooper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">New sheilds have focus effects for hate, check in lucy i forget name increase hate from procs and bash's by a percentage.<br />
I think the real key is had poorly equipped some people who pass trials are for POS/POV. When i get into a grp when tank has less hp's than me and not even epics, xp is slow and chanters/clerics/shaman die.<br />
Group with guildies, bocs really help and a 8.5K tank rocks for xp grps with boc/primal.<br />
Pallys can stun and great grp heals especially when cleric has balance AA, SK's have great aggro and very nice hp/mana grp tap.<br />
Plate class's are the best tanks if reasonably equipped.<br />
LVL/AA/equip make huge diff and cant really make statements as warriors suck in xp grps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Grimmlokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Not sure everyone saw it. But VI recently said taunt was going to be &quot;retuned&quot; to decrease warrior dependency on procs. At a fanfaire I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Valorindel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I agree with Celt on going an Alternate Advancement route. If there is a Vanishing Blade AA skill I see no reason why there can not be an Enraging Blade AA skill as well. Of course, it would be nice if it was able to be toggled so that the warrior only draws the extra aggro when they want to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Barreck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I myself play a warrior.  I agree that taunt is a bit messed up still, but I find that since PoP came out I've been having a much easier time holding aggro.  The ONLY problem I see over and over again with keeping agro is losing it to shaman slow, which isnt a big deal in exp groups.  Gimme 3 seconds and the mob is back on me ... after that the only time I&quot;ve lost aggro was when someone was deliberately trying to pull it from me.  As long as the warrior knows how to hit the taunt button they're not bad.  Also my equipment, at 63, is mediocre ... I use a wavecrasher and a frostbringer to hold aggro and I usually have very little problems.<br />
I do think we need an upgraded taunt though, I hate having a mob run around for a couple seconds ... I get embarrassed when I lose aggro but sometimes ye just can't help it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Sho'Nuff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">From what I've seen warriors are holding aggro now better than ever before in xp groups. The problem that arises is that it's more efficient to be healing a pal/sk full time and nuking like mad and slowing on inc, than it is to heal a warrior plus whoever the mob pongs to, while nuking conservatively and delaying slow.<br />
<br />
This is a complicated problem though. A fix such as changing taunt to just add xxx hate really would severely gimp a lot of high-end encounters, although it would be a totally appropriate change for exp groups.  Maybe an AA ability to which certain mobs could be flagged immune would work, or something that could only be used from behind a mob so as to limit an absurd amount of aggro buildup.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>karmic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I don't think it would be feasible to give warriors a summoning ability similar to mob summoning.  It would be too easily abused for pulling even if it had a limited range (Pulling through walls, ceilings etc).  Most high end warriors do quite well maintaining aggro of course because they have the equipment to do so.  <br />
<br />
I think the AA ability route is a great idea.  It would allow anyone who needs that type of skill to train in it, without making any game mechanic, aggro changes.  If you don't need it, don't get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Valencia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I disagree that some form of improved taunt should have to be an AA skill.  It should be given to warriors free, just as hybrids get high-taunt spells for free without having to invest AA...<br />
<br />
Having to invest 18AA+ for a skill which puts you at the same level as hybrid spell taunt is too penalizing, IMHO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Elessar Elfstone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">This is why Enraging Blow procs, Stun procs, etc are your friend. Love them weapons on our Warriors ;)<br />
<br />
Of course, they are exactly Centi Longswords, so that's moot. Warriors taunt does need an upgrade big time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Eolair Strongbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I also MUCH prefer having a paly or an SK.  With an SK, they have great aggro, and with their darkness line spells, I don't even have to snare. :p<br />
<br />
Was fighting with a 65 SK in caves last night, and only on a rare occasion did the shaman get aggro.  Usually when he got 2 slow resists or something.  But hey, casting slow 3 times is gonna outdamage damn near everything, lol.<br />
<br />
Definately much more efficient, mana wise, to have a Paly or SK tanking.  An occasional extra heal every once in a while is still much less than having to heal 3 people in the span of 1 fight.<br />
<br />
SK/Paly aggro makes it incredibly easier to chain pull the wasteland.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>moldas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">I play a warrior, and dont really have huge problems maintaining aggro in PoS/PoV with less than ideal taunt weapons.  I mainhand fleshgrinder, offhand frosty, and wear nearly exclusively homemade armour (tribunal stuff), yet I have very little problems lfg in PoV, and I often get tells asking to come to PoS/PoV.<br />
<br />
 Occasionally, the cleric or chanter will snag aggro early in the fight on the 1st CH, or when the chanter slows the mob, but its not usually a big deal because as soon as soon as I run up to wherever the mob has gone, he turns back to me within a swing or two.<br />
<br />
If you have a warr that is not maintaining aggro, chances are that his taunt button isnt broken, his finger is because hes not hitting the taunt button.  I was in a group the other day killing golems and creepy crawly things in PoV, and the other warr in group was not maintaining aggro very wielding a BoC.  I was gaining aggro after he procd EB 1-2 times, which leads me to believe that there is no way he was actually hitting his taunt button.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heh.<br />
<br />
When I say gimp, I mean it.<br />
<br />
I mean, NOT snaring, NOT DDing, NOT DOTing, NOT using one of our stun/DD proc spells, NOT jumping into battle right away.<br />
<br />
I often (especially if the warrior is lower level than I am) find that I STILL get agro while not doing all of these things.  Plus casting jolt here and there.<br />
<br />
It's even worse if I'm the puller.<br />
<br />
Generally, I'll guage based on who's the cleric, what we're fighting, how hard I'm being hit, yadda yadda, etc. to determine how aggressive I am on the jolt hotkey.  Usually, it's not worth the loss of damage/extra time.  Plus when I tank, the rogues NEVER have the mob turn on em...  =P<br />
<br />
Now that said, there are some warriors that have good gear, mash the taunt key, stay tight to the mob, kick, etc. and keep agro pretty well.  They just seem to be few and far between.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Eb weapons were a horrible mistake, they should never have been made (this includes the first steps of the series, the red epic). They've been a bane to the warrior class as a whole, allowing any problems to be refuted in the past by saying 'but you have eb weapons and defensive, take it and like it'. <br />
<br />
It's also compounded the itemization problem, being limited to only one type of weapon to do your job. Little good a non-proc taunt weapon does you as MT or ST or CC Tank if you can't get argo worth beans to make use of it, and really if a warrior isn't tanking what is the point of having more around? None.<br />
<br />
They've said taunt is still busted garbage, and that a supposed fix is coming. Shrug, that could be in another year tho ;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">I was gaining aggro after he procd EB 1-2 times, which leads me to believe that there is no way he was actually hitting his taunt button. <br />
Don't mean to sound like a snob, but you do realize hitting taunt while you are #1 on the argo list does nothing right? Of course you're going to pull argo on one of the times the taunt skill works, cause it matches whoever is #1 and adds +1 to your total - making you #1 in hate by a slim margin. If he's tanking and getting eb procs, so long as the mob is on him he should not be hitting taunt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Ilystil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">I'm not going to rant on +hate weapons. I've done it a million times before, so I'll spare y'all and simply say I honestly wish they'd found a better way to handle it. Taunt is so so sorta broke, you can get around it if folks are conscious of what they're doing. Unfortuently in XP groups it is tempting to just hit autoattack and pay attention to the tv, guilty of it myself (24 is more important than EQ damn you all!!) It's really going to depend on the group makeup and the warriors weapons. If the warrior has respectable taunt generating weapons, then it shouldn't be an issue. If the other folks in the group know how to watch their aggro, still not a big deal. That being said, I do understand their issues with taunt. They can't really 'fix' it, not the way most warriors would want it, because that would make the game entirely too trivial. The main problems warriors have right now is fast aggro. Through the band aid fixes, we have the ability to maintain a lock for as long as we're healed given enough time to piss the mob off. AoE taunt sorta helps the problem, except that all it is is a guarentee 100% successful taunt. I burn AET, wizard crits Garrison's the same second, hey guess what,I just burned my AET for nothing. So really, for properly equipped warriors, the only tough part is the initial aggro. What I'd like to see is taunt changed so that if successful, it jumps you to the top of the list and adds some hate, so that the warrior has a bit of a buffer once they have the mob. That would also make pushing the taunt button while currently having aggro actually mean something. Now, if they want to fix taunt fairly for all warriors, they'd need to either proliferate +hate weapons much moreso than they are now, or they basically need to redesign the system. What I would personally like for warriors is a three tier AA that adds on +hate for every single critical a warrior gets above and beyond what the damage itself may add. Say something like a +hate 50/+100/+150 progression, which would double when berserk and crippling. That would effectively give warriors an innate +hate ability, not to mention making Combat Fury and Fury of the Ages actually worth something to a warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">As a warrior this thread was an interesting read.<br />
<br />
The most logical and easiest fix imo would be to rework the current Taunt, and in addition to how it currently works, always have it add +XXX numeric hate(in additition to the chance of putting you at the #1 spot on hate list). <br />
<br />
If they want they can make it an AA skill, improved taunt(but cheap! :p), with 3 different levels(+50, +100, +150). This wouldnt fix warrior taunt at levels below 46 though, so maybe a bad idea. Probably best to simply scale the +hate value all the way from level 15(or whenever we get taunt, forgot) up to level 65. Something like +hate value=3*level would be nice and simple.<br />
<br />
The suggestion about making our crits add hate, I dont really like, because there are times where I dont want to generate extra hate, especially on raids. Any &quot;fix&quot; should be something that is controllable by the warrior, and not another random event(like EB-procs).<br />
<br />
In fact more often than not, my role on raids is simply adding DPS or being rampage tank. In both cases I am not really interested in getting unwanted agro through crits. <br />
<br />
For instance, we cleared VT today. And we had all our 10 warriors present.. I am not in our usual top 3 MT rotation, so basically my role today on boss mobs was hitting /disc aggressive(3 mins of increased damage). If the crits I then do, could risk pulling agro on me, that would not be so cool :)</div></div><hr />

Ranger should pull with tangling weeds, snare, and then tangling weeds again. Shaman slows on incoming while ranger kites. Shaman calls out when slow sticks, and ranger brings mob to the warrior. Ranger tanks until warrior lands a taunt. Rangers pulls back and unloads with bow.  <br />
<br />
If you are a melee focused ranger this doesn't fix your problem. You will still need jolts, but try not jolting until warrior lands a taunt or you start getting low on health.  You will still have melee aggy problem, but at least everyone else in the group has it easy. Wizards expecially can unload.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Panteroo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">aggro is everybodies responsibility to control appropriately. Tashing a mob as the warrior hits it for the first time is about as intelligent as snaring a mob and then using flame lick as the warrior hits it for the first time. If your getting aggro when your not supposed to have it then you need to step back and figure out why because your either doing something or not doing something that is causing it. <br />
<br />
As players everybody needs to be flexible enough to accomodate the situation of a wide array of different group types. Enchanters and Shaman may be able to get away with tash/malo/slow immediately when a sk/pal is tanking but they also need to be competent enough to understand that if a warrior is tanking they may not be able to get away with it. If you cannot adjust to the aggro *needs* of your group then you are detrimental to that group. The other day I was playing my cleric in a PoV pickup group. We had a ranger in our group (well equipped) who was constantly drawing aggro immediately upon a mob hitting camp because he decided that snaring the mob at 99% and then sticking a dot on it was fine with a warrior tanking and consistantly did it before allowing the warrior any time to build aggro. I asked him privately to please try to reduce his aggro as I did not have enough mana to chain heal him when he had aggro and keep up on the heals for the rest of the group and still be able to maintain enough mana to chain pull. He told me that he knew all about how to hold or lose aggro and would do it as he pleased, i told him great and that he would not be getting any heals from me if he got aggro because of an avoidable reason. Took him less than 10 minutes to die because he snared and dotted a mob hitting for 500+ within 5 seconds of the warrior engaging the mob. I rezzed and booted him from the group and got another ranger who performed 100x better in every way than the last one who knew exactly how to manage his aggro... right into the grave.<br />
<br />
Aggro management is everybodies responsiblity and people need to be able to adjust to the aggro *needs* of the group.. if you can't then you are simply of no value to that group.</div></div><hr />

See, this I disagree with. Every other class has to learn how to manage aggro based on their available skillsets. Doing this would thrust warriors pretty much into the same category. Right now warrior aggro management consists of 'everyone bag the uber taunt toys' ;) In that regard, we have aggro management alot better than alot of classes. If they end up giving more taunt, then warriors are going to have to learn how to manage it, and there is absolute zero reason why warriors should have it easy when it comes to avoiding aggro when their main purpose in life is to get and hold aggro in the first place.</div></div><hr />

It's a wonderful way to make sure your clerics arent getting beat up, but if you've got alot of melee in group who are using weapons with dd procs or folks who chain nuke, root is going to become a more or less pointless gesture, you'll end up spending more time casting root then doing actual damage, which is counterproductive.</div></div><hr />

I agree with Panteroo... <br />

Also, it does depend on the warrior's talent and I think that's how it should be.  I have a list of the best aggro holding warriors I fight with.  <br />
<br />
In PoN, I had a 54 warrior tanking and he was the lowest level member of group and we rocked.  Very few times the warrior lost agro and when it did it was caused by the shaman slow.  In same type of groups i've had 59and 60 warriors and we were ping ponging all night.<br />
<br />
I think PoP helps call out the good warriors from the bad and in my opinion this is a good thing.  Why shouldn't a warrior have to develop a talent to keep agro?<br />
<br />
Edit:  Wanted to add, I was the puller.  Had no problems with the warrior taking agro.  As the mob came to camp he shot his arrows and did his thing and I had full bar most of night.  The only time the group was interesting is when I brought more than one and didn't know it but it was sweet efficient experience.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>kenmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">a warrior's view:<br />
<br />
i personnaly have no problems holding aggro in PoV except for a few cases :<br />
Tash ( more aggro than slow )<br />
Slow ( and even more if resisted )<br />
some high damaging class proccing too much.<br />
<br />
In my groups ( i mainly group with guildies ) the enchanter and the shaman tash/slow the mob immediately when pulled. I just put myself next to it, hit auto-attack and bash my taunt button. It happens very rarely when the enchanter or the shaman dies and if it happens, it is often in the case where the shaman get a resist or more on the slow AND my taunt fails.<br />
<br />
I've noticed the taunt being better with the lvl 60, but it's again a successfull taunt in 3, and sometimes i have to hit it more than 5 times to gain aggro back. <br />
As a weapon, i use the 2HS epic, because it procs more often than the 1HS version and i'm less getting hit by ripostes. I know i dont do alot of dmg with it, but my main concern is being beaten by the mob, i dont care about dps.<br />
<br />
As of clerics getting aggro : it only happen when we have multiple incs. With one mob, i always have time to build enough aggro before the cleric have to land a heal on me.<br />
<br />
If i could change anything in our taunting ability, i would design taunt such as it is now, except that when failed, it would be a +hate component, such as +200 hate failed.<br />
<br />
When successfull, i does put me on top of list anyway, so no need of +200.<br />
<br />
And for info : i procced 2 times with 2HS epic in 2 hits ( first round of fight) wich means 175DD*2+250dmg+1000 hate. One tash and i lost aggro. I got it back with one swing (taunt was used to draw aggro of puller) so the enchanter took only one hit. And he was runed atm, so no probs.  What i want to point is that a paladin lost aggro too when shaman was slowing in another group. He needs to cast his stun spell to get aggro back but in the meanwhile, the shaman got hit anyway. With a warrior it would certainly be the same in this case, as the mob was just slowed by the shaman, wich means more time for warr to grab back his lost aggro.<br />

That a warrior can't hold agro as well as a ranger, with fewer hp and less defensive capabilities, is a challenge - not a mistake. Adapt, innovate.<br />
<br />
<br />
To restate Adagiox's quote somewhat, warriors are the best at tanking and the worst at taunting... and it's this way by design. As an enc, my preferred tank for grouping was a SK, although it's not really fair to compare the two as SKs add a lot more to a group via their spells. I might also be biased as the SK I grouped with was probably the best player Lanys has seen, but the flexibility of the SK in general would always make me choose one over a warrior for exp groups. Even as far as tanking efficiency goes, depending on what you're fighting an SK's lifetaps can really add some durability for him until mana runs out.<br />
<br />
Root is nice.. as an enc it has saved me many times, but it's not preferable to a SK (or pal, even ranger) snagging aggro back. Root is superb, but not always ideal.. I have rooted mobs off me only to see the cleric is on the edge of the mob's melee, or he runs towards the mob thinking it's mezzed (and I don't blame them for this, it's not a cleric's job to be keeping track of what's mezzed.. and it can get tough in 5+ pulls. :p)<br />
<br />
However, if pulling isn't an issue (FD is one of the biggest plusses SKs have..) and you're fighting big mobs, no more than 1 or 2 a pull, which need to be debuffed, I think I might opt for root-&gt;debuff and then fight. Puller pulls, enc tashes on inc, cleric roots as soon as Enchanter begins to cast a spell. If you have a shaman too, it might be feasible to work out shaman maloing, enc tashing, clering root landing after tash/malo. I think I'd try for something like this myself. I haven't fought these mobs though, so I'm not sure if what I'm saying would work. :) In any event, I'd most likely choose a warrior over anyone else here. This kind of grouping would bore me to death though.. give me deep chardok anytime. ;) and my SK, too..</div></div><hr />

The same is true now given the relative HP of the players versus exp mobs that hit for 700+. Whether that will change over time and all players will see a large HP increase due to levels, AAs, and gear, remains to be seen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe I wasn't clear.  The root is to allow the warrior to establish agro and the debuffers slow.  During this time, it's counter productive for other melee to be hitting the mob anyway, and we're talking about a time period of about 10 seconds for the warrior to get agro and the debuffers work.  Then everyone can chime in with their best efforts. 10 seconds is hardly a large amount of time to sacrifice to save a little enchatner/shaman/cleric skin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Rhick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">I think the thing most people don't understand is that taunt MATCHES the aggro of the highest person on the list. <br />
<br />
This is why when I pull I iuse mmolate, tangling weeds, and ensnare, and I chain them. This allows the slower to slow before the mob gets to the warrior, and I can just run to the warrior and stand there healing myself while he tries to taunt off me.  If you are pulling really hard hitting stuff like PoV or BoT just snare the mob and kite by the warrior a few times. You never have to get hit once, and the warrior doesn't have to chase. You can root too if your warrior misses a couple taunts in a row, but this rarely happens.<br />
<br />
A good tank will land a successful taunt pretty often, and when he does his aggro is LOCKED for the entire fight. Depending on how much aggro I built the wizards and nukers in the group can nuke all they want right from the start of the fight without any fear of pulling aggo off the warrior. <br />
<br />
The key thing to remember is you are building aggro for the warrior to taunt off you. Because a ranger can use a bow for most the fight once you transfer your aggro to the warrior you won't get it back.  Try this chain pulling in PoV.  Communicate with your warrior so they know what you are doing. Trust me they'll love it. It makes their job incredibly simple. Wizards will love you too. <br />
<br />
Clerics may complain about healing you, but unless cleric mana is the rate limiting factor in the group this isn't a problem. Usually I find that preslowing mobs before engagement, and guaranteeing that no caster in the party is going to get any aggro saves alot more mana than healing the ranger for the first 6 seconds of the fight. <br />
<br />
Anyway this is what works for me, and my guild mates are convinced that rangers are the best pullers in EQ.<br />
<br />
-Rhick<br />
<br />
p.s. This is the same reason it is smart to have paladins tank tough mobs at the start of fights. They can chain stun and build a huge amount of aggro that a warrior can taunt off. Paladins also have the survivability that unfortunately rangers don't have. For mobs that are notorious for bouncing aggro this is a great solution.</div></div><hr />

Of course doing a Cripple (which makes the world of difference in Hob groups) or a DoT throws me back on top of the hate list.  My ranger rarely gets aggro.

Pull with jolt, not snare (why would you want a slow mob crawling to camp anyway?) and stand close to the warrior when you pull the mob in so he can immediately obtain agro.  And really, after that, is it so freaking hard to wait two or three seconds before pressing A if you're meleeing, so you don't immediately grab agro again?  Warriors have the hit points and the ac to take a few seconds of hits before the tash/slow, let them take it!  The only time I take damage in an xp group in valor/storms is if I'm pulling and I get nuked, or I intentionally grab agro off a caster and jolt it back onto the warrior.  For normal non-caster pulls, I rarely take damage.   Why get beat up on pulls so you need to get healed?  I'm sure the cleric is busy enough healing the chanter who got a resisted mez and the warrior.<br />
<br />
As someone said above, tashing or maloing a mob on inc is about as bright as a wizzy going full burn 2 seconds into battle.  Use your heads.  Agro isn't just the warriors job, it's everyone elses.  If you're pulilng agro all the time meleeing, look at what you're doing wrong, unclick call of fire (hello?) and help your buddy out.  Don't snare at the start of the battle, wait till the mob is half dead, walk up next to the warrior (if using archery) snare, jolt if needed and go pull another mob.<br />
<br />
Warrior &gt; all for tanking pop mobs if his groupmates help him get the job done, and more efficient than a paladin/sk to boot.  Sorry if this post sounded condescending in any way, but I've not experienced any of these so called &quot;agro&quot; problems in my normal xp group, and our tank is a warrior in skyshrine + fleshgrinder/horn of hsagra, hardly uber by today's standards.</div></div><hr />

In lots of PoP zones the warriors get pounded hard by mobs that are unslowed.  If you are pulling with tangling weeds and immolate the shaman/enchanter can slow on incoming but aggro will still be with you until the warrior taunts it off.  I assure you that a ranger can tank a slowed mob better than a warrior can tank an unslowed mob. Warriors can taunt every 6 seconds and I have never seen a 61+ warrior miss more than 3 taunts in a row. <br />
<br />
The beautiful thing about high aggro pulling is the wizzy can chain nuke the entire fight without getting aggro heck the wizzy can chain nuke on incoming. I have been in groups without a tank where I just chain tangling weeds and snare, and 5 wizzies chain nuke the mob dead.  Either way whis means the fight is over faster, you can kill more mobs, and the net amount of healing needed per mob is alot less.<br />
<br />
If you have a cleric and warrior in the group this strategy will save mana, but if you have a shaman or druid as your group healer high aggro pulling will save a TON of mana. With no complete healer in group it doesn't matter how many HP a warrior has.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Rajalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">I guess it just depends on what strategy you use in your xp group.  For me though, even if I do tank a slowed mob for 18 seconds (3 taunts), after running it around 15-30 seconds, I'd still probably require an elixer which is 400 mana, so elixer me or cheal warrior, it's 400 mana all the same on the pull.  I prefer to let my warrior get pounded :p  Saves us time at least as I'm shooting my bow for that 30-45 seconds thereby doing more damage and lessening the healing that needs to be done overall.  It ends up being more xp per hour for us.  However, my regular xp group has been xp'ng together for months and months, and what we do we have down to a science.  If your strat works for you, more power to ya. :)  I can see it being a useful strat in certain situations.  In fact I've used it a few times on some giants.<br />
<br />
You did hit on a good point though, RHick, and one that I totally agree with -- that the composition of your group, and more especially the healers should change what pulling strat you use.  My regular group is: War/Cleric/Enc/Rng/Rog/Dru.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Rhick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">Ahh, you have the holy trinity and no nukers. That makes a difference.<br />
<br />
I usually have warrior, shaman, druid, wizard, wizard, ranger.<br />
<br />
When I aggro pull the wizards unload right from start. It works nice. <br />
<br />
As far as taunt goes I was giving a worst case scenario. My warrior friend 65 lands his first taunt 7 times out of 10 these days since they fixed taunt.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>eldakka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">There's some good suggestions and ideas here about agro management etc.<br />
<br />
However, many of the suggestions (not all) seem to be overlooking what I see as the point of this topic. Which is about the most efficient xp grind group MT.<br />
<br />
Now let me start by saying what I mean when I think most efficient xp grind group. I mean killing as many mobs as fast as you can such that there is no downtime required for medding etc but that thre is a constant stream of pulls.<br />
<br />
  As players everybody needs to be flexible enough to accomodate the situation of a wide array of different group types. Enchanters and Shaman may be able to get away with tash/malo/slow immediately when a sk/pal is tanking but they also need to be competent enough to understand that if a warrior is tanking they may not be able to get away with it. <br />
<br />
While I agree fully with this statement in general, it is counter-productive in xp grind groups to have to be 'careful' (as opposed to just normal agro management, like not dropping a 4k nuke as mob is incoming).<br />
<br />
 As someone said above, tashing or maloing a mob on inc is about as bright as a wizzy going full burn 2 seconds into battle. Use your heads. Agro isn't just the warriors job, it's everyone elses.<br />
<br />
IF you have a tank (pally/SK) that can grab agro such that the mob can be tashed/maloed/slowed while inc, then it is better than having a tank that you have to LET build up agro before slowing etc.<br />
<br />
We are talking efficiency here NOT general agro management.<br />
<br />
I suppose I am not being very clear here, but imagine it being like the execution trial. You want to kill mob x as fast as possible so you can get onto mob y quickly. But rather than these 4 waves and a boss mob, you want to do this for hours on end (with no boss mob heh).<br />
<br />
If you can get a tank where you don't HAVE to wait 10 seconds before attacking/slowing whatever, you will be getting better xp than if you have to wait before doing these things.<br />
<br />
I'm sure most people who get to PoV/PoS have (I hope) at least some concept of agro management. But it still boils down to the faster you kill, the faster you level or gain aa xp. The faster the MT gains and keeps agro, the faster you can kill.<br />
<br />
And for getting and keeping agro QUICKLY as opposed to having to &quot;build up&quot; agro, you can't go past hybrids with their spells.<br />
<br />
bah, I hope you can make some kind of sense out of my rambling, but I doubt it :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Woodrunner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">That pretty much hit the nail on the head.<br />
<br />
The problem that I'm encountering with warriors in PoP isn't that they can't get and hold aggro, its simply that it takes them time to do so.<br />
<br />
With a warrior tanking for my xp group, I expect to take a blow or two from whatever I pull while he gets it off me. He tanks it unslowed for a few seconds and then the slower feels its safe to slow.<br />
<br />
With a paladin tanking for my xp group, I bring a mob to the camp, it gets stunned before it catches up with me. There is also  a good chance that it will be slowed before the stun has worn off and aggro is still pretty firmly on the pally.<br />
<br />
Warriors make perfectly good tanks in situations where the other players are prepared to alter their play style to avoid getting aggro. They make the best tanks on raid targets, where the speed of a kill is comparatively unimportant. It tends to be more important that the MA stays alive than  that he gets aggro in a split second on raid targets. However, they don't seem to shape up quite as well for chain pulling xp groups where the speed that mobs drop and the mana burned per mob  on heals are the difference between a good rate of xp and an okay rate of xp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Karloss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">I've had some good Warriors and some bad......same as every other class......<br />

The good warriors will hold aggro after a short spell but there are some bad 'uns around that are hopeless :( Had a couple where I could NEVER cast snare until mob was actually running on 20% health else I would be getting slapped around immediatly.....even getting aggro without casting ANY spells or having any procs.....<br />
<br />
Now, switch in a Pally and I could even un-mem jolt most of the time (not that I do ;) ) and snare whenever I want...........regardless of what the issue is, SOE really do need to do something before a lot of people see getting a warrior as a possible waste of time.<br />
<br />
On a side note, I personally prefer a warrior tanking just because they can be much most mana effeicient of the group......would be nice to see something done about it. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>opelk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">Another technique to avoid ping pong :<br />
<br />
On incoming, our Pally chain stun ( 3 stun memed ) the mob. Mob stops and shm / enc have time to slow, tash ,.... And  aggro is always on the Pally . <br />
More : the mob is already slowed when he tries to hit the MT  <br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Zolina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">I've had quite a lot of experience with warrior MAs in Plane of Valor.  If the warrior doesn't know how to hold aggro, the ranger has four choices:<br />
<br />
1.  Do low-aggro pulls, ranger will get beat on, then slower will get beat on, then cleric will get beat on, then, finally, warrior will get beat on.<br />
2.  Do high-aggro pulls (snare etc.), casters won't get hit, but ranger will get beat up an awful lot as he/she is tanking an unslowed mob.  The casters may be grateful that they're not getting hurt, but you'll look like a manasink and die more frequently.<br />
<br />
3.  Root on incoming.  Works well if there's no nuker in the party, usually keeps the non-tanks from getting hit much, but the mana cost can hurt if you have no clarity, archery damage gets cut in half, and it's annoying.<br />
<br />
4.  Stick to archery.  You won't get hit much, but if the warrior has less than half a brain, the casters will take a pounding.<br />
<br />
Frankly, I prefer SK or paladin tanking, they stun or snare on incoming and hold aggro the whole battle, so I can attack any way I like without worry.</div></div><hr />

With this Paladin tanking, I can cast snare and slow immediately and never have to worry about it coming after me.  I used to play a warrior, I switched to Ranger for a lot of issues, one of them was how broken taunt was.  If you don't have top of the line weapons your screwed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Nift Trailhunter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">Ok so my understanding of taunt is (top hate amount) + 1 . <br />
<br />
If this is true then yes a warrior that is hitting taunt every single time they can is doing something.  They are continuing to increse their aggro amount.  Maybe this is not clear but I will try to make it so...  Top aggro ( hate number) is tank.  so taunt is hit wich means top aggro amount is taken (tank's hate amount) and then one is added to it.  this amoun is then set as the tanks new hate amount, therefore the tanks hate is now 1 greater.  This does not take away form damage so why not?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Locz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">Good topic!<br />
<br />
In a grind group......<br />
* Good warriors have no difficulty siezing and holding aggro. <br />
* Sucky warriors won't hold aggro very well.<br />
* Sucky pullers can't lose aggro to a warrior.<br />
* Sucky players in a group steal aggro.<br />
<br />
What do good warriors do that sucky warriors don't?  Good warriors use taunt/kick/(bash)/beg/disarm together in a macro.  Sucky warriors don't.  Good warriors who intend to tank choose weapons that proc hate (yes, even one of their not-so-hard-to-obtain epics from Kunark, 3 expansions ago, does this), or proc debuffs, or proc snare...and prefer to use said proccing weapon even if reduces their dps slightly.  Sucky warriors choose weapons based solely on dps.<br />
<br />
When a pull is coming in, good warriors assist the puller while he is still far away and fire arrows as it's incoming, then POUNCE on the MOB immediately as it enters melee range.  Sucky warriors just stand there, they seemingly ignore incoming messages, often looking into space, and don't notice the MOB is in camp until someone's health bar starts taking a nosedive. (reminds me of 8 year old kids bored playing goalie in a soccer game).<br />
<br />
A good ranger pulls with Jolt if their goal is to lose aggro easily.  A bad ranger casts snare, flame lick, immolate and Brushfire on the incoming MOB.  A good ranger puller leaves attack off until the warrior has siezed aggro.  A bad ranger puller is autoattacking the MOB he just pulled as he waltzes into camp.<br />
<br />
I could go on about group play behavior (including how/when chanters and shaman should slow) and how not to steal aggro, etc, but that's a bigger subject on how each and every class should play their own role best.<br />
<br />
Want to see?  Observe as 6-man groups in BoT try to kill a named MOB.   A group in which each member knows how to control aggro easily kills the nameds with no stress or complications.  A group which contains a poor player or two who &quot;accidently&quot; siezes aggro will wipe..and wipe...and wipe, until some other group gets impatient and over-runs them.<br />
<br />
Or better yet, watch players trying to pass the PoJ executioner trials.  Good teams with pre-ST, pre-NTOV gear and all level 60-61 easily pass the executioner the first time because they know how to aggro manage.  Sucky teams, even with uber gear and higher levels (63+) often fail 30 or 40 or more times, and usually they fail because they can't aggro manage worth a damn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Montegue</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">At least in my limited little 1st tier world (PoN, PoI, PoD, PoJ), warriors are obsolete when it comes to efficient tanking in exp groups. They are completely obsolete. <br />
<br />
I have a good friend who plays a Paladin. After long debate, we came to the conclusion that HP and damage mitigation mean jack and ****e when it comes to tanking on planar mobs. What is most important is safely landing a slow in order to stabilize the fight, conserve mana, and in general keep things less chaotic. <br />
<br />
Warriors take time to build aggro. That translates into lots of unslowed damage to the tank. Hybrids can ABSOLUTELY lock in aggro on he pull itself, and easily maintain it. Slow, tash, and nukes all land immediately, which ends the fight much sooner than if we all have to sit on our thumbs while the warrior builds up enough hate. <br />
<br />
an aggroed mob on a chanter means a dead chanter. An aggroed mob on a shaman means some wasted mana and time. An aggroed mob on little old me means everyone can cut loose on the mob and the fighting is much more efficient. Slows and mana regen reall make &quot;manasink&quot; a term of the past. Who cares if I am a manasink these days with c3 and FT items?<br />

<br />
<br />
Because if the warriors continually hits the &quot;Taunt&quot; button everytime it refreshes, there is a good chance it won't be active for him to hit when he needs it.  And typically, warriors are usually just barely in the lead on aggro if the rest of the group is working to make it so, and it only takes 1 extra nuke, snare, debuff, etc, to upset the order.<br />
<br />
Especially when you end up with warriors with lower levels of equipment than the rest of the melees in the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u79"><b>Valencia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p79">I think the thing most people don't understand is that taunt MATCHES the aggro of the highest person on the list. <br />
So, you are saying that if a pally is chain-stunning a mob for most of the fight and I hit Taunt once successfully, then I get the aggro?<br />
<br />
Hmmm...not sure I believe that.  I would tend to think that a successful taunt builds aggro, but doesn't necessarily put you smack dab on top of the list immediately...<br />
<br />
This would also seem to imply that pulling with TW + snare + Flame Lick (for instance) would not be any different than pulling with Jolt since the warrior could taunt it off you either way -- which kinda makes me wonder why anyone would need to pull with Jolt at all...<br />
<br />
Guess I'll test this out tonight...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u80"><b>Viken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p80">I think some of you have the wrong notion of how hate works. Everything you do to a mob, be it slash, kick, bash, beg, nuke, slow, tash, snare, etc... increases your hate by a fixed amount. The Taunt button also does this but its not fixed. It depends on your taunt skill and so it varies from class to class. Warriors have a much higher taunt skill which explains why if you are standing side by side trying to get a mobs attention you will never &quot;out-taunt&quot; a warrior if all you are doing is hitting your taunt buttons.<br />
<br />
Take a look at spell effects such as Enraging Blow:<br />
http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=2675&amp;source=Live<br />
<br />
Notice it increases hate by an absolute amount. This agrees with my theory on how taunt works. Hate is absolute, not relative.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u81"><b>Lanandrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p81">It's not hard to keep a mob off me.  It's hard to keep a mob off the slower.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u83"><b>Rhick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p83">Ok, I hope everyone reads the above thread on taunt, and then mabye grabs a warrior and does some tests for yourself.<br />
<br />
Taunt only matches aggro of the top person on the list. It does not add any aggro at all.<br />
<br />
Try this. <br />
<br />
Find a zone with humanoid mobs that say something when a taunt lands successfully.<br />
<br />
Pull the mob with snare, and snare, tangling weeds 10 times.<br />
<br />
Then bring the mob to a warrior and stand in front of the warrior without attacking. Have the warrior taunt without attacking until you get the msg that taunt was succesfful. The NPC will tell you.<br />
But wait.. the NPC didn't turn to face the warrior. It is still attacking you.  Have the warrior hit attack, and do the minimal damage they can before the mob turns. Have them attack with their hands. It isn't much. Now snare again, and you get aggy back.<br />
<br />
Now have the warrior taunt 10 times without attacking. They won't pull aggy off you I bet. Now have them attack with hands, boom aggy transfers. <br />
<br />
 The point is... Taunt adds no hate.   <br />
<br />
Now continue the test. Find a wizard to add to your party, and mabye a shaman to slow/heal. Find a mob and pull it with snare. Snare it 10 times before you get to camp. Have the shaman slow on incoming. The shaman won't pull aggy because you have built so much hate with snare.  Tank for awhile and have the warrrior taunt without attacking again. When a taunt is successful back off. The mob will stay with the warrior because of proximity aggro. <br />
<br />
Taunt is all or nothing. It either works or it doesn't. <br />
<br />
Now put your wizard to work. With the warrior just standing there, doing nothing. No taunting, no attacking, no begging. <br />
Have your wizard unleash hell... no concussion please.<br />
Depending on the level and the &quot;magic hate&quot; of the mob the wizard can nuke, and nuke, and nuke. Even if the warrior doesn't attack at all they can hold aggy from your snares probably until the mob is dead. <br />
<br />
If someone taunts off you they get all your hate, and no one can take it away until they build more hate than you built.<br />
<br />
You can use this same strategy for boss level mobs (especially luclin ubers) When you move into a room have each tank in your raid fire an arrow at the mob to set rampage then you start snaring, tangling weeds, and flame licking. Just keep this up while the clerics work out their complete heal order. Mob AE hits you or you get nuked? Just heal yourself, and you are adding aggy.  When everyone is ready just have the main tank walk up to the mob, fire up the heal rotation, and they start taunting. The second they get attacked this means they landed a successful taunt. Now the entire raid can go full burn and melees can assist with NO FEAR of anyone pulling aggro. <br />
<br />
For unrooted mobs you can do a variation of this strategy (AoW for instance)  IF you can kite while building aggy do so, if the mob has special effects or other nastiness just pull it into position, hit weaponshield, and keep snaring and tangling weeds for 10 seconds. After this send a tell to the main tank and have them AE taunt off you. Make sure they don't AE taunt before you are done casting, and give them a few seconds to get some attacks in. Until you and the MT coordinate timing you will probably die (if you want to get really fancy you can have a cleric use the nifty Divine Aura others AA ability to save your ass after AE taunt), but 3-4 snares give the main tank a HUGE start on aggro for a fight. You won't see many wizards getting summoned unless they really get out of hand.<br />
<br />
Good luck in your tests, and have fun. You are an aggro management scientist now.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u84"><b>Strikingone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p84">Interesting Posts.<br />
<br />
<br />
The warrior class has always been my main class so I would like to share my view of taunt.<br />
<br />
I could swear I read Absor post a long time ago that a successful taunt will either Generate a certain amount of agro or put you +1 hate over the current person at the top of the hate list. <br />
<br />
To support my thoughts on taunt, and it providing agro.<br />
<br />
Enchanter mezzes. /assist mob then shows he is on top of list.<br />
I taunt a couple times hoping to get a successful taunt and then /assist mob, will generally show the mob is now agroed on me.<br />
<br />
Now, say for instance One warrior of a similar level takes a mob down to 50% and I jump in and start taunting, I can assure you that I generally do not get agro until I get enough taunts in to eventually catch up to his hate level. Once I catch up to his hate level, the mob will then flip flop as we will be matching each others hate +1 on each other, but it will not be immediate. If that was the case we would not require Area taunt for clean tank switches.<br />
<br />
One of my favorite pulls is by a shammy who has slowed a mob, the reason being is that if taunt is successful, we get that much hate off the start and its a nice base to work on.<br />
<br />
The problem I see with warriors is the first 10 seconds of a fight.<br />
It is quite often that a proc will not land, and the first taunt is failed when a slow is tried, that leaves me with my /shield ability on my slower, and me waiting 5 seconds to hope taunt works again as well as my weapons proccing.<br />
<br />
Hybrids have it much easier because they can use their agro abilitys from a range, as well as stack their agro like EB weapons do, while warriors gotta hope they get a proc.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>Giland</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">My take on it is this<br />
Depending on your taunt skill, taunt has the abilty to generate a specific amount of agro, or  putting you 1 point over the person who is currently on top, whichever is the lowest value.<br />
If you are already on top, taunt generates no hate at all.<br />
<br />
I tested this with a 54 wizard casting ice comet on wyverns in CS and a 57 ranger tanking them.<br />
If the wizard cast ice comet right off the pull, the ranger would need two successful taunts to regain agro. Sometimes 3 were required, but I would guess I had one failure.<br />
Casting a lower end nuke (the 640 damage firebased one) would only require 1 taunt if successful. Since I was two boxing, I could time my taunt to be within a second of the spell landing. That was all the taunt that was required.<br />
If I pre-taunted, then the spell hit, the mob would go to the wizard until I was able to taunt again. That would signify that since I can single taunt get agro after the spell, but could not keep agro if taunted before the spell, I was getting no additional agro by pretaunting.<br />
<br />
Now, here is an idea. Does sitting generate agro?<br />
If so, then a warrior taunting a mob that is agroed on a person sitting would increase to that amount. When the person stood, their agro would be reduced, thereby putting the warrior signficantly higher than them.<br />
Perhaps there is actually 2 agro lists, and sitting creates agro on the second one. Your total agro is a total of the two. Taunt only works on the first list, not the second. A caster would have to wait till their total agro (actual + sitting) was below the warriors actual before they could sit.<br />
Any thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u86"><b>Rhick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p86">If both players are in melee range of a mob the warrior can not turn it with taunt alone. They must do damage on top of taunt to turn the mob.<br />
<br />
Taunt may match hate +1, but the mob needs hate +100 to turn or something.  If a player is not in melee range, or leaves melee range after a successful taunt then the mob will turn towards the warrior.<br />
<br />
As far as the number of taunts required to turn a mob... I don't think it matters if you have 500 or 10,000 hate points over the taunter. A single taunt will match that hate if that taunt is successful. Try snaring a mob 20 times before you pull it to group, then see how many taunts it takes to turn mob on average. Then snare 1 time before pulling. From my tests it takes the same number of taunts, but I think everyone should prove it for themselves.<br />
