<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone been having flag issues lately? I killed Bertox with the guild I'm applying to, hailed the projection and got the yellow text, went back and did the preflags ... but the seer and the Elder still give me the text that says I need him dead.<br />
<br />
Guide said they would escalate it to a GM, but for some reason I'm not very hopeful :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Do you have carprin and grummus?  Also, you said that you had to go back and do preflags.  After you did that, did you go to the seer and &quot;unlock memories&quot;?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I received Carpin before Bertoxx - this was the guild's last run on those MoBs so they let me tag along for that. I did Grummus a week before hand.<br />
<br />
And now this is the million dollar question that's going to make me feel like a complete ninny ...<br />
<br />
Does &quot;Unlock memories&quot; do something other than &quot;Guided meditation&quot;?<br />
<br />
If so, feel free to throw pies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">&quot;unlock memories&quot; is a function that re-aligns the order of your flags.  If you did things in the wrong order, it resets them to be in the right order.  Try that and see if it fixes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Repost the text from the seer and we may be able to help you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you killed Saryrn before Bertox, then your flag order is screwed up, and you need to unlock memories.<br />
<br />
Another common sticky point is with the Thelin part of the Terris Thule flag. You need to hail Thelin like 4 different times. Skipping one of them makes it so your flags get put wrong, and you can't zone into places you should be able to (SolRo+).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Assuming you have Grummus' PP hailed for flag, and Bertox's PP hailed for flag, this is how you get that flag fixed up:<br />
<br />
Go to PoD entrance.<br />
Hail Adler outside of it (last name is somethign like Fehrstel)<br />
say &quot;what ward&quot;<br />
Hail him again.<br />
Go to the seer and unlock memories.<br />
Go to his brother in the sick room in potranq.<br />
Hail his brother (named is soemthing like Elder Fehrstel) to get a character flag.<br />
Go to the seer and unlock memories.<br />
Go back to his brother again and hail him.<br />
If everything goes ok, you should get a character flag and he will say &quot;welcome back friend...&quot;.<br />
<br />
I used to think that Saryrn's flags were somehow intermingled Bertox, but I'm not sure.  I know you can get Bertox flag without having any of Saryrn's flags.  I think you need Bertox to get Saryrn though.<br />
<br />
If you are having problems with Saryrn's flag, first make sure you have the hedge trial completed, you've killed Terris Thule, and you've gotten the flag from the Keeper of Sorrows.<br />
Go to Adroha Something in the sick room in potranq.<br />
Hail her.<br />
Say &quot;tortured by nightmares&quot; or something like that for character flag.  (if you hail her and talk to her, you can find out the trigger text for yourself for the flag).<br />
Go to the seer and unlock memories.<br />
Go to the sick room again and hail the guy lying on the floor next to Adroha.<br />
You should get a character flag.<br />
(At this point you *may* need full Bertox flag to progress.  I'm not sure though)<br />
Go to Fahlia Something and hail her.<br />
Say &quot;what plane of torment&quot;.<br />
Say &quot;I will go&quot;.<br />
You should get a character flag.<br />
Go to the Seer and unlock memories.<br />
That should complete your Saryrn flag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You're probably missing some simple hail step. Try what Juujuu suggested and see if that works.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, do &quot;Unlock my memories&quot; until you get no more character flags, then do &quot;guided meditation&quot; and report the text from the seer to us. Experienced flag experts will be able to tell from that exactly what is missing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">That saryn/bertox mix is pretty screwy due to the large number of hails required.  I had Saryn before TT before Bertox, I hailed guys for an hour (with intermittend &quot;unlocks&quot;) until I finally got the Saryn preflag and was able to &quot;unlock&quot; the whole mess.</div></div><hr />
