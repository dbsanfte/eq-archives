<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bonethug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I think  i have good overall gear...but i think i am lacking in hps. Any suggestions would help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">For helm I'd sugguest a Circlet of the Falinkan loose a little ac but gain on hps mana.<br />
<br />
For 1 ring i'd sugguest Regal band of Bathezid if you can handle the faction work. For the other either get at least the 9th ring or stop wearing your coldain ring. Valorium Ring of Gallantry or Di'zok Signet of Service make a good second ring.<br />
<br />
For arms Supple Armadillo Scale Sleeves of a PoS mini boss are nice or Hurricane Chain Sleeves once you can get into BoT and gather the materials to make em.<br />
<br />
Gloves get coldain skin, shissar scale or Stormrider Gauntlets are all nice options.<br />
<br />
For the belt Girdle of Mithaniel or Cord of Nobility are both very nice options. Barbed Rubicite Belt is still nice and should be pretty cheap.<br />
<br />
Rotting Flesh Kilt is nice for legs but probably not cheap to buy. Hurricane Chain Leggings is a nice options if you can get the stuff for it and have a friendly smith. Decayed Chain Links sell pretty cheap on my server and are still a nice peice.<br />
<br />
For range slot Talisman of Benevolence is a nice peice. Advanced Magic Manual is also pretty nice. Wicked Bone Atlatl has descent stats and a nice focus effect. There always some of the new pottery made items that you can use in the range slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I am impressed that you made it to 65 with such low hp... I get nervous with only 2200 unbuffed hp, with canni V...<br />
<br />
Anyway, some advice, just off the top of my head...<br />
<br />
Get your ninth ring if possible, that's where you get hp/sta from, before that, I'd wear another ring, perhaps another velium fire wedding ring (65 hp) and bank the 8th ring. 8 str aint doing you anything. Or you can gather the parts for the vallorian rings, which have more hp/sta, from PoV.<br />
<br />
Girdle of Mithandrael for your belt, it's a rare drop from HoH, has 50 hp 10sta.<br />
<br />
Talisman of Beneviolence for your range if you are on dragon faction, has same wis but 35 hp.<br />
<br />
I'd replace the JBB... I've just found it has no use in PoP. 264 point damage is nothing for that cast time, doesn't even do a dent... my jbb has been in the bank since I got flagged.<br />
<br />
Head, circlet of the Faulkaen or Slime Covered Coif.<br />
<br />
Legs... Thurg or better.<br />
<br />
What's the graphic on the acid scarred tunic by the way? nice tunic.<br />
<br />
Hands - coldain skin gloves.<br />
<br />
Just some ideas :)</div></div><hr />
