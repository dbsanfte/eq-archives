<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mussles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have just started on upgrades from being absent for aprox 1.5 yrs. I am now trying to get the 3 books from Lord Ghoisk for the epic. Unfortunately my guild has nearly disappeared since my leave and I have basically no Velious faction at this time. I am now PoP enabled and wondering what equipment I should strive to get. Along with where I should hunt for the best exp. You expert advice would be greatly appreciated and respected! :confused:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ScRuBbA</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">you have way too much wis, nuff said....<br />
<br />
horse is good, if you have the money, circled toe bones, shadel/velium fire ring, silver hammer earring, shissar gaunts, crystal spider eyes/exec veil, pauldrons of witness, iksar bp probably better just for regen, brown chitin leggings, tribal war boots, anything is better than jade chokidai thingy, i would sell lodi and get a hiero cloak, and cant think of any good belts at the moment..<br />
<br />
you might want to consider getting into another more active guild so you can start raiding and improving that way, velious faction isnt hard to do at all, takes about a week or less to max faction with whichever you pick, dwarves/dragons or giants<br />
<br />
after you get some more hp and horse, you can do CoM U-turn or temple if its camped, or try HHK if its not permacamped, sebilis for cash drops, or PoJ exit with a melee partner..... after 55 disease and nightmare are good<br />
<br />
hit 60, get torpor and malo before u do anything (grinding aaxp is what most people do) then 61/62 if you manage to acquire those spells via ethereal turnins, 60+ do whatever you can, beg, annoy, bribe, anything to get flagged for valor/storms, after you see the exp from these zones everywhere else is a waste of time compared to it.<br />
<br />
1 more thing: cheapest horse is 7-8k with 130 CHA or whatever i believe, and if you cant get ghiosk books, just faction it and get into a fear raid...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sanosake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Check out my gear at 51. Should give you some good ideas. Get rid of those peice of **** armor:<br />
<br />
Coldain Skin Boots<br />
Sun Leggins<br />
7wis rings<br />
Follower's Sleeves<br />
3wis earring<br />
7wis mask<br />
<br />
You wont lose much wis, but you'll gain at least ~400 hp and TONS of more AC.</div></div><hr />

Get to max vendor charisma and they are 8400.  Buy a couple of CHA steins if you need to.</div></div><hr />
