<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>rad100</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I went to eq toolbox and downloaded all maps, extracted them, and still can't get them to work. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong, maybe I'm extracting them into the wrong folder, but it's a little annoying not having maps for zones that everyone else has. I tried deleting all eq maps files and re-downloading them but that didn't work. Anyone know what i can do to get these damn things to work?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">try typing /load maps when you are in eq. alternatively make sure that they havent actually loaded..... sometimes when you start eq the map is really magnified and looks blank... click on the height filter box to make sure it is off, and then click on zoom out a bunch to see.</div></div><hr />

<br />
     I know this may sound stupid, but if you unzip the maps into the maps directory in Everquest while you are in game, you must zone in order for the maps to start showing.</div></div><hr />
