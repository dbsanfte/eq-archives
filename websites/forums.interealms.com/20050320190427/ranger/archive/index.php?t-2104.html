Chimps should have right to attorney, say campaigners<br />
By David Usborne in New York<br />
26 April 2002<br />
It sounds like the script for a Hollywood comedy, but plans are being hatched in the United States to give chimpanzees the chance to file suits in a court of law.<br />
<br />
The endeavour is being spearheaded by the Chimpanzee Collaboratory, a new coalition of researchers and animal welfare advocates who contend that the 1,500 chimpanzees held in captivity in the US need legal protection from abuse by humans.<br />
<br />
And support is coming from some important quarters. The head of software company RealNetworks, Rob Glaser, has contributed $1m (£690,000) to the effort while several academic figures have stepped forward to voice their approval.<br />
<br />
A chimpanzee can communicate on roughly the same level as a three or four-year-old human, using sign language. Children most certainly have legal status in the courts, even if guardians file actions for them. In the same way, third parties, such as animal rights activists, would be able to represent the chimpanzees in the courts.<br />
<br />
&quot;If a human four-year-old has what it takes for legal personhood, then a chimpanzee should be able to be a legal person in terms of legal rights,&quot; Steven Wise, a Harvard University lecturer and author of a book, Rattling the Cage, told The Wall Street Journal. He noted that the primates share 98.7 per cent of their DNA with human beings.<br />
<br />
Questions will be asked, however. Is this not a case of America taking its affection for litigation to almost barmy extremes? And where will it end? What about cats and dogs? And goldfish?<br />
<br />
Chimpanzees have attracted attention because they are the closest to us in demeanour and intelligence. And there are myriad temptations to mistreat them, because they are so useful in medical research.<br />
<br />
Accordingly, some in the biomedical profession are already mobilising to thwart the Chimpanzee Collaboratory. &quot;The chimpanzee example is the beginning of what we view as a slippery slope,&quot; suggested Frankie Trull, president of the National Association for Biomedical Research.<br />
<br />
&quot;What concerns us is the increasingly litigious nature of those who believe that no animal should be used for any reason.&quot;</div></div><hr />

About 1.3 percent of its DNA</div></div><hr />

<br />
Knowing that, should we deny 4 year olds a right to live out their life as they wish as well? No, of course not.... but we've already said a Chimp is just like a 4 year old, so why not them? They are virtually humans themselves.<br />
<br />
You guys can make fun of this case all you like, but you can't give a damning reason why they should be treated like lesser creatures as long as they are so similar to your fellow human beings. Ok, maybe you can.. there's a challenge for you.<br />
<br />
Some might recall a certain race of humans being treated like common animals in the United States, too. Rightfully so, they were given equal rights over time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VaderJM4</div><div class="date">04-30-2002, 08:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not so. They are not human, discrimination and racism was wrong, not granting equal rights to animals is not the same.<br />
<br />
That 3 or 4 percent difference is absolutely EVERYTHING. It gives us mozart, it gives us society, government, space travel, and the millions upon millions of thing that makes us better than chimps.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Haha, I ripped that mozart thing from some movie, think it was congo.</div></div><hr />

But what happens if some days there is something more intelligent than a chimp.  If it talks like a human, thinks like a human, but isn't a human, what do we do? <br />
Then we'll deal with that when it happens. Making laws to protect a non-sapient animal today is not the way to protect the potential sapient non-human of tomorrow.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jorana</div><div class="date">04-30-2002, 10:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The case does have some merit.  Every year, thousands of new lawyers pass the bar and are admitted into a profession that the older lawyers hang around in forever.  Simply put, the new lawyers have run out of clients and have to turn somewhere to to practice.  Hence the chimp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So does this mean it is perfectly ok to use the profoundly mentally retarded as medical test subjects?  They are not capable of abstract thought.  They will not develop beyond the capacity of a 4 year old.  Heck some of them can't even communicate using sign language.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually that's not really true.  Apes have been taught sign-language, been taught how to draw and other similar abstract ideas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ronarin</div><div class="date">04-30-2002, 10:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, my previous post on this subject was deliberately provocative.  I do believe there is a need to conduct medical tests using animal subjects before conducting the same tests in human beings.  Why?  Because from my world view most human beings are more important than other animals.  This means that I'm less moved by seeing a chimp suffer horrible side effects from an experimental drug  than I am by seeing a human being suffer from the horrible side effects of an experimental drug.  I don't know if this is right but it is how I feel.<br />
<br />
This doesn't mean medical labs should be allowed to treat their animal subjects cruelly.  If a medical lab wishes to use high order primates as test subjects then they should be required to provide as comfortable an environment as possible while still maintaining propper scientific controls.<br />
<br />
 <br />
Oh and if you read through the hyperbole of the Independent article the main goal of the Chimpanzee Collaboratory appears to be ensuring humane treatment of chimpanzees.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
And thanks Ronarin, that's pretty much what I was getting at.<br />
They are trying to draw a definite line somewhere. Chimps are way too similar to functioning human beings, and they are given extremely limited rights... bordering on none at all. I think they deserve more rights, at least legal representation.<br />
<br />
Tell me.. what is a 'human'? A shape? A state of mind?<br />
<br />
We're monkeys too, in case you all weren't aware. We're nothing but glorified chimps when you get down to the nitty gritty of it, so why shouldn't we give the same respect to a similar animal? It's practically one of our own.<br />
<br />
Some of you too quickly throw out these cases thinking they are stupid without really delving in to it. I don't feel 'strongly' about this or anything, but I do believe in what I am saying and trying to offer a counter-argument.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantom042</div><div class="date">05-01-2002, 02:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First off, I believe in humane treatment of animals.<br />
<br />
Despite this, if companies aren't testing on animals, they will be testing on prison inmates. It's been done before. Too much money is at stake, in the form of potential earnings and lawsuits, to not test on someone.<br />
<br />
All animals should be treated as well as possible. If there is widespread mistreatment, then maybe apointing legal advocates for abused animals is a reasonable solution.</div></div><hr />

I am aware, and we are not monkeys. We did NOT evolve from them. They are NOT practically one of my own. This is all I will say about this. I will not reply again in this thread.

BUT!!!!! Do we need to waste money on more legislation on points of law that already  indicate what is and isn't legal?<br />
I mean, is this going to make  the same actions MORE illegal? Its like gun control laws, drug laws,  and the like. What, do these new laws denote degree of illegality?<br />
And we wonder why there is so much waste in government spending.<br />
Before anyone jumps on this I know its not the government doing this but by the same token, this is exactly something it would pull.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have had pets. Grew up with a pet cat, and now own two Jack Russell Terriers that I love very much.<br />
<br />
Let me add these items. (With an assumption as to where you are going with this)<br />
<br />
A) They have NO legal rights. I would never abuse them, mis-treat them, or want harm to come to them at all. I would probably even risk my own safety to a certain degree to protect or help them.<br />
<br />
B) They do NOT have a soul. They are not aware of their own mortality and they do not spend time wondering what they are doing here, or where they may end up after death.<br />
<br />
I apologize if my assumptions are wrong, and please, feel free to correct me in that case, or ask me any other questions that may cross your mind.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elwin</div><div class="date">05-02-2002, 01:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You answered my next question already, which was do you love your pets. We won't argue if an animal does/doesn't have a soul. For the record I believe they do, but we'll save that discussion for some other time.<br />
<br />
I have two dogs. They are like my brothers, and I do love them like I would love a brother or another family member. <br />
<br />
In spite of the fact you believe them to not possess a soul, you have grown quite attached to them. You probably can tell that they love you too, much like another human would. A chimp would have those same feelings, capable of possessing them and sharing them. So why shouldn't it be protected under law, especially considering it can communicate better than a dog or cat? If you can't see why they should be defended because they are unintelligent, unevolved, or due to lack of a soul, look to your compassion. If you have no compassion for such a creature in your heart, there's nothing I can do for you.<br />
<br />
I also believe dogs and cats should have better rights. They are domestic animals that are very close to many human's lives. People grow very fond of them.. willing to lay down their own lives, and often those pets lay down their lives too. Some dogs or cats even add to Human society. Some people wish to have more defended under law than just other Humans. That's why I believe this case isn't a waste, or 'dumb'.<br />
<br />
There's more to this planet and country than just 'us'. Law exists to protect. It should protect all of our interests, Human or otherwise.</div></div><hr />

People put people on ignore because they're annoyed by them. Even if I didn't agree with Kullaas, Nitefox or Taly some of the time, I never thought of putting them on ignore, because their opinions are usually well thought out.<br />

If you are doing it to be annoying, then see above. If you are doing it to add something to each thread, then more power to you.</div></div><hr />

I try to add comedy, I dunno how accepted that is by you, but if you wish, I'll try to be more serious, but that probably wouldn't be wise, because that's what I was on VaderJM3.</div></div><hr />

This is the problem with you Vader. You think your comedy should be appreciated everywhere. That's not true. The excuse that you're just a poor misunderstood jokester doesn't work.<br />
<br />
Posting in a thread about the death of a celebrity is not the place for comedy. Posting jokes in the middle of a debate is not the place for it. Posting witty or snide remarks while a woman is sharing her latest bout with depression is not the place for it. There is a place for it where it won't bother anybody. <br />
<br />
Learn the proper places for it and you won't have a problem.</div></div><hr />

Chimps, gorillas and orangutans only get as close to our family tree as the super family. Whether you believe we were all created whole, or evolved from a common ancestor, humans are still FAR more than glorified monkeys.

If you can't see why they should be defended because they are unintelligent, unevolved, or due to lack of a soul, look to your compassion. If you have no compassion for such a creature in your heart, there's nothing I can do for you.<br />
<br />
I have already said that I would be willing to some degree to risk my own safety for them so I think the &quot;no compassion in my heart&quot; comment and argument has to be left aside. I obviously have compassion for them. In situations like this I am able to separate my compassion or feelings about a subject from my intellectual understanding of right and wrong. An example: If I where to come across someone beating up my Wife/Mother/Sister or God Forbid raping one of them, there is a good chance I would take their life because of how I felt. Of course that would not make the action right. I can feel compassion without letting it dictate my better judgement. <br />
<br />
You have said that we need to leave the soul argument aside, well I would say that is about 90% of my argument against this, so we are about done with this exchange of views.<br />
<br />
The other 10% of my argument is based on this. Without comparing apes of any sort to humans, (since regardless of how close to us you believe they are, they are NOT human) what argument can you give for them having legal rights? Remember NO comparing them to humans, children, mentally disabled, etc. I doubt you will be able to come up with one, so I will leave you with this as my argument, NOTHING other than Human beings have any legal rights in this country. <br />
<br />
The defense rests. :)</div></div><hr />

Damn shame too, especially if you know a homo sap or three :( I can't think of another animal I've known who was less trustworthy.<br />

And as for a soul... *shakes head* Your heaven is going to be a barren place.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The defense rests. :) <br />
Au contraire - from Colorado statute:<br />
(1)(a) A person commits cruelty to animals if he knowingly or with criminal negligence overdrives, overloads, overworks, tortures, torments, deprives of necessary sustenance, unnecessarily or cruelly beats, needlessly mutilates, needlessly kills, carries or confines in or upon any vehicles in a cruel or reckless manner, or otherwise mistreats<br />
or neglects any animal, or causes or procures it to be done, or, having the charge of custody of any animal, fails to provide it with proper food, drink, or protection from the weather, or abandons it.<br />
<br />
(b) Any person who intentionally abandons a dog or cat commits the offense of cruelty to animals.<br />
It sure sounds to me like animals have the right to be free from torture, torment, overwork, starvation, beating, needless killing, etc. The example is from Colorado, but just about every state has SOME form of animal cruelty statute.<br />
<br />
My point isn't that animals deserve nothing - it is that animals deserve no more than the rights already granted. I am perfectly willing to sacrifice a few chimps to find a cure to Alzheimer's disease, AIDS, Cancer, MS, etc. If you told me right now that you had a 10% chance of finding a cure for my son's autism, but the research would kill 5,000 chimpanzees, I'd go to Africa and help you find them, pack them up, and bring them into the country if you asked me to. THAT'S where I stand. <br />
<br />
Humans &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; All other animals</div></div><hr />

<br />
What gives us this right? How do we justify that and maintain ourselves as being moral and ethical people? Can you answer that for me Myrea? I am interested, because I can't think of a reason within my own ethic boundries as to why we deserve to be superior to the point of metaphorically crushing all other creatures beneath our heel for our own agendas.<br />
<br />
I am aware animals are tested upon for benevolent ends such as curing diseases, but to me there is still a lot of grey area there. I can't say it is without a doubt the right thing to do, because it comes at a potential fatal price.<br />
<br />
Also, what if a HUMAN cares enough for an animal that he/she would wish it to be protected with law? I would not wish any harm to come to my dog. He is as equally important to me whether he have four legs or two.</div></div><hr />

Myrea, I thought your son had aspergers.  If so, don't call it autism, there are significant differences between the two.<br />
<br />
Kullaas, I know a hell of a lot more about my son's disability than you do. Asperger's Syndrome is an autism-specturm disorder. <br />
<br />
Asperger's Disorder is &quot;a milder variant of Autistic Disorder. Both Asperger's Disorder and Autistic Disorder are in fact subgroups of a larger diagnostic category. This larger category is called either Autistic Spectrum Disorders or Pervasive Developmental Disorders&quot; according to Dr. R. Kaan Ozbayrak of the University of Massachusetts Medical School.<br />
<br />
Asperger syndrome is the term applied to the mildest and highest functioning end of what is known as the spectrum of pervasive developmental disorders (or theautism spectrum).<br />
<br />
It is thought that the type of autism demonstrated by Dustin Hoffman in Rainman is closer to Asperger's than any other form of autism.<br />
<br />
There are also significant differences between chicken pox and shingles, but they have the same root viral cause.</div></div><hr />

Don't try to tell me that you are more in tune with the cause of someone else's problems than FOUR doctors at one of the premier children's medical facilities in the world have diagnosed.<br />

If you're looking to make my ignore list, you're doing a great job.<br />
If you'd care to make informed comments, you can check out the National Institute of Health and their take on autism:<br />
http://www.nichd.nih.gov/publications/pubs/autism/facts/sub7.htm#Wha <br />
What conditions are included in the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) category?<br />
<br />
Currently, ASD includes:<br />
<br />
Autistic disorder (sometimes called classic autism) <br />
Asperger syndrome <br />
Childhood disintegrative disorder (CDD) <br />
Rett syndrome <br />
Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (PDDNOS) or atypical autism <br />
Depending on his or her specific symptoms, a person with autism can be in any one of these categories.</div></div><hr />

I stand corrected. Thank you for pointing that out. I do agree with the &quot;rights&quot; that animals already have. I would hate for anyone to get away with &quot;torture, torment, overwork, starvation, beating, needless killing, etc.&quot; of an animal. They however do not however have the right to an attorney or to be considered on the same level as humans.<br />

No, Heaven will be filled with more love, peace and joy than any one of us can imagine.<br />

<br />
We (Humans) are superior to all other animals because of who's likeness within which we where made. It really is that simple. Of course I do not endorsee or agree with &quot;crushing all other creatures beneath our heel for our own agendas.&quot;  I prefer to love my dogs as the pets they are, thank God for bringing them into my life, and continue to be able to understand quite easily how we are superior to them.</div></div><hr />

As I said in the beginning of this talk, our views are based on very different beliefs and those are not going to be changed. We will agree to disagree and as you said, thank you for the interesting exchange of ideas in a mature and considerate manner. :)</div></div><hr />
