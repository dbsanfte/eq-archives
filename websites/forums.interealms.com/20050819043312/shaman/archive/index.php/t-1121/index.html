<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ralahast-BB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just dinged 25 tonight, was wondering if Alchemy is worth it to work on right away, or should i wait a few levels, Im not overly rich but Alchemy has been something that always seemed cool to me :) any input is apreciated.. Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>WM231NIKE</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Wait until 29 at least.  Just put the trainer practice points in until then.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">When I think of all the time and money I've wasted on Alchemy... <br />
<br />
With the money I sunk into alchemy I could have bought Malo <br />
and Torpor AND the fast horse by now. Without the time wasted, <br />
I'd be level 60 now with enough AA points for at least can5, if not <br />
more. <br />
<br />
The potions produced aren't worth the cost to most players. You'll<br />
never make your money back. <br />
<br />
My advice is don't waste your time and money on alchemy.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">do alchemy. good distraction from the game, sow potions are a good source of income for a mid 30's shaman, ITU potions are invaluable, shrink potions are invaluable for a raid, port potions are damn handy, damageshield potions are damn handy, MR resist potions are damn handy, as are many other things about it. Alchemy is not too profitable, endgame, but its a skill worth having. (150 skill atm myself)<br />
<br />
Alchemy - its damn handy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">learn SOW potions then stop.  Any higher and you pissing money away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">25k pp to get alchemy from 20 to 160 or so.<br />
<br />
Amount of that recovered in sales to players? = 0<br />
<br />
They should have given shaman a class AA ability for Alchemy like they did for chanters with JC. 3 skill points and your chance at failure decreases 50%.<br />
<br />
(maybe they did and I don't know).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd say learn Shrink and then stop.  Shrink gets your skill to 70, which cuts down a LOT on failures.  Going from SOW-trivial to Shrink-trivial cut my average cost from about 75-80 for a 10-dose of SOW to about 68 per 10-dose.  I recovered about 600p of the 1k I spent getting it up there by selling ITU and Shrink potions (although it took a while), and the hundreds of SOW that I've made and sold then have been 10p cheaper to make each.<br />
<br />
The secret to making money at it - no secret, really, just preparedness and persistance.   Always have 3-5 on you; make an auction button and hit it every 15 minutes or every time you zone if not grouped or otherwise busy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Targar - Yes we have a class ability to reduce alchemy failures.  Course you've got to spend 18 points in class (that means 6 regular and 12 arch before that), which is an incredible waste if you ask me =)<br />
<br />
As for the original post, don't bother starting alchemy at 25.  It's level capped, so the furthest you can get is to a skill of 5.  You're not going to make anything useful until about level 32? or so, when SoW potions start to get makeable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Actually, there is an entire section of this board that is devoted to Alchemy...you might want to discuss it there.  Plus there are quite a few excellent threads already there.</div></div><hr />
