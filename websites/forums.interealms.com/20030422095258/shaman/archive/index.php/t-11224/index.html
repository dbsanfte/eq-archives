<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>lalebeq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">please a simple question....can i start the first part in OOT if i am lvl 47?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">yes. the SHAMAN epic can be done at any level.<br />
good luck</div></div><hr />

I was under the distinct impression that any and all epic quest npcs would not speak to you if you were under 50. Have I been mislead....?</div></div><hr />

<br />
sort of. you can't do some epics til your 50. i think the ranger epic for one..<br />
<br />
the shaman epic can and has been done at level 5<br />
you have to MQ the tear, that's all.<br />
<br />
you can be holding the epic at any level as long as you have max ally and a shaman to mq the tear.<br />
<br />
as for the question you certainly can do the oot part, i did that at like lvl 30. however you might wanna just kill peg leg in BB or one of the others - saves you the run out to OOT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">yeh, peg leg is BB is fast and easy and seeing no ones there he's a sure pop. BTW i did it and there were 3 bandits but no pegleg, you have to kill all the bandis and pegleg will pop in about 5 mins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yep, and Blinde the Cutpurse in Rathe Mts is good, too.  He's on top of the hill in the Cyclops valley.  <br />
<br />
At 47, you can solo everything through the Test of Wisdom (Tabien and Glaron were OK fights, but forgone conclusions, at 34 solo).  <br />
<br />
With 2 full groups of friends that level, you can do Black Dire.  With BIG friends, you can do Dire with tons less folks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>CrankyPK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Just did Black Dire with my 56 monk and 52 shammy solo.. was total cake.  Walked through all the noob mobs, BD wasnt up.. so i waltzed in and downed Advisor real fast.  Jumped out of the tower and went back to the wolf, who was now up.  Pulled him and two gargoyles and didnt get below 75% health.  Black Dire is cake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>lowkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The shaman epic is no longer completable below 46. I recently tried with my froglok shaman at 29, the Sentinel Spirit in EJ ate the iksar scale saying &quot;How did one as inexperienced you as you get this! I'll make sure its returned to the proper owners.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Did it again at 46, no problems.</div></div><hr />
