<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Koraden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well there seems to be a bit of the market for sow potions at the moment and i was wondering about a few things.<br />
<br />
1. What level (skill) do i need to be to make selling SoW potions cost effective?<br />
<br />
2. What is the cheapest way to progress to the above mentioned skill level?<br />
<br />
3. Roughly how much will the cheapest way to progress to the above - above metioned skill level cost me in pp?<br />
<br />
I have actually played around with alchemy in the past when i was level 30 or so, but i ran out of pp and decided to level instead.<br />
<br />
I'd appreciate any advice, Cheers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mordaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hmm, make potions. Bout 100 skill and they will be at min triv ( 5% failure ). Course you don't say your current skill level so bout 2kpp...rooughly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">At skill 70 my SoW failure rate was pretty near 5%.  That coincides with trivial skill for shrink positions so I stopped there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah I also stopped near shrink potion trivial, think I'm going to raise it more though. Failing a ton of shrink potions sucks, specially when I need to keep my SK stacked with them :)</div></div><hr />
