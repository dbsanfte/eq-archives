<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Toshizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What is the best form of solo to be used at level 10-15. Then 24-35+   By this I mean such as root and rot or kite and so on.<br />
<br />
thanks any help would be great</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There was a great thread on this, which I thought was in the combat and tactics forum, but I wasn't able to find it so now I'm wonderin where it went.  At any rate, for your level there are a lot less tactics then there are for higher level shaman.  In fact, I can think of only three tactics:<br />
<br />
1)  Root/Rot (Root a mob, DoT it with every DoT you have, re-root it, rinse repeat)<br />
2)  Kiting (more viable since that patch the other day; throw a few DoTs on a mob then let it chase you around until it dies)<br />
3)  DoT the mob and melee it (only do this if you have good AC).<br />
<br />
And then of course there is grouping.  At later levels, you can add in:<br />
<br />
4) Pet Kiting (like regular kiting, only you let your pet nip at its heels while you kite)<br />
5) Pet Tank (you slow the mob, pet tanks, you cast spells)<br />
<br />
Getting back to your original question, I found root-rotting to be the best form of experience at your level, though a good group generally was better exp.  Of course, this was before they removed the kiting penalty *shrug*.  I'd say just experiment and find what works for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">10-15 : melee, melee, and melee,<br />
<br />
24-35: root+dot+canni or slow+melee+dot ; go melee if you are twink, or root+dot is boreing, better get group which make exp lots faster</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Toshizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">thanks guys after I posted I remembered that there was the hunting forum and kicked myself, anyway thanks a ton.</div></div><hr />
