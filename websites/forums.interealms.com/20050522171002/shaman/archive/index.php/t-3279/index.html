<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I decided to raise my alchemy last night. Started at 70 and made nothing but grow potions. about 14k and 3 hours later I was at 172. Wisdom was at 255 the whole time, cha was at 130ish. Your mileage may vary. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I did the same thing at the beginning of the week but I started at 103 and went to 180.  It's a good feeling to finally get that done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lumppy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My question is WHY??<br />
<br />
Once we are able to make SoW and Shrink potions is there really any reason to get our skill above say 110?? Other than to just say our skill is at 180 and make the odd gate or DS potion. To me alchemy is a waste of money and time. If there was somthing we could really do with this skill then I would invest in it.<br />
<br />
Look what you can do as a Jeweler or a tinker then compair it to alchemy. Bahh <br />
<br />
Only my opinion and we all know what opinions are like -- we all have one:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My guild is interested in gate potions, DS potions, regen potions and those insta heals made with giant toes.  I told them if they bring me herbs, I'll click them. It's nice to be able do this for guildmates.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Because we can and no one else can. Gate potions come in handy plus DS potions are VERY nice for raiding. The insta heals will be nice too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you have the money in the bank and are not saving up for gear, why not :)  its fun to say you have maxed your alchemy.  i just need to sit down and grind out those last 6 points, but i just keep finding more fun things to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Last night a group of us were killing Thought Horrors on the far side of the pit in The Deep.  Our druid got sick and had to leave.  No problem, I have gate potions with me.  He leaves, we stay, and the melees can still get out when we're done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">10+ to all resists isnt that bad either.<br />
<br />
<br />
what the hell else am I going to do with my plat?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Yesferatu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Bah, by the time any of us are of a decent level to max out Alchemy, 20k to go from 1 to 180 shouldn't be that big a deal.<br />
How many other tradeskills can say that?  Pottery isn't as useful and most other stuff takes forever or is much more expensive, ever try jewelcraft or fletching?<br />
<br />
<br />
I wish we maxed higher, but I'd say alchemy is definately worth the trouble if you have the cash.<br />
<br />
Tell me a 30 point damage shield wouldn't help a soloing shaman...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>DanninSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">lol, if you are really into torturing yourself try getting tailoring to say...  175 let alone 250 :P<br />
<br />
<br />
alchemy is nice for utility and can be very useful, shrink/DS/Insta Heal for raids..    cure disease/poison/insta heal for pvp..    gates for when you are in a hurry and cant find a port ..   DS/Regen for twinks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">They are nice for an older established guild but  myself they just cost too damn much to skill up.  14k :p  I wish I had that,  I'd get a JBB .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">21kpp to hit 180, and I only use it to make DS potions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mooshfu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yea the DS/STinging worts caught interest in my eye. Alchemy at 70, I make the counteract disease/poison for my SK to duel =)</div></div><hr />
