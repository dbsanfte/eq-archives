<br />
I posted a comment on his board that shamans have had a legitimate whine with slow mitigation being BROKEN for  . . . o since PoP came out.  I suggested Woody might want to level up a bit and stop hunting in Dreadlands (which his highest char is a lvl 49 warrior) before he started making snap judgements about people doing TierII+ PoP hunting.  <br />
<br />
I got my post edited by Woody to read &quot;Whoops! I made the mistake of being an ignorant jackass!&quot;<br />

<br />
Peace out. <br />
<br />
Woody - Slow is a class defining ability. If it's the #1 reason people want you on a raid - even cancel a raid if they can't get a Shaman, if it's the #1 reason you get tells from halfway across Luclin begging you to come to PoN to group with them... &quot;these mobs are too hard, come and slow them&quot;...<br />
<br />
It's class defining.<br />
<br />
But, on the other hand, we did bitch when it was broken. Rightly so, it did get it fixed. But oh boy did we let out a bellyache about it. It still isn't fixed right - we're still getting odd results from PoV/Exe trial, see the sticky thread at the top of this forum.<br />
<br />
But Land, peace out :) It was a funny, and if we can't laugh at ourselves, who will? Better to laugh first than laugh last.</div></div><hr />

Well, he's half right, no one ever said you were ignorant :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Woody</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Like I said on my board, there's nothing wrong with disagreeing with me. And where you're right, I know nothing about any of the tiers of planar advancement, It's not fair to assume I know NOTHING just because I opt to spent the few minutes I have, playing the game as best I can.<br />
<br />
There's no reason to be demeaning and conescending. You could have told me WHY slow is so important instead of making fun of how I play the game. And as far as I'm concerned... if you never had slow, you'd never miss it. And if slow didn't exist, Shamans would be useful for a PLETHORA of other reasons.<br />
<br />
I have nothing against shamans. I've picked on every class. My own most of all. And where some people will choose to get mad at my ribbing, orthers will think it's funny, and still others with hover in the middle and do what is most valuable: write me and tell me why I'm wrong in a civil, enlightening manner.<br />
<br />
So I'll go back to soloing in Dreadlands. Because I can. I pay my monthly bill, it's not your place to either condone or condemn. But approaching me civily is always the best way to get the best response.<br />
<br />
<br />
----- EDIT -----<br />
<br />
I'm really sorry this came to these boards. This person's grief is with me... it should have stayed on my boards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Nice try, Woody.  Wasn't bad, but you are a bit mixed up about shamans.  <br />
<br />
The other things you say we're good for, is, well, simply a kindness on your part.  We're not really good for them.  What else do we have to offer, stat buffs?  ;)   More or less useless(emphasis on the LESS).<br />
<br />
Take away our slow, and we have pretty much nothing.  Nobody groups with us just because we have torpor and canni and that combo gives us great mana regen.  What good is mana regen without something vital to spend it on anyway?  Maybe people rarely like us for malo, our level 60 unresistable debuff.  (If you're even level 60 and have the spell.)  But it probably won't get us any group invites.<br />
<br />
Focus isn't bad(another 60).   <br />
<br />
Neither are needed for most any group.  Malo is sometimes needed for raids.<br />
<br />
But slow is basically it.  Without it, we're dead.<br />
<br />
It's not whining at all to complain about it being messed up.<br />
<br />
What would chanters do, and how would they feel, if they could no longer mez?  Clerics if they could no longer heal?  Wizards if they, oh...kept their snare, but lost their DD's? ;)   People really do need their key abilities, or they're screwed.  <br />
<br />
It's flattering to think we're really a fantastic class, and we are, with our slow. <br />
<br />
But without it -- well, we really do suck.  <br />
<br />
Don't be surprised if, having played the class so long, we've picked up on that.  And don't let the legends of shaman uberness make you think we're uber at everything no matter what or no matter what happens to us.  We're great BECAUSE of slow, not despite its absence.  We're as vain as the next guys, but...we know people aren't asking us to group for our stat buffs, or heals, etc., or just for our sparkling personalities.  <br />
<br />
We're being honest and realistic about it when we say that messed up slows = a big problem for the class whose main contribution is their slows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Meener</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Oh, come on people.  It's a comic.  He makes fun of people.  He makes fun of everyone.  That being the case, every so often you're going to be the brunt of a joke.  That's how it works.  Get over it.<br />
<br />
You do not have the right not to be offended by anything.  Quite the opposite, free speech means you have the right to offend people as you wish.  And I have the right to put you on /ignore :)  People that think free speech stops when they're the target of something is what has turned so much of our culture into a kids' TV show.  Get over it, take your criticism like an adult and learn from it.<br />
<br />
Do you even see the irony in whining because someone called you a whiner? <br />
<br />
Get a sense of humor people, it's really not a big deal.<br />
<br />
Edit: although I'll give you this, Woody's edits did seem kinda obnoxious, ill informed, and stooped down pretty damn low with those personal attacks.  So....my what I said stands, although it seems Woody needs to learn that himself as much as anyone here.  Misquoting someone to make them look like a moron, rather than deal with the issue at hand like an adult is particularly lame.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Two quotes interested me, the first from his second post on this page:  I'm really sorry this came to these boards. This person's grief is with me... it should have stayed on my boards. <br />
<br />
and the second from his own forums:  The difference between us is, where you can criticize and be demeaning and condescending... I wield the BOOM stick.  <br />
<br />
I opted for a change of venue where the moderator is not the one I am having a problem with.  If you can't face up to your actions outside your board . . . if you can't tolerate criticism of your art . . . if you only listen to people who constantly kiss your ass, then I have nothing more to say to you Woody.  Grats on the few hundred people who have so little to do at work they can browse your forum and kiss your ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>modrodgod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I didn't think shaman were whiners before, but I'm tempted to think you're crybabiess now =\ quit while you're ahead sir</div></div><hr />

Thanks for all the times you've made me laugh, Woody.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Meschit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Jesus, Land. Don't be so damned thin-skinned. It's just a stupid cartoon. Cartoons have never been known to be factual sources of info. All you're doing is reinforcing the stereotype of being whiny. Be thankful you play a class that's actually interesting enough to be made fun of. What are you, still in 3rd grade?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I didnt really care on the matter, well enough to rehash it to an average cartoonist, until i noticed Woody edited out Lands posts and actually replaced the text.  With that he lost all my respect and so should lose yours.  I know this is a different matter than what is intended for this thread but I felt you need to get off of lands back.  Really none of this would be happening if he took the critisism in stride or perhaps even just said something like i dont appreciate these kinds of posts here... something other than inserting text into other peoples posts!<br />
<br />
About the slow part.  Keep calling us whiners about the effectiveness of slow while you CH or attack with your 12- 20 or so weapons with a taunting proc but I remember when each class was as bad or worse than we are.  Hey at least we are clear in are arguments and dont resort to &quot;Whoops! I made the mistake of being an ignorant jackass!&quot; or &quot;W T F FIX DIS SONY QUiXorS! it blows!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Dragonsfyre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I thought the comic was damn funny, like most of his stuff.  It sounds like most of us here felt pretty much the same.  I do find it interesting and perhaps disturbing though that we would have been targeted as the class who needs to buy the &quot;50 gallon drum&quot;, as historically we have been total sheep when it comes to nerfs, or lack of significant upgrades, and any whining that has happened has been pretty much confined to these boards, where we comiserate with our shaman brothers and sisters about SoE's lack of insight regarding our class and it's issues.<br />
<br />
Unlike most of the other classes:<br />
<br />
- Bards raise holy hell anytime a new stacking issue comes up...we patiently endure bizzare stacking issues and hope they'll get resolved someday.  <br />
<br />
- Clerics have bitched and moaned for years about their Epic and the bottlenecks in it.  Once that was fixed, they switched topics to how they have slowly become less useful in groups (until the new Mack-Truck-hitting mobs in PoP came out).<br />
<br />
- Necros have waged a bloody war with VI over many things, mainly nerf after nerf and the issue of stacking dots on mobs.  Since we also use big dots, you would have thought Shamans would have voiced their opinion on that issue, but for the most part we were silent.  In fact, some of us (myself included) feel that dots should not stack in the way they currently do, as it is not really realistic.<br />
<br />
- Tanks and hybrids of all shapes and sizes have battled mightily and vocally for years to define their place in the game, how they should stack up against the other classes in damage, AC, mitigation, etc.  Every new discipline, AA Skill, etc., is put thru the ringer.<br />
<br />
- Druids - God don't get me started.  BY FAR the biggest whiners in the game, the constant squeaky wheel, etc.  By contrast, Shamans are the sheep of the EQ world when it comes to speaking up over about our issues.  They would be buying vat-loads of the liquid in the comic strip is it were available.<br />
<br />
It was only recently that we on this board have fully realized that the only way to get ANY attention from SoE was to becaome something of a squeaky wheel ourselves.  Several threads in this forum, in the Spells and Alchemy forums, etc., have been started to attempt to consolidate the views of the Shaman community into a voice we can use to gain SoE's attention.  It is not what we as a community WANT to do.  But it is what we have come to realize that we NEED to do to have any hope of a reasonable outcome.  <br />
<br />
Even the outcry over the broken slow mitigation, which in my personable opinion is the single biggest nerf to our class ever made, was focused almost solely NOT on the fact that slow mitigation should not be in the game at all, but rather that what was in the game was broken.  They handed us a plate of crap, and all we did was complain that the plate was chipped, not that the food was crap!<br />
<br />
I guess the bottom line of what I'm trying to say is that while we may bitch and moan about our lack of upgrades, the poorly considered nerfs to our abilities, etc., we confine those to our little corner of the web and don't speak out like other classes do.  Or at least we did until recently.  Hey, maybe we'll need those 50 gallon drums after all!<br />
<br />
Lastly, Woody is the moderator of his forums, and has the power and the right to do pretty much whatever he wants on them.  Killing or locking a thread that is little more than name calling and such is a commonly accepted practice for board mods.  Editing the post as he did, however, is stepping over the line, and he is destined to lose the respect of many of his readers by going that route.  <br />

<br />
Can you imagine if we didnt have the Lands of the shaman world out there making noice about a glairing snafu in EQ?  It would just be us complaining on our own board that no one reads but us about issues that no one really cares about except us.<br />
<br />
Good lord Woody,  changing someones post?  If you have an issue you delete the thread or lock it out. It's your board. But you dont change someone else's words man.  Thats just wrong.<br />

You have given me a laugh quite a few times. I also think that the artwork in your comic is very nicely done. <br />

Ignore these people that thing you suck, because you don't. If you did, your comics wouldn't be linked on most of the EQ Fan sites and be the most infamous comic for the game, now would it? :)</div></div><hr />
