<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Got this from the Enchanter boards. Idea of a scaleable Epic which was also touched on in the Epic 2.0 Graphic thread.<br />
<br />
Step 1: You get an ok item, bazaar-loot level. Stats simular to old epic. <br />
Step 2: You get a very nice low-end raiding item, 100 hp/mana level. <br />
Step 3: You activate the unique power of the item. <br />
*** Everything up to step 3 should be doable with a 3 groups of bazaar-geared L 65 characters with 50 to 100 AA. <br />
<br />
Step 4: Upgrade to post-VT quality. <br />
Step 5: Upgrade to post-Elemental quality. Unique power improved. Requires <br />
Step 6: Upgrade to post-Time quality <br />
Step 7: Upgrade to end of path. Unique power improved.  <br />
<br />
Obviously there's not only some waggle room in that - BUT it is something that 'fits' both the casual and Time-Dude/Dudette's style of play. <br />
<br />
Thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I like this idea, and hope Sony has the foresight to allow people to attain an epic without guild support.  My position has always been that an epic should be attainable by the player, not dependant upon a guild to obtain.<br />
<br />
Low level epics - soloable, to one group encounters.  Better than something you can buy.<br />
Mid level epics - one, to 3 groups.  Better stats, and effect.<br />
Upper - requires guild support.  Very powerful, and loaded with stats.  Elemental-Time required guild support.  Make the damn thing THE weapon in the game.  Make it something that will not become obsolete.  Increase it's power as expansions occur.  <br />
<br />
The time sinks involved with these items should be rewarded with occasional upgrades.  <br />
<br />
All should be able to be upgraded, if the player decides to step it up.<br />
<br />
Also, epic mobs and fights should be instanced.  No more frikken camping epic mobs, which just plain sucked...get in line, park a ranger, waste hours.  Perma park the epic npc's and allow them to instance an encounter like LDoN.  Stop the frikken epic camps.  Hellooooo!!!!...anyone remember frikken Ragefire camps?  I remember putting in 40hrs/wk when we were camping that stupid spawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mordaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">But without camps like Ragefire, how would I be able to teach the group every language and get everybodys begging and bindwound maxed?<br />
<br />
/snicker<br />
<br />
It would be a nice idea Faern.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I need to do more Ragefire camps then.  BW and begging isn't maxed yet. lol<br />
<br />
-Fin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">To me, an Epic is a personal quest.  I think it should be &quot;do-able&quot; with one group of support for some of the hardest parts, and solo-able for most.<br />
<br />
One item is not going to make a bazaar level character ready to farm Time.  There is no reason to make is excessively complex to attain that item.<br />
<br />
It should be *hard* for 1 group at the most difficult points, but not impossible.  There should be instanced parts that are ONLY solo-able.  Its a simple thing really.<br />
<br />
Even if the new epic pieces are Time quality, there is no reason that they should become less personal.</div></div><hr />
