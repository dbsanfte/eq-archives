<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Growlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all, i am searching for some help/advice with a new shaman<br />
<br />
First, Race? i know people say race doesn't matter at the higher end but it does to me, i'm not in a uber guild or even a large one i'd be lucky to get a full group out of my guild, we don't raid much. considering that the most i have ever made cash wise was 5k in 2 weeks i doubr i'd be able to ever buy really good equip. Basicly without any equip at all what race makes the best shaman?<br />
<br />
Also the Shaman will mainly duo with my brothers ogre warrior or his frog paladin, how well would these two combo's work if they only built together as a duo and how high could they get?<br />
<br />
 i notice most people say hp/ac is more important then wis, would this hold true in a duo that never solo'd?<br />
<br />
Thank you all in advance for any help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You should most definetly pick froglok as a race.  They are pretty much hands down the best race around.  I'm currently rerolling my level 65 shaman into a frog right now.<br />
<br />
And that works good for your brothers frog paladin, but I'm not so sure on the ogre.  The Sony synergy constant for ogre-froglok groups is not that great, but the paladin should be awesome, you will probably get triple xp every kill with them grouped.<br />
<br />
And hp/ac only applies to non-frogloks, with frogloks you want maxxed wisdom, int and agility.  With the agility bonuses that frogloks get, you shouldn't be able to tank better naked than even a top end equipped shaman of your level.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />

Ogres are the best race for shamans. As I've said before, frontal stun immunity is better than ALL OTHER RACIAL BONUSES COMBINED. The 15% penalty sucks I'm sure, but IMO totally worth it. I die with some regularity because normal melee (not even a bash) stuns me and prevents me from slowing something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">the only problem with ogres is that they look like complete **** wielding a shield and chain armor. I mean sh!t. I would rather remove my own nose with a rusty sickle before rolling an ogre shaman.<br />
<br />
Even with frontal stun immunity, snare necklaces, innate regeneration, faction standing adjustments, and all other racial benefits race is purely a cosmetic choice. In my opinion Trolls look the coolest especially since the new models were introduced.<br />
<br />
purely cosmetic</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well as for race they all have things they do really well....<br />
<br />
Ogers = Frontal meele Stunn Immunity, 15%~ exp pentalty, Evil Race<br />
Trolls = Regen, 20%~ exp pentalty, Evil Race (Inny Trolls get snare neck)<br />
Lizard = Regen, 20% Exp Pentalty, AC bonus, No Click bracer, Evil Race (Hated by all races)<br />
Barbs = Blind as hell at night, 5%~ exp pentality, Good Race<br />
Frog = Tasty in soup, N/A on Exp pentalty, Good Race<br />
Kitty = Starts Neutral to most, N/A on Exp Pentalty, Neutral Race<br />
<br />
I personally play a troll.  I liked the neckless and the regen.  If you dont know already some the better results are to put MAX into wis at startup and rest of it into Stam.  Just make sure you get Dex and Agi above 75 so that you do not get any type of pentalty for it.  There is alot of cheep equipment out there now for shammies these days just take look in bazaar and mix and match.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>The Antifrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If I could go back I'd be an ogre.  Inny troll (which I am) would be my second choice though, for the combo of the snare necklace and regen.  Regen is sort of like FT, its no big deal but doesn't hurt to have as long as you're not sacrificing anything for it.  I think old model trolls looked great, wish we'd kept the fattus-status with the new ones :(  Or at least the mean look.  I play mostly in first person though and fashion is the least of my concerns.  If fashion is higher on yoru priority list, maybe barb is a better choice.  Cats look nice as well, but no matter their armor they always appear naked to me, gives the impression they're a newbie not wearing much if any armor.</div></div><hr />

search is your friend...do a search for which race in titles and BAM! you get at least 5 posts with MANY replies.<br />
<br />
to second paragraph..of course the paladin/shaman can duo or the warrior/shaman, a shaman CAN solo to 65 with NO problems and you dont even need decent gear to do this..so of course duo would work and up to 65, speed isnt taken into account.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i know people say race doesn't matter at the higher end ...<br />
<br />
It doesn't matter ever.  At all.  You will be 100% as powerful a shaman no matter what race you choose, at any level.  Some have nice bonuses that some people like, but none are game changing.<br />
<br />
That said, Iksar are obviously the best =)</div></div><hr />

i'd go ogre again, mostly for the extra hp's at low levels and the no stun :) , cant purchase that in aa's ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
for example my 57 BL still wears a treeweave and uses a PSU and a Sheetmetal ulak</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Krenk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">As far as game mechanics, it does matter. As for personal taste it also does matter. For stats, it does not matter.<br />
<br />
Ogre &gt; Troll &gt; Iksar &gt; Lame races.<br />
<br />
Ogre only when the ability to do the can/heal cycle, which is around 44ish with that Stoicism or whatever the new thing is called. Otherwise the regen enables Troll/Iksar to gain mana back a lot faster then non-regen races. That point does matter, especially in groups at levels 24-44ish. Troll being the better pick for STA.<br />
<br />
It's true. As a Troll Shaman I may level slower, but I am a MUCH faster mana battery then any Barb/Cat/Frog. If the end game is what matters, go Ogre. Frontal stun immunity makes a serious difference in the high end aggro situations.<br />
<br />
I have had a Barb, Iksar, Ogre, and two Troll shaman. The only ones I have left are the Trolls, though sometimes I do wish I'd gone Ogre. After four years my play style is almost purely solo, therefor Troll fits much better. Iksar I found too weak in the first 30ish levels, since I like to melee. I was also the second Troll Shaman on Tallon Zek to get the snare necklace way back when shrink was not possible in neriak and there were no shrink potions. I helped the first gets his, he got his information from someone on another server. We got our necklaces all in two days around the time they first went live. So I am quite used to having that snare for runners, which helps me solo.<br />
<br />
It's mostly personal taste. Being Troll so long, coming from the old TZ, I don't care much for lighties (Barbs), Cats are new fangled to me with no real advantages, and Frogs should all ****ing die.<br />
<br />
Since you are going to duo all of the time, go Ogre. Really, you won't regret it. Evil factions are really easy to play, but then I've been one my whole EQ life.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Imho.<br />
<br />
If your a powergamer that wants to race to 65 and join the resident uberguild, go ogre, you'll have a hard time with mana for the first 43 levels, but after that its clean sailing.  Front stun immunity really is fantastic in pop.  Also has slam.<br />
<br />
If you see yourself as a casual gamer, without access to good gear and are not in a hurry to get to 65, go troll, natural regen is a big deal pre stoticism and even after that, its still a nice helping of free mana.  Again trolls have slam, + the snare necklace quest line as well as Jaundice bone gear which is nice cheap and easily availible stuff thats quite nice to wear at the lower levels when AC really matters.<br />
<br />
As far as the other races go....<br />
<br />
Vahshir's noteable bonus = Sneak, a very useful ability, especially if you like questing, they also get safefall but I think its quite a low level, not really useful except it cuts down on the falling for 1 damage spam when you run down hill =)<br />
<br />
Frogs get nothing beyond good base stats and no xp modifier.<br />
<br />
Iksars get regen and also of note, a moderate ac bonus, forage and of course our tail =)  However we pay for this with awful base stats and the inability to wear a suprising amount of gear which can be quite a nuisiance at the low/mid end.  You'll be cursing your lack of strength for the first 30 levels, you'll be cursing for lack of stamina for the last 5.   <br />
<br />
Barbs pretty much fall under the same category as frogloks, however, for that 5% xp penalty you gain: A) Slam, B) The ability to be taken seriously, but you loose decent eye sight which is a nuisiance till you get vision.<br />
<br />
Unless you are a direhard quester or only want to play in the old world.  Faction really isnt that big a deal these days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Shamans get infravision at 9, so nightblindness is only really a problem for the first 8 levels, and if you have a lantern, only when naked. I do remember naked corpse runs having to feel my way through the tunnel from Everfrost to Blackburrow. That wasn't much fun.<br />
<br />
Nowadays, the first 10 levels are much quicker, and you can always get the PoK books to someplace without as many dark tunnels to level in, so nightblindness is a minimal consideration.<br />
<br />
Other than that, lots of good advice here, but it basically boils down to what you feel happier with.<br />
<br />
I personally chose barbarian because at the time (around 3 years ago, after Kunark but before Velious), faction issues were more of a problem. Plus trolls and ogres scratched their bums (or was it just ogres?) and everyone and their dog was rolling a new iksar. In fact, all three of the other races available at the time were ugly, and frogloks now are just as bad. Whereas Kianor is tall and ruggedly handsome with blue stuff on his face. I can live with that. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>The Antifrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">It was trolls too, and what the hell do you mean &quot;ugly&quot;?!?!  *scratch*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Bilgoba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">My guide in how to create and play a shaman<br />
<br />
1.  Pick Froglok, people generally have more respect for frogloks<br />
2.  Make sure you use in your name frog, froak, ribbit, kermit, etc.  If you wanna throw a tilt on things, make sure that when you hit 20 your surname has something about being a bear in it.<br />
3.  Get level 60 as fast as possible so you can prostitute.. scratch that.. SELL buffs in PoK<br />
4.  Bear form, all the time, everyday.<br />
5.  If you decide to not make a froglok, and make an ogre or troll, make sure to talk in &quot;og-ur&quot;.  Make hotkeys demonstrating your fluency in it.<br />
6.  When raiding at higher levels make sure to not overlook the power of such spells as Talisman of the Daiku and Talisman of the Wrulon, make sure everyone has them.  Don't shrink, bear form.<br />
<br />
Did I miss any?</div></div><hr />

Anyway thanks all for the help i think i'm going to go ogre the high stam and no stun sounds good, my only fear is that if i duo with my brothers frog paladin, he'll level much faster then me and i'll get discouraged. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Well, if you're going to powergame, Inny troll is the best bet - You get the same exp penalty and regen as an Iksar, but you come with more built-in HP, marginally better faction, can wear various plate stuff. You also get the snare necklace and halfling mask that comes with it. Iksar are sexier and have better wisdom, but as a Shaman, you're already 100% sexy, and wisdom = teh suk<br />
<br />
Me, I'm a barbarian. Given the choice of switching my race, it would probably be to Froglok, simply because I don't like the 5% exp penalty for being able to do 1 damage with a 2% chance of landing and a 0.5% chance of interrupting aspell...</div></div><hr />
