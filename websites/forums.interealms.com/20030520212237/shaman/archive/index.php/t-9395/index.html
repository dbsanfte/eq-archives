<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>tribblestump</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering what a good melleeing weapon for a 34 shaman would be? I have around 1k to spend and I really need a new weapon.  I like to cast my spells on mobs then tank them with the ds that I get from my ranger (main) and I want to do more damage with my melleeing. I like to have my shield equiped, so piercing or 1hbasing weapon suggestions would be perfect. Thanks!<br />
<br />
Edit- I am using a slime coated harpoon right now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Piercers:<br />
Spine Chill Spear is fairly cheap.<br />
Slimey that you are using works just fine though.<br />
<br />
If you can spend a little more (or get a deal), one of the best pre-epic piercers that is widely available is a Rune Etched Icewurm Fang.  <br />
<br />
1hb:<br />
Journeyman's Walking stick is a nice situational weapon, that procs Tashani.  Price should be around 500-700pp, varying by server.  (Note, this weapon stinks for damage/delay.  You want it for the Tash proc.)<br />
<br />
For practicing your skills, seek out as low a delay weapon as possible.  I don't think there are any really cheap high damage/low delay 1hb you could buy right now, but I've never been much of a blunt shopper.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>tribblestump</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Anyone ever use one of these (Spear of Mortification) - http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=685<br />
People seem to all be saying that it procs quite a bit, seems like it would make tanking a lot easier. And what level can I give my pet two gnoll hide lariats so that he will proc stun?<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gallaena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I used the Spear of Mortification in my early days to raise up my skill in piercing (pre-Velious, post-Kunark). Even then, it wasn't that great of a weapon. I'm sure that you can find cheaper and faster piercers.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Spear of Mortification seems to proc alot more than the Howling Harpoon, but the harpoon is also a slower weapon.  I have seen parses that suggest that proccing is independent of the weapons delay but I don't think it was totally conclusive.<br />
<br />
At any rate, I just go a Pebble Crusher and I love it!<br />
<br />
edit: oh and for level 34, you might be able to kill the Sambata's out front of ME in dawnshroud peak.  One of them will eventually drop a very VERY nice 8/18  1H blunt (no drop).  Its wicked fast and using that I maxxed blunt very quickly.   Using a combo of that and the Spear of Mortification my weapon skills were never far behind.<br />
<br />
Remember, use the fastest weapons you can get to raise skill, then look for something else once you've maxed out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Huth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I am 36 now and used a Slime Coated Harpoon right the way up to 34 and then sold it and picked up a Howling Harpoon for 200pp, i hate it...i'm too low a level to proc and it's dead slow so i picked up this 1hb for 600pp<br />

I'm actually going to buy another Slime Coated Harpoon (nice and cheap) to use as my 1hb is now higher than my piercing.<br />
