On one hand, if you want to kill yourself there probably isn't much I can do to stop you.  I'll try and talk you out of it but realisticly, that's the best I can do.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, I don't think people should be helping other people kill themselves.  <br />
<br />
On the the third hand(foot maybe?), I hate to see people in pain with no way out.<br />
<br />
I file this under the &quot;it doesn't affect me and there isn't much I can do about it so I'm not going to worry about it&quot; category.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Personally I favor the legal allowance in the always in extreme pain going to die anyway cases.  We put animals out of their misery as a kindness, but not people.  Why?<br />
<br />
Past that point though, it becomes a lot less arguable, or rather becomes a religious or political argument.  Thats ground I don't want to cover.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It seems to me that it's much more of a religious argument than a political one.  I don't think that the government has any business attempting to force a religious argument on it's constituants.  This is really about letting those who don't have any moral/religious issues with this process the avenue to end their pain.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From my perspective its your life and if you wish to end it then so be it.  Certainly I would try to talk someone out of it and I personally at this point in time would fight tooth and nail to hang onto life but some people know when their time is up.<br />
<br />
Religiously I look at it as God gave a gift of life and some guidelines to live it by.  But in the end its a gift and yours to do with as you please.  If you are ready to give up that gift then I don't see anywhere where it says you shouldn't.<br />
<br />
On the assisted suicide situation... If the person gives their permission to end their life then I see no problem with it.<br />
<br />
However if the person is comatose or legally unable to make decisions(and there is legal precedent to state when someone is mentally fit or not to decide) then by no means should that person be allowed to state that they wish to die.</div></div><hr />

Presumably one would be able to stipulate such desired in a living Will.</div></div><hr />

If someone is comatose and they have written in their will that if they are unable to function alone then kill me off but if the comatose patient is likely to be up and going again in about a month would we go ahead and kill them or wait the month?  If we followed the letter of the will we can kiss the guy goodbye.<br />

Also wills and interpretation of wills are too easy to abuse especially if the executer of the will has ulterior motives.</div></div><hr />

I'm not really trying to make light of this, but it seems to me that if you don't trust the executer of your will, that's your problem, not anyone elses.<br />
<br />
I know that I would make DAMN sure that for a living will, things were spelled out very precicely and that the executor was someone that I could trust implicitly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And I would too but its amazing how often especially when talking about people where money is on the line that long trusted friends turn out to be backstabbing leeches.<br />
<br />
Also the average American I would wager is either not as intelligent about these things or as savvy(sp?) about these things.<br />
<br />
Just saying too many people let themselves get suckered on lesser things(savings and loans, mail fraud, Enron) and when we are talking about the ability to murder someone scot free due to a technicality in a living will its not something I would want to be done easily.  Hence a concious decision is the only safe way to go.  <br />
<br />
People may say thats mean of me to not let someone who is unconscious the ability to release but I would think making the mistake of releasing someone who didn't want to be released but was unable to protest would be a graver mistake.</div></div><hr />

<br />
WE might be able to come up with wording that is hard to exploit cause WE give this kind of thought all the time here on the glade about odd ball situations.<br />
<br />
However most Americans are (without meaning to be mean) stupid and like it.  They don't look at who they vote for.  They don't research what car they want to buy.  They don't read and study the laws which get passed through congress.  They don't analyze and debate and defend view points and actions on the news.<br />
<br />
What I'm saying is despite our disagreements you and I are part of a exceptional breed who actually takes the time to read and research things for ourselves.  We think about odd situations often to their obscene extremes.  Most Americans don't.  Hell when significant portions of college grads can't find the US on a globe this should be saying to us hmm maybe they don't even think about higher issues like assisted suicide.<br />
<br />
More over most Americans are lucky if they are planning for things more than a month away.  The average American lives only from Paycheck to paycheck.  Often times Death or near death is the last thing on their minds.  People write wills on a scrap pieces of paper in a hurry in the middle of the night... not sit down with a lawyer and family members deciding things.<br />
<br />
What I'm saying Aizle is we would be the exception in terms of laying out a specific will.  And to build a law with the expectation that we are the norm would be opening up a lot of people to abuse.  Now if the average American put forthought into their will then yes I'd be more open to the possibility of allowing the living will to be the only governing piece of paper needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myrea</div><div class="date">04-19-2002, 12:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Living wills, no matter how explicit, are notoriously hard to enforce. The problem is that the person who most wants it to be enforced is not in a position to testify to that fact, and the one who do not want it to be enforced are generally thier most loved family. <br />
<br />
Unless you have hired a lawyer who is separate from the rest of your family's legal counsel(s) to enforce your living will, there's not a good advocate to speak on your side in court. For example, if you and your spouse both setup living wills with the same lawyer, and when she goes into a coma, you decide to challenge the living will, her lawyer is your lawyer - see the problem?<br />
<br />
And in the mean time, the living will is negated while the court process goes on.<br />
<br />
The same thing happens with organ donation. If your family does not relase your organs for transplant, they can't be used, even if you have signed a donor card.<br />
<br />
The best protection you have is to come to a real agreement with your family about what you want and how to handle a situtation. Sign the donor card and get the living will so that your spouse, kids or parents have the legal force they need to make the hospital follow your wishes, but make sure they are going to use it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;I'm sorry, Mr. Anderson, I know you have full blown aids and will suffer unimaginable pain for 2-3 years even with the best of drugs and will eventually die anyways, but I can't let you die now and skip the senseless sufferring!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brannuer</div><div class="date">04-19-2002, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">http://www.cnn.com/2000/WORLD/europe/11/24/brussels.euthanasia/index.html?related<br />
<br />
    There is also the fact that you might be euthanized without your consent, something that was a hot topic of debate when the Netherlands was thinking about legalizing it. The study *seemed* to suggest that in countries where it was legal patients were slightly more at risk of being in a situation where their death was 'hastened', either through treatment specifically designed to do so, or via withholding treatment that would extend it.<br />
   In the city I live in, there is a 16 year old girl who wants to refuse blood transfusions because it violates her religious beliefs. Her father is opposed, her mother (and church) are supportive. So far, the court has forced her to accept the treatment (she has leukemia, doctors say she will die without treatment). It's being appealed right now. <br />
   A very similar situation happened a couple of years ago (different city)  when a young boy with cancer wanted to refuse traditional cancer treatment and take alternative therapy at a clinic in Mexico. His family completely supported him. After prolonged legal battles he eventually was allowed to do so, and died within a year.<br />
  It's political, religious, and very emotional. I've watched family members die from cancer and alzheimers. I would understand either decision, but the thing I would be most uncomfortable with is having the government force it's will into a situation that will never fit into what any law could forsee. The suffering and criminal activity it would cover, and the peace it could deny are very heavy weights to counterbalance successfully through legislation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I understand, but to some extent I view that as natural selection.<br />
<br />
If you're too stupid to take the time to REALLY think a living will through, and with someone that you trust, then I guess I don't have a whole lot of sympathy for you.  Compassion yes, but...<br />
<br />
Also, I'm not saying that hospitals should be able to make ANY kind of action on their own.  Only that allowing them to assist when it's the wish of the patient.<br />
<br />
Also, I would guess that probably 90% of the requests for assisted suicide come from concious, lucid patients.  As if you're unconcious you can't really tell the doctor that hey this hurts and make it stop...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Personally i would rather be &quot;put to sleep&quot; then be kept alive on machines, as for how to verify this i dunno.  Maybe you could check it off on your drivers license like you do if your an organ donor lol.  <br />
<br />
Seriously though like others have said its hard to be positive  becuase the person in question cant tell you what they want, and people are always gonna second guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Emer</div><div class="date">04-19-2002, 10:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This has been a hotly contested debate here for quite a while.  The strongest part of the issue being not should somone be allowed to kill themselves with the help of medical aid, but is it legal.<br />
<br />
There still are many concerns (and valid mind you) that have to deal with abuses in the system and I'm not sure if it truly to put in enough safeguards to keep the final legislation feasable to use.  <br />
<br />
Who decides whether somone is mentally fit to make the kind of decision to end their life?  Somone with the stress of learning or knowing they have a terminal illness or disease can be depressed enough in the earlier stages to make a hasty decision they won't be around later to regret.<br />
<br />
Is it selfish to take your own life knowing you have suffering and hardship ahead of you, or selfish to rob your family and friends of time that could be shared.  I still haven't quite decided.  The lesser of 2 evils is still evil, but I believe the decision should be left up to the person with the illness.   Psych evaluations themselves are skewed in this instance as most think that somone who would want to take their own life aren't mentally balanced in the first place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myrea</div><div class="date">04-20-2002, 12:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is it selfish to take your own life to end certain pain and suffering near the end?<br />
<br />
I don't think so. If the pain is so great the the drugs and machines to lessen it turn you into a different person than your family knew, I'd rather save them the pain of watching.<br />
<br />
My grandmother died after about a year of illness, months in ICU, more months on a ventialtor. By the time she finally died, she didn't recognize anyone, she was in so much pain. And her body was so bloated we could hardly recognize her. She was miserable, and for the last few weeks, delirious from pain that the strongest drugs couldn't completely eliminate. We all cried every time we left her hospital room, and it nearly killed my grandfather to be with her in that hospital day after day for a year.<br />
<br />
To see her all prepared for her funeral, with her dentures in again, her hair and makeup and meticulous as she liked to keep them and her face back to its normal size and shape was what we all needed. She was at peace, at home with The Father at last, and we were free from the pain of seeing her suffer.<br />
<br />
I say that when it's time to go, it's time, and no one is being selfish by saving their family the pain of watching somone they love die slowly and painfully.</div></div><hr />
