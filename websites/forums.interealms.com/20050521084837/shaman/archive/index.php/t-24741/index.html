<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cradossk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been in beta for only 4 or 5 days and hardly consider myself qualified as one to give a good impression of the Shaman so far in the game but I didn't see anyone else posting on here.  I have been retired from EQ for a couple years now and I'm sure the Shaman has changed somewhat from where it was but so far I'm liking him in EQ2.<br />
<br />
As everyone knows you play the first 10 levels of your life in EQ2 as a generic Priest. They immerse you quite nicely in that and it doesn't take long to get the game feeling like you've been playing it for ages.  After you do some initial quests for some Armour on the Island of Refuge you'll end up in the city, I ended up in Freeport as an Iksar. There you can get your citizenship and level fairly quickly in newbie zones up to lvl 9 or so. At that point you'll have to embark on your quest to decide your next profession. You do a set of 3 fairly easy quests for a guy one for Cleric, one for Druid and finally one for Shammy. At the end of that you get to pick and are given a last chance to change your mind. The choice is undoable. Ding you become a lvl 10 Shaman and you get your first Slow which I have found is actually quite an impressive Slow for a lvl 10 spell. At that point I got out in the new Commonlands which seems to be a good place to spend your teens. Lots of quests and easy to find groups. I dinged 11 and got my first Disease DoT as well last night. <br />
<br />
So far I'm really liking it.  None of the screenshots or movies I've seen really seem to do it justice. The spell effects really need to be seen to be appreciated. They are simply amazing. You hit a guy with a Disease dot and his skin turns green and boils appear all over his body.<br />
<br />
Anyway I'm only lvl 11 and quite rusty so I'd love to hear the experiences of any Shaman who have moved on to become Mystics or Defilers. Or anyone else's 2 cents.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's a better game than EQ1 in most respects i can think of. It's still run by SoE.<br />
<br />
Up to you mate...</div></div><hr />
