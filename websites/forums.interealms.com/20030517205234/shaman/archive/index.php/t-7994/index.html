<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Here is the deal, my guild is 6 real life friends all of us hot boxing other than my gf, she runs single until i can get her another computer.  My guild consists of (grouping folks with what two classes they run typically.  First char is the main):<br />
<br />
63 Rogue/61 Chanter<br />
62 Shaman/60 Rogue<br />
60 Sk/ 60 Necro<br />
63 Monk/ 60 Cleric<br />
63 Druid/ 60 Warrior<br />
<br />
My question is, what is the best trial for us and what would be the best way for us to get all folks through the trials. ie you only need one rogue so then the next time swap rogues, unless you need both to even pass.<br />
<br />
So far the only thing I've come up with is:<br />
Cleric (duh have to have one)<br />
Chanter <br />
Wiz (for disintegrate, does it land on every mob in there?)<br />
Druid (hear they can dispell summoned on all the rocks is this true?)<br />
Tank (this is where we can swap the SK for the warrior)<br />
Rogue (we are going to need damage for the big guy from somewhere once again we can swap the rogues?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">For Execution make the base group: cleric, tank, druid or wizard, wizard or rogue, add the other characters as they need to get flagged. <br />
<br />
Think: heal, tank, damage, damage, other, other. If after a few goes that group can't do it try: heal, tank, damage, damage, damage, other.<br />
<br />
Druid can use banishment, resists may be a factor, add the chanter if you have problems perhaps. <br />
<br />
Dont slow stuff, best damage shield up, all assist one person, dont switch targets until its dead.</div></div><hr />
