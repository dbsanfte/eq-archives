<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just curious as I may have to update my RAM and Vid Card.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, I have pretty good specs.  A GeForce FX 5700 LE 256 meg card, and a gig of RAM, but dont take that info as being what you *need*.   I find WoW runs amazingly smoothly - but you could play with less.<br />
<br />
A friend of mine has 512MB  and a crappy 64 meg video card (no-name).  Some options could stand to be turned down, and it sputters if theres a ton of people all bunched in one spot, but it still plays passably - especially in instances.<br />
<br />
I dont think there is an official minimum spec list out there at the moment, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kossaxel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The minimum system requirements for World of Warcraft have not yet been announced. Because the game is still under development, the changes implemented by our programmers and designers will cause the program to run faster and slower on the same hardware over the course of our beta testing. Until the game is near completion, we will be unable to offer minimum or recommended system requirements for the final version of the game.<br />
<br />
The current minimum system requirements for the World of Warcraft Beta and Stress Test are listed below. If you are running below any of the requirements below, then you could encounter graphical issues, crashes, or slow down which we will be unable to address.<br />
<br />
- Your computer will need a 56K or higher modem with an Internet connection.<br />
<br />
Windows® System/OS:<br />
<br />
- PIII or AMD Athlon 800 Mhz or higher.<br />
- 256 Megabytes or more of RAM.<br />
- GeForce 2 graphics card or better.<br />
- 3.3 Gigabytes or more of available hard drive space.<br />
- DirectX® 9.0c or above.<br />
<br />
Mac® System/OS:<br />
<br />
- 1.0 GHz or higher, G4 or G5 processor.<br />
- 512 Megabytes RAM or higher. DDR RAM recommended.<br />
- ATI or NVIDIA video hardware with 64 MB VRAM or more.<br />
- 3.3 Gigabytes or more of available hard drive space.<br />
- MacOS X 10.3 (&quot;Panther&quot;) or better.<br />
<br />
Until we can provide details for the final version of the game, please trust in the fact that it is our goal to provide our customers with as rich a gaming experience as we can without requiring upper-end hardware.<br />

I ran wow during the Stress test using a P4 1.6ghz,  64mb geforce 2 and 512mb of Ram.<br />
The only problem I had was in the major cities I couldnt see Floor/wall textures at times, made navigating them quite a PITA. :p<br />
That may have been a driver issue however, but since im not in beta I can't test that theory</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What you running right now faern ?<br />
<br />
I have a 1.1 ghz with a 9800pro 128 and it was great. I mean there was a lil hit when i got near spots where a lot of people where, but thats due to the higher amount of computations needs to generate real time placement of multiple avatars. Its the bane of the MMORPG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">733 MHZ, 256 RAM, Nvidia 100 / 200 card.<br />
<br />
I am definitely thinking of buying more RAM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Wow, yes, get more RAM.  If not for WoW, then other reasons. :)  I have lately come under the ideal that you really NEED at least 512 for most things.<br />
<br />
Especially if you run windows XP.  It's sick, almost, how companies will sell computers with XP that only have 256 megs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well actually, I bought my computer in 2000 (along with my BMW) and it was running WIN 98 SE.<br />
<br />
And the aforementioned 256 MEGs of RAM.<br />
<br />
Tiger-something is selling 256 (133SDRAM) here in Raleigh / Cary for 34.99 a stick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">733?!?! 256?!?! Nvidia 100/200?!?!<br />
<br />
OH MY!<br />
<br />
Dude! I've got a couple of PIII 1Ghz, 512MB+ PC133, GF2 MX400, SB Live! Value machines sitting here doing nothing (since I retired my 4 box combo in EQ). I'd be glad to send ya one! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks for the offer Val.<br />
<br />
A puppy maybe. Ixnay on the omputercay.<br />
<br />
What can I expect to pay for a decent vic card upgrade and what vid cards should I be looking at / for ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I just upgraded my main machine from a GF3 Ti500 to a GF FX5900XT 128mb from newegg.com for $177. Actually picked up a pair of 'em and upgraded my wifes old GF4 MX440 at the same time. Good cards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Fearcazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I run WoW on my laptop and get 30 to 60fps. Average FPS is 40.<br />
<br />
I have a Dell 8400: 3.4ghz, ATI X800SE 128, 2 gig of rams and EQ2 runs like crap. With everything turned dow I only get about 10fps in town and there is no other PCs around. You can guess which game I play more.<br />
<br />
I bet you can run WoW on a P3 fine just like the min spec says.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I got 1.3 Duron, with 768 ram, GeForce Ti420 128mb and I had no problems at all. Although I will probably upgrade and give this comp to my dad.</div></div><hr />
