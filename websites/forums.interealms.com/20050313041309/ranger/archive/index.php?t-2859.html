<br />
Soem questions:<br />
<br />
1) Does it increase damage, or just to hit chance?<br />
2) How does it &quot;work&quot;? Is it an ATK buff, a sheer to hit modified, a DAM modifier?<br />
3) Does Archery Skill seem to raise faster with it up at all?<br />
4) Is it worth a spell slot at various levels?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
     It increases the chance to hit moderately and thats about all.<br />
It does not increase attack or damage modifier or aid in increasing the rate at which your archery goes up.  <br />
It does fade fairly quickly so if you are using archery a good bit then you might wish to have it memmed if you are soloing. Doubtful that a slot would be warranted if you are grouped.  An added bonus to the +chancetohit is various vision benefits at certain levels such as serpent sight, see invis etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unfortunately, after 15 when you get your straight Archery buff, you'll have to wait 37 levels to see the next one, which features an improved Archery buff along with See Invisible.  6 levels after that, another Archery improvement and Ultravision is added to the See Invisible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drewno</div><div class="date">05-12-2002, 09:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Someone a while back posted a survey on this...and they found out that it actually appears to be an attack buff, adding 10 atk, then 20, then 40. They found this out because the % dmg increase was actually EXACTLY equal to a %atk increase, had it conferred that bonus (10,20,40). Overall they are not 'that' useful. However, i'll still use eagle eye because of the see invis and ultravision component.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It increases archery Skill presumably exceeding your level cap.<br />
<br />
A Couple of observations.<br />
<br />
If you Archery is not already capped this may help with skill raises, because success ususally raise more often than failures.<br />
<br />
Also, it means that at whatever level MAX damage starts to exceed Arrow + Bow, you would see more MAX's then, if  the formula for Archrey MAX is skill releated like Meele Max damage is ((Skill + STR+ Level) /100 * DAM)<br />
<br />
Interesting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khelzor</div><div class="date">05-12-2002, 12:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Eagle Eye (and I presume the others to a lesser degree) makes a huge difference in the amount of damage per hit as well as number of hits. I can definately tell a difference when EE fades, and I make it a point to keep this up when I am using a bow. There is no doubt that it is worth the time to cast it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sean SpiritArrow</div><div class="date">05-12-2002, 01:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure what it does, but if it does directly modify the skill it can't excede the 252 hard cap on skills.<br />
<br />
And I believe people have tested and shown there is a difference between what the 3 actually do yes? So I don't think it does that, seeing as the very first one would be more than enough to &quot;cap&quot; you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Heilos</div><div class="date">05-12-2002, 02:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yea I remember someone did do a pretty extensive test on the three different spells, but it got deleted when the boards got whiped...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kivorn Teleri</div><div class="date">05-12-2002, 04:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well. My parsings indicate a way higher hit percentage than what the +12 points (from 240 to 252) would offer... so I'm actually gonna be so bold as to suggest that it might very well disregard the 252pt skill cap.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sean SpiritArrow</div><div class="date">05-12-2002, 05:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I seriously doubt it does, seeing as no other percent modification to skills does that (and I've tested it with ones that mod weapons, the atk gain matched up). Plus they stated at one point that skills are hard capped at 252 period and that you can't go past that no matter how big the mod is. A spell buff would work exactly like a skill mod on a weapon so... I don't really see how it could heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kivorn Teleri</div><div class="date">05-12-2002, 05:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's the goofy part. Neither do I. I know of the cap at 252, but I also know that I'm seeing a whole heap of added damage with eagle eye on in my logs. I have no explanation for it. All I know is that I'm doing way more damage with it on than a 12pt skill increase can explain, thanks to higher accuracy.<br />
And I sure as hell know it isn't placebo.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kianwan</div><div class="date">05-12-2002, 07:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What is does is it adds a flat % chance to hit. 10% higher chance to hit for the first one scaleing up to 40% for the last ( I think ). Thats all, it doesnt modify your skill or ATK or anything it simply gives you X % better chance of hitting, easy as that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khelzor</div><div class="date">05-12-2002, 08:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I disagree Kianwan. It is obvious when using it, not only do you hit more often, but you do more damage per hit. It could be it is +40 atk when using archery which would make sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kianwan</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 02:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Err .. we did ALOT of testing on this way back when they where released and from all the logs there where NO increase in damage done ONLY in the tohit chance (and in the crit chance it seems tho it can because of the extra hits).<br />
(we meaning the glade as a whole since I never posted any logs)</div></div><hr />
