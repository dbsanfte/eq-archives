<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mcast12</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My server population (inny) is currently down about 25% after EQ2 and WoW, but I'm still really enjoying the game. I have plenty to do, including epic 1.5, equipment upgrades, glowing runes etc this should keep be entertained for a few months!<br />
<br />
With all the negative &quot;i'm quitting&quot; posts, I thought I would post something more positive!<br />
<br />
Anyway, have fun whatever you're playing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Your not alone . Im having as much fun on EQ now as I ever have . OOW was in my opinion simply a great expansion and really incresed my funfactor in EQ . On my server &quot;Drinal&quot; I have noticed a population hit but it doesent seem massive , pick up groups are still obtainable easily .<br />
<br />
In short I agree with you EQ1 is still insanely fun .</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm loving EQ.  We just recently starting to farm PoW, PoA and PoE... Just got my Rondo shield.  Life is Gud!<br />
<br />
I am done with all TS expept to get the last 40pts in Fletching, Smithing and Tailoring for Aid Grimmel.  I just finished my VP faction and need to finish camping the pieces.  I love the fights now that even a shaman can heal through (Named still need a cleric for though).<br />
<br />
I just love the game right now.  Having a great time and think it's too bad so many people are leaving to EQ2 and WoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Absolutely still loving EQ(1), and no plans to leave.</div></div><hr />

Why walk away from all that hard work and force myself to purchase a ridiculous number of computer upgrades I won't use for any other purpose?<br />
<br />
Forget all that. My friends and guildmates are on EQ1, and so am I. I'm here with them until they unplug the servers.<br />

Agree, but ultimately, I think a LOT of the hard-core EQ high end raiders who leave for EQ2 or WoW will be back, simply because I do not think either of these games will be able to compete with the depth of EQ1. <br />
<br />
Its gonna be a rough 3-6 months though, thats for sure. Look for guilds merging, folding, a lot of recruiting, backflagging. Probably even a lot of server-moves. I wouldnt even put it past SOE to merge servers if the overall populations continue to drop and stay low. No sense having 10 servers when 6 will support the same number of players.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>crollub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Im also very much enjoying eq 1 :)<br />
<br />
my main concern is the number of new players on eq1 is bound to take a hit because of the new well publicised options of eq2 and wow<br />
<br />
so populations are likely to be steadily falling as people leave but not so many join.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I agree, a lot of the hardcore high-end raiders may well be back... but what happens when their guild has merged with another in the meantime?  Interesting question.<br />
<br />
I do not believe SOE will merge servers to save server cost. The servers are paid for, yanking some wouldn't save them much money; and the message that would send about EQ1's lifespan would be unmistakeable.  They might, however, merge servers if the server populations get too low to support meaningful interactions between players.  MMP's have a &quot;sweet spot&quot; number of people where you can still find pickup groups, but the best spots are not 100% permacamped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">My guild just broke into VT for the first time last week and re-starting early progression on PoP. We've had a handful of players (Including our GL) go to EQ 2 and start up the guild there. But eveyone has stated they view EQ 2 as a casual game. There won't be any progression in the guild there so we can all concentrate on our porgression in EQ1. (for now anyway)<br />
<br />
We're all having a blast still. Our guild is still growing and even have had to slow down our invites because we've been getting applicants out the wazoo.<br />
<br />
I still want to try to EQ 2 once I upgrade my computer but I'm still excited about raiding in EQ 1 since there is still a lot of content I haven't seen yet and there's a lot of friends I have in the guild who have no plans on moving to EQ 2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Haxot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Aye, huzzah for the depth of EQ1 (chuckles)<br />
We love it, we love to grouse about it.<br />
<br />
It's our 'home' in the gaming world.<br />
<br />
I'm happier then I was when GoD came out. ^_^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tickmunki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Howdy,<br />
  I to still love EQ1, and l have goals for my Character. I believe the &quot;radier Nation&quot; as l call it, ( which is short for hardcore, and high end raiders IE: Raider Nation) will just have to keep going even though these slow times. I think a someone else said it best.<br />

&quot;The mistake that WoW and EQ2 are going to make is they will allow it to be too easy to level. Burnout won't be far off and people will come back to EQ1.&quot;<br />

Which I believe to be very true. If not coming back to eq1 there simply moving on with life and from the game. <br />

 have fun and be safe<br />

I love parts of EQ, but I absolutely hate &quot;grinding.&quot;  IMHO, you shouldn't play a game to power your toon, you should play it out of enjoyment of the game itself, and the powering of the toon should be a side effect.  EQ is this way at times for me, but if WoW or EQ2 can achieve it consistently then I think they will be superior games.  Just because neither game takes the EQ approach of endless timesinks such as slow leveling, not to mention faction-sinks (#@$)*#@&amp;% dranik loyalists), rare spell drops (do you have all of your GoD and OoW spells yet?) and  long (entirely unrelated to raiding) quests for keys to raid zones, doesn't mean that they are failures.  It just means they need to have something for people to do once they max out their toon.<br />
<br />
What I expect of both games is that they will be like EQ back in the day.  I remember a friend telling me, when I joined during the Velious era, that I shouldn't do any quests or worry about equipment (to be fair he did twink me a bit) until 60, because levels were &gt; all and once you got to 60 that was when the game really began.  His point was that the real fun of the game came from doing the massive quests like the shawl, the dain ring, and your epic, and these were the kind of thing you did after you got level 60.  So I guess what I am saying is that being able to get to the maximum level quickly is not inherently a game flaw: having no end-game content is.  And while I have heard that both WoW and EQ2 let you level fast, I have yet to hear reliable complaints about either game that they have no end-game content.<br />
<br />
I really doubt that SoE or Blizzard would be stupid enough to make a MMOG that can be &quot;finished&quot; in a few months, but until these games have been out for a few months we won't know.  Personally though, I'm looking forward to both (WoW initially, and EQ2 if WoW fails to meet my expectations) as they both seem to focus far more on classic RPG elements like small groups instead of raids, and quests instead of grinds/camps.  And if they do both run out of steam after a few months ... well, I'm not stupid enough to sell my account, so as long as SOE isn't stupid enough to delete it while I'm gone Loramin will be waiting for me to come back.<br />
<br />
Oh, and one final thought: in beta devs often up the exp rate to get players to test the high end content they otherwise wouldn't get to.  It's entirely possible that in the actual game exp rates will be &quot;nerfed.&quot;</div></div><hr />
