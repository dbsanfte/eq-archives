<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone got Channeling Focus 3? Its stated that you will improve channeling by 15% at level 3. Just wondering how much this translates to in percentage? If its around 50% less interrupts I would certainly consider getting this skill, but if its more like 15% its not something I would be thinking of getting, atleast not in the short term<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>sharden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have channeling focus 2 and initially it was great.... I seemed to be totally un-interuptible.  I even burned some guild loot points to get a +10% channeling boots.    Then along came Verant with a patch (the one that did the DR component on slows) and I noticed I was being interrupted a lot more.  In fact several posts on this forum occured with others claiming a stealth nerf to channeling to make our AA skills more viable.<br />
  I have resisted adding the level 3 AA skill to get 15% cause its value seems to have been nerfed....  I may still be more un-interuptible than prior to AA skills, but it doesn't seem much.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With 15% channeling focus that would add another 33, for a total of 253. Thats 1 point from the hard cap.<br />
<br />
So if you have the 10% channeling boots from Grieg's End you really only need the first (5%) level in Channeling focus to max out. The rest is 'wasted' points.<br />
<br />
That's how I always thought about it.<br />
<br />
<br />
If I ever get to playing again, I'm most definitely getting both boots and CF1 asap after canna5. CF rocks in pvp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That patch sucked. I had level 1 channeling at the time and interupts were very noticably reduced. Then after that patch it was totally screwed.<br />
<br />
One more skill point to level 3 Channeling and the 253 channeling cap, hopefully if it was worth it. <br />
Here's an interesting snippet found over at casters realm recently.<br />
<br />
-Your chance to recover casting is calculated solely on your Channelling Skill. <br />
-Dexterity only affects Channelling in relation to raising your skill in it. How quickly your raise your Channelling ability is determined by a combination of Dexterity and Intelligence. <br />
-Dexterity does not affect your chance to actually recover casting. <br />
-Agility doesn't affect Channelling, or casting recovery in any way whatsoever. <br />
-If you cast a spell which you are 5 or more levels higher than when you obtained it (eg: root is a level 4 spell, so if you are level 9 or higher) you get a Channelling boost, ie: a higher chance to recover casting if interrupted. <br />
-Player controlled movement will, in most circumstances, break a spell with no chance to recover. <br />
-Movement caused by a monster hitting you while you are casting a spell gets a chance to recover the casting. <br />
-Your skill level in a specific type of spell (eg: Evocation) doesn't affect your chance of recovery. However, this will affect your chance to fizzle the spell. <br />
-Any Specialization skill you have in the type of spell being cast will not affect recovery, however it will have a chance to reduce mana cost, and lower the fizzle rate.<br />
<br />
Best way to improve your chance to stop an interupt is to stick your back against a wall as already mentioned.</div></div><hr />
