<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Durgen</div><div class="date">05-01-2002, 01:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We have seen the short list of what the developers are planning so far.  While some of its good some of its bad (or at least no so good).  So the question is what do you hope for witih EQ2?  What will make it a better game for you?  What should the add, improve, or throw out?<br />
<br />
My early list (in no particular order) – <br />
<br />
1.  Item decay.  But in a limited form.  If player crafted gear becomes the base level of gear then decay will be good.  Preferably not to the point of breakage however (perhaps just lowering quality over time).  <br />
<br />
2.  More races.  I would like to see more playable races.  Though perhaps fewer classes.  One of the largest problems is the number of classes there are to play yet the game being very centric to just a few in many instances.  So it could be quite amusing to play a Gnoll or Orc for instance. <br />
<br />
3.  Better balancing with the classes.  Obviously this has been something highly contentious ever since Kunark (perhaps before then though I am not sure).  I hope that classes within the same grouping (Pure caster, Preist, Melee) do no deviate so much that some classes are just unwanted in many instances.  Or at least make it much more clear in the being of what the expectations will be for each class.  <br />
<br />
4.  Better questing/camping.  I see these as linked issues.  For in a game like EQ it is your primary means of acquiring items.  I personally don’t see why questing cant be a better, and/ore more varied way of item acquisition.  Most quests presently give you sub standard items for the effort.  If you go thru a camp level effort to get an item for quest the final item should be camp quality.  Also “time as an equivalent of effort.”  <br />
<br />
5.  Raids.  While I am sure that some people are very pleased with the idea of 30/60/90 people raids, I personally find them annoying.  I would rather see encounters that would be raid level at most be 2 or 3 groups (with the new number of people per group at 8).  Perhaps a few rare encounters for more than that.  But very rare and few.<br />
<br />
6.  Make grouping experience more comparable to soloing.  I know its been said to death.  And Verent has tried to fix it.  But there are still so many cases that a lone soloist can out do a group for exp movement.  <br />
<br />
7.  A better guild system.  A system that is less stringent and in need of human assistance to work with.  One of the few things I will say I liked about DaoC was the guild system.  It allowed for quite a few options.  Though they were a bit difficult to work with given the command line interface.  <br />
<br />
8.  The Game world.  Obviously we are looking at a game with much better graphical engine.  But the artistry and visuals within that are both highly important.  A Color TV is great but if you can only pick up black and white shows whats the point?  (ok that may be a little beyond some of the younglings).  I can live with a bunch of orcs in the game world as long you make them different, different models, different textures, different sizes.  But those are just the physical properties.  The less tangible properties are just as important to the roleplayer in me.  Why is the mob in any given place, what its motivation, is it friend or foe and why?<br />
<br />
9.  Good vs Evil.  EQ really ended up skewing the lines in many cases on what is good vs evil.  Or at least the powergamers did.  I still look at the whole Dragon/giant/dwarf debacle within Velious and see a mess.  People turned the whole deity and good/evil thing inside out in an effort to gain power.  It was and is disheartening.  While some ambiguity is good to make you question morality and ethics there simply wasn’t any real consequences for choosing the wrong path.  <br />
<br />
10.  Story.  While EQ has a story its often not easy to find and figure out.  I hope there are more events to help tell whatever story they want to tell in EQ2.  I hope its more accessible to people who play the game (be it by participation or reading about it).  I hope they support things like player made newpapers or books so that the story can be spread.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Obviously there are many areas that are just full of greyness.  I feel roleplaying is good and important but I am not going to impose my beliefs in that area over that of other play styles.  <br />
<br />
So lets hear some other thoughts and ideas.  Preferable positive ones.</div></div><hr />
