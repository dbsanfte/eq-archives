<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shiba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">For me, it has no stats. Has ANYONE gotten this charm to show stats? (Yeah my melee skills are mastered as the charm says is necessary.)<br />

<br />
Please post if you've gotten this thing to show stats, thank you!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It works, but you have to MAX all weapon skills except H2H.  Max = 200 skill for us so you have to get pierce, 1hblunt and 2hblunt all to 200 before it will have all the stats listed.<br />
<br />
If you only have one skill to 200 it will have some stats, 2 weapon skills to 200 it will have slightly better stats, and finally when you get all 3 to 200 the focus effect will appear on the charm and work.  You must re-equip the charm after you max your stats or it won't show the updated ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shiba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hmmm on mine it says mastered (not max) but I guess that could mean the same thing,  (silly though, as the skill window does end up saying mastered, but never say's maxed.)<br />
<br />
Thank you very much, not what I wanted to hear, but does explain the problem I'm having!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Shiba, can you tell me about which room the Seer spawns in?  I once saw the Seer being killed by someone in 'the Broken Skull Bloodlord' room (room straight ahead from the trap) but I had no way to know if it spawned in that same room or if it was pulled to there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shiba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The room past the trap with the four way split, go to the left side, hall bends to the right immediately after you turn left out of the main room and the hall dead ends.  In the room of the dead end, there are three spawns, the one in the center is the PH.  This is the ONLY place he spawns.  Not to be discouraging, but the spawn is INSANELY rare.  (I believe its a 100% drop if that makes you feel better.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Chaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hmm.  Can you tell me which room from this map please?  Your description has me sorta baffled.  The rooms are numbered here.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shiba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hmm for some reason that map isn't matching what I remember the lay out to be...Here are more specific directions (special thanks to Veremar on Bertox for these directions, following them is how I found it myself!).<br />
<br />
From Nadox Zone-in: <br />
<br />
1) Head down corridor and go through fake wall. <br />
2) Go straight and open door. (static guard behind door) <br />
3) Follow passage left and then follow it until you hit a &quot;T&quot; intersection. (wandering guard along this hall) <br />
4) Take the &quot;T&quot; to the right, be careful, if you continue ahead straight to the wall you will fall down a trap into a water area below. So you need to take the left just before you get to the next &quot;T&quot; at the end of the hall, and that will wrap around and lead you to the other side. <br />
5) I think if you follow this 2nd &quot;T&quot; to the right it will hit an elbow that turns to the left. As it does so, you will see an open doorway straight ahead, and one to the right. <br />
6) Follow the doorway to the right and it will take you down and to the left. <br />
7) you will enter a big room with exits on all sides and 4 static mobs in it. (also 1-2 wanderers pass through here)  Take the left corridor. It will then turn to the right and empty into the room that the Seer spawns in.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps, it definately helped me!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shiba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Re-reading the directions and looking at that map...Go down the steps marked on the bottom right of that map, go off the map and you'll hit the four way I was refering to!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dementhos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Speaking of maxxed weapon's skills, are there still NPC's around you can raise your skills on, but dont attack?  Heh I know that skellie in the Firepot room was good for this for awhile, before he got changed to untargetable. I am sure there is still one or two out there that still work for this, though they would have to be blue to a level 63. Maxing 2hb at my level is quite the pain. Knew I should have used one when i was younger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Chaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Shiba, that helped a ton!  Thank you very much :)  Guess someone musta pulled the Seer upstairs or something when I saw it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">On that map above, the Seer spawns in the room on the far bottom right of the map.  You go off the map that's shown to get there.  Good luck!<br />
<br />
edit: Oh and one more thing that you probably won't want to hear .. but he doesn't drop the charm every time.  I killed him twice and once he dropped a fairly nice ring with effect: Spirit Sight (worn).</div></div><hr />

Our 61 pet works good for this. Other class pets as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The charm from the Seer is a very very long camp -- rare spawn, rare drop. And some competition.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">First try netted one for me, though it took me a couple hours to spawn him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">This looks like a very nice item for that slot....<br />
<br />
I will have to make it a priority.<br />
<br />
My pearcing is a little behind but 1hb and 2hb are at 200.</div></div><hr />

You can do that??  Just summon, target, and attack?  I used dogdog for practicing begging till that was nerfed, but didn't know you could get melee skillups off em.  Jeez, I feel silly.  I maxxed mine on spiders in Velks.  Buffed myself up, slowed and crippled a spider, preferably crystalline, and backed him into the corner halfway up the ramp near the zone.  Be sure to dex buff yourself to the gills...potions are your friends here, they'll stack with our dex buffs.  And haste, of course.  Borrowing a haste item in addition to casting it on yourself would help.  It also helped to get a really fast weapon.  There are plenty of speedy ones going cheap in the Bazaar nowadays.  They might hit for next to nothing, but all that matters for improving your skill is the delay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Duel a pet caster who can summon a blue pet, and has /pet hold.    Then you hit pet all you want all day long and it should (theory here) regen at normal un-aggro'd rates... aka more than we hit for with rusty weapons.   Pet won't hit back, and you can get all your skills.</div></div><hr />
