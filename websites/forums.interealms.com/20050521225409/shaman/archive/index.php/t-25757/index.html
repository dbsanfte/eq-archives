<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>phogel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a 66 shaman that I was currently going to use to pl a ranger or a warrior that I have.  They are both the same level and I like them both evenly...so my question is which of the two would be the most proficient to level?  I am guessing the warrior just because I would not be using my bow that much with ranger considering Id be tanking.  Let me know what you all think and thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Both are going to be about the same but it really depends on the equipment you have for them.<br />
<br />
I'd personally go with the ranger as snare a few other utilities would be nice to have. More fun to play to but thats all personal opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shiuna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I leveled up a dwarf rogue to use as a second pet. He's kinda cute but he's only got 1 eye and he's not too bright.....it's fun to watch him run, though.<br />
<br />
When we're grouped I let the rogue follow me, then run off a ways and turn around to see him try to keep up. His legs were just'a churning.....  hehehe.....ah, well, enough dwarf bashing.<br />
<br />
I assume the shaman is not your main...<br />
<br />
You should easily be able to pl either character to the mid to high 50's just by buffing and hasting the crap out of the powerlevelee, slowing the mob, and healing as needed. Once the mob's health goes below 50%, sic the dog on 'im and let the powerlevelee get the next mob.<br />
<br />
Note that, unless you're diligent, the powerlevelee will have crappy defensive skills.<br />
<br />
After level 57 or so it's pretty boring.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rubitt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">if your looking primarily to duo go with the ranger.   although he wont be able to tank as well as the warrior he adds alot of utility and greater dps.  with aas hp and ac he can also tank most mobs your going to be fighting.  alternately he can sit back and use the bow if you wan to root rot.  for a duo the abilities to harmony, snare, buff and track are huge.<br />
<br />
however if your lookin to use them as the core of a group a warrior give you a better starting base than the ranger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>phogel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">thanks for all the fast responses, ive given it some thought after reading your posts and i think i will go with the ranger. i do like the extra abilities he has over the warrior, as far as hp nothin a little more tweekin cant fix to atleast get the ranger some decent hp.  and no the sham is not my main i do like the char alot but im no guru of any sorts on shammies just a casual player that enjoys alot of classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ranger can tank fine up untill about Tier 3 if PoP.  Before I got bored of it, I had a level 57 Ranger in another account that I would duo with.  He could tank anything except Kriegers and named in BoT with only my 65 shaman healing/debuffing.  With my friend's cleric bot he could tank the kriegers, but its was always touch and go, and that was at 57 with just over 4K buffed and 1200-1300 AC.  <br />
<br />
Warriors wil tank better, but no utility other than tanking isnt much fun.  And once you get EQ/AR3 your ranger is set for DPS untill you get some really nice weapon upgrades from GoD/OOW and then he will be better DPS meleeing instead of plinking arrows.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well you don't mention what level warrior and ranger are - if they happen to be low level then maybe consider SK (about favourite 2 box choice here judging by comments i have seen) or paladin (probably my favourite because of complementary buffs and also rez, not quite so efficient for dungeon crawling though).<br />
<br />
Probably most of warrior gear could twink one of these and there are some sick knight only tradeable weapons that sell for buttons nowadays.<br />
<br />
Just a thought, maybe War or Rng are in their 50's and you don't want to do the grind although I leveled up an SK to mid 40's in about a 4 days /played once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">if your looking primarily to duo go with the ranger.   although he wont be able to tank as well as the warrior he adds alot of utility and greater dps. <br />
<br />
There DPS isnt much different.  A ranger has an innate attck bonus but the warrior gets triple attack post60.  Since they both are on the same damage table and can use the same weapons, there DPS works out to be close to each other.<br />
<br />
Yes, this is a common grip among rangers.  Warriors are TANKS not DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>phogel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">in regard to your post kevagron hes 46 ill put magelo below, i did a couple levels since yesterday and he does fine solo...well solo if u dont count sham helpin him)<br />
