<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Saramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Litgruvs Thread about Sony being having brought EQ from EBay started me thinking.<br />
<br />
Are Sony Devs really as inept as they seem to be.?<br />
When was the last biggish patch you remember that didnt leave more bugs in than it fixed ?.<br />
Do the Devs actually care where EQ is going or is it just something for them to toy around with in their lunchbreaks ?.<br />
Are there any devs left from the original Verant days and are we in fact blaming Sony for something that would have happened even if Verant were still in charge ?.<br />
Does anyone at Sony even if its just the office cleaner actually have &quot;The Vision&quot; of what EQ will become ?.<br />
Why do they always bring the servers down immediately if someones found an exploit be it large or small yet when major bugs are found it always takes days or weeks for a fix.Some may answer to this that to find a bug say for example non shrinkage of pets takes weeks going through code etc.Well surely it would take just as long to find out why Sharks are dropping several million GP ?.<br />
Why is Sonys customer service so really piss poor.I can honestly say it is the worst service ive ever seen from any company.Yes i know we ONLY pay $12 a month but hell thats still $12.If i decide to buy a Volkswagen instead of a Merceded I pay less but i dont expect the After Sales Service to be non existent.<br />
Do Sony really hate Shaman or just totally clueless ?.<br />
Why was Brenlo given his job ?.<br />

They have a game thats at least as addictive as a number of class A drugs and they know people will keep coming back for more even if they get a bad hit<br />

He's referring to This thread (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=20925) in which Litgruv states Verant sold itself to the highest bidder.  <br />

Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't Verant a wholly owned subsidiary of Sony before EQ even reached Beta?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Hizzter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Look, it is all very very simple.<br />
<br />
The 'A' team that used to work on EQ is long gone.  So is the 'B' team, the 'C' team, and the 'D' team.  All that matters to Sony now is the number at the bottom of a spreadsheet.<br />
<br />
The 'F' team currently running the show is as clueless as a newborn, both on design, coding, and customer service.  You cannot expect any really great enhancements / additions to this game anymore.  Be patient, and when WoW hits the shelves and most guilds cannot scrape up enough folks to raid Crushbone....that is when you'll see lots of knee-jerk, reactionary changes from Sony.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I disagree.  It's unproductive because it's not being presented in a productive manner (i.e.: it's a rant not a question/suggestion.)  As an example, consider this &quot;question&quot; from the original post:  Do Sony really hate Shaman or just totally clueless ?. <br />
<br />
Do you really think that's going to result in a productive response?  I can almost guarantee you all it's going to do is get the entire post ignored.  Enough of these types of posts and the entire board gets ignored.  (btw, I realize there are a lot of productive posts on this board and I commend those posters...I just don't want to see their hard work go down the drain due to the increased level of whining I've seen on this board over the last 6 months)<br />
<br />
Also, if anyone expects to make a suggestion that involves game balance and have the suggestion implemented in a month or two I think they have unrealistic expectations.<br />
<br />
One more comment...my main is a 65 warrior.  Until the recent melee changes, warriors were in as bad/worse shape then shaman are today.  That was a very frustrating time to have played a warrior.  However, after a lot of work we got the class upgraded so it's fun again.  Shaman are going through the same process now.  One difference is, shaman are not &quot;the most broke class in the game&quot; like warriors were...so monks are going to get the attention first.  But, Sony will get to shaman.  Also, I'm not saying don't post your ideas or that I think shaman don't need changes...all I'm saying is, be productive with your comments and realistic with your short term expectations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Do you really think that's going to result in a productive response?  <br />
<br />
lol, that is the only that gets a response.  read the shaman boards at Sony.  Brenlo does not respond to well thought out posts, because there is no response that works from Sony.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hmm in answer to the question, there are 2 sides really.<br />
In Defense of SoE, <br />
I think people playing the game have high expectations of SoE, combined with the fact everyone has more of a say now with the prevalence of messageboards and so a feeling of discontentment with something can spread very quickly and oversize itself especially amongst <br />
communities which members are all of the same type. Not saying this about the shaman issue just a general observation.<br />
 <br />
Also, there are lots of paths which people want the game to go.  With  so much appeal, SoE has to select their way of evolving the game. Which there will be people that will inevitably be disappointed by the path they choose. Additionally, class balance is a another issue hard to get right, there will people disappointed with their class no matter how right they could be, if they have perhaps less input than other classes. <br />
<br />
Also the concept of 3d mmorpgs is still very new, and an updatable game of this proportion is very groundbreaking in a way so in a respect they can't really follow any set formula and are pioneering. Plus, eq is an old engine, which I imagine could be difficult to program for or so it seems by the lack of variety that has come along.<br />
<br />
Finally, Verant got a lot of flack too when they were in charge, I remember when terms like **** VI were prevalent, only to be corrected as its SoE now. So **** SoE was adopted slowly over time. So in some aspects the game was broken even before SoE took over, and certainly some of those aspects were much more irritating before SoE.<br />
<br />
However in criticism of SoE, I think there is a lack of passion now in the game especially behind making new expansions. Soe provide the goods, which do enough for people to maintain their &quot;addiction&quot; but I don't think they really inject fun into the game anymore and the emphasis seems to be about gimmicks and using tired old formulas in terms of new equipment, spells and new mobs. Admittedly I am generalizing I know there are some attempts of difference, it just seems incredibly minor to the game a whole.<br />
<br />
I also think they don't engage in communication enough with certain communities or if they do take a overly long time. Admittedly, certain communities are adept at making issues out of nonissues, and no doubt it is hard from their end to try explain this without the background atmosphere of contemptment but efforts all count. Brett's communications to the different communities is a start though.<br />
<br />
So some of the flack SoE do get is undeserved, however, in other ways they are the direct perpetruators of the way the game has gone to be cheapened and weakened. Although, it is also equally viable that a lot of people have finally begun to tire of the game and so want to attribute blame. Its kinda hard to recognize the most true reflection of the state of the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I think people playing the game have high expectations of SoE<br />
<br />
... as they should. $12.95/month for non-Legends, and we get handed work apparently done by amateurs? Yet they keep expecting the populous to keep forking out the $13/month because of (insert item here).<br />
<br />
If they truly cared about the customer base, the well thought out posts done by multiple people, would at least have a response, or an acknowledgement, and the &quot;rants&quot; would be ignored. Unfortunately, it's the other way around. Additionally, development would be more concerned about content working, than about &quot;making it look prettier&quot;... provided even THAT works.<br />
<br />
These aren't high expectations here, getting a response to well thought out issues, as opposed to the rants, and actually testing things before they go live? Any software company that wants to keep their customers, and keep them happy, wouldn't be caught NOT doing so, but... they have so many hooked by just throwing in new &quot;drool factor&quot; items, that it puts the blinders on the fact there are glaring, and ignored, issues.<br />
<br />
14 days left for me, in the last 7, they've screwed up even worse (just go to Tranquility... try to find the Soulbinder, or the Ornate/Elemental guy), which, could have been easily caught by being tested, fixed, or at least put on Test, unless nobody on Test goes to Tranquility for Ornate/Elemental armor, or noticed the Soulbinder missing? (which I doubt)<br />
<br />
There's free software (free play too) that's better supported and has better bug fixes, or at least other, also free, places to go to get around those glitches.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Razzaziah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">My guess is the 'talent' is gone and they are using junior engineers who cost less (example the XML ui person no longer works at SOE).<br />
<br />
I'm not going to predict the future of EQ but I can state what they have done in the past.  They have tied the innovation to purchasing a 30 dollar expansion and the eqLive team to &quot;bug fixing&quot;/&quot;finishing&quot; the expansions.  We can only hope that if competition truely does take place that SOE decides to revamp EQ1 vs work on EQ2.<br />
<br />
Someone mentioned discontent.  I prefer to call it unfulfilled promises.<br />
<br />
Conservatively I have given ~$800 to sony over 4 years.  Some have given more, some have given less.  In 3 of those years I was quite content.  There was enough stuff for me to do to be satisfied.  Now I'm reading that there is a big wall ahead of me (I yet to reach it) where players are basically consuming the game faster then the developers are producing it.  And the number of people in this situation are increasing.  It is increasing because those dissatisfied are leaving, and guilds at this point recruit from lower levels who 'skip' past chunks of the content.<br />
<br />
I want to give SOE credit.  But when all I see are items where the stats are Expansion # * 5-10 I'm lose faith.  The fact old zones are unchanging, you can laugh about the cloth cap (and its fabled version) but these items serve zero point now a days, remove them, change the zones across all expansions.  Create: Ring war #2, Raise the caps on tradeskills to 400 and make trivial items no fail.  Allow instancing of any zone at a cost of PP (and limit the frequency).  COMPETE in the marketplace.<br />
<br />
One thing EQ has which other MMORPG developers dont.  People are PAYING them to continue development.  They have a successful product and are being paid to make it MORE successful.  People may want to play EQ2 where characters/npcs look like highly polished barbie dolls (i.e made of plastic, not built with a rack), but doesnt appeal to me.<br />
<br />
SOE should use the money they are taking in to make it more difficult for their competitors to compete.<br />
<br />
Razz</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'm not referring to the shaman problems as high expectations, just commenting on the issues that face SoE. I completely agree that as a consumer we most likely would expect nothing less especially regarding the amount of money they get. However, they have to prioritize so many things to work on , and with each new expansion there are a lot of specific appeals to which certain groups of people hope that it will meet. <br />
<br />
Testing and communication are 2 problems,  communication I acknowleged in my post, its one area they severly lack in. And testing, some games can take months testing everything out, with the complication of eq its no wonder that there are problems. So there will be bugs, and most of the time they do deal with them I think, however, their trend of releasing stuff before it is ready or properly tested is  a big flaw of SoE. Every MMORPG will have bugs or class issues though on release since it is impossible or difficult to foresee every issue. I do agree though that SoE seem to adopt the slack attitude regarding this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I also agree that communication and testing seem to be weak points for SoE.  I don't have any expecations of a bug free game, but they don't seem to hesitate at throwing out a release either without significant testing or with known, significant flaws (ex:  the new collision issues.)<br />
<br />
I also expect communication and testing to seriously bite SoE once a real competitor is out there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you actually know how many very productive,well thought out intelligent postings on the state of Shaman there has been on this board ?<br />
Not sure of exact numbers but we're talking an awful lot.<br />
How many of those posts have brought an answer from Sony ?<br />
1 or maybe 2.<br />
How many whiney rants have there been on the EQ Boards from various classes apart from Shaman ?<br />
A lot.<br />
How many of those posts have got answers from Sony ?<br />
A lot.<br />
<br />
Trust me this was not a rant post.<br />
It is actually my HONEST opinion of the state of EQ and Sony at the moment.<br />
Seriously my only real nasty comment was &quot; Why was Brenlo given his job&quot; <br />
Would you seriously want this man running your companies customer relations programme ?.<br />
Oh and if Monks are the most broken class in EQ (Which i tend to agree with) why are Sony concentrating on Rogues at the moment ?.<br />
Plus when was the 1st time you warriors heard that Sony were seriously addressing your many problems.?<br />
It was when warriors en masse threatened a sit in.<br />

I hope these were done &quot;dipping&quot; with sarcasm, cause otherwise you're showing just how new to this board you are.  The &quot;productive non-rant thread question/suggestions&quot; have all been done in triplicate with no success.  Only things that seem to work are to do things the way of the druid.  Rant, scream, kick your feet till you're blue in the face.  It's only then that SoE seems to notice.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sorry, don't mean to flame or start anything, just thought the whole &quot;presented in a productive manner&quot; bit was funny as hell after everything shaman have done to get SoE's attention.<br />
<br />
Either that or we've found our SoE employee of the month.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Honestly, not meaning to be mean -- but I think you're pretty optimistic if you think they pay much attention to this board or most others.  Remember how many years people were telling them that the effective shaman spell drop rate was much lower than they thought it was because of the huge loot tables on, say, Juggs?  Some problems go on for years before they say, hey, whadda ya know!  Maybe there IS something to that after all!<br />
<br />
Really, it's not like there is any kind of a history of rapid response or avid board skimming from Sony personnel to rely upon and that we should be terribly scared is going to fall out of place.<br />
<br />
If the CS level was of a significantly higher order, then worries about some post or other on some board or other would be far more critical.  As it is now, one more post is just one more grain of sand on a beach.  I think you are very positive and optimistic about the impact of these boards and these posts, which is nice enough, but I don't think it's realistic.</div></div><hr />
