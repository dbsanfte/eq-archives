<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Seveca</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Been reading posts on the site recently.  I think this is my first post, so I better make it a good one.<br />
<br />
/startrant<br />
I just think Alchemy needs to be re-tooled, and many others feel the same way from what I have read.  There is no call for any of our potions, with the exception of higher end multiple person raids.  And even then most people don't want potions because of whatever reason.  So what is the point?  I am a 47 Shaman with an alchemy skill of 108 now and the potions I have made to get to this level do not sell, even in the bazaar.  Sure, I can make SoW potions and try to undercut my brethren Shaman to make a couple plat, but that will just drive the prices down to where we make 1pp per 10 dose.  I already see that happening.  On Tribunal Server, it was so bad that I saw 10 Dose SoW potions going for 69p 9g 9s 9c.  How friggin greedy do you have to be???  I stopped trying to sell 'em now, and just give the potions I make to my guildies and friends.  What is the point?!?!?!<br />
<br />
Other tradeskills have recieved upgrades, why not Alchemy?  Seems like blacksmithing gets ten new smithed armors every upgrade that are better than the last.  What do they have against Alchemy?<br />
<br />
My opinion only here, but I have been playing EQ for a year, so I don't know exactly what it was like the first year it came out.  But in talks with old-time-EQ'ers (we all know the ones....I was here for Beta! lol), the weapons and equipment was so far below what it is now that I think our potions would have been HIGHLY sought after.  (I still have a hard time thinking that the Short Sword of Ykesha being the most uber weapon in the game.)  But they have thrown so many different variations of weapons and armor that have stats and proc's that our potions have become useless.  Sometimes even our spells can be useless with the equipment that is out there.   I had a warrior, prolly 40-50 because we were in DL, tell me not to waste mana on him for a strength buff because he was already maxed at 255.<br />
/endrant<br />
<br />
Some things I would like to see is potions that don't have ANY negative stats.  Maybe even ressurection potions, with a set up like the clerics have.  Meaning, first rez potion is no exp, next is minor exp, then more, then more, etc..  Or maybe some Illusion potions.  SOMETHING!!  And the prices!  I know I just about fainted when I saw the prices on some of the higher end reagents.  And they saw Jewelcraft is expensive?<br />
<br />
Ok, ok, ok....so NOW /endrant.<br />
<br />
I was happy that Shaman are the only ones to get Alchemy.  Too bad it is not as useful as it should be.  Or could be, I should say.<br />
<br />
Hopefully there will be some responses to this so my venting won't go unnoticed.<br />

Would be nice to have a trophy, which summons a medicine bag.</div></div><hr />

GREAT IDEA !!! :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
*Yawn*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd be quite happy if they even just redid the sell back on the potions and herbs to vendors.    Herb prices vary from about 2pp to near 100p, but every single one sells back for the same9 some gold... ARGH!<br />
<br />
  Potions sell back at a SLIGHTLY different price per potion, but still nothing NEAR what you paid.<br />
<br />
  THe only exceptions to this are the 2 new herbs and WoK, which you can sell back at a very minor loss....  When I saw that I had hoped the redid the resale on other herbs, and was sorely dissapointed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Andal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Oh vey.  I've been playing since beta, and it's been understood that tradeskills were not implemented as ways to generate cash.<br />
<br />
You can, of course, but complaining that Alchemy is not one of the profitable skills misses the point.  Take up Smithing.<br />
<br />
If someone wants to eek out a meager profit by selling lower than everyone else, that's their business and their right.  If the margins are too low, then you can do something else.<br />
<br />
But calling the person selling for 1pp profit &quot;greedy&quot;, when your intention is being able to make 50pp profit, is a classic example of what psychiatrists call &quot;projection&quot;.<br />
<br />
The person who sells as high as possible is obviously more &quot;greedy&quot; than the one who sells as low as possible, from the viewpoint of the consumer.  And that is the only relevant viewpoint.  The guy selling low is doing a public service to those who purchase potions, and is therefore charitable, not greedy.<br />
<br />
If you take a look at the stat potions, you will find that they've been designed to be used in sets of three.  The proper combination of three potions will result in no stat reductions to the imbiber.  Most potion boosts will stack with similar spell buffs, therefore potions have utility for the imaginative.<br />
<br />
What I think would be nice is the ability to forage or find as drops the potion components.  Other than that, I'm very happy being the Alchemist!<br />
<br />
It's a unique ability, you get fun stuff to give to your friends.  It's not about cash, it's about being a Shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Of course, when you have people cranking out sow potions by the hundreds via macroquest, what sort of projection is that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Seveca</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Garf....sorry if I bored you, but I haven't read all the posts.  Just needed to vent a little.  And BTW, I guess tests would be testic.....nm.<br />
<br />
Andal....I understand your opinion and agree with it to a point.  I am not trying to make 150K by my alchemy.  I would like to be able to make some potions that would be useful to my guildmates and friends that are not going to cause me to go broke.<br />
<br />
As far as making SoW potions go, I am only saying that I made money to work on my Alchemy by selling SoW potions in WC.  Now, with people undercutting each other on EVERYTHING in the bazaar, a young Shaman that wants to increase his/her skill in this area will not be able to make any plat selling SoW potions in the bazaar because some of us only fail once or twice per stack, whereas some with a lower skill level might fail 8 to 10 times.  I always considered myself part of a brotherhood as a Shaman.  A brotherhood who try to help each other.  But, by undercutting each other on prices for the few potions people will pay for, we cut out the lower levels who do not have the skill level we do to make these potions.<br />
<br />
And yes, maybe when Beta came out it was understood that tradeskills were not designed as ways to generate cash, but that is what they are being used for right now.  Lots of things have changed since Beta, and I am not saying that I agree with them.  I am simply stating the ideology of those playing at this time.  I agree that selling at a lower price is everyone's right.  And as far as the ideation of projection is concerned, I would have to say that I disagree.  The standard rate on Tribunal server for a SoW potion has been 100 pp.  Has been for the time I have been playing at least.  And since the bazaar has opened I have seen a fast decline in price so that only Shaman with higher skill levels can turn a profit at all.  Why did it change?  Because Shaman want to sell more potions to make more money.  So it would be greed that motivates those individuals.<br />
<br />
And as far as the person selling at the lowest price being charitable, I disagree with that also.  Most of those people were not so &quot;charitable&quot; when the going rate was 100 pp.  They were selling them for 99pp and still trying to undercut others.  So they were not charitable, just greedy.  Maybe it was only that way on my server.  And that is only my opinion.<br />
<br />
I really do understand your point, but if potions weren't so expensive to make, I probably wouldn't be bitching and complaining right now.  I mean, hell, to get your skill in baking up to in baking to 135 is minimal compared to attempting one potion that is trivial at 90.  And yes, I understand that our potions give better stats than 99% of all baked items, but it is just an example.<br />
<br />
I am truly sorry, but it was a little offensive to me when that warrior told me that he didn't need a STR buff because he was already maxed unbuffed.  I just wish we could get some new potions that would be more helpful.  Seems that a lot of other tradeskills have recieved improvements to keep up with the EQ upgrades, and Alchemy has not been upgraded in relation to the other tradeskills.<br />

'Course, I ahve had a couple drinks while writing this, so take it with a grain of salt.<br />
