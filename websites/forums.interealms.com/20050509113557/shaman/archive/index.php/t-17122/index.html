<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have heard lots of good things about gear drops in Veksar for the non uber shaman.<br />
<br />
I am level 63 with average gear (see magelo link in signature). I have my epic, but I don't have Torpor (have stoicism). Also, I don't have Pox, only Bane of Nife. I have most 61 / 62 spells, but only 2 or 3 63 spells.<br />
<br />
So, is it realistic for me to try to solo in Veksar? I mean, I know I can solo trash after the drop off, with care, but are the named guys that drop the good stuff gonna rip my head off and p1ss into my neck?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Popu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The undead in Veksar are VERY VERY VERY posion and disease resistant, don't bother trying to land these - all the the undead.  Cold lands ok. You are pretty much stuck to doing golems and going after the massive golem ( I think that's the named one) for any loot. Slowed they hit for mid to high 200's if I remember.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The LDoN dots wreck Veksar mobs; the undead have fairly low MR, and after any realistic debuffing, the new dots land well.  This opens up quite a bit more of the zone to Shaman soloing than before.  Its possible to solo for Kylong Darkmail Gauntlets now ... although it takes some ambition and a good bit of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah pretty much like Pop said Wey, the golems are really the only things that are going to be worthwhile trying until you get maybe Bane and Ana. Even then, you've pretty limited as to what you can do to the nobles etc.. with regards to damage. Keeping any camp like Chef clear means you have to drop mobs fairly efficiently so that's probably not going to happen. Not sure how you'd get on at Shop - you may be able to just hold the half dozen spawns around the named area down. Would be a lot of work though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tragik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It really depends on what you're going for.  A lot of named in Veksar can be singled out of the room (without FD pulling) and for the double pulls you can use root to pull one, get them both slowed and work them down slowly with pet, epic, LDoN dot and the occasional ice nuke.<br />
<br />
If you're looking for shaman usuable gear you can try:<br />
<br />
1.  Chef camp for the Kylong Darkmail Girdle.<br />
<br />
2.  Highborns (rough mobs 58 - 63) for the gauntlets.<br />
<br />
3.  Shop camp for the shield and tunic (haste belt and 2hb also drop here - there are two floors of mobs in the front shop camp.  Right off from the golems).<br />
<br />
4.  Temple/Warlock camp drops another belt with right click summon companion (works from inven) along with a 1hp.<br />
<br />
5.  Hands drop an affliction efficiency 3 ring and a named Warlock in the Theatre drops a spell haste 3 ring.<br />
<br />
6.  There is also an FT2 necklace that drops in the sewers.  Stats are so so and I never bothered going for it.<br />
<br />
Plenty of other camps also.  You always have the option of hitting a couple of the easier rooms for just the loot drops to sell then buy what you want in the bazaar.  Except for the nobles dogdog can tank just about everything here.  Nobles hit for up to 464 btw, depending on level.  You'll need to torpor tank these and the fight will be looooooong if you're sporting average gear (didn't look).  <br />
*EDIT:  Just reread your post and realized you don't have torpor so I would really recommend skipping these if you're solo.<br />
<br />
Anyway, good luck.  If you're just after loot and farmage fun then speed of kills really doesn't matter.  Carry a couple of ITU 10 charges with you for the undead and remember that aggro and assist ranges are very small in Veksar.  Common sense can often make it clear what order to pull in for singles without having to resort to root or VP pulls.<br />
<br />
Goblins and Golems are the only live mobs as well.  Everything else is undead.<br />
<br />
*EDIT:  I usually do this place with my necro.  The combination of snare (for pulling/splitting), undead slow, undead mez, superior pet, fast taps, fire/magic dots, forceshield make this much easier then doing the same with my shaman.  As a shaman I recommend grabbing a nec/bst/mag or any of the tank able melee classes like pal/sk/war/mnk/rng.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for all the advice people.<br />
<br />
I will have a go at shopkeepers - I know how to get there. I might try to muster enough LDoN points to get the spells, but other than that, I might just have to tank 'em in teh face, so long as I can work out how to single. I think I can probably get 1200AC self buffed with a couple of gear swaps out of the bag, and I will just have to hope that will be enough to do the job.<br />
<br />
Is there a particular mob in the shopkeeper area? Or a placeholder, or do I just try and kill as many as possible?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Placeholder for the &quot;a rotting shopkeeper&quot; is &quot;a revenant&quot;.  PH for the &quot;an undying blacksmith&quot; is &quot;a wraith&quot;.  Spawns named once every half dozen spawns or so?<br />
<br />
Off the top of my head,<br />
Shopkeeper: drops Kunzar Deathshield as common, Soulscream Belt as rare.<br />
Blacksmith: drops Battleworn Ch'Ror and Kylong Darkmail BP<br />
<br />
You can also pull the Iksar Behemoth PH (a massive golem) from here with a group, but I doubt you could keep it going solo if you're trying to keep spawns broken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Breaking the shop solo would probably be roughat your level without Torpor. Puppy, Epic, JBB and ****ty ice nukes are the only ways you have to doing damage and you can't single pull the shop, there will be 2 fights where you have to take 2 at a time. Mobs aren't that high level there so root parking works (but I think they summon). It would be a lot easier and efficient if you brought along a tank imo. It's a nice easy duo spot for a shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tragik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Breaking shop can be fairly easy if you get lucky on a long lasting root.  When you enter from the golem area you'll pass through 2 rooms with a single mob in each.  Kill these then proceed towards the 3rd and final 1st floor room with 3 spawns (2 mobs + PH/named).  <br />
<br />
The way I split these is to move into the room just far enough to cast on the mob closest to me.  Root him and the middle spawn will come alone.  Sic the pet on it for some breathing room while you land slow and drop a root on it to keep it focused on the pet.  Now edge back into the room and slow/reroot the 1st mob and finish killing the &quot;add&quot;.<br />
<br />
That's it, room is broken.  Kill the parked mob next then pull the PHer/named.  Once the room is cleared move to the bottom of the steps and setup permanent camp right there.  This way you only have to deal with the 3 room pops and nothing else.  Remember to keep tight control over the pet if you don't have /pet hold.  Some of the spawns do HT and cast and having the pet run into melee range too soon can be hazardous to your health.<br />
<br />
The chain tunic drops off the named on the 2d level of the shop.  To single pull those use the same tactic for the 1st floor except you're going to root the middle spawn and aggro the mob closest to you.  Kill him at the bottom of the stairs, then pull the 2d (rooted mob).  The PHer/named on this floor is placed out of assist range so he'll never add to a pull here.<br />
<br />
Last bit of advice on this camp.  Take the loots you obtain here including the tunic if it drops and sell it all in the bazaar.  Pickup some Tae Ew with that cash.  Better stats and even though it's purchased armor you still earned it fair and square.  Get the haste belt to drop and that'll pay for a damned near full set (the good pieces anyway).<br />
<br />
Good luck to you.<br />
