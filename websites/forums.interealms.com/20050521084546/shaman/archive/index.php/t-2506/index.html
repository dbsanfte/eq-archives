<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Currenly, my armor is crap in a few slots:<br />
<br />
<br />
Boots: JB.. lots better out there<br />
Hands: JB &quot; &quot;<br />
Arms: JB &quot; &quot;<br />
Wrist 1: Rune Etched<br />
Head: JB <br />
Ear1: 25hp/mana <br />
Waist: Fear belt<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Items that arent' junk:<br />
<br />
JBB<br />
Obby shroud<br />
Fungi<br />
Dorfy Legs<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
My plan, was to sell the obby shroud for 6-7k (people pay this on my server) and  redo my wrist with a Defence bracer (serious ac boost) and maybe another slot...<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyone have any input?  I'm working probably with a total of 7-8k in plat and although I know Coldain are better stat wise I'm looking to up my raw AC as well. (Troll)<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yeah, go to HoT you slacker. ;)  Wolfcallers is a decent JB upgrade and it even looks good on trolls ;)<br />
<br />
JB armour is hardly crap, its decent AC armour with the weaknesses being that the clickies rarely come in handy and there are no stats or resists on any bits but the BP and legs.<br />
<br />
Earing, try the twisted leaves one (AC2, 2 WIS, +15 HP/Mana, clicky spirit of scale), or the new crafted one from CT would be decent.<br />
<br />
Wrist, Bracer of sense (hang in Umbral with a group, it'll happen).  I'm pretty keen on my wolf callers in this slot, solid AC, although the ultravision clicky is mostly meaningless to you.<br />
<br />
There have been some really good belt suggestions on this board in the past and for the life of me, I can't think of any, but I'm pretty happy with my PoF belt.<br />
<br />
Hands, I believe the general consensus is coldain skin gloves.<br />
<br />
Head, the thurg head bit is nice (AC:16, wis 5, stam 6, +15 mana) and looks like FS so it should cover that ugly mugg of yours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Obulous Death Shroud is worth more than 6-7k . . . at least on my server.  I've seen it auctioned for as much as 65k, but sold for as much as 45k.  It's a pretty decent caster item, comparable to FT5 or so for a shaman who is pretty active.  <br />
<br />
I'd keep whatchu got, head to ToV and do some HoT.  You'll get wolfcallers, just a matter of time and pressure.  Wrist slots that are good include Matchless Dragonhorn at 15 ac 12 wis, or Peerless at 14 ac 11 wis (I wore one for a while).  Bracelet of Sense is good too of course.  <br />
<br />
Go on more raids if you want upgrades.  Simple as that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks Lan that's good advice.  Will look into those options as well.  My guild raids HOT on thursdays but to be honest we have too many damn shaman in our guild *stacking issue whine here* *stacking issue whine done* so even when I meet minimum level I'll have issues getting in.</div></div><hr />
