<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been out of EQ since the GoD expansion came out. Here is my current list of expansions, am I only missing Omens of War and the new DoN or is there another one in there as well?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance, I'm a bit lost after being gone so long :p<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">that's all that you are missing.  Only Omens and DoN.<br />
<br />
If you wait like a few weeks or so I'm sure that they'll offer Omens as part of a new package with the entire set in it.  But prob. still have to buy DoN seperate though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
   A question for you guys that have bought multi expansion packages like EQ platinum.... do you get a separate registration code for each expansion? The reason I ask is that I just hit 9 different computer stores and was only able to find one copy of GoD, it was however missing a registration code so I returned it. I don't have a credit card so I can't order it online. Would it be possible for me to buy EQ platinum and just register GoD for my main character that has every other expansion.<br />
<br />
<br />
  Thanks,<br />

EQ Platinum only has 1 registration code, not one for each expansion.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">any of the combo versions like platinum should be able to be used to bring any account up to those expansions so if platinum has GoD you can buy that and use it's registration code to get GoD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This works, but just bear in mind that once you use the code, either to activate a new account or upgrade an existing account to have all of the expansions that Platinum covers, the license key does not work again.  You can't use the key to upgrade 1 account with Gates, then start a second account with everything prior to the Gates expansion.</div></div><hr />
