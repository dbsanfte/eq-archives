<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I dinged 55 over the weekend, and some guildmates wanted me to join em in innovation. Ok, fine, I havent exactly been sociable.  But dear lord, the exp was bad. About 3 hours for a yellow?! I just hit 55, so have no idea if this is typical or not.  Any comments? I love my guild, but I do need to level at a reasonable rate lol!<br />
<br />
I have access to a 54 warrior with average gear (mostly thurg quest armor, windblade,) I have 950 ac, horse, jbb and ikky bp (no fungi or epic).  Both of us have e breath items.  Any spots we could hit together for better exp than this rate?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Me thinks you're spoiled.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hmm heh ok. I *did* just come off the nobles at hhk and the taskmaster room before that, where it took no more than about 6 hours to gain a level.  Perhaps xp just hits a wall at 55...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">1 yellow in three hours?<br />
<br />
I consider myself lucky for a blue in one... And that's about my rate in HK...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think most people agree that 1 blue per hour is the 'average' rate for exp in the mid-high 50s.  You can get better in some spots, or with a really good group, but Im not really worried unless it drops below 1 blue/hr. (However, in PoD it's more along 2 blues per hour).  <br />
<br />
I did the taskmaster and HHK as well and I dont remember EVER seeing 6 hours per level (ie almost 1 yellow per hour).  I'd go back and check your logs...I think you might be overestimating.  The nobles/bards in HHK will only spawn so fast.<br />
<br />
<br />
PS - regardless of how fast you were getting xp prior, YES, 55 is a much slower level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">With horse jbb and warrior, we netted roughly a blue every 15 mins or so. I dont see how you netted only a blue every hour. It was like 4 or 5 nobles for a blue solo for me, and I could kill them nearly instantly.<br />
It was that fast. <br />
<br />
OK, well since the leveling gravy train has apparently dried up, I may as well take it easy and just hang out with friends.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I did PoD once I hit 55 and I was getting 1 yel every hour and 15 or so. Once it took 1h45m.<br />
<br />
I am being serious.<br />
<br />
I would group at either the Cleric Spiders or what my server calls rcy which is the right side of the castle.<br />
<br />
After the hell of 54 I couldn't believe how fast the bar moved.<br />
<br />
I was in kick ass groups though.  Basically non-stop fighting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">At 53 i made a blue every 12/15 min in HHK, doing pretty much all the mobs :P<br />
<br />
Twice that time at 54 though ;\  Anyways, 3 hours for a yellow is freaking nuts.  Before POP, 55 exp took me forever, cause i was bored of HHk.  When you do 3 hours for a blue, then you can start to complain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nubok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">At 55 I had to clear all 5 spawns in HHK 3 times to get a blue. And thats not bad at the level!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>gummox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">At 55 I had to clear all 5 spawns in HHK 3 times to get a blue.<br />
<br />
Since the nobles respawn every 18 minutes, that's ~90 minutes per yellow, and ~7.5 hours to go from 55-56, which is slightly faster than I went from 54-55 there.<br />
<br />
Are all us noble/bard murderers getting spoiled by this exp rate? It sounds like I'll NEED to buy PoP just to continue the fast lvls that I'm getting used to. :eek:</div></div><hr />

<br />
One blue of exp is 4% so that means that you were getting 1% per kill.  I did a little soloing in HHK (it's almost ALWAYS camped on my server) and the exp was good, but it wasn't 1% per kill, more like 1% per two to three kills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>oomba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">well, went to PoD with a full group of guildies ranging from my 52 to tank of level 59, we were fighting near a castle....I was earning a blue bubble of exp every twenty minutes of playing.....<br />
<br />
Now all I need to do is convince guildies to bring me along more often, hehe....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Seefar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">well, went to PoD with a full group of guildies ranging from my 52 to tank of level 59, we were fighting near a castle....I was earning a blue bubble of exp every twenty minutes of playing.....  <br />
<br />
Yeah, at 52 exp in planes is REALLY incredible.  My first plane group (at 52) was in PON and I was getting 1% per kill in a group.  Amazing! I just wish the group could have lasted longer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shamanistic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Ok, this has been mentioned before the fastest way that I have ever seen to get through any of the 55-60 levels is to *gasp* partner with either a druid or enchanter.<br />
<br />
I know what your thinking... how can partnering help me?<br />
<br />
Well I spent  weeks trudging along with 55... until my friend (56) druid send me a tell saying I am getting the best XP of my life come help! So I did... just charm kite with a good druid or enchanter all you have to do is slow and cripple. I have made 20%(1yellow/gold/orange) in an hour. I have also made 2 yellow AA in an hour.<br />
<br />
*edit* I should mention where I did this... I did it in PoN and PoD in PoD we use a rat, and in PoN we use the blood ravens. In PoN the evil tree(facing outwards from zone in wall to the left), and in PoD the Courtyard where the defilers spawn.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>CrankyPK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Good lord.. i dont know how you people are leveling so slow.  With my 56 monk/53 sham duo.. i make at least a yellow an hour at ME zone doing monkeys, and i consider that last resort exp.  If you want the best exp you either have to be in PoP or a good dungeon IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Shizbiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I got a yellow an hour in hhk but I got out before the bards went light blue.<br />
Try chardok for nice exp at 55</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Don't forget PoI (outside the factory) has the lowest level mobs of all the tier 1 planes except for some parts of PoJ. I'm 54 and the exp in PoI is starting to turn bad, but I can tell you that all planes are not equivalent in exp. PoN is better and PoD exp will likely be at the same rate as the exp you're used to in the younger 50's in PoI. Just find a courtyard group and kill stuff. And the best thing about PoD is you can get parchments! yay! I still havn't won a roll on one yet, but I will some day...</div></div><hr />

Its worse... the &quot;bards&quot; are an 18 minute spawn.  The nobles and issabella are 6 minute spawns...  As is captain boshinko.  In addition, there is a noble/gnome spawn on the third floor as well two more level 40 (rare) spawns on the 4th floor.  But the chances of having the zone to yourself is very low (at least on Xegony).<br />
<br />
At 51, with Kei and a horse... I could solo clear all 5 spawns on the 2nd floor as well as the captain and the 3rd floor semi noble spawn.<br />
<br />
On top of this crazyness, The ZEM in hhkeep is insane enough that a hhkeep dark blue is often worth more exp than a yellow/low red in some other zones (I've only verified this while power leveling, not at the 50+ level).<br />
