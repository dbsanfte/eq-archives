Haven't logged onto it for 4 or 5 weeks now and dont miss it at all.  There are only a handful of games that I have paid for that suck so bad I was actually pissed I wasted the money on.... SHEW! Good thing I didn't pay for EQ2 or it would have been at the top of my list.</div></div><hr />

You do know that the entire point of a beta test is to work with the developers on making the game NOT suck, right?  Great job as a tester.</div></div><hr />

Define suck. The point of a beta test is to test &quot;stuff&quot;, and that means a lot of different issues, for example, syntax on the low end to crash bugs on the higher end of the scale.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The game isnt going to suck because of bugs.<br />
<br />
It is going to suck because of the ideology of the developers. <br />
<br />
Well I don't actually know if it is going to suck or not. My intrest in it as a game is about 1%. <br />
<br />
I do not trust the company behind it. And I will not purchase the game unless people that I do trust reccomend the game to me. <br />
<br />
And even then I would weigh the benifits of starting fresh with SoE. <br />
<br />
That my friends is the cost of thier running of EQ1 And the direct result of the shoddy treatment of the playerbase, by the developers and handlers of the game. <br />
<br />
That being said I hope all that play it get what they are hoping for. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Unfortunately, I'll be able to provide updates about this... *cough*  game.<br />
<br />
They came up with a CLEVER little scam, for anybody stupid enough (us) to preorder the game, back when we didn't know if it would be good or not.<br />
<br />
Remember that character generator CD they sent out a while back?  Yeah, well when you attempt to cancel your preorder, they tell you that Sony has already &quot;partially delivered&quot; the product...<br />
<br />
So we're gettin it whether we want it or not.  I hope it's better than everybody says.  *grin*</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It is going to suck because of the ideology of the developers.<br />
<br />
I pretty much agree.<br />
<br />
The people who designed The Estate of Unrest are long gone.<br />
The current EQ designers seems mildly proficient in 3D Studio Max (although model optimization totally escapes them) and utterly clueless about fun.<br />
<br />
Welcome to New Expansion!<br />
A CoolMonsterModel hits you for 80 points of damage.<br />
Entering FreakyNamedZone<br />
A TheSameMonsterModel hits you for 3750 points of damage.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Co-worker had been doing Beta for JTL the new SWG expansion, he was ready to quit swg before he got in beta and oddly enough, He Liked it, He Liked it alot, yea there were a couple small bugs, but that happens.<br />
<br />
They did a large patch recently to live servers and all the small bugs and  Larger bugs got in on the live servers before the game was even released.  Not sure but I think that might be a record for Sony.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Dont get me wrong the Expansion overall of Omens of war is a decent one. <br />
<br />
But How many times are they going to reuse the same model over and over. Not just the Mob models which is expected. <br />
<br />
But the castle Entrance look is repeated how many times. Witht he off center second one as well. And the hewn stone look of the castle corradors as well. <br />
<br />
Not to mention the Ignorant layout of the Dranik's hollow missions. If they lived there for so long where was thier food/ water supplies. Or living areas. Know wonder the dragorn gave up. No bathrooms. Cookie cutter design that is unfinished and implimented solely for the purpose of padding zone counts on marketing boxes. A design to simply appease the crowd of Instance zone players (Please note I am one of them) But with all the care of a 10 year old who is GMing his first DnD dungoen. &quot;You walk into a room, there are.........(sound of rolling dice).... um..... 2 Dragorns A flapping bat and 3 giant rats. &quot;<br />
<br />
Oh pardon my wonder and awe at the skills of the developers. <br />
<br />
It is a pathetic unfinished section of untested zones that dissapoints me because we do deserve better. Yes some of the zones are cool. But they have too much fluff and padding compared to the really well designed areas or Original EQ and Kunark. (Which had some padding of thier own. West karanas anyone?  But even there there were nuggets of cool in the rough. The two clops hanging in the Mountains. The couple bandit camps with the runners in between them)<br />
<br />
<br />
My opinions of course. Some will agree some won't But if you want to flame me or something at least be bear enough to leave your name. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well, as announced today, in press release and the EQII home page, release date is Nov 8, two weeks from today.  Man, will this thing blow.  From all accounts, they need 3-4 more months of beta.  I guess they have not learned their lesson yet.  Stink bomb incoming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Thantu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">A friend and I are in it (the EQII beta), and honestly, it isn't the ground breaking game I had hoped for.  I guess I wanted it to have the sense of wonder and discovery that EQI had when it first released.  I haven't gotten too far into the world just yet, but it just seems like the same old stuff with chuggier turns (granted performance wise, it's a beta).  Not to mention the opening sequence was decent enough the first time, but, oh Lord, every freaking character?  Add a useless newbie island to that and you've got a capital, &quot;Meh.&quot;  My wife and are leaning pretty heavily to WoW, after beta testing that (holy crap talk about polished, I've never been in such a stable beta, you'd swear it was a release candidate), but I was kind of ticked when they (Blizzard) removed skill points and went to cash based trade skills / training.  It (EQII again) isn't a bad game at all, but right now it is just one more MMORPG in a sea of MMORPG's, one of which includes the original.  As always, I remain a beta testing fiend. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">OK, firstly, to handle the issue on OMG, how buggy is this game:<br />
<br />
What, weren't you epople around when EQ came out?  Don't you remember?  Unexpected zone crashes?  Boat rides that would ALWAYS crash the zone and leave you drowned in the water, waiting for a GM to zummon you because you had no idea where your corpse was when the zone crashed?  I heard this in SWG when it came out, &quot;OMG!  you take the servers down 2 hours every week?  U SUCK!&quot;  When users push for the games and the calendar says it's time to release (hello Christmas) these things are going to happen.<br />
<br />
Secondly, The game isn't really all that new:<br />
<br />
What did you expect?  There are only so many ways to do a fantasy MMORPG, and how are you gonna get somethig radically different from: Meridian, UO, EQ, SB, DAoC, Legacy, FFXI, etc....   They each have unique features, but quite a bit of their gameplay overlaps.  If you want something very different and pretty, you might try CoH.  However, don't look for content there, as they're a little lacking on deep content.  All you get is the same recycled content over and over, with different settings/mobs.<br />
<br />
Take the game for what it is.  It's going to be EQ light.  It'll be more accessible for people who don't want to spend 50+ hours a week in the game.  It probably won't have the deep content and strategy aspect the EQ acquired (it certainly didn't have that either, in the begining).  It will NOT be a replacement for EQ, but it might be something you pick up when you have an hour, insead of three, to go online.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Belinda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">SOE has LEARNED nothing.<br />
This game is FAR FAR away from going Gold.<br />
But again they Fear WoW and they PUSH it out.<br />
If it comes out on 8th of November, you just pay for beta phase 3 or whatever they will call it thats all.<br />
Shame on you SOE , but well..............</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">This game is like a 3 month old fetus that is being forced out...<br />
<br />
It's gonna attract some ppl then they will leave when wow is out.<br />
Mark my words this will be a great failure. Beisdes nobody has the machine to run this game. Even people who currently own the best video card on the market and 2 gigs of ram will CHOKE trying to run this game.<br />
<br />
<br />

yeah yeah well i am an Aries and we always say that :)<br />

Amazing eh, but still, can't beat these kinda games for entertainment value.  What else can you spend that many hours playing for only $13(EQ) + $40(ISP) a month?  Well, and upgrades . . . and expansions.  But it's still pretty darn cheap entertainment.  This past weekend I spent about $250 on several dinners, drinks, a movie, and gas just hanging out with the girlfriend, partying with some new friends on Main street at a club, and going to a movie (the Grudge (scary as hell!)).  So at that rate I'll be spending about $1000 a month on entertainment . . . if I don't go out during the week that is.  $53 bucks a month is sounding pretty darn cheap.  But then again, I'm happier now so go figure.  Maybe money can buy happiness?</div></div><hr />

Blatant lie. I run this game on a 1.2 AMD Tbird, 768mb PC2100 RAM and an ATI 9800 pro 128mb. Sure, youll choke any top end system if you try to run with Max settings on....hell there are a LOT more games than EQ2 out there that have this problem. I run it on about average settings and the only place I have serious lag (that isnt serverside) is in the Cities.</div></div><hr />

But this is exactly what i mean. The highest end system right now cannot run things on max. We are talking a $4000 computer. Oh and don't forget this is a MASS multiplayer online RPG. So when you got a raid and got some 50+ people on the screen with those models with all that detail your video card will explode.<br />

Did you forget the part where they specifically said that it was built that way for a reason?<br />

Oh, and raids dont have 50 people. They are limited to about half of that. Are you sure you arent mixing this up with some other game? lol</div></div><hr />

I have an AMD 2500 XP, 1 GB of pc2700 and a GeForce FX5200 128 MB video card.  The game ran fine at medium settings, even in cities with quite a few people on the screen at a time it ran fine.  I'm sure with a GeForce 6800 and a better processor it would be much nicer, but I have no complaints really.  And dont worry about the 50+ people on the screen at a time, as raids are capped at 24 I think it is.<br />
<br />
Graphics aside, I wish that they would take the time to fully test to game before releasing it.  Theres quite a few key features that were just recently added to beta, and theres no way that they will find the time to test them completely before the game is live.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Money can't buy happiness, but its a lot easier to pull up to the curb next to it in a Mercedes&quot;.  Can't remember where I heard that, but there is an element of truth to it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Money buys Quality entertainment. <br />
<br />
When you are entertained you are happy. <br />
<br />
The question is. <br />
<br />
Are you happy when you are not being entertained. That is where money doesnt help. <br />
<br />
Hence the old adage Money can't buy happiness. <br />
