<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jhaelx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What sucks on fighting ldon and pop mobs is that after a malos(3.5-5 sec casting time) a slow, you have little effective casting time to cast a dot before the mob is dead. This is why a lot of people nuke when dotting should be definetly an viable source of damage for us. Not to appear as a whine, but it would be good if there was another Malx line which was unresistable but a 2 sec casting time and only -30 all resists but disease. Or Bane with a resistadj. I don't know what do other people think? I am aware this could be an overly complaint and there are other ways of dealing with it, however this is the age old problem which I have noticed. And why beastlord could be certainly preferential in some groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Don't cast Malos except on named MOBs. Use that mana for an extra nuke.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Look around for a spell haste 4 item/augment.  It can also trim off those seconds you need.<br />
<br />
<br />
  If you don't feel you have time to add in DPS, fill another role.   Me.. I pull for LDoN.  I love it.  Everyone that groups with me expects it, and I do it well.<br />
<br />
  Sometimes I bring in 3 or 4, THEN I toss in some added DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Aye, I agree with House.  Most mobs aren't terribly resistant and Turgur's will stick on one cast.  If I do get a resist I usually dont try and slow again because by that time the mob is usually at 60% or so, and would be dead or running before I landed the next one anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I usually group with a BL and a necro, and sometimes a chanter.  My motto is: 'slow early and often'.  Since in LDoN, we often have 2 and 3 pulls, our approach is that everyone that can slow does.  Sometimes my slow ends up over-writing the others, but as long as the others call their slow, I will usually let it ride and land a dot instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hyperd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Caanus, could you start another thread called Pulling - for shamans. Would be nice to know how you do it.</div></div><hr />

Go to the mobs. Target one and cast a spell. Run back to the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Add to Shiner's:<br />
<br />
In case of multiple mobs:  3 min root one.  VP another.  Run back to camp with rest, and start slowing.  Reroot the VPed mob the first chance you get, then slow both.  Whee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">LOL, you forgot a few pulling tricks.  1) Have fresh Q on you when you are pulling. 2) Use puppy as a shield, he is your friend!! 3) Pull with slow or if you are pretty sure you have 3 or more root pull (as Gwain said) from max distance and you should be able to slow one or two more on inc. 4) Slow early slow often 5) Don't even mem malos (thank goodness).<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nakukak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Aye, using our dog is a great trick for pulling in LDoN. When you get a tricky pull, send the dog. The mob you pulled w/ slow will come through and attack you, but the others will jump on the pet, allowing you an extra second or two to slow another. If he enrages, all the better; he'll tank for more than enough time to slow them all. And when he dies? 650 mana and your meat shield is back to ready status  ;) <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>jhaelx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yeah I pull in a few groups, when there are multiples I will root one on incoming. Run back to group, Cast Virulent paralysis on another if there is still 2 incoming. And then slow the 3rd. I don't use pet thats just my preference. I only use my pet for soloing, in an exp group even though its &quot;free damage&quot; or that extra shield its baggage. <br />
<br />
Btw a for your info, the common perception of Virulent Paralysis is that by upgrading the lvls all you are doing is increasing the duration on the root. But!! A added and useful fact is that the better Virulent Paralysis you have the bigger knockback on it. I have Virulent Paralysis 2 atm, the knockback is pleasantly much bigger and pushes it a more satisfactory distance out of range. Don't believe me? Look on Lucy. The push back on Level 1 is 8, level 2 is 12, and level 3 is 16. My concern with getting lvl 3 is that it may push TOO far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">VP3 is beautiful.  It pushes mobs just the right distance.  You won't push a mob out of a room or anything silly like that.  If you imagine a mob standing due north of you and you are within melee range of it, and it was knocked south of you with VP3, I think it would be pushed JUST outside of melee range if you did a uturn to face south where the mob would now be.  If you've gone for VP2 already, go for VP# asap!<br />
<br />
Would be nice to know how you do it.<br />
No offense to you here, but you don't sound like you've ever really hunted in a dungeon before.<br />
Lots of us learned how to pull and handle CC work ages ago before Kunark was even out, and further honed skills in the dungeons of Kunark.<br />
<br />
Here's some tips:<br />
-Mem tirgir's insects and use it on pulls of 3+ mobs<br />
-Turgur has huge aggro.  Make use of this knowledge.  If you slow a mob, it'll do a b-line to get to you.  Back off out of melee range of the group, and root the mob there.  Repeat for each mob that's unslowed.<br />
-Pay attention to the names and graphical appearance of the mobs you are slowing.  If you see 2 mobs of the same appearance and 1 of another, slow the 2 mobs first.  That way when you change targets you won't have to think hard about which of the 2 twins you've just slowed<br />
-Pay attention to the health level of mobs and how fast they are swinging (ie how fast their flashing name bobs up and down when they attack) when you are figuring out which mobs have been slowed and which haven't.  There's no need to slow mobs that are already slowed.  It should take you about 5 seconds to figure out if a mob is slowed or not.  Compare it's attack rate to other mobs standing around to see who's name tags are bobbing faster.<br />
-Turgur has a huge refresh time.  Keep this in mind for the spells you are casting.  If you bounce a turgur, only cast malos/malosinia afterwards while waiting for turgur to refresh.  Cast other spells while you are waiting for the refresh time to expire.  It might make your next slow land about 2-4 seconds later than it would have, but you end up casting a lot more spells this way, which IMO helps more than just standing around waiting doing nothing.<br />
-get Virulent Paralysis.  It's very useful for CC work.  You can push mobs out of melee range and root them at the same time.<br />
-leave lots of room between the place you are pulling from and the camp.  Use this space to root a mob as the pull, and you still have time to slow one of the mobs incoming to camp.<br />
-scout out your pulls as best you can given the time you have.  Some times you have more time to do this (like with Vision spell or stalking probes).  Some times you can use f9 to move the camera around a bit to peek around a corner to see what kind of adds you'll get.  Some times you can quickly step out from a corner and move back really quickly (like 0.5 seconds quickly) and mobs won't aggro you if you hide behind cover fast enough.<br />
-know how much aggro you have on mobs and how they'll react as you cast spells on them or on their buds.  Heals pull aggro on everything if you heal enough.  Low health pulls aggro.  Turgur pulls aggro.  Aggroing mobs next to other mobs pulls aggro.  But each of these pulls aggro different.  Keep in mind how much a mob is going to hate you BEFORE you even cast a spell.  If you do this, you'll already know what your next action/spell is going to be because you know what the mob is going to do before it does it.  Like, I know if I cast slow on the add without it being taunted, it'll run straight to me.  Knowing this, I'm going to be pulling it off to the side and rootparking it off to the side.  Knowing that mob is parked off to whatever side I just planted it, I don't want to park any other adds nearby so that when the main mob is dead, my group members won't be in melee range of the parked mobs when they go for next target, so I'll park the next add on the opposite side of the room.  I've got this all planned out before Turgur is even done casting on the first mob.  Think ahead...<br />
<br />
How to use this in practice?  Here's an example:  Suppose you have a 4 pull you know you are going to pull.  Target one mob, then target another.  Tell the group 4 mobs inc.  Root one mob as your pull.  Hit your alternate target key to target the other one as you are running back to camp.  Slow the 2nd mob before it hits camp.  If you run through your party, the slowed mob will continue running through them, but since you only have social aggro on the other 2, they will stop and hit the party and leave you along to deal with the lone slowed mob.  Root the slowed mob out of melee range of anyone.  Try to target the mob that's not the main target and VP his butt out of combat with knockback.  Now it's rooted and out of melee range.  Slow the main mob in camp.  Slow the mob you VPed.  Now run back and slow the mob that was rooted on the pull, assuming root hasn't dropped already.  Dot with your single best dot the mob that's rooted since you have plenty of time for your dot to go full duration.  Run back to the combat (assuming root didn't break yet).  Target another mob that's not being meleed yet and dot him too.  Now's your chance to start wincing back mana.  As root spells start breaking, if you dotted and slowed the mob, it'll go straight for you, so you can root it where you want.  If not, it's hard to tell if it'll go for you, or a healer, or a melee if one happened to try taunting it a bit.  Also keep in mind that you ARE a healing class, so instead of dotting, you might need to help throw some Qs and heals around.  Also keep in mind that melees can CC adds helping ease your CC worries, especially if you have something like 5+ mobs in camp.  Stick a melee on each mob, root what you can out of melee range, and throw Qs around until you get the number of mobs in camp down to an easily managable level.<br />
<br />
Another tactic you can use to pull massive pulls is to pull with mass pets.  The mobs will mostly or all aggro onto the doggies.  You have pretty much a full minute of them CCing the mobs for you.  Target individual mobs and slow them and thus peeling them off due to slow aggro and let the tanks CC them or you can root them in place somewhere.  Pulling a 5 pull shouldn't be that rough doing this.<br />
<br />
This is basicly the same tactics I used back in Lower Guk at level 40-50, and used in Karnor's castle at levels 52-56, and used in Seb at level 57-60, and used in every other dungeon/outdoor zone since then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Another good reason to keep Tirgir's loaded: Turgur's so freaking slow to recast, if you get a bounce on a Turgur on a one or two pull, just Tirgir instead.  So you get yourself in the AE?  Big deal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Tigirs is awesome in LDoN.<br />
<br />
When you can pwn a 5 mob pull without any CC, that's pretty good I think.  <br />
<br />
Cast Tigirs, then run to the side of the room.  Clear target box with the esc key.  When mob hits you and targets itself, root it, and move back.  Clear target again with esc key, have next mob hit you, root it and move back.  Repeat until you have a line of rooted and slowed mobs stretched out behind you.  <br />
<br />
Cann and heal and root the first mob again.</div></div><hr />
