<br />
      Hopefully i spelled mobs name right but in case i didnt. After going over river just past hedge is an entance with two lvl 65 sk  type undead. THE question is how do these stack up with mobs in say COD , Pov Pos and tier two spots that unguilded person can possible hunt in? Been putting exp on my shaman and palidan because i did the side key quest for cod and finished it and am going to finally work on getting flagged and wanted to see how these stack ( the guardians) up to other mobs in higher places. MY intial pull i got both and was able to root part the other long enough to eventually kill them both. Had totally forgotten about the 1100ish point ht they do lol and almost lost when one fear me mid heal. I killed them a few more rounds beforei had to go and was a little rough when 2k heal doesnt heal me much more than a good round of dps from them. Anywhoo any comparisions would be much apperciated. Gonna research about the gargs in pon next. I flunked garg pulling badlly after killing these a bit lol . <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm not really sure about the guardians since I've never tried them but the castle/crypt with the gargs in PoN is one of the best exp places in tier 1.  I've really only been once with a full group including a cleric.  I got an AA in about 3 hours 15 minutes.  Normally in Valor I get an AA in roughly  2.5 hours. <br />
<br />
The biggest problem with crypt/decay in PoN is the pulling.  When you pull those gargs on the outside you almost always get 1-2 banshees from the other side of the wall.  Worst part is you don't see the adds until they warp on your head.  My advice is to bring a good heads up group that doesn't have a problem dealing with the warp adds.  I'd grouped with everyone for so long we work well together and we didn't have a mezzer but it certainly wouldn't hurt to bring a one.  The other slightly annoying thing is that exp drops off quite a bit at 65 because the banshees turn light blue and make up at least half of the pulls but at 63 I was getting an AA every 3 hours 15 minutes.<br />
<br />
It sounded to me like you are looking for good experience places to 2 box your shaman and paladin in tier one though.  So I would suggest hobgoblins for PoN or maybe courtyard in PoD.  You could certainly do courtyard in PoD I just don't know how the experience is 63+.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Halycona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hobgoblins in PoN are great exp, maybe even a nightmare horse from the plateau, I could duo them with a 65sk quite easily. <br />
Gargs are nice exp but an fd puller is highly recommended, although it is possible to solo pull, I don't know how though, just heard of guildys soloing there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hi barliman, <br />
<br />
       Thanks for the info. Its a mix looking for more to do in tier one and wondering how gonna stack up once i get flagged. Ive put it off quite a while for aa and grouping with friends who were still under 60. But they all at 60 now and been really thinking about getting flagged and i did complete the COD side key thing. <br />
<br />
     Problem with tier one is get tired of the usual spots or they before light blue or other reason. I used to die vetri flies at 60 , 61 but at 62 got mostly light blue. <br />
     Killing wretched puslings but they vary 55-57 and i cant pacify the ones over 55 and makes for some interesting splits depending how the spawn.<br />
I can split a 3 pull if need be and I DO IT RIGHT heh. <br />
   I pull with pally to keep shaman pet sitting and hope first root stick than root 2nd one  and than get pet on main pusling asap cuz if he attacks others i get on hate list and get summoned and there goes root parking. Than it still possible but alot harder even with alpha pet. <br />
   The other end though is now when i get it split with aa's and my shaman half way through 63 one house of them doesnt do it anymore i sit alot but trying to split up and keep on top of two house o pusling is a pain. So thats where the itch to find more spots came in. I was going to gargs when i got the urge to pull the foreboding guardians and wondered about how they stack with tier two to see where i might stack up to tier 2 zones. Ive been by the courtyards in pod but i dont know where a two boxer would set up and no conflict with full groups and i dont have patience for camp drama's. I do want to hit COD but pally is 61 and was thinking of going for 63 for him before i went there. Anyhoo ive gone on enough thanks for responding.</div></div><hr />
