<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kashale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am finally fighting mobs that mitigate my slows.  I have a question:<br />
<br />
If I cast slow on a mob and I get the message that my slow was partially successful (or mostly successful) is that the best I can do?  In other words, if I cast slow on the same mob again, will it always yield the same result or could I possibly slow it to a higher degree the second time?<br />
<br />
Thanks  :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">In talking to some other shaman on my server, we have talked about the SLIGHT, PARTIAL and MOSTLY successful slow messages, and what they actually mean. One of the shaman said that he believed that they really mean 25%, 50% and 75% effectiveness. Is there anyone out there that can verify or dispute this?<br />
<br />
This discussion started after we got a SLIGHT slow on Rydda`Dar using Cloud of Grummus. If he is right, then we managed to get a 10% slow on him, which looks about right based on the damage the tank was taking. But I would like to know if anyone has parsed the numbers on this.</div></div><hr />

Well if Turgur's is max of 75% (no mitigation) and there are 3 other levels of effectiveness (Slightly, Partially and Mostly) then I would say it would be something to the effect of:<br />
<br />
Slightly - 20%<br />
Partially - 40%<br />
Mostly - 60%<br />
<br />
Although in my limited experience I have not seen a &quot;Slightly effective&quot; message yet, only Partially and Mostly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Slightly ususlly happen on name/mini name</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I am pretty sure that each different class of mitigation (slighty, partialy, mostly) isn't a specific value, just a range of values.<br />
<br />
1-35% mitigation would be mostly<br />
36-65% mitigation would be partially.<br />
66-99% mitigation would be slightly.<br />
<br />
(I made those numbers up).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I got a partial mitagation message against Nadox last night.  Supposedly, he can only be slowed by 30%.  So, there might not be a direct correlation to the spell and the mob.  Meaning, mob ABC can only be slowed by 10% no matter what slow lands; therefore, he falls into the &quot;slightly&quot; category.  Mob XYZ can be slowed by 50%; so, &quot;partial&quot; message.  Just a thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">No, SOE clearly said that even with the mitigation, the better slow would slow more. A shaman landing a mitigated slow on a mob would slow it more than a bard, enchanter or BL slowing the same mob.<br />
<br />
I also do not believe that there is any randomness to the amount slowed when mitigated. I believe that there is a flag that is set on some mobs which causes them to mitigate at one of the 3 levels, and the percentage of slow for that particular mitigation is constant.<br />
<br />
I was hoping someone had parses to show if what we think is happening, is really whats happening or not.... Apparently, nobody does.</div></div><hr />

Problem is with anything past mostly effective it gets hard to find targets to log on. Especially with the slightly. These tend to be boss type fights where it's harder to get a good log of the effect. Some people claimed to see low % slows overwriting better slows with the higher mitigation levels but I haven't seen any indication of that even when I tried to test it intentionally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">This is posted on Allak's referring to Spiritseeker Nadox (level 60) and is why I posted what I did earlier:<br />
<br />
Hits for a maximum of 414, and mitigates slow to ~30% (Beastlord's 30% slow wasn't mitigated, but Ranger's 50% was). <br />
<br />
Just something to think about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Bigmeeno , what you say is true. I did some extensive tests to check this very thing. The result is that a higher percentage slow will &quot;slow&quot; more even on mitigated mobs, BUT that it becomes very close between shaman slow and chanter/BL. <br />
<br />
For example, a Shaman slowing over a chanter will only result in saving 1 extra attack round in a 60second period.</div></div><hr />
