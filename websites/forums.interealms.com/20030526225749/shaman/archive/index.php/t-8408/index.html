<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Koyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings all,<br />
<br />
I'm a bit confused about our Grow spell. I've used it and hrm.. got the message that I feel larger, but don't actually &quot;grow&quot; at all. What's the use for this spell and where does it work, if at all?<br />
<br />
Bit confused as I've tried it almost everywhere, when I saw my wife the other night (a Gnome) get Grow cast on her and she did indeed get taller. She was in a Kunark zone, is the spell limited to certain zones?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Aye. You can only get ogre big, and gnome small. Cast shrink on a gnome - they won't get smaller.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Koyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ok, makes sense.. but when I cast Grow on my wife, she doesn't grow at all. She's a Gnome and has room to grow I'm thinkin.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It's buggy. Got to cast it again or thrice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Islowem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">and you need to be grouped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Koyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yea, we were grouped.. tried everything except multiple castings. I'll try that tonight. Thanks!</div></div><hr />

Will be larger than if you just went into bear form.</div></div><hr />
