<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gibbous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just getting into EverQuest again after a long time away. Have never played a shaman past 14 but this time I plan to dedicate a lot of time and energy to the class. I have played enchanter, bard, and shadowknight most extensively but still starting over is starting over.<br />
<br />
I was wondering if any had any basic advice on VERY cheep items that are still good that could help me out as a newbie shaman. Also any who are on Mith Marr who wouldn't mind talking a bit please send an email or reply to the post. Would love a nice 1 on 1 with an experienced shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">VERY cheap? Banded armour and a fine steel spear. Around 5pp each.<br />
<br />
Still pretty cheap - splitpaw gloves and a few other splitpaw items. Spore covered xxx (e.g. sleeves, boots etc). All around 20pp or so each. <br />
<br />
Got a little bit more? Consider a velium fire wedding ring or two (450pp each),  spine chill spear (300pp?)<br />
<br />
Finally - spells cost a lot at lower levels. No need to buy them all, concentrate on heals, dots, nukes, haste, ac. Buffs don't do a hell of a lot at the low levels, so don't fret it if you don't have every one.</div></div><hr />
