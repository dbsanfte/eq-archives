<br />
I have recently taken to buying mage weapons for my little mongrel.<br />
<br />
Whilst I see other peoples weapons proc (xyz hits abc for x points of non-melee damage) accompanied with a nice flash of lightning or whatever, i never seem to see either message or effect from the mutt's weapons. <br />
<br />
Am I doing something wrong? Is there some setting i need to change? Or is my mongrel just that poor?<br />
<br />
(usually focus + diaku + hasted, but even with mortal deftness + ios i never seem to see anything)<br />
<br />
tips appreciated<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gaesekki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There are two things (I think) that you can look for:<br />
<br />
1.  The first would be is that the graphic on the mutt goes into a howl motion so to speak.  Would not be able to tell you if there is any sound associated with this since I do not ever play with sound on.<br />
<br />
2.  Look for the &quot;soandso is seared by flames&quot; (hand of ixiblat) or other such emotes for procs.<br />
<br />
Not sure if there is a way to get a numerical display on this.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps a bit</div></div><hr />

The first few dogs will only proc with the fists of ixiblat (i think is the name)  Not until you get the high level pups will they proc the mage swords.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry, I should have said, this is my &quot;true spirit&quot; mutt.<br />
<br />
I do see the howl motion from time to time. Is that the proc motion then? I guess I assumed the lazy mongrel was taking a break...<br />
<br />
Not sure if i see seared by flames message. I guess I better start looking more. I was kindof expecting to see &quot;mongrel hits mob1 for 50 points of non melee damage&quot;. Does this never happen with pets?<br />
<br />
thnx for the help so far ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I believe you can only see other PC's 'non melee damage', not NPC's. You never see a message telling you your guildmate was blasted with an Ice Comet, for example, other than the emote.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rubitt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">aye look for the &quot;howl&quot; motion. that is dogdog emote for casting a spell ie proc.</div></div><hr />
