<br />
spirit call give you 3 to 5 pets depending on level that are the same as your level 61 pet.<br />
<br />
advanced spirit call give you 2 and 3 pets that should do more damage than sc3. they have a nice proc (650ish?) and hit for more (100ish?) and should be better, but they give less push and some like that, some dont and wnat sc3 and sc5 to be different.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you like the pets for DPS, get the advanced AA. If you like them for CC, stick to the basic SC.<br />
<br />
SC5 = fewer pets, lower total hp, less push (this is both a blessing and a curse), fewer interupts, more DPS</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I only use them for interrupts on caster mobs, and for positioning on named mobs, so I'm sticking with SC3 - for now, anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Why do I keep reading that SC pets have more HPs than ASC pets?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Why do I keep reading that SC pets have more HPs than ASC pets?<br />
Because they used to. When ASC first came out the pets were released with too few HPs. It has been reported as fixed some time ago. <br />
<br />
Check the dates of the posts complaining about ASC HPs.<br />
<br />
EDIT: I have compiled all Shaman pet stats here, FYI: http://morelight.org/samanna/info_shaman.html<br />
<br />
The damage output and the HP of the pet was mistakenly set too low and should be fixed shortly.  Very sorry for the inconvenience.<br />

Not forgotten, just haven't been able to patch out pet data yet.  Probably won't be until the next scheduled patch if I had to guess.<br />
<br />
-Ryan<br />
Unfortunately we couldn't patch out new pet data because of the changes for Mage/Necro/Beastlord pets that are in transition at the moment.  The next patch is scheduled for about 2 weeks from now I believe and it *should* be all set by then.  <br />
Also, if you have a shaman on test with this ability it should be functioning correctly now, so the fix is complete, just not patched live.<br />
<br />

Around 5 Apr, reports started coming in that the ASC HPs had been fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Retron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Spirit Call 3 (9 AAs, 4/3/2):<br />
5 wolves, L58, double for 60, enrage and push a fair bit (clones of the L61 pet). <br />
<br />
Advanced Spirit Call 2 (10 AAs, 5/5):<br />
3 wolves, L60, double for 135, proc a 640 lure DD, enrage and don't push as much. The wolves aren't translucent either.<br />
<br />
ASC2 gives a noticable DPS boost over SC3, and the fact the wolves are L60 rather than L58 should improve their hit rate as well. <br />
<br />
Is ASC2 worth spending twice as many AAs on as SC3? For me, yes, as I tend to send in the wolves as often as I can, although due to it being painful to get aggro in hard LDoNs, Tipt etc it's of less use there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Exactly my point. There have been like 56 threads about ASC on the Crucible and we have been stating that they fixed the pet's HPs at least a dozen times, yet every time somebody say that they have less HPs. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>haruuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">very educational thread, especially for those of us late coming to the site. <br />
<br />
awesome, thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tudani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Just curious, as I don't recall hearing anything about it.  Is ASC 1 more dps than spirit call 3?  Or do you only get the dps increase if you spend all 10 points for ASC 2?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Spirit Call 3 (9 AAs, 4/3/2):<br />
5 wolves, L58, double for 60, enrage and push a fair bit (clones of the L61 pet).<br />
<br />
Advanced Spirit Call 2 (10 AAs, 5/5):<br />
3 wolves, L60, double for 135, proc a 640 lure DD, enrage and don't push as much. The wolves aren't translucent either. <br />
<br />
Spirit Call 3:  5X60 = 300<br />
<br />
Advance Spirit Call 1:  2X135 = 270 + random 640DD proc per pet<br />
<br />
I didn't have ASC1 for very long, but just looking at the potentials it seems like it would depend on how many times they proc'ed.  From observation it seems like, on average, each one will proc once per fight.</div></div><hr />

he never said ASC2 pets had less hp. just less combined. which is true afaik</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well, on average doing msha's in Qvic (about 25 total parses that i've seen presented) ASC2 do about 5500 - 7k dmg per cast, minus procs.  So, they do around 6200 average not including the procs.  That's still pretty substantial dmg for the minute that they are up to me.</div></div><hr />
