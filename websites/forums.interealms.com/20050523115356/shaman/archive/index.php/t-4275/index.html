KEYRINGS NOW IN GAME<br />
<br />
Earlier we reported that Old Sebilis no longer required a key. This was a little inaccurate. What's actually happened is much cooler!<br />
Old Sebilis and Howling Stones are now Keyring enabled zones. If you complete the key quest for the respective zone and use the key once to enter it you will get a new message. The message informs you that this key is now on your keyring.<br />
<br />
Once you receive this message you no longer need to keep the key, you can destroy it or toss it in the bank. The Keyrings have been in demand from players for a while now and were unveiled during the recent Boston Fan Faire. <br />

Two fewer soulbound items to trip over when looting my corpse :p</div></div><hr />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">why wasnt this in the patch message? seems kinda stupid to have people guessing like this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm not going to repeat the things that Alan's already stated so well. 99.9% of the people who play EverQuest do so in a fair manner, and agree that there is no room for cheating as part of EverQuest.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, this message is addressed to the other 0.01%. <br />
<br />
If you've &quot;accidentally&quot; ended up with items equipped that your race or class cannot normally equip, and/or have any items that haven't been earned in the lines of acceptable gameplay under the EULA, we strongly recommend that you log in your character before tonight's patch and unequip any mismatched items and delete any duplicates.<br />
<br />
<br />
As of tomorrow's patch, please do not be surprised when items gained in an illicit manner and/or wrongly equipped are creatively, forcibly un-equipped.<br />
<br />
We already have logs of who's done what, and we'd like to extend an opportunity to those who may have tried something out &quot;just for fun&quot; to take their actions back.<br />
<br />
<br />
As a team, we've been congratulated quite a bit lately for many of the positive changes that we've been making to the game, and we're glad to continue to improve upon what we still believe is the most enjoyable online game out there. <br />
<br />
However, please do not mistake our intent. The rule does stand: If you cheat to get around the system, you must be willing to accept the consequences. <br />
<br />
Cheat in EverQuest; Bad Things Happen.<br />
<br />
<br />
Once again, to the vast majority of people who play EverQuest in the true spirit of the game, we're sorry that we've had to take up your time with this. <br />
<br />
We thank everyone who has submitted /bug reports and feedback here in the Dev Corner on this issue. No punitive action has been or will be taken against those who discover and report bugs, and stop taking advantage of them. <br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />

<br />
ABSOR ON KEYRINGS<br />
<br />
We spoke with Alan VanCouvering this morning to get some confirmation on the keyring code which appeared recently on the Live Servers: <br />
The keyring code should go in fully with the patch tonight. <br />
<br />
What will happen is that any appropriate keys will be added to your keyring. Any doors or locks that require those keys will work just by clicking on them. To find out what keys are on your keyring just type /key and the game will give you a list. <br />
<br />
