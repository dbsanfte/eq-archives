<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yeah... seems shaman only get two honorable mentions for soloing bit mobs,and one &quot;takes too long to be effecient&quot;.  Other than that, no one seems to even think about shaman when debating what classes solo big targets the best.  Guess after the 10th class took down ole yeldema everyone realized we are no longer the single target solo kings we once were believed to be.</div></div><hr />

meh, i still can solo lightblues in GoD pretty good. the darkblues break root too much :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Makelike</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I found Turtle's post about soloing and specifically regarding shaman humorous. Especially since I seem to remember him being one of the loudest opponents to the &quot;proposal&quot; that Glori posted on the Newb boards</div></div><hr />
