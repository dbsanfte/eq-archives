<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grimtug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I had a question regarding the Temple of Droga portion.  I know that you are suppose to kill Digalis in the jail area.  My question is do you just drop through the pit trap and find him there or do I have to find the key to open the doors?  I invised and ran down to check it out and found I could not open the locked door when trying to come through the front.  Just curious as to how others have done it.  I'm a 56 shaman and really do not want to bother anyone for help yet as I know the next 2 cudgels will require me to seek out assistance.  Thanks for any help or suggestions on this part.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>gummox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I didn't try bear form, but shrink x 2 wasn't enough to get my fat Troll ass through the bars.  I dropped in through the pit trap, walked through the invis wall, cleared all the goblins in the vicinity and waited impatiently untill the right slave popped (the one that cons warmly or whatever Scaled Mystics usually /con to you) and pulled him out of his cell into the main room.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grimtug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just wanted to thank you both for the advice.  I dropped down into the cell and nuked the first gobo down and then popped the pet.  Cleared it out and there was the slave already up.  Pulled him out and that was that =)  Now I just have to find a dragoon with the helm and kill Bruiser Noz and it is on to the next one =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kialan Lecariuz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">For me I had to get a rogue to pick the jail locks...and had to kill some iksar prisoners to spawn the right one.<br />
<br />
But oh my, GOOD LUCK getting a helm off a sarnak dragoon. I had a hard 3 days with that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grimtug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think I have gotten very lucky during this part of the quest from hearing what others have said.  I invised up and ran around in the Sarnak fortress and finally found a dragoon way in the back.  I rooted, dot'd and waited and low and behold...a helm on the first kill.  Just wanted to thank everyone again for the help with this quest.  I am now off to Howling Stones for the 7th quest.  Hopefully that will go as well as the others.<br />
