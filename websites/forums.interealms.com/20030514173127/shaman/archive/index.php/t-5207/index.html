<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wondering what your experiences have been here with some of the classic spots. I've been playing in HHK today for roughly 4 hours and pulled out roughly a yellow, though not bad I would like to better maximize my exp. I don't get much time to grind between raids and just plain not being able to get on so the faster the better. <br />
<br />
Where do you make great xp at this level? Chardok seems to be weak on the xp side these days, tried it last night post patch. Haven't tried katta yet but may head there if it's still a reasonable place to grind that's kinda out of the way. CoM is mostly light blue now, and Hole just keeps kickin my arse when I try to solo there. Bloody adds. Anyway... just a question, advice would be welcome and appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">4 hours for a yellow and you're complaining?<br />
<br />
Wish I had your troubles.<br />
<br />
I certainly hope this was a simple message board troll and not a legit post. If the latter, you're spoiled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Taht is about what I got in HHK before the last couple of patches.  be happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've been told HHK slows down at 55.<br />
<br />
I was there last night, at 54 from 12:45 AM to 8:45 AM.<br />
<br />
I went from 2% to 100%. Ding 55!<br />
<br />
I haven't been back yet (too caffinated to play right now, woo, new pet! Woo, caffinnnnneeeee)<br />
<br />
But I was doing a yellow every hour and 40 minutes at 54, with no epic, jbb, horse, iskar regen bp, pet. I called my room &quot;The Dining Room of Death&quot; and smashed and mauled faster than they could spawn, oh, glorious. My biggest problem was an idiot mage who was running around killing guards (okay), but standing in my path in those narrow halls while I am pulling Issabella down the corridor (NOT okay), and then asking for buffs (NO WAY, you almost killed me five times.)<br />
<br />
So I can see where Lor is coming from, but I don't know of any place better at 55 yet. I'll be looking around. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I found 55 was a HUGE slowdown from 54 in HHK, it just still happened to be better than most other solo places at that level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I ground through 55 at HHK as well, just dinged this morning. I got a blue every 25 minutes, depending on spawn times. I did quit picking on the bards ( I was picking on the bards at 54 ) because I dropped to Apprehensive, and I hear bard faction is a pain to raise, and I don't want to go kos in all cities. (I never go to queynos or freeport, Shadowhaven baby :)). <br />
<br />
The bards go lb exactly at 55, and are 100% lb.<br />
<br />
At 55, 75% of the nobles were lb, and 75% isabella is lb. <br />
<br />
The main problem with HHK is, it's boring. Real boring. And at 56, I don't think it'll be worth the xp to stay. <br />
<br />
Well, I've got bane of nife and celerity now, plus my 55 dogdog, so I think it's time to move onto a new hunting ground... if I see green carpet and green ceiling and green walls and &quot;Guards! Help!&quot; one more time, I may go crazy :)<br />
