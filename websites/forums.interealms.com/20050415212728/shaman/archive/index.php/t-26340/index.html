Count your manapool, then that of a hybrid...  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The new slow is in timer group 0, so it could be stacked with nihils on resistant targets for fast casting if needed. Other than that the only improvement is an additional 20 on the resist modifier. It would be nice if they included a -40MR debuff in an additional slot, so that it could be used as a true prep spell for turgurs. Then turgurs would be as likely to land as nihils. That might give it some additional utility and perhaps create new uses for the spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">That's a useful idea.<br />
<br />
And take it from someone with a chanter alt, the 6 sec (5 sec with spell haste focus) cast time of Forlorn Deeds is a b**** when you're used to a 2.3 second Turgur's.  Many chanters use the 50% slow on softer-hitting mobs just for its 3 second base cast time.<br />
<br />
Giving chanters a resist mod, fast casting slow was, in my opinion, overdue, especially because enchanters don't have a slow based on a different resist for high-MR mobs.  Now if they'd just put in some &quot;lure&quot; type mezzes and nukes...<br />
<br />
(this being said because 99% of an enchanter's offensive spells are based on MR.  A high-MR mob is virtually immune to an enchanter, who usually can only stand around and look pretty after tashing the mob.  No other int caster has this problem, as they either have alt-resist spells or spells with lure components, or both.)</div></div><hr />

I'm a hybrid and I have roughly 400 less mana then my shaman does.</div></div><hr />

it was pretty balanced, We should be able to cast Malos faster if they are getting a quicker slow just to be balanced..</div></div><hr />

I have recently been going to gates to try and get that spell. It is IMPOSSIBLE to get groups to go there on the Nameless.  If there is another way that is doable..then i'm all for it.<br />
<br />
As for the BL slow, my alt I 2box with is a BL so I'm all for it;)</div></div><hr />

I am not sure what your gear is like, m9, but you can probably Duo in KT for the spell, even nameds. Drop a Serenity as the tank runs off, slow as the mob is inc, and you should be fine. At worst, a trio could easily keep the spawn areas of the nameds clear, and get damn good XP doing it. <br />
<br />
But the status of KT is a bit screwy. Its just a major-league PITA zone, all the way around. Long run, long invis run to the decent camps, with see-invis roaming around, it just bites. I agree its time to add SOME alternate method to get Gates spells, either with research or a quest of some kind. Making Nihil, a spell in our &quot;Class Defining Spell Line&quot;, so difficult to get is weak.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Count your manapool, then that of a hybrid...  :D<br />
<br />
Hybrids haven't had a mana pool disadvantage for years. Right now they have the exact same mana that a normal caster of the same level with the same stats would have. I'll have to admit that I don't know what it's like for bazaar geared players but the different isn't huge from what I've seen in my Guild. All the good melee gear or the hybrid class gear always includes mana and wis/int on it and usually not much behind what casters get. Sure we've got some casters that are really focused on mana and have things like the 400 mana clicky buffs that break 10k mana but most of our casters are closer to 9k and our hybrids are around 8k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>zolexa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Count your manapool, then that of a hybrid...<br />
Especially at todays levels.  My SK has had more mana than my shaman for over a year and a half.  And that was before she got full EP geared.  Now she's left him in the dust.  But then his gear is currently gimpy.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>notch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">My oppinion is.. sure.. give enc and bst a new slow. <br />
But give us a no resist 50% slow.(NO MIDIGATION, except for lvl 66+named)  Same cast time as malo.  350 mana<br />
Bring something to the table that shammans have over the other classes. <br />
<br />
I havent read one thing about giving shammies a mana regen buff.<br />
<br />
bards get slow.. give mana regen.<br />
Necros can slow and give mana<br />
bst can slow.. and give mana regen buff<br />
chanters. duh<br />
Shammies get slow (which becuase of midigation ends up being about the same as some others) but no mana regen buff .<br />
<br />
And they should also give us a 60 min haste! since duration of slows in most situations doesnt make much differance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">About Yiktu, it's actually the rarest spell in KT, and the most common drop in sewers 1-2. I think it's also 2nd most common in Barindu right by the sewer entrances just pull all those mobs.<br />
<br />
Paladin's getting Yoppa's doesn't bother me as long as we get a better heal.<br />
<br />
Also I rather have our new slow be exactly what nihil is except give an additional -40 mr check like the other person mentioned, to help turgurs land.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">My only point is they need to make it fair to shamans in how they distribute this spell. <br />
<br />
There are a lot of shamans who still don't have this spell, and of course any new lvl 65 shamans are going to find it nearly impossible to drag groups to GoD - sheesh, I find it difficult and I am in a good sized guild that can do it if needed.<br />
<br />
Either make it that the BL -mr slow drop only in GoD, rarely from nameds. <br />
<br />
Or make Balance available to the same degree as whatever method they use to allow BL's to get it to even it out.<br />
<br />
Yeah, like I see either of these two happening :(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">well, mitigation is here to stay, has been since PoP. no sense in bitching about it.<br />
&quot;no resist&quot; slow is never gonna happen.<br />
we need variables &lt;i&gt;like resists&lt;/i&gt; to make the game fun. sure you can get frustrated when a mob resists a spell, but if the mob didn't occasionally resist, it'd be the same rhythm over, and over, and over again, it'd require no reaction, and there would be no need to recast a spell, building aggro wouldn't happen or anything else similar. a &lt;i&gt;less resistable&lt;/i&gt; slow is different. it helps eliminate certain annoying situations...<br />
<br />
I will say that this should probably replace Vindictive Spirit, a near useless spell that serves no purpose other than to give us another rune between champion and might. /rude<br />
<br />
I do have to say that 1.5 min duration screams for my attention and mocks me.</div></div><hr />

What are you talking about, Chanters have ALWAYS been able to slow faster then Shaman since PoP.<br />
<br />
Enchanter = Tash (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3342&amp;source=Test)  - 1 second / Serpent of Vindication  (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=22959)  - 3 seconds = 4 seconds total<br />

Shaman = Malos (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3395&amp;source=Test) - 5 seconds / Time's Antithesis (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=24699) - 3 seconds = 8 seconds total<br />
<br />
Shaman w. Balance = Malos (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3395&amp;source=Test) - 5 seconds / (2.2 recast) / Balance of the Nihil  (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4900&amp;source=Test) - 1.5 seconds = 8.7 seconds Total<br />
(Balance is not dependable enough to be used without Malos)<br />
<br />
And if you havent noticed, Chanters get a much larger advantage from their item, due to the cast time being cut in half and shaman dont.  So by all rights, shaman do have the right to bring this up whenever we want.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know where you grind, or what your preference is but I rarely malos before using balance. I grind upto and including qvic, riftseekers, rcod sewers, etc. and I pretty much slow on incoming. It's easier for me to TA and follow up with a balance if the mob isn't slowed. I'll malos after that if there are casters who aren't able to contribute to the max/min equation without it.<br />
<br />
I'm sure you will all now tell me that I suck because the max/min formula states that if you don't malos you can't complain about how sucky you are but if my grind group and I can haul an aa in every 20 minutes in the rcod sewers without a death and with non-stop mobs in camp for a sustained period of time I'll just suck quietly and have fun.<br />
<br />
I grind with a beastlord tank most of the time which is odd, because I thought we were supposed to hate them too.</div></div><hr />

Yeah well. I'm no enchanter, but I don't think they've had a slow upgrade in quite some time. Mostly I'm interested to see how SOE will make the spell available to them, and whether it will be fair (compared to the trouble a lot of folks still have with getting hold of Nihil).

I find all this very funny. Chanters and Beastlords will be able to slow just as well as a Shaman. Palis will now be able to heal just as well as Shaman.

Oh, honestly.<br />
<br />
Enchanters and Beastlords cannot slow &quot;just as well as&quot; Shaman. Yay for their upgrades. Besides, Tugela had an interesting way of looking at it.<br />
<br />
Paladins get Yoppa's ... wohoo for them. I think we hold our own just fine — and maybe you missed the part about how SOE is taking a look at our healing ability as part of the class re-envisioning project.<br />
<br />
If I read correctly, Panther/Leopard is going to be adjusted for use on pets. I haven't seen anyone say it will be adjusted for use on PC's. It's a hell of a spell, and I'm glad I have it, but I'm not going to cry and whine because it won't do as well for pets as it used to. Yes, I'm fine with it being &quot;nurfed.&quot;<br />
<br />
So you just go right on ahead and scream. Maybe, if I'm feeling like a generous &quot;fanboy,&quot; I'll get you some throat lozenges for when you're finished screaming. Wouldn't want you to lose your voice. You'll need it for when the sky really does fall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I always considered canni a &quot;mana regen buff,&quot; personally. /shrug<br />
I think his point is we cannot buff other players mana or mana-regen in any way. We have very solid tools for our own mana, but nothing that helps others. <br />
<br />
Personally, I think we should be getting SOMETHING to help casters in our groups more. Panther was a nice bump for us to help Mages and Necros, and sort of helps Chanters (their higher pets are a bit more usable), but we really have nothing substantial to offer Clerics, Druid and Wizards (yeah, yeah, theres Boo Boo, Wizard Swords, and that Cleric pet-hammer thing, I suppose we could Panther those in a pinch).<br />
<br />
I would even settle for the lower versions of the BL mana-hp regen line, or a reduced duration KEI (neither of which stacks with the real versions, of course). Fair is fair. If they are going to be getting such strong bumps in slows, then we should be given something to bring us closer in the things they do well, one of which is mana bumping.</div></div><hr />

If I read correctly, Panther/Leopard is going to be adjusted for use on pets. I haven't seen anyone say it will be adjusted for use on PC's. It's a hell of a spell, and I'm glad I have it, but I'm not going to cry and whine because it won't do as well for pets as it used to. Yes, I'm fine with it being &quot;nurfed.&quot;<br />
<br />
So you just go right on ahead and scream. Maybe, if I'm feeling like a generous &quot;fanboy,&quot; I'll get you some throat lozenges for when you're finished screaming. Wouldn't want you to lose your voice. You'll need it for when the sky really does fall.<br />
<br />
I am really glad you are glad and if you like being a fanboy more power to you, but taking it in the shorts again is not something I am looking forward to. <br />
<br />
1)Looking at our healing? When their is a real spell up I will believe it.<br />
<br />
2)Adjusted for use on pets. If 100 dps for the short time it lasts and the huge amout of mana it takes seems like a good deal to you? Then good for you, I must disagree<br />
<br />
3)Slow is close now with midagation. Slow is now closer because of the - resists both chanters and beastloards are going to recieve. Once again if you are happy with this more power to you but I am not.<br />
<br />
4)I didnt say the sky was falling just It looks like shaman may be getting the shaft again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agree.  This is the scariest thing for me atm.  Just how does SOE intend to balance our slows against heals (which I think is pure crap, but they stated that that is their intention).<br />
<br />
2)Adjusted for use on pets. If 100 dps for the short time it lasts and the huge amout of mana it takes seems like a good deal to you? Then good for you, I must disagree<br />
<br />
<br />
100dps = An aggro-less 600 hp per tick dot with a duration longer than our curse line.  Its damn near unresistable also.  I'm still happy with 100 dps for 650 mana.  I can cast this on every single melee on our raids np.  With Spirtual Channeling I can cast this on every single person in the raid, and all pets.  <br />
<br />
3)Slow is close now with midagation. Slow is now closer because of the - resists both chanters and beastloards are going to recieve. Once again if you are happy with this more power to you but I am not.<br />
 <br />
<br />
We just killed the King in RS, and disease slow once again played a role (princes).  Regardless, I agree in that SOE has narrowed the gap between slowers.  <br />
<br />
But that doesn't have me concerned as much.  I still bring greater dps to a group than a beastlord does.  I can also play the role of main healer, which a beast can't.  <br />
<br />
Champion, better haste, and 100 dps per melee in a group + 100 dps for my pet = &gt; beastlord by far.  <br />
<br />
Take a typical group for me.<br />
1. Cleric/Druid<br />
2. Shaman<br />
3. Monk/Bard/Ranger<br />
4. Necro/Mage<br />
5. War/Pally/Sk<br />
6. Rogue/Ranger/Zerker/Beast<br />
<br />
In that group, I add 300dps to 500 dps per pull constantly (can easily maintain 3 Panthers, and alternating 3 melee/pet, then 2 melee/pet, with fast pulls, its on all 5 melee/pets at all times).<br />
<br />
I can also take over main healing if the cleric/druid dies.  As well as zero rez them back to our group if not with a necro.  I can also spam heal the MT if the mob we are fighting is very mean.  <br />
<br />
Add our group Champion, add our 7% damage avoidance.  Add our 60hp per tick regen.  Add our attack sow.  Add our 5% damage mod buff.  <br />
<br />
Add our ability to root and heal ourselves.  Add that we have the best mana regen of any class save necro's, and many ways to use it, and you still have a very strong class.  <br />
<br />
Between my epic hot, my group aa hot, my single target hots, and my fast heals,  I can stack a hell of a lot of healing power on the group as is.  <br />
<br />
The biggest problem remains our blast heal.  When the crap hits the fan, and we haven't had a chance to stack hots, our blast heal is still inadequate against upper end content.  <br />
<br />
Our second biggest problem is the cast time, and especially the recast time on malos.  If the shaman is fighting resistant mobs, and mutiple are in camp, the enchanter begins to out class us.  There's no point being able to heal if your heals can't keep up with 2-3 mobs unslowed dps, and you don't have the time to slow them because A) you're being beat on, B) the tank is near death, or C) malos won't refresh fast enough to get them slowed.<br />
<br />
Lets look at the three slowing classes in terms of what they bring to a group of mixed melee and casters.<br />
<br />
Healing: Shaman &gt; Beast &gt; Enchanter<br />
CC: Enchanter &gt; Shaman &gt; Beast<br />
DPS: Shaman &gt; Beast &gt; Enchanter<br />
Buffs:  Shaman &gt; Enchanter = Beast<br />
Debuffs:  Shaman &gt; Enchanter &gt; Beast<br />
<br />
Thats how I see it.  <br />
<br />
Healing:  Of course the shaman is a better healer than enc or bst.<br />
CC:  Of course the Enchanter is a better CC than shm or bst.<br />
DPS:  Some may argue.. but between our buffs and Panther, I'm willing to bet we bring more overall dps to a group than a beastlord does.  <br />
Buffs:  Duh. <br />
Debuffs:  Slow is the main debuff yes. And enchanters are nearly equal to shaman in group content.  But malos I think gives us the edge when nukers are around.  Its almost a toss up here now I think.  With the beast still far behind the enc/shm.<br />
<br />
Lets look at the priest classes now:<br />
Healing: Cleric &gt;&gt; Druid &gt; Shaman<br />
CC: Druid = Shaman &gt;&gt; Cleric<br />
DPS: Shaman &gt; Druid &gt;&gt; Cleric <br />
Buffs:  Shaman &gt; Cleric &gt; Druid<br />
Debuffs:  Shaman &gt; Druid &gt;&gt; Cleric<br />
<br />
Healing:  Cleric obviously.  But then we get into a more moderate different.  With our hot on, our relative heal power = a druids.  Its when we can't land the hot that our blast heal shows its weakness.  The complete heal is still a valuabe tool though, so the Druid gets a slight edge for that.  But with blast heals increasing in size, and with Crits, I notice less and less Druids using CH in groups.  Raids is another story.<br />
<br />
CC:  Kinda depends on the content here.  If mobs are snarable, a druid can snare kite/root when the mobs are hitting too tough to tackle directly.  If the zone is compact, or snare does't work, then the shaman get the edge for being able to slow and park still, but loses if the mobs are too tough to tack hits from. <br />
<br />
DPS:  With Panther, its now the shaman.  No debate there.  Before Panther, it was the druid.<br />
<br />
Buffs:  Duh again.  We are too versatile to be denied the top buffer slot.<br />
<br />
Most of that assesment comes from a group standpoint.  When you talk raiding, things can change a bit.  <br />
<br />
For instance, both our active shaman (me being one of them) took a week off at the same time. Our guild succesfully killed many raid target s without us.  Try that without clerics or druids, and you'd be in trouble.  The raw HP buffs that cleric and druids brings are of much greater importance to raids than a shaman being present.  Likewise, bigger blast heals and CH are of much greater importance than a shamans heals or 5% greater slows.<br />
<br />
<br />
In summary, we are holding our own in groups.  And I think are the top pick of the slowing classes.  We are still the third pick of the healing classes though.  If things get out of hand, we oftetimes can't keep pace with mob dps.  <br />
<br />
In raids though, we still lack.  We truly aren't necessary.  We are the icin'ing on the cake on raids.  Our cures aren't even needed if you just mgb hots and do group heals.  We rarely cure anything, even on Quarm+ dots now.  Panther doesn't stack, enc's can slow for us without trouble.</div></div><hr />

Is spelling really that important to you? I will make sure and watch my step. I didn't know you were an english teacher. Or maybe I just hit the wrong key, well maybe not :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">I would even settle for the lower versions of the BL mana-hp regen line, or a reduced duration KEI (neither of which stacks with the real versions, of course).<br />
<br />
I rather like those ideas. Of late, I find myself in groups lacking an enchanter or beastlord, and it'd be nice to cast something to prevent the &quot;Oh my KEI wore off, hold pulls plz so I can run to POK&quot; crap from Pickup_Group_Cleric_01. I'm liking the Beastlord mana/HP line more than a reduced KEI, though ... I have much love for HP regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Sebekiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Add our ability to root and heal ourselves.  Add that we have the best mana regen of any class save necro's, and many ways to use it, and you still have a very strong class. <br />
<br />
I'd say that overall our mana regen is better than a Necromancers. The advantage necros had previously was in the fact that they did not have to actively cast to recover mana. With Pained Memory I am able to recover 120 mana/tick average, with plenty of time between to cast 2 to 3 spells. Add in Canniblization (which averages to about 35 mana/tick if you use it every 3 minutes) and we are averaging 155 per tick not including meditating (if on a horse or able to sit between casts) and not including any buffs that add mana regen.  Necros get 65 per tick from their self buff and have disadvantages in that they cannot use the Enchanter mana regen buffs (doesn't stack) and the hit points they to recover mana are much more expensive to recover via Lifetaps than via Spiritual Serenity.  When I finally get Ancient Ancestral Calling and Spiritual Channeling, it'll be &quot;Game Over&quot; as far as any non-shaman hoping to compete with me for Mana regeneration/prodution.<br />
<br />
This is exactly as it should be, since the developers set the base mana costs on our spells higher to compensate for Shaman mana regeneration.<br />
<br />
Between my epic hot, my group aa hot, my single target hots, and my fast heals,  I can stack a hell of a lot of healing power on the group as is.  <br />
<br />
The biggest problem remains our blast heal.  When the crap hits the fan, and we haven't had a chance to stack hots, our blast heal is still inadequate against upper end content.  <br />
<br />
<br />
It's still possible for a Shaman to do this on at least an emergency (short-term) basis in GoD and Omens experience groups, but it takes a very well-geared tank and a Shaman with the right combination of AAs and Gear (Max Healing Adept, Max Healing Gift, Qvic Arms or better for Healing Focus) to keep up with Mob DPS for very long. In most of my groups, once Leopard (don't have Panther yet) is cast I tend to toss a few heals to slow down the rate that the main healer has to heal, simply because I can recover that mana back far faster than they can.<br />
<br />
This past weekend I was in a group doing group MPG trials. We were clearing to each trial for some extra exp along the way.  I soon stopped slowing except for nameds because I found that casting Spirtual Serenity was as helpful to the cleric as a mitigated slow that didn't land until the mob was at 60% or so. Of course, we had a well-geared tank (in the top 10 active players ranked by total hit points on Lanys) and enough overall DPS to tear through most mobs like a hot knife through butter.<br />
<br />
Well, the panther thing isnt a big deal, it was pretty clear that it was imbalanced when applied to pets. Even using leopard my pet was doing about the same dps as my warrior, who has pretty respectable gear. It was obvious that that would be changed, and I think they way they are doing it sounds like the best option.

The spell is far from useless even in the modified form.<br />
<br />
I don't think that Leopard or Panther will be worthless even after the nerf, I'll probably still use them for my major DPS output unless the group is light on melee.  My concern with the nerf is that Sony's record shows they are very likely to over-nerf these spells, then declare that things are &quot;perfect&quot; and ignore any evidence to the contrary for quite some time.<br />
<br />
They are also likely to break other things.  If whatever is broken hurts the players (players proccing less, pets not proccing at all, etc.) they'll spend months working on the fix. If it is in the favor of the players (mobs doing less DPS, etc.) they'll release an emergency patch that same night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>bryce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">&quot;Take a typical group for me.<br />

<br />
It would be nice to get some #s from parsing Panther on other classes.  When I parsed myself, Panther was adding 125 dps (w 1237 crits).  (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=25962&amp;highlight=Panther)   <br />
<br />
Since pets dont critical proc, and if they proc the same as us, pets would do around 100 dps then. That would make pets 25% less efficient then casting on PCs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hehe.  I'm sorry you have to group with those folks.  I've never once had a rogue complain to me.  Matter of fact, they beg me for it to make the wizards pissed in our guild hehe.  Its started a whole &quot;who's the best dps&quot; battle again hehe.  <br />
<br />
Sk and Pallies:  First thing I tell them.  Make sure you have an open buff slot UP TOP.  If Panther lands above their self proc, its better dps.  <br />
<br />
Bards and Rangers. If they aren't meleeing, they are being slackers.  I know my guild rangers do more melee dps than archery.  I normally remind them by saying &quot;HEY FLOORMOP (if ranga), STOP BEING A LAZY TARD AND HIT THAT MOB&quot;. hehe.  Same with Bards.  Unless they are raiding (using two instruments for max effect), there should never be a reason that they stand there doing nothing (unless mezzing... but I mean, come on hehe.)<br />
<br />
<br />
Just because you cast this on someone does not mean they will be doing an extra 100 DPS. Even in it's nerfed form pets will still be the way to go to get the full effect.<br />
<br />
You're right.  They might actually be doing 125dps:)   I'm guessing 100 dps is the average.  <br />
<br />
<br />
But you are right.  We are placing our dps in the hands of others.  Its frustrating to see a rogue you just cast panther on sitting there twiddling his thumbs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Tebion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">why would one want to get a mana regen buff for us?<br />
sure, it would be nice, especially if it stacks with all other manaregen buffs, but honestly, from the very beginning, the shaman was the buffer for MELEE's, not for casters.<br />
we were here to make them hit faster, harder and better<br />
we were here to make them get hit slower and for less<br />
we never were here to benefit the casters and stepping into this group would do us more harm than anything else (guess what, then everyone who has mana regen buffs screams to get melee buffs, too).<br />
<br />
lets rather stay and get improvements in OUR job, not in the job of someone else (like the awsome upgrades we got with OoW and DoN)<br />
<br />
yes, some will argue that druids never had a mana-regen line before their Nine/Steel times, but, well, that is the past, i dont want to be a druid, do you? :P<br />
<br />
and another thing: calling peeps &quot;fanboys&quot; or similar doesn't make your argument stronger, in my eyes it makes it completely irrelevant, no matter what you write. Keep on the facts and stop the personal attacks, kkthx :)</div></div><hr />

Between C6 and Salik. I don't think we're that much better than chanters since you are talking about the full deal with buffs.<br />
<br />
Personally I think that a Malos upgrade is in order now with these changes. Malos needs to be 1 sec cast no recast like Tash, especially when the poison counter aggro changes go live.<br />
<br />
Paladins are not a healing class, most hybrid classes have more mana than me sadly enough, and many have FT15. Their heals need to be crazy inefficient just because they're a hybrid class. Their heals need to be as inefficient to us as like shaman heals are when compared to cleric heals.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i disagree that they should have massively ineffecient heals.  For top pallys healing is a form of damage midigation, just as SK life taps are for SKs.  stuns do not work for damage midigation against many mobs, and without decent heals pallys would fall behind the tanking curve.  not to mention, pally mana regen is crap when compaired to a shaman.  makeing their heals cost tons of mana more than ours would kill the class... i for one agree with the changes to pally healing...<br />

<br />
these two spells were exactly what their class was asking for (when you look at the changes.)<br />
this thread shows a discusion about pally healing if you care to read it...  the guy asking for a 2k and 3k heal in this thread is on crack and from the way the thread developed most people didn't agree with him...<br />
http://www.pon.myfreebb.com/viewtopic.php?t=524<br />
<br />
now that pallys have gotten a healing upgrade to their spells i see no reason while our quick healing spells should not be given reduced cast time and increased healing power...  i would assume this is an upcoming change for us that just has not been put on test yet (by assume, i mean hope...)</div></div><hr />
