<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ralv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just finishing up this cool quest.  The only thing I need to do is kill Barduks Darkpaw for his head.  Just wondering how many people have done this and how many people it would require to kill the guy.  I heard he has a TON of HP.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Heilos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Did it with a 55 Ranger (me), 61 druid, 54 Shaman, 55 wiz and another 55 Ranger.  Was huuuuuuge overkill.  All you really need is a slower and a healer, although it is good to bring more to clear the way towards him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dunaden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Did it with 2 druids and 2 rangers, all in the low to mid 50s.   We were able to invis all the way into Barducks (the casters mobs do see invis, but we managed to avoid the few we saw).   <br />
<br />
The druids could have probably done it alone, we just pulled him solo to the wall of the cave, rooted him,  dotted him,and shot arrows til he was dead.  Then succored out to go defend the town.<br />
<br />
The only reason to bring more people is to defend the town from the waves of gnolls that attack after Barducks dies.   That was fun :) .   We didn't have enough people to save everyone, but it was a fun fight and good expeience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Meecham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">He does have a ton of hp. That means the fight will typically be long, which means you'll probably get repops during the fight.<br />
I killed him once, brought a full group (51-53) and it was quite easy though took 5 minutes even with a full group. Enchanter charmed a few repops to throw 'em against Barducks for kicks.<br />
The gnoll war afterwards was very fun, we finally had to bail when there were like 8 gnolls in the building we'd settled in.<br />
<br />
Harmony of Nature also works great for racing back there quickly. Then it doesn't matter if invis drops or if they can see invis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Foxeye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My shaman husband and I duoed him at 54.  I was responsible for keeping it rooted while my husband epic-dotted and JBB'ed him to death.  Timing my roots to land EXACTLY after his nukes landed was the key to making this work.  We've probably killed him about 10 times now.<br />
<br />
When I turned 58 and my husband had his 2k heal I was finally able to tank barducks in our duo.<br />
<br />
We were easily able to pull him to the back of the room with a fully popped room without aggro.  We just tended to clear out any healers before this, because we didn't want to risk him getting within CH range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aizle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I killed him with 58 Ranger (me), 55 Paly and 60 Shaman.<br />
<br />
Was an easy kill.  No adds if you know where to pull him to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ralv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Finished it up last night.  Thanks for all the advice folks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Meecham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Where do you pull him to? I scouted around that whole cave without finding a good spot. I pulled him solo several times, but tended to get social aggro as soon as I got past my harmonied mobs - I was invis and they couldn't see me, still got aggro once Barducks passed them. Eventually I killed a few gnolls to clear out a corner of the cave and dotted him there - root broke too much for it to work.<br />
<br />
I have a necro partner, both soon to be 54, but I can't figure out how to make this work. It's a personal challenge. Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ralv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">We didn't pull him anywhere so I can't help you with that.  I had a full group of mid-50's and we just cleared the cave first.  He didn't seem to aggro even though we were beating his buddies right next to him.  Sorry I couldn't help.</div></div><hr />
