<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vandulus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am thinking about getting Lucin and I was wonder how harsh the Hardware requirements are.<br />
<br />
Is anyone running and older config/slower PCs with lots of ram able to play in the Lucin areas or is it finally that time?</div></div><hr />

All new models are off. Most other bells and whistles are off as well.<br />
<br />
Get used to seeing the ground if your system is like mine. You'll tend to spend most of your time staring at it on a raid. Non-raid is quite playable with just adjustments to the clip plane.</div></div><hr />

turn clip plane all the way down, turn off ALL luclin models (including Vah shir which you have to edit your eqclient.ini, the GUI model select doen't let you disable them)<br />
<br />
And shut off all spell effects, and other junk.<br />
<br />
And you can go everywhere fine.  Even 30+ person raids in Ssra are ok.<br />
<br />
I refuse to spend 1 cent more on hardware for my computer at this time.  I'm waiting till the end of the year/begininning of next year to buy a hammer system, then i won't have to upgrade for another 4 or 5 years.</div></div><hr />

Runs Luclin with all models and clipping pane maxxed fine in most old world zones. Have to reduce clipping to about half in Luclin zones. Haven't been on any big raids in Luclin zones but if I did I would bet I would have to turn some models and spelleffects off.</div></div><hr />

I can run everything top since I upgraded from a geforce 256.  Now in luclin i have to turn it down the ol clipping but i still can do alot more than I could before.  Oh and loading times with luclin models on still takes forever so I just leave them off.</div></div><hr />

Eq runs pretty slow with luclin models turned on, so I disable them all and only get partial slow down when lots of people are in the zone. I think my greatest bottleneck is my video card. It's the Radeon LE version, even tweaking it some doesn't seem to help. So I'll probably be upgrading to a Geforce 3 ti200 or Geforce3 - anything over that isn't going to help much for my system.<br />
<br />
What's the option to turn Vah'shir models off in the eqclient? And if you turn it off, do they have a model that takes up less resources or will you not be able to see the Vah'shir? I was wondering if there was someway to turn it off. If I can run all the old models like that, it would make my experience much better. It looks lame having a new model like Vah'shir running around while all the other old models are turned on :|</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have 2 machines I run EQ on.<br />
<br />
One is a Athlon 650, with 256mb of ram and a geforce2 card.<br />
I run with models off, animations off, textures low, caching on, clip pane somewhere in the middle, etc.<br />
<br />
It is fine in most all of luclin, except Neth.  Has a lot of trouble there for some reason.  Framerate drops to like 1 frame every other second...gah! <br />
<br />
My other machine is Athlon 1700+ with 512mb of ram and a Geforce3.  I can run with all options on and I have no problems at all.   I run it with all models off though, because I like to zone fast.  :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fedayeen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Had Luclin on a P2 400MHz and 128ram,<br />
Low Clipplane and no new chars,<br />
if i wanted to have 1024x768 res, that was the only way.<br />
Oh man, Luclin is still slow on my other,<br />
AMD 1.2Mhz, with 512ram, went to the Nexus and the City there, clipping the crap out of my computer, not fun at all, felt like playing on the first comp i mentioned.<br />
They have made to high requirements for this kind of game IMOHO.<br />
Way 2 Go Verrant!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Runs just peachy on a Althon 1.33Ghz, 512MB RAM 64mbGeForce 3 with full options and all models etc (although I turn off some models for raids as I like it really smooth.<br />
<br />
Runs ok on my PIII600 with 512mb RAM and 8mb ATI graphics card with all models off, clipping plane about 1/4 of the way up and no options on.  That is until I hit a wooded zone and then it is case of look at feet and hit /follow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">2 PCs now (family addiction, doncha know)<br />
AMD 1.2, 768 Mb, Voodoo 4/32mb or nVidia Ge2/Mx400, and SB Live on both.<br />
<br />
WinXP machine has sound probs; doesn't work well with the SB Live.<br />
<br />
WinME machine runs like a dream.<br />
<br />
All models on, clip plane way out, only concession I had to make was low particle effects.  Play 1024/768 rez/fullscreen mode.  Some of the Luclin and Kunark zones (And Stonebrunt Mts) run better if I pull in the clip plane 1/3 of the way back.  Odd, Velious doesn't do that to me at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Cayen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">3 machines at present:<br />
<br />
2 ghz p4, 512mb ddr ram, geforce2 64 meg---I can turn all the models on, all the textures to high, clip plane all the way, particle density on high, and run bard speed through the tunnel the day after Thanksgiving with 200 people, 50 of them paladins holding their epics and waving flashy &quot;No Vacancy&quot;  signs....and it never hitches.<br />
<br />
1400 p4, 384 mb rd ram, geforce 2 64 meg---All bells and whistles on, runs almost seamlessly...hitches in some Luclin areas.<br />
<br />
533 Celeron, 512 mb sdram, riva tnt2 32 meg---Can't turn diddly crap on, and its still average...or below average.  But, I would still call it solid.<br />
<br />
I still to this day say that EQ depends more on the processor than anything.  Well, mainly system bus speed (ie: 66 mhz on the Cel really really sucks).<br />
