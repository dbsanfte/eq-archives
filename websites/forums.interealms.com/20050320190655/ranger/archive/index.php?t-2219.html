Simpsons Creator Says Series End Is Nigh (http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;cid=638&amp;ncid=762&amp;e=1&amp;u=/nm/20020430/en_nm/leisure_simpsons_dc_2) <br />
<br />
&quot;I think we are closer to winding it up,&quot; the television show's creator, Matt Groening, told the Financial Times in an interview published Tuesday. <br />
<br />
&quot;Although what happens generally if we win the Emmy for best animation show is that that gives us another couple of years to run it into the ground,&quot; he said. <br />
<br />
At first, I thought the series was stupid, inane and a waste of time, but I've really grown to enjoy The Simpsons. I don't want to see it end yet.</div></div><hr />

He stated that they are in the process of working on their 13 &amp; 14 season.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myrea</div><div class="date">05-01-2002, 11:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, and Sarah Michelle Geller denied that Buffy was ever going to leave the WB.<br />
<br />
The stars are the last to be allowed to admit ANYTHING about what a show is doing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numbuk</div><div class="date">05-01-2002, 12:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally, I've wanted it to end for the past couple of years.  Don't get me wrong, I've been a huge fan since the very first Christmas Episode of Season 1.  But they've really been stretching for ideas lately and have been pushing the limits of lowbrow.  I think they should end with dignity while they still have some left.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dignity?  We are talking about Homer here....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numbuk</div><div class="date">05-01-2002, 12:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, but the show had a certain class to it say 5 years ago.   Now there's excessive vomit, poop, and loss of extremities a-plenty.  It's like they're almost trying to get booted off the air.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rounlin Starwolf</div><div class="date">05-01-2002, 12:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I pray that it never ends:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dayspring Askanison</div><div class="date">05-01-2002, 10:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Like MASH, Cheers, Hill St. Blues and many other shows. All great shows must someday come to an end. I'm going to miss the Halloween specials, but it has gotten a little stale. But Don't have a cow, man! There is always re-runs!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drexel</div><div class="date">05-01-2002, 10:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to agree with Numbuk on this one (again.):)  I used to watch The Simpsons religiously every week, until a few years ago.  I still watch the reruns at 6:00 on weekdays, but the show is losing its edge.<br />
<br />
All the shows that will be remembered as great shows ended while in their prime (Mash, Cheers, Seinfeld.)<br />
<br />
Roseanne was a great show.  Will it be remembered as a great show?  No.  The last season chewed.  Friends?  That show took a bite long ago and has been choking on it ever since.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fullerton</div><div class="date">05-02-2002, 09:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sadly, I must agree. <br />
<br />
I mean hell, look at the other TV show greats of all times that went on beyond their prime. Melrose Place, Fresh Prince of BelAir, and our universally beloved Clarissa Explains it All.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numbuk</div><div class="date">05-02-2002, 09:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey, Clarissa got better with age because...well.... Melissa got better (looking) with age.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaraxel</div><div class="date">05-02-2002, 10:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fresh prince is one of the best tv series ever.</div></div><hr />
