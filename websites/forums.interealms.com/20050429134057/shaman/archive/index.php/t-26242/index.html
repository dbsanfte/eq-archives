<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What's best you have had? While twinking, caster in SM I hit an evis for 2119. Oddly enough, My best hit in Strath so far was on the wandering badass abominations, think it was 1956, pretty good against a badass level 58 mob(still not move his hp bar much).<br />
<br />
been hit for like 2200 by a warrior before(execute?), 800-900 by a Paladin()some funky seal?), 1400 by a mage(pyro), 1000 from a hunter, and 1750 I think is best I have taken from a fellow rogue with cold blood evis. No idea about druids but moonfire sucks, and no idea about loks and priests either, they are always running away. My hits are god awful on plate classes, half of what a cloth caster takes.<br />
<br />
Just a boredom thread.<br />

I crit'd Starfire this morning for 500.  :) Biggest number I've seen.  My Direbear can crit for 360ish I think.  (at lvl 44)</div></div><hr />

After switching to a tri-spec, going with different gear, MB crits for high 700's at 58.</div></div><hr />

Upcoming druid too, can they be legit tanks all geared up in dire bear form?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">1300'ish Aimed Shot crit on even con melee mob back around 52 or 53 (57 now).<br />
<br />
Normal autoshot crits in the 350 - 400 range usually happen at least once or twice a fight, sometimes three or four times if/when I'm lucky.<br />
<br />
25 BM/22 MM spec (with one point earned as of this morning when I hit 57 not yet committed), so I might could get a bit better numbers if I spec'd more into MM, but I'm enjoying having a meaty pet to take the beatings right now. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">As a 60 warlock I've critted for 1900 something with soul fire after a curse of elements.  Would have been around 2700 with the ruin talent I believe which I'll probably get soon with a respec.  I think with curse of elements, a lot of added fire damage and extreme luck it is possible to crit for 3500 with soul fire.  I don't use it much though since it is a 6 second cast, has a 1 minute cooldown and costs a soulshard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shrewd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">1200 on a lvl 51 paldin. thats a regular hit crit 400, which fires command and crit 800... When I get higher and get a better procing weapon... it will be more...</div></div><hr />

Can't speak for top end instances, but my bro (55 war) and I can tank almost any eliete we've fought so far by just bouncing agro off each other in with me in bear form for the most part. Just pop out occasionally to toss regrowth on both of us. <br />
<br />
I actually have more hp (dire bear gives +1000ish hp at 53) and ac then he does, but bear form has almost no pure avoidance whatsoever (I think my dodge is like 6.8% and thats it), no block, and no parry. <br />
<br />
Bear form also lacks the tools for agro on multiple mobs that warriors have like sweeping strikes. Keeping more then one mob on me is a real challenge at times. Bear form does the dps of a wet noodle which also makes it really hard to hold agro. <br />
<br />
I'd personally rank bear form tanking like this.<br />
<br />
HP  A+<br />
AC A+<br />
Avoidance D<br />
DPS D-<br />
Abilities C<br />
Agro generation C<br />
<br />
Over all - B- <br />
<br />
Bear form can tank ok, just not spectacularly. That said I spend most of my time in bear form because I can actually take a beating and all the other forms do crappy dps too (atm).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">800 melee on a crit windfury.  My 2-hander kinda sucks though (46dps staff from Maraudon still). I hear you can get around 1500 with a top end 2 hander.  I crit pretty consistently for 900-1100 with spells though.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">1450ish is the max I've critted with my mage.  That only happens on pyroblast, combo with 35% damage talent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">2300ish crit aimed shot on a rat :).  Best I can do on actual mobs is about 1700-1800.  Aimed shot sucks for overall dps though - imho.  There are quite a few better and/or slower bows and guns that can probably go higher than mine.</div></div><hr />

I'm going distruction build, and I get ruin in a couple levels. I can't wait! :P<br />

There was a thread about execute on TSW, supposedly with sunder armor, a max rage bar, and a crit, execute can do over 3k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kryscha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Warrior : 874 using a Warmonger 2H sword at level 51. I don't have any of the arms spec talents, and I believe some of them increase your crit damage, so it *could* have been higher I guess. Been doing a lot more instances lately, which has meant 1h+shield, so haven't had that much chance to use 2Hers again.</div></div><hr />
