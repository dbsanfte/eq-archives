<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vulash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys, I quit playing about a year ago.  A couple months after Luclin came out I believe.  Anyway, I've just recently started playing again, and the amount of changes are slightly overwhelming.  I could use a little help from anyone willing.  I'm level 59 with no AA.  Basically my biggest question is upgrades.  Every expansion raises the bar on equipment, and typically there are some easy upgrades from your &quot;high end&quot; stuff from before ;)<br />
I don't have a huge guild, or a huge amount of time, but those are the type upgrades I have.  I'll try and list my equipment from memory, but since its been so long except yesterday evening, I won't remember it all.  Also, I'm a AC/hp man, and my wis seems to be sitting well, although more is great if it doesn't sacrifice AC or HP.<br />
<br />
ToV ss quest armor - BP, Legs, Helm, one wrist<br />
Gladiator chain sleeves, <br />
coldain skin gloves<br />
Vindi boots<br />
PMM (I had something better here, but it seems to be gone)<br />
+3 wis 2ac earrings<br />
bandit ring from FG<br />
missing other ring, was going to get AC5 hp55 ring<br />
Fear belt<br />
Ancient Seahorse Hide Cloak<br />
Sarnak Battle Shield<br />
Epic<br />
Goblin Parrying Spear in range<br />
Shoulders I dont' remember, nothing special though  chokadai maybe?<br />
JBB<br />
<br />
I have no focus items, no FT items.  I don't know if either of these are easier now or not.  I'll be exploring and researching in the meantime too.<br />
<br />
Also -  Have the price of Malo and Topor dropped any?  I have 0 plat right now (burned it on friends when I quit), and it would sure help with motivation for 60 if they had ;)  I've never had large amounts of plat (I think 10k is my max, and thats the only time over 5k)<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
check the Equipment forum - good threads there, and you are far more likely to get some responses to your questions</div></div><hr />
