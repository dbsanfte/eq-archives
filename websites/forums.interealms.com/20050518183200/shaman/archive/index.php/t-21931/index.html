<br />
65 shaman 330 aa's (ft12,regen 9, Iksar, all applicable focus items including ID4) playing 40% normal ldon, 40% hard LDON &amp; vxed,tipt and 20% raiding.  Raiding is very occasional slows and mainly spot healing, spot buffing and nuking.<br />
<br />
Stats are below if you feel like reading them. ----------------------------<br />
<br />
DATA<br />
<br />
Extrapolated non-raid fights based on 3 min canny5 timer and successful turgur's: a) 1259 canny5 x 3 min = 3777 min x 1.25 (a 25% lag in being able to canny during fight) = 4721 min; b) 3959 successful turgur's<br />
<br />
4721/3959 = approximately 1 min 12 sec per fight including downtime between mobs. So maybe 1/2 fighting, 1/2 pulling so fights last 36 sec on average.<br />
<br />
Canny 5 - 1 cast every 4 fights, canny 4 - 2 casts per fight.<br />

The developer's want #'s.  Here are my parses from the past month and I'm working like a bard on speed for most fights casting, cannying, etc. I respectfully suggest that I can't work any harder so these #'s are absolutely top end.<br />
<br />
65 shaman 330 aa's (ft12,regen 9, Iksar, all applicable focus items including ID4) playing 40% normal ldon, 40% hard LDON &amp; vxed,tipt and 20% raiding.  Raiding is very occasional slows and mainly spot healing, spot buffing and nuking.<br />
Translation: These are Purdypog's parses regarding his recent playing. He spent about 40% of his time in normal LDoNs, 40% in hard LDoNs or Vxed and 20% raiding in unspecified zones.<br />
<br />
Stats are below if you feel like reading them.  Summary as follows attempting to figure out total contribution of hard working shaman per non-raid fight in LDON hard or vxed since LDON easy is another animal altogether:<br />
<br />
1) 800 damage/fight nuke<br />
2) 720 damage/fight FA<br />
3) 844 healing/fight Q and Tnarg's<br />
4) 405 damage/fight pet<br />
5) 50 damage/fight epic dot<br />
6) 50 damage/fight melee<br />
7) 2052 damage/fight shaman haste<br />
8) 0 damage/fight stat buffs<br />
<br />
4077 total damage per fight 15% of normal vxed mob since I'm guessing that vxed mobs have about 26k in hit points based on my nukes doing 3% damage.<br />
Translation: Purdypog did the above damage per fight, totalling about 15% of a single MOBs HPs on average.<br />
<br />
844 total healing /fight - Since I don't have cleric parses this is just an estimate but lets say 1 ch for 6k and two fast heals of 2k is clerics average per fight and I am doing all the hot's. 8% of healing per fight<br />
Translation: Purdypog healed about 8% of the damage his group took.<br />
<br />
Average fight is 36 seconds, slowed portion 25 seconds, average slow with some partial slows 50%. (no attempt to figure out damage reduction due to slowing since I don't have mob dps).  But, my point here is that short duration fights with partial slows reduces the shaman's edge over enchanters and beastlords compared with previous content.<br />
Translation: I am not quite sure what Purdydog is trying to tell us here.<br />
<br />
So, the $100 question is whether my experience group contribution is balanced given that I am the slower just marginally better than an enchanter or beastlord, I contribute 15% of the damage and heal 8%.  I will let the developers make that call based on what they think a beastlord or enchanter brings to the table.<br />
<br />
[QUOTE='Purdypog']But is it fair to compare these shaman #'s (getting carpal tunnel and being as efficient as possible) to a beastlord or enchanter? I think not.  Take my contribution #'s and 1/2 them if you want a level playing field for all shaman who are not working quite as hard cannying or don't have the aa's or focus items. So somewhere between 7-15% of damage and 4-8% of healing is really the #'s to use for balancing purposes<br />
Translation: Purdypog proposes that since these numbers are partly the result of superior gear or playing skills that lower numbers should be used to approach the balancing process.<br />
<br />
BALANCE IN RAIDS: In raids Shaman still are seriously gimped if there are more than 2 shaman.  Our slow casting nukes rarely contribute ANY damage on clearing mobs.  The raiding 3,4 5th shaman are usually asked to spot heal and nuke on boss mobs.  While those are useful things, druids who are doing exactly the same thing heal and nuke better.<br />
Translation: No translation needed I think :)<br />
 <br />
The rest of his post is the data he used to arrive at above conclusions.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps :P . By the way, I neither agree nor disagree with his post - I did nto have the chance to do more then skim over it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">A quick glance indicates that you attributed the increased DPS resulting from your buffs directly to yours. <br />
I am not sure I agree with this, especially when half of your DPS comes from haste, a buff that usually isn't provided by Shamans. <br />
How did you figure out the increased DPS from FA btw or am I reading that data wrong?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>m970456</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Your haste numbers assume the groups you are buffing are all melee.  There are groups I'm in where my haste only effects 1 person in the group..So haste is hard to tell how much it helps on DPS in a given group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">well i not sure quite how to look at this.<br />
<br />
heal diffinate seem weak, supposing that there is only 2 healers (cleric /druid) then i would think that being able to heal more than 8% would be better, it means the other healer was healing 92% meaning we not really backup healing either. better ratio would be  cleric being mayb 75% us 25% or druid 60% us 40% but i not sure whether the low heal was just because you couldnt heal any more than that or the cleric just healed alot better than us. either way it would seem our healing is lacking.<br />
<br />
damage seems more in line if each person did 1/6 of the damage to mob then 16.6 % would the mark to make, so we wouldnt be that far off. although i think your idea that 7% to 15% is more accurate. and at 7% we lack.<br />
<br />
although you can say buff/haste etc are rreally damage we cause cause our buffs, it is still really the mellee that does that no us ourselves. so though we help dps, its not the same as doing dps. which might lower that %.<br />
<br />
still just shows if they lower the cast time on VS then that would help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hi all, well I agree with the person who said he neither agrees nor disagrees with this parse.  Much of it is dependant on how hard the content is or the group composition.<br />
<br />
Case in point is normal LDON.  As most shaman know Q is a very efficient healing spell, and I can usually be the primary healer if the group composition warrents it.  Some of my friends and I try to go thru an entire adventure where i never cast Tnarg's and I am only healer.<br />
<br />
The other spectrum is Hard LDON or Vxed/Tipt where the mobs hit very hard and there is NO way a shaman can be the main healer and Q only provides a bit of buffer before a cleric heal or nasty death when someone gets agro.  It is almost impossible for a druid a main healer in the most difficult zones because their quick heals are a touch light and less mana efficient. Generally the cleric handles all healing duties on the main tank and I spot heal and Q peeps up.  Thus the cleric does the lion's share of the healing as is appropriate given their efficiency but they run dry on mana faster than most shaman.<br />
<br />
Just as an aside, the reason I am less than happy about the upcoming upgrade to Q is that it often overheals in its current state in hard content.  I use it before incoming on the main assist tank and to top off the other group members.  Now the proposed upgrade is better than nothing and it will affect healing, as will the improved regen, but in harder content its effect will not as much as you might expect (because of the overheals).<br />
<br />
But what I got out of my parses are that it is fairly reasonable to consider that my average fight only lasts 36 seconds.  The time spent casting malos and slow and maybe throwing out a nuke and taking a random canny4 when you are at full health and a canny5 whenever if refreshes pretty much takes the entire fight.  It is also important to be ready to spot heal and refresh buffs.  But we knew that already.<br />
<br />
The basic difference between a well equiped high aa shaman and a light aa shaman is pretty much about a nuke a fight if you are really fast and the ability to help out the cleric more if they need it.  So, an extra 800 damage a fight for 350 aa's and every focus item.....lovely.<br />
<br />
Every harder content group has a slower IMHO.  Just talking pure class balance now, with partial slows the shaman advantage narrows to almost nil and the slow section of the fight is about 25 seconds on average (assuming you bite into the 36 second fight).<br />
<br />
I've zapped my analysis in the original post because I need a bit more time to add in the effects of regen and anything else I may have forgotten.  Extrapolating data is not to be done lightly if you want to do it correctly.  But, the #'s of 7-15% of a groups damage and 9% on healing in hard content is probably about right.  Beastlords probably beat that and stack much better in raids.  Enchanters are situational on dps but bring a element of safety to a group that can be very valuable.<br />

---------------------------------------<br />
<br />
I think in harder content vxed, tipt, etc. the healing % I referenced is really about right considering my before mentioned overhealing on Q and the occasional quick spot heal.  You would be correct if there was a druid in the group instead of a cleric but at least in my experience the druids can not keep up on healing in these expeditions and in fact the cleric is even lagging.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i also though about the damage abit more, obviously a cleric healing wont be doing so much damage. so 20% would be the mark, of course there is  the fact some calss are dps and some arnt. i would like to see shaman as being  a good dps. not high, but decent. i would think being able to do 20% of mobs damage would be  about it on average. but as someone mention group make up type mobs killling etc all affect this.<br />
<br />
it actually very hard to use these parses (unless soe has an idea what % it wants classes to do) i just cant help feeling though that these % are low, and to acheive this you had to work alot harder than other classes.</div></div><hr />

4077 total damage per fight 15% of normal vxed mob since I'm guessing that vxed mobs have about 26k in hit points based on my nukes doing 3% damage..<br />
<br />
I have a super hard time swallowing the bolded line.  This is a huge stretch since it assumes that a) You *never* grouped with a Chanter and used their superior haste   -and-   b) All of the damage done to a mob was either your nukes or party melee with no procs.<br />
<br />
I would be real curious as to how you managed to put a value on FA.  That to me seems rather high.  You are definitely painting a very rosy picture to say that FA is giving your group 720 damage / fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Hail,<br />
<br />
First, the delivery of the raw data leaves something to be desired. ;) <br />
I recommend compartmentalizing different topics in different threads, so we can clearly see your point(s).  Right now in this format it is very confusing, and partially misleading.  Don't know if I can do any better, but I'll try.<br />
<br />
<br />
I would be real curious as to how you managed to put a value on FA.  That to me seems rather high.  You are definitely painting a very rosy picture to say that FA is giving your group 720 damage / fight.<br />
Let's break it down a bit, and JUST look at what Purdydog said about FA.<br />
<br />
Let's very conservatively guesstimate melees (w/o FA) doing 175dps (will vary by # of melees &amp; class of course) on a 36 second fight.  Melees being anyone swinging in battle, whether that's a pet or player.<br />
<br />
36 seconds x175dps = 6300 in damage per fight.  <br />
FA adds 140attack, which generally equates to a 10-20% increase in DPS, depending on who you ask.  We'll use 10, 15, and 20% for examples to display the low, medium, and high ends.<br />
<br />
175dps from melee (w/o FA) + 10% (w/ FA) would add 17.5dps.<br />
175dpsx15%=26.25dps boost because of FA.  <br />
Using 20% as a percentage damage increase from FA would add 35dps.  <br />
<br />
(10%) 17.5dps (due to FA)x36second fight=630 (FA added) damage.<br />
(15%)  26.25dpsx36second fight=945 extra points of damage because of FA.<br />
(20%) 35dpsx36second fight=1260 extra damage.<br />
<br />
So his 730 damage per fight from FA I can believe.  In fact for melee heavy adventure groups I would imagine this # is on the LOW side if the shaman is religious about keeping FA up on those who are swinging weapons.  175 melee dps can be cranked out by a single good rogue without FA w/ the right weapons &amp; AA's.  So melee damage increases from FA may actually be much higher than Purdy stated.  Would be interesting to review the existing FA parses to compare.<br />
<br />
Then again, consider the benefits of keeping FA on a super-whamodyne charm pet... ;) <br />
<br />
Lots of information buried in the work Purdy did, now we just have to extract it, valuate it, and then make some conclusions.  The only conclusion I have from my #'s is that I need to pay more attention to casting FA on high dps melees and scream louder for a longer duration/shorter recast delay (or a group version)! :D <br />

That *may* have been true back before everyone was at stat caps and you got to factor in the STR bonus as part of it.  Today?  Even a pre-elemental Shaman has capped STR with just Focus.  Heck, with Daiku and PE I can cap dang near *anyone*.<br />
<br />
140 ATK is no more than a 10% increase in ATK for most characters these days . . . let alone DPS.<br />
<br />
I can't buy it.  Not even for a dollar.</div></div><hr />

I don't mind you disagreeing.<br />
What I would love to see is some parses from your own groups Sudedor.<br />
What IS a good average melee DPS value for your groups without FA?<br />
Run the numbers again with FA on the melees.<br />
<br />
I agree some of what Purdy has posted may be unrealistic (especially the haste bit), but I don't think this particularly aspect (FA) is that far off.  If you use 250dps as a value for melees instead, then 10% increase in attack (generally 10 attack=~1% extra melee damage from what I've read, I'd love to see evidence otherwise) would add 25dps.  25 extra DPS on a 30 (not 36second) second mob fight would add 750 damage.  <br />
<br />
I think educated constructive criticism can be a great tool.  Purdy apparently put alot of work into this.  I recommend doing a little research of your own before callously trashing his (or anyone's) work.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">They aren't my numbers, I am not in a position to defend them because I don't have them.<br />
<br />
I'm not trashing anything, I am asking where the numbers came from.  I'm asking someone to show me the math.<br />
<br />
Saying that 140 ATK adds 15% DPS . . . where do you get that number?  Where does anyone ?  I've not seen it parsed, but if you have, please link it.<br />
<br />
It &quot;appears&quot; that the numbers are coming out of thin air.  I don't know that they are, but that is the appearance.  Perhaps 750 damage / mob is right, I don't know.  I question it.  I ask for how that was arrived at.  Since I don't have the data, all I can do is ask for it.  I feel I was very non-confrontational about the FA numbers.  I simply want to know where they come from.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I have a super hard time swallowing the bolded line. This is a huge stretch since it assumes that a) You *never* grouped with a Chanter and used their superior haste -and- b) All of the damage done to a mob was either your nukes or party melee with no procs.<br />
<br />
I would be real curious as to how you managed to put a value on FA. That to me seems rather high. You are definitely painting a very rosy picture to say that FA is giving your group 720 damage / fight.\<br />
-------------<br />
<br />
Well, without the extrapolation part of my original post which I deleted almost immediately because it wasn't ready yet (including the effects of the newer regen and Q, etc), you could not see my explanation of shaman haste nor of the definition of &quot;overall damage/healing&quot;.  Just another example of dealing with limited information and picking and chosing different paragraphs in a post.<br />
<br />
But, whatever, I did say that Shaman haste was almost without exception only used when enchanter haste expired (assuming that there was no enchanter in group).  In fact the entire damage/healing analysis was a &quot;best case&quot; scenario where I attempted to say that under premium &quot;Shaman&quot; circumstances that our healing was about 9% and damage output about 7-14%.<br />
<br />
Excluding enchanter pet group in this analysis as a comparison because it skews the #'s and is a abberation due to Sony re-tuning the content to allow charming, these points are what I consider to be relevant:<br />
<br />
a) Fights in harder content are indeed averaging about 35 seconds.  Of course, I just looked at a clock to verify this also.<br />
<br />
b) Slow portion of fights are about 28-30 seconds of the fight.  I did not affix a value on this - I just pointed out that with slow mitigation Shaman/Enchanter/Beastlord slows are very similar.  While I do feel that Shaman are the best slowers because of the combination of a slightly better percentage and lower resists because of malos, the inability to slow before MA engagement in the majority of the pulls partially negates that advantage.<br />
<br />
c) Because of the &quot;overhealing&quot; of Q and the weakness in our spot heals a hard working Shaman is only contributing about 9% of the total healing (and this is with the Cleric casting no Elixers).<br />
<br />
d) Total damage of shaman who is chain casting spear of torment (in addition to his/her other roles and indirect damage) is providing about 7-15% of total group dps. and much of that is dependant on whether shaman haste is used.<br />
<br />
e) The difference between a well equiped and high aa Shaman vs a normally equipped and low aa Shaman is about one spear of torment a fight (800 damage - taking into consideration focus items and resists).  This is, I am estimating, about 3% of a mobs total hps - hardly a big return on Shaman aa's and equipment.  If we get agro Shaman are pretty much toast no matter how many hps or aa's we have.<br />
<br />
I did not post specific suggestions about re-tuning Shaman, but maybe I should now.<br />
<br />
#1  First off, increasing Shaman nukes and lowering the casting times isn't going to make a dramatic difference in content balancing, but it will make a difference in Shaman DPS contribution within a group and more appropriately represent the difference what 300+ aa's and elemental+ gear should provide.  I think this is the #1 area that Sony should address.<br />
<br />
#2 Increase our indirect damage thru buffs and debuffs.  My only comment is that Shaman long duration buffs should not be a big part of our class balancing because we don't want to turn into a buff selling class that can not get a group.  It's the 15-30 min duration buffs will make or break the Shaman and our instant debuffs such as slow and cripple (hopefully a beefed up cripple that will be worth casting in a 35 second fight).<br />
<br />
#3 Healing does NOT have to be addressed necessarily.  It all depends what Sony wants to do with healing balance and what they do with #1 and #2 above.  Although I applauded Sony's beefing up of Q and regen it really did not make a big impact in harder content - maybe 1% in total Shaman healing (because of the overheal). The HOT changes improved us from being the God of normal LDON to being the Super-God of normal LDON. Woopie do.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Ok, I went to a more knowledgeable source with regards to ATK and DPS.  Rangers.<br />
<br />
Draw your own conclusions:<br />
<br />
<br />
Rangers used a player with 46% worn haste and a 1600 ATK rating unbuffed for their baseline parse.  The player had a DPS of 157.<br />
<br />
They buffed the player with VQ (basically 54% haste) and ATK buffs to give the test data an ATK of 1900.  The DPS on that case was 222.<br />
<br />
Just the 54% increase in DPS due to VQ would be more than 222.  Even if you assumed VQ only added 35% to DPS . . . a 300 ATK change only added 10 DPS.  How a buff of half that would add 25 DPS I can't even fathom.<br />
<br />
Once again, not my data, but data from Rangers, who would, I imagine, know a thing or two about DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Hail,<br />
Ok, I went to a more knowledgeable source with regards to ATK and DPS. <br />
Heh, after your post, I went and looked at the Ranger's Glade for a bit.<br />
Ranger post on Attack &amp; DPS (http://forums.interealms.com/ranger/showthread.php?threadid=35963&amp;highlight=attack+damage) <br />
Was very informative for me.  I would have never looked it up if it wasn't for this discussion.  So rep bump for you! :)   I think you can see where I got my 10atk=1% DPS, because many rangers were under the same impression, and it works as a good rule of thumb for many of them (non-uber).<br />
<br />
I'd still love to see some situations where the ONLY thing you changed is casting FA with a group &amp; see the overall change in DPS/total damage.<br />
<br />

Actually, I don't see any fizzle data in there at all, and with that many casts, there should be.</div></div><hr />
