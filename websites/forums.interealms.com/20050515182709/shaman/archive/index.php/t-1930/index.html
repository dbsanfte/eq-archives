<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Unfortunately, Everquest 2 featured technology rather than gameplay. When asked questions about corpse runs and other gameplayer-related items, the team ducked and focused more on how great the game looks. <br />
Using all sorts of graphical tricks, the game looks lightyears ahead of its predecessor. Using a totally new engine built from the ground up (not the same engine used for Star Wars Galaxies, even), the EQ2 team set out to make a beautiful upgrade worthy of the EQ name. <br />
<br />
All the materials use pixel shaders and bump-mapping, so things such as metallic armor have a glossy sheen to them. Due to multilayered texturing (a &quot;clean wall&quot; has four layers of grime, moisture, and dirt textures applied on it) walls look appropriately grimy without taxing resources. <br />
<br />
The characters are well-animated and are filled with all sorts of little details. Dragons have appropriately leathery skin, and watching it move around, I noticed how a part of its chest was heaving with every breath; a small detail that wasn't needed, but Sony Online Entertainment created it anyhow. <br />
<br />
The only gameplay detail we could dig out of the team was the character generation, in that you only create the character's look at first. Class is decided by the actions you take while doing newbie quests, so you literally create your class while you game as a newbie. <br />
<br />
Hopefully, we'll soon see actual gameplay, but for now, Everquest 2 is one of the prettiest MMORPGs our crusty jaded eyes have seen. <br />

Anyone have a link to the How-to-become-a-millionaire-before-SWG-and-EQ2-come-out website?  I've got me a job that's getting in the way of my fake lives!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I can see them wanting to not give away too much this early, primarily to cover their arses in case the public gets its hopes up and then has to be let down.  Beyond that, it's not wise business to give away your trade secrets.<br />
<br />
Anyway:<br />
The only gameplay detail we could dig out of the team was the character generation, in that you only create the character's look at first. Class is decided by the actions you take while doing newbie quests, so you literally create your class while you game as a newbie.<br />
<br />
This could be intriguing.  Personally, I know pretty much what class I want to be before creating a character, but this leaves it wide open for those who are less-decisive.<br />
<br />
All in all, I still am not sure if I would be eager to jump on EQ2.  The game looks spectacular, but if the rumors of anti-twink coding and non-global banks are true, I doubt I'll even bother.  I just hope they don't cut all support to EQ1.  I think they said they would still support EQ1, but I guarantee we won't be seeing much in the way of improbements once EQ2 goes live.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is the very reason I have no interest in EQ2, yet.<br />
Sure it looks all neat and dandy, but will the buggin thing work? And play correctly?<br />
<br />
So far .. it's all looks, exactly what SoL was.<br />
Honestly, who where plays with all the models on?<br />
<br />
Dunno abou yall, but every single one is 100% OFF and not just for lag reasons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Okay, pardon my bitching, but VI can go screw themselves if they think I am going to play EQ2 if they can't be bothered to transfer characters.  Yes, I know they're probably tired of the same game (and probably the same names of certain buttheads that always get petitioned), but if they can't see the value of the hundreds of DAYS played, I have no interest in enriching them further.  A switch like this in large part ignores the huge time investment from the original EQ players.<br />
<br />
I really hope they rethink their position a bit.  We'll see.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rafeeky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Agree with guice.<br />
<br />
Plus I think the screenies are modified.  Luclin mobs dont look like the prescreenies that I saw before the expansion was released. But then again this could be due to medium graphics card.  I believe this will be the same way. Blocky hands on generic mobs etc but nice work on boss mobs etc.<br />
<br />
I really can't imagine the system that will be required when it goes live with graphics like that.  If Luclin in 512.....I can't really afford to upgrade to 1gig memory as it is still very expensive past 512mb.  Plus motherboard doesn't allow it :( . Of course this is coming from a guy who likes RPG text games or similiar.<br />
<br />
A small concern, since class isn't selected at start, what if you do the wrong quests or events that turn you into something you dont wanna be.  Then you will have to start over to make sure you dont end up as a ranger instead of a shaman ;) .  As ambigious as EQ 1 was starting out - look at the manual - I don't expect much from EQ 2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The value of any trip lies in the journey, not the destination.<br />
<br />
Yes, I value Khallin.  I have 186 (or so) days of playtime, over the past two and a half years, invested.  The things I value are the memories of what I've done during that time - whether it was making my own set of banded armor, helping friends finish epics, or making 60th.  There will come a time when this game will end - whether you got tired of it pre-Kunark, or whether you are still playing in xx years when VI turns off the switch, after combining the last few players onto one server.  It will end, and your random collection of data will be flushed.<br />
<br />
Games should be about having fun while you play them.  Are you pissed at VI because you couldn't transfer in your characters from the Pool of Radiance?  Or perhaps because you can't take your shaman over to Star Wars?  Then why be pissed because they won't let you take it to EQ 2?</div></div><hr />

Absolutely true.<br />
<br />
I don't really know if I would even go to EQ2, but I would look at it probably the same way I did DAOC.  Something different yet similar.  I shudder at the thought of leveling up all over again lol, but if its sufficiently entertaining along the way it will be worth it, just like it was in EQ now.<br />
<br />
It does sound interesting though, although I wouldn't like the bank thing.</div></div><hr />

Well there are games out that have magnitude better graphics than that run with high graphics very fast.  EQ just shows its age with its graphics engine with all these additions.  Not a prime example but DAoC run high res actually looks good.  Then of course you can look at the FPS games and such release lately...  We shall see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jeraem Gaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I dont care much about the graphics this early either. I dont buy a game based on how it looks, most of them look pretty good in this day and age. I want to hear ALOT more about game play issues before I'd consider eq2 over all the competition that will be on the shelves by time it comes out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">&quot;Honestly, who where plays with all the models on?&quot;<br />
<br />
I do.  Have had them all on since Day 1, and have no urge to go back to the bland, cartoony stick figures that were the old models.<br />
<br />
Lotsa Luclin bashing out there (which still boggles my mind), but you won't hear it from my corner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">i aint gonna play eq2 cause well, everquest is enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Nowadays it is hard to &quot;invent&quot; something new, as someone somewhere already has probably done it. So it is with EQ2, from the feature list posted by them, almost 90% was same as in other games (mostly AC, some AO'ish thingies). Sad though is how Verant claims of &quot;new features invented by them&quot; heh..<br />
<br />
Despite some of the neat things, the game will be in general the same. Same group-only oriented game, where only some classes have the power to do anything on their own, and most classes can't get a jack worth of XP unless they are grouped. EQ sucks in this area already big time, why would I want to put up with that stupidity once more in newer game. Game will in the end be the same campfest that it is now, not as bad as it is now, but still. The whole frikkin' concept of the game caters specifically for creating so-called &quot;uberguilds&quot;, which all in all consist of people, who have no or not many RL responsibilities and can waste more time playing the game then someone else does. All in all the so-called &quot;uberguild&quot; isn't bad as such, because those who know more can help others to know more, but often the twisted way of thinking &quot;we're so good, because we have no life and are so 'uber' in this game&quot; gets on the way.<br />
<br />
These non-global banks will in a long run ensure, that some areas will become super laggy, while some areas will be very thinned out. Especially the lack of a global bank sucks when you do some quest heck knows where, then need to finish it and at the bank you realise, that you forgot some little but super needed gizmo in your old bank, some thousand miles away. Wee, &quot;fun&quot;, go back to get it.<br />
<br />
Weapon decay sucks, if it will be implemented like in DAoC/UO. It is logical in a way indeed, but NOT when your weapon loses some 10% of condition after some 30 minutes of gameplay. Imagine questing for some mean weapon, spending countless hours on it, many days, then getting it, then using it and after 2-3 days of active use the weapon is screwed up (as it is now in DAoC). What, that's fun in Verant's eyes? I don't mind when some stupid FS weapon decays away, but I sure as hell mind when my epic weapon can decay like a common crap on sale everywhere.<br />
<br />
The easiest way would be to remove the decay, but leave in the &quot;anti-twink&quot; code, i.e. the items have some certain level (or stats) restrictions, and before one reaches that level, they can't even equip/wield that item. Does it stop twinking? Not really, as you can always twink the char with cash, and get the best gear for the level, but it will alleviate the twinking a bit.<br />
<br />
All in all, while it will have some different features from current EQ, which may make it better then this old EQ, it definately hasn't got anything in it, which would make me want to play EQ2 over the SWG and AC2. Despite these little things, it's still the same rotten EQ as it is now. Heck I only play it still to finish my epic and get a spot (hopefully) in SWG, after that, to blazes with it, I can't care less what happens to it, I'll cancel the account anyway.</div></div><hr />

A level 25 warrior in full Crafted isn't a twink; he's well-dressed. A level 25 warrior in full Cobalt is a twink. If EQ2 is to be an attempt to resurrect the &quot;old-school&quot; world of pre-Kunark EQ, they will have to heavily implement level restrictions, etc. to maintain that appeal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its a different game with a different class structure with a different class/skill development model. Why on earth would it be possible to transfer an EQ1 character?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>svaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Hey guys...  Just a little tidbit.  I think that you will find that the new engine will perform MUCH better, with WAY more detail than the old one.  This old engine that EQ is utilizing was not really developed around the concept of surviving this long.  Alot of the code is going to be utilizing 'yesterdays' ideas about 3d rendering and such.  I've seen demos on my geforce4 that are a step shy of photorealisim, and they dont even drag the system down, yet I still get the occasional drag-a$$-choppy effect SOLOING in EQ.<br />
<br />
   By the time that EQ2 comes out, 512 to 1gig of ram in a machine will be the de-facto standard.  512meg is already fairly standard amongst computer game freaks.<br />
<br />
    In addition, technology basically doubles every 18 months.  Think about this, the run-of-the-mill system in late 2003 will have at LEAST a 2.5ghz processor, at LEAST 512m ram, and at LEAST a geforce3/4 equivillant.<br />
<br />
     Lastly, for all you people whining about upgrading.... Computers are typically depricated after 2 years anyway.  Suck it up, spend $1200.00 on a new one, because you are missing so much other stuff besides Everquest.<br />

You sound like you expect people to disagree with that statement.<br />
<br />
Seriously though, I hated leveling up, I hated being a newbie scraping up coppers for a backpack...so, no EQ2 for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Yeah, we all hated it at the time, but I still look back most fondly on those first moments.<br />
<br />
The game was just so different than anything else, I just couldn't help but love it even tho I didn't know what I was doing. I still remember sitting in Halas in my leather armor as my first warrior when a guy walked up in nearly full bronze and 2 mino axes. People were amazed. I remember one guy was like &quot;metal armor!!!&quot; Seriously, like 20-25 people gathered around, and we sat, like theatre in the round, as this guy talked about the &quot;wicked dungeon of Najena.&quot; Seriously, some of the charm was lost to me when just about everything was known, itemized and quantified. I'll never forget things like looting my first mammoth cloak on accident, since I hadn't even heard of it.<br />
<br />
I'd like a new setting just for the explorer in me, but I just don't think I have it in me to go through all this again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
VI's track record has been daziling is &quot;awesome&quot; graphics and slacking in back end development.<br />
<br />
I think the main reason some people ( like myself ) are still bashing this is cause of the Interview's one statement: <br />
Unfortunately, Everquest 2 featured technology rather than gameplay. When asked questions about corpse runs and other gameplayer-related items, the team ducked and focused more on how great the game looks.<br />
<br />
If you read between the lines, it shows that VI doesn't have any set game play design down! Shoot, that's normally the first thing you create. Then place the eye candy around it. VI &quot;doesn't seem&quot; to have don that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">pretty graphics would normally be a good way to attract people to your game, but here it sounds like it's a bad thing :) good graphics doesnt make a game, but it doesnt make a game bad either.<br />
<br />
i'm not saying the game gonna be awesome, i just think it funny people are saying nuh uh! no way i'm gonna try it because of xxx thingy, like we're discussing a patch msg from test 2 days before patchday :)</div></div><hr />
