<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tekish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I realize answers will be biased here towards shamans and that's ok, I just want to maybe get some different views. :D<br />
<br />
Currently I have a lvl 25 shaman and a lvl 13 enchanter. My bro just made a Beastlord and got him up to lvl 15 and I'm trying to decide which char to play w/ him.<br />
<br />
So far I just haven't been to happy w/ my shaman, im hoping after I get quickness and first pet things will start to look up.<br />
<br />
I want a character that: <br />
a) Is easy to find a group with. <br />
b) Does not have much down time when he solo's<br />
c) I love reading how shaman's can solo the big game stuff. e.g. Tantor and some of the dragons<br />
..hehe, I'm not asking much :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">a) Shaman :)<br />
b) Shaman :)<br />
c) My friend can do that he's 60 ;)<br />
<br />
Who wants to play a stinky old enchanter anyways?<br />
<br />
After 24 (Canni 1 w00t) Shamans keep getting better and more fun, don't worry :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">a) shaman<br />
b) shaman<br />
c) shaman<br />
<br />
<br />
Dat was easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Bah, idea KSer! :p<br />
<br />
hmm sig isn't working</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">No shaman has soloed Tantor that I've heard of.  Bards were doing this for a while by using some charm bug to make Tantor fight WW dragons and wurms.  Actually, bard + beastlord is probably pretty fun to play.  Necro would be good too, but most effective in boring outdoor zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Verata</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">OK, rather than give you a biased account, cough cough<br />
I am 51 shaman, my wife is 51 enchanter.<br />
<br />
The advantage to the shaman would be healing abilities as well as general utility.<br />
IMO shaman and enchanter are very similar classes to play, in so far as you support others doing damage, you have to be aware of adds, and you keep certain buffs on your party mates.<br />
<br />
The problem i think you would run into is that if you are duoing, you need healing, so the clear advantage is for shaman there.<br />
If you 2 are finding groups... shrug, if you pick chanter, you always need a healer in your group, so that is one spot that will always be needed.  If you were shaman, you fill that role, and just add 4 melees, or whatever.<br />
<br />
The advantage of the chanter is that more is possible.  Adds are controlled without ghetto mez (root) and group effieciency is more helped by a chanter than by a shaman. <br />
<br />
So, in summary,  IF duo, shaman.  If grouping, shaman still more usefull than chanter, but only slightly</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as getting quickness and tagars insects making things start to look up, yeah... I just got 29 last night, quickness is awesome, I always have it up now :)<br />
Tagars insects has been resisted once since ive had it (4 orange into 29 now) and we were fighting red con mobs. I think at lvl 29 a shaman really starts to come into his own and starts getting a feel for what he's gonna do for the rest of his life :)<br />
Good luck! :)</div></div><hr />
