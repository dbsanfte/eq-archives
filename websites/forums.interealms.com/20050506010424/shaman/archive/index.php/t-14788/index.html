<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>pwredby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is what I have right now:<br />
<br />
run 3<br />
metabolism 3<br />
regen 3<br />
<br />
spell casting reinforcement 3<br />
spell casting mastery 3<br />
natural durability 3<br />
combat agility 3<br />
mental clarity 3<br />
healing gift 3<br />
spell casting fury 2<br />
<br />
mgb<br />
cann5<br />
spell casting reinforcement mastery<br />
quick buff 1<br />
<br />
planar power 1<br />
<br />
advance healing gift 3<br />
lightning reflexes 5<br />
radiant cure 1<br />
spirit call 1<br />
viral paralysis 1<br />
<br />
Now the question is what would you put in next?<br />
What I'm thinking is doing Quick buff 2 (I have a haste of mithaniel item).<br />
Then healing adept 3 and advance healing adept.<br />
<br />
Anyone know anything about channel focus? any good?<br />
<br />
What's your take on combat stability? does it just take 10percent off the dmg you take? like if u get hit for 500, does it lower the dmg down to 450?<br />
<br />
I'm getting kinda frustrated w/ the way sony designed the shaman aa's there's really nothing good to put in except resist once I get around 200aa's. Which will probably cause me to quit doing aa's and just log in for raids. Any information or suggestions would be great. Outside of the aa's I am thinking of getting anything else I should get?<br />
<br />
lvl 65<br />
Current HP: 3500<br />
Current Mana: 4000<br />
AC: 1050<br />
other stats that matters: 245 Sta, 237wis.<br />
<br />
Another question is can we crit heal off Mending of Kregg (2k CH)?<br />
I have never seen it happen so just wondering.<br />
<br />
Edit: yup meant to put combat agility =) thx.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>xDeMeNtiAx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">no CH, and %heals like kragg's will not critical</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>pwredby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That sucks =( I see clerics do those 15k heals all the time /sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Galamann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, if you're really bored of AAs, you can always do quests.  My assumption is that if you have 3500 hps, you are near the elemental planes.  There are countless quests to do that are fun and rewarding such as the earing quest.<br />
<br />
First off, if you are in the elemental planes, get Radiant Cure 3.  You need it for exp groups in PoE and it's very useful everywhere else.<br />
<br />
I really enjoy ID5. There's nothing better than HoH mobs missing me twice then hitting me for in the mid 100's twice. I love it so much and don't regret it.  Healing adept is also very helpful. However, I do like gift better than adept. But, it's still very useful. If you use kragg's alot, get it. With all level you do 1549 heal instead of 1300. 250 might not seem like alot, but it does help. And it's an extra 500 when you crit.<br />
<br />
SCF is good if you are into nuking in exp groups. I enjoy it. Every single level helps and even though it's 9 points<br />
<br />
Planar Power 5 would also be a good way to go. Each level adds about 15 more hps.  It's not alot of hps total, but it sure does help.<br />
<br />
I have no idea on channeling focus, i still don't have that and SCR3.<br />
<br />
I can't tell you which you should go for first, it's truely all your decision.  When i was deciding what AAs i needed i always asked myself &quot; what AAs can i get to improve my performance on raids.&quot; If you get hit alot and almost die, get ID5. If you heal alot and what tnarg's to be stronger, get adept. If you want to be able to nuke more, get SCF. If you are in the elemental planes, GET RADIANT CURE!<br />
<br />
Good luck to you and your guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wildane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, until a couple of days ago, I was under the impression that Kragg's Mending could crit, since I've seen cleric CH's crit and thought ours was flagged as a CH.  But, Kragg's Mending is a percent heal (1950 or 75%) and as such, it cannot crit.<br />
<br />
About the AA, that really depends on how you play.  Personally, I'm pushing towards defensive AA since I seem to get smacked around more than I heal folks (which is not to say I don't heal when needed, but I get a lot of aggro ;)).  Plus, healing AA only affect one of our heals, Tnarg's.  Not saying it's not good to have healing adept and advanced healing adept but just think about how often you heal compared to how often you get aggro from debuffing and such.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wildane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">no CH, and %heals like kragg's will not critical<br />
Cleric complete heals DO crit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">CH's do, %CH's don't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You listed combat stability but I am assuming you really meant combat agility.  That being said, you should do CS3 and ID5, they're great AAs.  Also, finish up RC3 and QB2 or 3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">what you said is pretty much where I'd head.  I hit 147 myself last night, and though I've spent them a little different, within the next 50 AA or so I imagine our trees will be identical.  <br />
<br />
quick2, all of adept, finish spirit call, radiant to 2 or 3.... just save up a few points and click whatever looks good at the moment</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'd agree with quickbuff2 first at least. <br />
<br />
I put off buying qb2 for a long time, I've had a haste of mith item for 5 months or so now, but once I bought it I realise I should have done so much sooner..<br />
<br />
Very nice to have 45% beneficial haste with no cleric about. 3.3 second unbuffed Q is very useful ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">yes, Quick buff 2 must have, it is one of best aa!!<br />
<br />
after that, try Spiritcaller 3, combat stability 3, and ID5, also channel focus 3 is useful too, and RC3; after that the rest aa is junk, like crit nuke, heal, stat etc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">In this order:<br />
RC1<br />
QB2<br />
Pet Control<br />
RC2<br />
SCFury3<br />
<br />
then pretty much anything else you do is gravy.<br />
RC1 is totally badass and you'll love it in so many situations.  You can get by without RC2 for a while tho most likely.<br />
QB2 is a must have.  Buff haste is extremely nice, and stacks with other haste items.  Get a spell haste item.  I have an 18% haste mask from VT that stacks nicely and gives me a 3.4 second Quiescence.  With a cleric haste buff it's capped at 3.0 seconds.  <br />
Pet control is one of those AA's that everyone underestimates.  It's lovely being able to have dogdog up and having total control over him.  You'll love it I am positive. <br />
Spell Casting Fury . . . well you already did lvl 2, might as well go for the max crits!  I actually got the first level of PoP fury as well . . . fun fun fun.</div></div><hr />
