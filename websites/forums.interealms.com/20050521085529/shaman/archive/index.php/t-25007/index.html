<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cradossk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Its felt playing a Shaman and not Cannabilizing for more mana so far but I had just assumed without scouring the list of spells that it was coming at some point. I don't see it though and I guess that's a bit sad. No root and no cannibalize and no pet this time around.  I'm hopeful they could change that in future patches or post 50 spells but those were pretty key parts of the Shaman IMHO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">/agree..   But we do get Enchanter's Rune spells with no regent required..</div></div><hr />

Remember, EQ2 is *not* EQ1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah, cannot compare the two games spells by spell or skill by skill.<br />
<br />
The lines are blurred.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Nope, you cannot compare at all.<br />
<br />
Shaman are very balanced so far in EQ2.  We are capable of performing our primary function and bring useful and desired utility to a group.</div></div><hr />

And we get to play main healer! :)  I have had zero problems playing main healer up through level 18 now and I primarilly have my duo brawler partner tanking when we form groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cradossk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I guess having not played EQ for a couple years I do kind of miss those elements to the class.  I think saying you can't compare EQ and EQ2 is kind of a cop out really and that they do bear comparison. One is the sequel after all. I understand they needed to play with classes and I certainly don't feel weak or underpowered out there. I just miss a few Shaman elements from EQ1.  To be honest with run, cannibalize, root and a pet we would be pretty over powered.</div></div><hr />

A cop out, to what?  EQ2 is a sequel yes but mainly in class structure and storyline, not mechanics - think of it as an evolution not just a sequel.  The gameplay and mechanics are much much different so comparing them directly isn't really useful.  You can do it by stating things like &quot;Shaman don't have root, pet, etc&quot; but our abilities in EQ2 are based on a different game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ask yourself if you would miss those elements had you not played EQLive.  I'd bet the answer is no.<br />
<br />
However, I think we do get a root at higher levels, or something along those lines, maybe it's just a snare.  We also get a &quot;pet&quot; of sorts, and this pet casts beneficial spells on our party, though it does not move or fight.  Canni isn't something I find myself needing given the way mana works, and besides, I get to chat with my party now!<br />
<br />
EQ2 Shaman are certainly more desireable in a group and more fun to play than EQLive Shaman.</div></div><hr />
