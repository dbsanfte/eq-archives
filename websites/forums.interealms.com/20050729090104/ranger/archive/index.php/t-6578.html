<br />
I absolutly hate it in game when people I dont know come up and inspect me. I allways feel that they are invading my privacy. I get an uneasy feeling. It really urks me when nothing is said. They run up IN MY FACE and inspect. Not even a &quot;stealth inspect&quot; from behind or the side.  <br />
<br />
On the other hand. As soon as I get a new piece of equipment the 1st thing I do is go and Update my magelo profile. Then when I post on message boards like this. I have my magelo profile in my sig thats saying &quot;hey look at me&quot;. And i have no problems with it being there. <br />
<br />
Thinking about it, Im still uneasy about people looking in game.but I will do my best to keep from getting &quot;upset&quot;. Dont mind me, just ranting/venting/mumbling.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think the main thing is that in game it's so much more personal...almost like someone walked up to you and grabbed your T-shirt or pants to look at labels.<br />
<br />
For me, I don't mind if someone inspects me, but common courtesy is all I ask for.  Is it really so hard to type, /say May I inspect you?</div></div><hr />

Locate the line that says 'Showinspectmessage=TRUE'<br />

Close the file, click 'Yes' when asked if you would like to save the changes you made. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anina_RN</div><div class="date">07-24-2002, 04:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hate that too...<br />
<br />
But what I hate more is when some half dressed newbie does it then says 'what r the stats on ur weapons', or 'can i see ur (insert piece of equipment)'.<br />
<br />
Or... When said newbie just sits down in my face and doesn't inspect or say anything...<br />
<br />
Freaks me out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On the other hand, If I'm shopping / banking / checking critter con, and accidentally click someone, I'm immediately saying &quot;Oops sorry didn't mean to inspect ya.&quot;<br />
<br />
They had a skill in Asheron's Call that would let you conceal all that info when folks tried to scope you out. Wish they did in EQ.<br />

That too is located in the ini file. Its wonder that id did know you could disables the messaeg of pople inspecting you while i did know thaty I could disable the ability for ME to inspect others(assidentaly or intentionally)</div></div><hr />

I was very happy to learn that trick myself as on raids I somehow always managed to inspect the guy sitting behind me while trying to con the mob in front of me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;If you are inspecting me without permission GOOD FOR YOU. Im sick of weenies who blieve, in defiance of reason, that their gear is private information.  Whining twits.&quot;<br />
<br />
While I might have put it a bit more diplomatically, inspects never bother me........the game of 20 questions that sometimes follows is can be annoying as hell, but on the whole, if someone wants to sneak a peak...especially another ranger...have at it.</div></div><hr />

IT LOOKS GOOD DAMNIT!!! =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
/em covers his slots, please ask next time.<br />

It doesn't do anything but let them know I'm not happy about being ninja-inspected.  I think I'll go change that ini line now, thanks for the tip!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myrea</div><div class="date">08-16-2002, 11:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't usually inspect people without permission, but occasionally I will - especially someone who /cons green to me but looks better equipped. That way I can make a mental Twink/non-Twink note and go about my business. I never say anything, unless it's a fellow Ranger and I want to go get one of whatever they have for myself. <br />
<br />
I don't generally mind if someone inspects me, as long as they're silent about it. Even if they want to admire my equipment and ask about it, I'm usually OK. Of course, I'm in mental RP mode unless I'm actively trying to market something, so it doesn't do them any good to ask about stats and things. They either have fun role-playing with me over it, or they get frustrated and leave. What bothers me is when they begin begging for items immediately aftewards - or when I get up and move, and they continue following me around inspecting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kinolen</div><div class="date">08-16-2002, 01:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Usually the only times I inspect without permission is if I'm...<br />
<br />
A) Looking to give free gear away to lower levels, I'd prefer to give it to non-twinks.  Asking them if they mind you inspecting them would let them know that maybe they should unequip whatever uber gear they have to try to get some free stuff.<br />
<br />
B) Someone inspects me first without asking.  Generally, if some just runs up and inspects me, especially 50+ people, I'll immediately inspect them back.<br />
<br />
What really annoys me is when people run up to me inspect me, and then ask to buy equipment piece xx that I'm current using.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tymoria Brightblade</div><div class="date">08-18-2002, 10:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ya know, I just had two run ins with that in the same hour lol<br />
<br />
Soandso is inspecting you<br />
Want to trade to upgrade those legs?<br />
<br />
nope, thanks, but if I had wanted to upgrade or trade, I probably would have gone /trader 8o)<br />
<br />
oh, but these are way better than what you have on. . . <br />
<br />
Yeah? Well these arent my regular legs either, I use &quot;these&quot; legs for battle and the ones I have on now are for look<br />
<br />
oh! well then! you already have better lol<br />
<br />
yup!<br />
<br />
Next incedent got ugly.....<br />
<br />
Soandso is inspecting you (and is also so close to my face I saw through her head)<br />
<br />
http://www.angelfire.com/rpg2/tymoriaspics/alttrade.jpg<br />
<br />
Now I'm sorry, but really, if I DID want to trade, I would be in the bazaar trading, not standing here with the durn thing equiped.  I have the LSoEE, a Lupine and a Defiance in case I'm in a lupine non-friendly area, at level 46 I'm thinkin thats plenty of weaponry for me;)  I had a centi, upgraded, she had a realy neat weapon on top of that? good for her, it ought to make the next trade easier for her.<br />
<br />
I have gotten to the point where I dont mind random inspects so much as I used to, but this is the stuff that makes it so irritating.  people think they know just how to get you to trade, this girl forced a trade window up on me twice in a row, I canceled both times right away, 'cause I already said NO.  No means no people RAR :D<br />
<br />
It's this sort of stuff that makes me that much more appreciative when people DO ask ahead of time, because then I know they probably arent trying to force some garbage trade on me before I can think about it too long.  I also ask before I inspect (insect  is off at all other times) because in my mind it's just polite to do so.  Some people care, some dont /shrug  it's all in how the inspect gets played after it happens that determines if somebody will mind or not really.</div></div><hr />

Now I know how to annoy Anina. <br />

I've got something to do when I'm bored now!</div></div><hr />

AKA They thought you looked cool. Now I agree having a lvl 3 or 4 newbie asking you all these questions is annoying... but... I dunno... thats my rant..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arkus</div><div class="date">08-19-2002, 01:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is just rude.  I do not play the game to be bothered by anyone.  I don't send tells or inspect random strangers and I expect the same treatment.  As far as being able to tun the messages on and off, well that can be done.  But it is sad that the onus is on the person minding their own business rather than on the rude little punk.  Why do I have to go out of &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; way to avoid these people?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eldril Mystwalker</div><div class="date">08-19-2002, 07:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I cant Win. <br />
<br />
Now with inspect messages off.... and with that, Now I have a feeling of paranoia...&quot;is this goup checking me out?&quot; crosses my mind as Im hangin out in nexus or bazaar. I think I'll turn the messages back on and deal with that. Again, dont mind me, Im just bored and waiting to go home from work..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eldowin</div><div class="date">08-21-2002, 03:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">heh I take action when people inspect me, basically if it isn't someone I know, or have at least grouped with on more than one occaision and they inspect me, I will ussually inspect them for about half a second to make sure they don't have a fungi and attack, or just move away depending on whether I'm in shape for a fight.<br />
<br />
On the other hand if the person is not in pvp range to me, and isn't someone I know has vendetta (probably guild-wise) against me, then I let em go ahead, and just for curiosity's sake I inspect them back.<br />
<br />
But I suppose my position is a little different because when a person inspects you and you don't know them then 99% of the time they are sizing you up, hence why I take initiative and attack them first, or run.<br />
<br />
oh yeah and I hate having peopel come up and try to buy my gear, especially since they rarely even give an even trade, let alone something I would give up an active piece of gear for. When I first bought a centi LS I was so proud, within 5minutes someone offers me 1k for it... when I got my wurmy I was even prouder, someone offers me a glowing black sword for it insisting it is a fair trade, and bugging me about it for several minutes.</div></div><hr />
