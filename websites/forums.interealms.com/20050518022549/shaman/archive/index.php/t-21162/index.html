<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thornebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I like to Solo in Nadox, I make a fair amount of cash and even if most mobs there are light blue to me. With 100 percent going to AA exp I also get about 1 percent AA a kill.<br />
<br />
With reading that Nadox was on this list for the New Hot Spot Zones and added EXP I thought I would go there and check it out yesterday.<br />
<br />
Well I got the Same amount of EXP as I did before the patch. And my spells seem to get interupted a lot more then normal while melee'ing.<br />
<br />
I guess the question is. Is the New Hot Spots for lvl20 - 50 only? or nor no bonus if not in a group? the patch did not take hold in that zone? I read the patch message wrong? or some other reason?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It may be just like it is in shops in RL: they announce that they have crazy sales, -50% off of everything! And then they just put new price tags on the items, showing some &quot;old&quot; bogus price, and the current price below it as a &quot;new, better one&quot; :) Who know, maybe they just pulled the leg of players just to get them move, without actually doing anything..<br />
<br />
Or, they increased it, but very very little. Again, like in shops: &quot;Item A no longer costs $100, we adjusted our prices and now it's whopping $99.98, come and see our crazy low prices!&quot; Same in the zone, added some miniscule amount, but screamed out loud about it :)<br />
<br />
In both cases, I wouldn't be surprised at all, if this was the case. Not sure whether the XP somewhere would be/could be limited based on the char level. I think someone in some thread parsed the XP and there was a chance, but it wasn't anything worth to scream about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gilador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I just posted this to the 'Patch message' thread:<br />
<br />
I'm the author of EQ Companion. One of the new features I have added to the yet-to-be-released 0.795 version is experience tracking. It shows how much experience you are getting per hour and how much experience you gain per mob.<br />
<br />
I just happened to hunt in Torgiran mines the night before the patch and I was parsing my experience gain. I was getting 1.3% AA per kill then on average.<br />
<br />
Tonight after the patch I was getting 1.52% AA per kill killing the same mobs (I did not get any named mobs either night).<br />
<br />
Looks like they increased the ZEM by 17% at least in Torgiran mines.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thornebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">well I do know that a friend of mine went to MM which is also on the list of Hot Spots. His char was some where around lvl20 and got 1 lvl in 30 mins with 3 deaths.<br />
<br />
also could these hots spots exp be reg exp only?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>jraven1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I tried some Nadox killing last night and didn't really notice an increase either. It certainly wasn't anything comparable to Paludal vs another newbie zone. Still only 1% AA per kill and sometimes with rounding I'd bump up to 2%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">might be regular xp only.. hmm wonder what about leadership..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Took my cleric to gunthak last night and the xp seemed decent, probably cuz a 65 druid friend pulled a huge train and the cleric ae'd it. GOnna try it again today, without the druid ae.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Went out to Gunthak with my BL I was PL... xp was 1% with the rounding 2% now and again.  Seemed kinda crappy.  Buddy came with me for a bit in there also and we commented how bad it was.  He went to Dulak after and said the same thing that it was crap xp.<br />
<br />
Just because they upped the xp doesnt mean it's good :)  I really think they were horrid xp before and they are horrid xp now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">My guild took a group of low 30s/high 20s alts to Splitpaw.  I have grouped there before at that level, and I didn't notice any difference.  I'm sure they did raise the exp slightly, but calling it &quot;Paludal-level&quot; exp is certainly an overstatement on their part.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hot Spots <br />
----------------------- <br />
Try out the new Hot Spot zones which give a boost to Experience while adventuring in them, in a similar manner to Paludal Caverns. The current Hot Spots are: <br />
<br />
<br />
I think this was drawn up by lawyers.... &quot;in a similar manner to Paludal Caverns.&quot; As in... Paludal Caverns got an xp modifier... other zones got an experience modifier.  SOE is giggling while they explain &quot;Well they both have ZEM... just one isnt quite as high as the other.  But we didnt &quot;lie&quot; did we?&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>temuchintehkhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'm sure the ZEM is higher... but you're not going to get PoP elemental exp in nadox...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">A rather interesting &quot;thing&quot; happened last night in Gunthak. Was playing my necro, level 44, in a nice little quiet spot that was giving 1-2% xp per mob. Near ding (95+) a new mob spawned in the area. Never, never has anything spawned here (or the next 2 spots ... as this story will note) in tons of time spent here when I was leveling my shaman.<br />
<br />
It was a standard zone luggald model called a luggald trainer. Same con and difficulty level ... but it gave out 3% xp. This same mob spawned in 3 separate but close locations one after the other (kill one, other spawned a little bit away.) Killing the first 2 I dinged 45 and a box popped up saying: &quot;Congratulations on reaching Level 45. For better experience you should visit Torg Mines.&quot; (Something to that effect.)<br />
<br />
I killed the next &quot;new&quot; spawn and received 3% straight xp again. I stayed there, because the mobs are fast to kill and easy 1% still. These luggalds never spawned again. I took my necro to 46 here just to test and see if it would happen again as I got close to the new level. It didn't.<br />
<br />
It was an interesting break in the camp monotony, as well as a nice quick 9% xp. I am going to check out TMines today and see what the effect is at 46.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Rgallnor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Im assuming that Nadox only has a great xp mod for lvls 50-55 as stated in the patch.  55-60 was Hates Fury.  That was the highest modification.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Grafsha,<br />
<br />
That is the most bizzare thing I have heard of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Piwacket</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">They said to keep an eye out for hints where the zones are with exp boosted. and I think you will get more exp boost if you are in a full group. Sony wants people to play with others hehe.<br />
Piwacket Magicat =^.^=</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Im almost certain that the exp mods are directly tied to a characters level.<br />
<br />
I took my level 44 Wizard to Dulak.  Was getting half a blue per kill on the Broken Skull Scouts right at the zoneline.  Quads were generating just under 2 blues per kill.  Needless to say I made level 45 in about 40 minutes (from just over one yelow into 44).  <br />
<br />
When I dinged 45 I got a pop up box that said &quot;grats on 45, go try Torrigan Mines as thats the hotsport for 45-50 folks.&quot;  My next single generated barely a sliver of blue exp.  My next quad was just over half a blue.  Thinking that I needed higher level stuff in the same zone, I headed further in and did some 'root n' shoot'.  Still, exp was minor at best.  I did get about a quarter of a blue for a yellow con that a druid keep rooted for me.<br />
<br />
Since Torrigan was really close, I popped in to see how things went there.  First kill....half a blue.  Every kill of a blue con mob there....half a blue.<br />
<br />
Although Im kinda miffed about it, this is a GREAT way to fend off the bottom feeders.  To get the good exp you are forced to go to zones that are more age appropriate for you.  Although some of the boats in Dulak were still dark blue to me all the way to 62..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Me and a friend took our usual team to Dulak to see what it was like now. We had been grouping in Overthere and then Dreadlands - 40 enchanter, 40 cleric, 37 warrior. The experience in Dulak was about the same as Dreadlands. Slightly more per kill, but mobs hit harder and had more HP, so over time worked out about the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Just happened to be PLing a chanter at the time that this hot spot thing came out.  He was level 18 when it was implemented.  I kept him in paludal till 22 then brought him over to Mistmore.  Right now, about four hours after I hit Mistmore, he's level 29.  Getting about 7% per red con kill solo.  Doing it now with a 47 druid ds and a 65 cleric reverse ds.  I'm not great at three boxing it, and as such, there have been alot of mobs that i've killed that for whatever reason the chanter didn't get the exp for, but the exp has been great.  I'm sitting around the castle area rigtht now and everything there is still deep red at 29.  <br />
<br />
Oh, when I dinged 20, I got a popup window that suggested I try out mistmore castle and it told me how to get there from PoK.  Then, when I dinged 25 it reminded me of Mistmore and how to get there.  I'm going to hit 30 there and then see how much the exp drops off. <br />
<br />
I've spent a bit of time in Mistmore before messing around with my shaman, but now enough to know exactly what is there and what isn't normally there.  There seems to be a few named mobs there that I haven't seen before, and there is a NPC at the entrance that I never saw before.  It has been a while since I've been there, but wondering about them.  Nothing that I've killed has dropped anything extra yet though.</div></div><hr />
