<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Got this spell just a while ago off a Guardian Wurm.<br />
<br />
Now, the spell link here says it lasts 30min (Caster's Realms said it lasted 2min) and drains all mana.  However, when I casted it on myself it did not seem to do this, and, again, Caster's Realm did not mention anything about the mana drain.<br />
<br />
So what's the real scoop in Voice of the Berserker?  I know it adds mondo boosts to melee stats, but does it really drain mana and how long does it last?<br />
Also, are there any other side effects to it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Back in the olden days, this entire line drained your mana while providing haste, melee stats, and a nice bit of regen.  After a while Verant decided to change it, so now it just buffs up melee stats, no more regen.  I don't think it gives haste anymore either.<br />
The only downside is you can't cast for ~30 seconds after you put the spell on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Once cast, you cannot cast spells from your gem slots for 30 seconds (they all grey out).  Lasts for about 15 mins or so.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Last longer than that Grim, I forget the exact time but its more than 15, I am thinking 30 or so. Well then again someone could post the spdat file.<br />
<br />
Point being it grants a LOT of AC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hermana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Increase Dexterity from 74 (L59) to 75 (L60)<br />
Increase Strength from 84 (L59) to 85 (L60)<br />
Increase Armor Class (AC) by 24 (L59)<br />
Increase Agility from 74 (L59) to 75 (L60)<br />
<br />
I use this as a normal buff usually to increase AC.  This is an excellent buff if you time it where you have 30 seconds of downtime.  Stack this with Focus, Stamina and Primal Essence or Agility and most Shamans will have 255 Strg and well over 200 Dex and Agility. Last almost as long as normal buffs.<br />
<br />
Does not stack with Primal Avatar btw.</div></div><hr />

lasts 18.7-19 minutes.<br />

pretty damn nice buff for 1 mana :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thantu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah, sorry bout that, the spell list is pretty out of date at the moment.  It won't be this weekend, or pos even next, but it'll be current before July.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Batuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I admit it.  I am a buff freak.  I always keep VotB up.  You can time it by casting regrowth first.  Soon as Regrowth starts to fade, pop off VotB again.  Just be careful not to use right before a big pull is incoming.  :)</div></div><hr />
