<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was bored last night while waiting for a friend to get online to help them get some elysian armor in UP.  I'm 64 with most of my gear being equivelent of the MMC LDoN gear (Ghastly somethingorother), so I'm not quite ghetto, but close.  Have malo, torpor, but the only 64th level spell I have is Ulthor /sigh.  Oh, well, I digress.  So, I decide to have a look around and Gantru Draklner (sp) is close by.  Hmm, what the heck.  I've got Virtue and Kei on so why not.  Pull with malo and run to the zone where after getting inturupted twice, get slow on the third try.  Summon dog, buff dog (no weapons tho, Grrrrr) and begin the process with cripple, pox, plague and eventually BoN and reslowing every five minutes.  Well, 31 minutes later he's dead heheheh.  Was fun and sort of a landmark solo kill for me and I just thought I'd share it.  Not a big deal for most of you, but I'm sure you can remember your first BIG solo kill fondly as I will remember this one.  Please feel free to share yours also.  It might give me some ideas where to try next.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Moregar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Awesome, and congratulations =)  Personally, I have never solo'd much of anything, as it seems I am always in a group helping people out.  I have played my shaman for a year and a half, and am nowhere near done with the things I want to do...lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Congratulation!<br />
