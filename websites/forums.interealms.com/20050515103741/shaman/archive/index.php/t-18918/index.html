<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ok, just a theory here...<br />
<br />
There has begun to be some speculation that the new spells that  the Target type: Unkown(34) will be usable on only a certain type of mob in the new expansion.  Most of the spells with this target type are a little worse than the spells each class already has (of similar type).  This leads us to believe that said mob is resistant to all of our 'normal' spells, and only these new spells will land on them.<br />
<br />
A recent thread began calling this new type of mob &quot;cursed&quot; for lack of a name...<br />
<br />
I *might* have an idea of a better name that you can call them... Berzerkers.<br />
<br />
Many have said that Berzerkers traditionally are highly resistant to magic (if not completely so).  Perhaps sony is sticking with this model, and making it's new class resistant to all of our current spells, and creating a new set of spells just to effect this new class (because if there are berzerker PC's then there are most likely berzerker NPC's).<br />
<br />
This would be a brilliant meathod for Sony to control the new 'end game'.  We all know that SOE has tossed out a ton of spells which !#@$ up many encounters, and now they are left trying to think of ways around the blunders they have already made.  This way, sony can make several boss mobs that can only be fought with new spells, allowing them to write the entire encounter from the ground up (obviously though, they can't change our buffs/heals that have already been given to us, but changing the detrimental spells gives them alot of control over the encounters).<br />
<br />
Of course, if that was SOE's new clever idea, they quickly lost all cleverness when they began making the spells follow the exact same pattern as our former spells (minus a little umph).  But, this could be a tricky way to bridge the balance gap between melee's and casters.  In the new zones, caster damage would be reduced considerably, and melee damage would be upped (because of the new disciplines).<br />
<br />
Obviously I am reaching a little here, but the thought came to me, and I figured I would post it to give us all a little more to chew on.<br />
<br />
I honestly think making Berzerkers resistant to our current spells would be in line with the name, and would make the most sense.  However, I would not at all be surprised if SOE just pulls some random exclusion rule out of it's !@#$ and gives no storyline justification for it.  That way, they would be able to control the boss encounters and still have the bosses cast wicked spells (berzerkers aren't supposed to be able to use magic).  This is most likely the case, but I am going to be optimistic for once, and believe that sony is going to release an expansion that makes sense  (ROFL).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Purtyoogly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i just dont know what to think about spells that only work within a specific expansion.  <br />
<br />
Would have been neat to have something new added, rather than a recycle of an old concept.<br />
<br />
It already is insanly fun having turgurs and grummus with its respective debuffs memed at the same time, why not make encounters that use all 3 slow types now /runs off insane</div></div><hr />
