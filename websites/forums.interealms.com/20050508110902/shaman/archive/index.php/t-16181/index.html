<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So what is up with the barbs and falling?  I love my Barb Shammy, but it is damn embarassing to ALWAYS fall when doing the simplest things, like getting off of my lizard.  I have a dismount hotkey, and as soon as I click, boom, I fall flat on my back and pop back up like one of the three stooges.  At lvl 51 and in full plate, I look like a retard.  <br />
<br />
To add insult to injury, my buddies laugh everytime it happens.  Worse of all is when I'm in a mountainous zone and trying to run down the mountain.  The other day in DL, running to the BW zoneline via the snow capped mountains, I fell about 11 times in a row and took about 300 hp of damage, one fall for 124 hp damage?  ***!!??<br />
<br />
Another time, I'm in DSP grouped with a very good Bard War and we are camping the GE entrance.  Every time the puller comes back with a mob, the War runs down the steps to engage it, and falls every single time.  Every time.  Just going down one flight of stairs.  Became the joke of the day for the group.<br />
<br />
OK, so is it just me (I don't think so) or is this another little annoyance, besides the broken 2hb combat animation, that I'm gonna have to /bug every day until it is fixed.  Please don't tell me it is intentional, that a barbarian is supposed to be a clutz.  <br />
<br />
So, anyone else care to share their observations on this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yeah, Ive noticed it.  It usually doesnt bother me except in PoK, when even going down steps seems to cause fall damage.  <br />
<br />
Its really only an animation problem.  The Luclin models introduced a bevy of strange behaviors to all the models.  Ever been running throuh PoK and notice someone swimming near the Nexus stone?  Or doing that silly tread water animation when standing in PoS desert?  Annoying after awhile, but easy to ignore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Skadi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Have you seen my breasts?  Or how about my massive backside?  I am frankly amazed I can even stand up straight at all!  Or that my 30cm waist doesnt snap in half.  How about that classy dance moves!  Pretty obvious the artists in charge of barbarian models have been spending to much time at the nudie bar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Your weight has a HUGE bearing on falling damage. You also have no safefall skill. And you are RUNNING down those stairs.<br />
<br />
Leave all that crapola you dont need in the bank. Or get weight reduction bags. Or ignore it and keep regen up.<br />
<br />
Mainly, just learn to live with it, or stay on your mount, since it has 150 safefall skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There's the size thing, too.  Barbarians are between medium and large.  Notice that hobbits don't fall down so much.  Would you HONESTLY rather be a halfthing?  I suppose you could suck down illusion potions if it's that annoying.  *grin*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It happens to ogres too.  What you do is you click on the horse icon to remove it instead of typing /dismount.  You won't fall anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Get a shrink and you won't fall so much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Guntak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Have you seen my breasts? Or how about my massive backside?<br />
<br />
Oh God yes!<br />

My normal weight is about 75 stone.  My SK friend that I duo with, and consequently spend alot of time with, is a gmone.  His standard running around weight is about 125 stone.  He doesnt take damage down steps.  All my bags but one are WR.  Ill grant you the running part, walking is too slow.  <br />
<br />
It never does enough damage to be anything more than an annoyance, but its still annoying.</div></div><hr />

/em agree<br />
<br />
Love those Sandfisher girls in North Ro. I must have been breastfed as a baby.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">This really doesnt have anything to do with new models. Speed and weight have always been the main factors in falling damage. If you have spirit of wolf or some other speed spell (and no levitate), you will fall more while traveling across uneven terrain. It also seems the more weight you are carrying, the more damage you take from similiar distance falls. It's been this way forever.<br />
<br />
The horse/lizard dismount thing is just annoying. I never use dismount, I just click off the icon. That one probably does need some /feedback.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Faern (142 / 167 stone) running from the DL tunnel exit to Karnor's can nearly kill himself if he doesn't have Lev.<br />
<br />
DE Enchanter with ~ 100 stone (105 encum) or so takes 1/10 the damage.<br />
<br />
My opinion? It's a Large v Small race thing and Barbs are considered large for falling purposes.<br />
<br />
As an aside - nudie bar is awesome. GREAT drink specials and the FOOD? Wow. The music? 70's Boogie Night-retro nice mix of rock and classic.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, there's some sort of dancing entertainment going on as well...<br />
<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yeah everyone laughs at me for taking falling damage getting off my horse.<br />
<br />
My favorite is still the part where I can run down the ramp to Kael from EW with Selos Song of Travel on and if I am looking down just a little I take massive falling damage from falling into the ground repeatedly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">My friends always mess with me because anytime I step on snow, I take a tumble.  Barbarians should be really accustomed to walking and running in the snow.</div></div><hr />
