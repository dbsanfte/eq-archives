This was posted over at the Dev corner (http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=53816)  yesterday.<br />
<br />
We wanted to give you an update on some of the things we've been working on lately. We've been following the various class and server boards, and looking for pressing issues. While this isn't the complete list, here are some of the topics currently being reviewed -  <br />
<br />
I read through it...<br />
Obviously they must have lost the link to our community.<br />
<br />
No mention of anything to do with our 11 page petition on str/dex spells.<br />
<br />
Charm spells are specifically mentioned.  So is healing. They're also checking out the drop rates of parchments to see if any &quot;adjustments are needed&quot;...which can *possibly* mean a change for us....but it's pretty far fetched.<br />
<br />
<br />
I feel so unloved 8(<br />
Like an unloved, abused red headed step-child.<br />
<br />
***edit cuz I can't spell</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hell, I would sacrifice any later tuning to the Shaman class if they would drop the hammer on<br />
<br />
a)Enchanters.. for the love of god, charm is horrible horribly borken, these people solo all over BoT .. just pacify their way up to tower bosses and charm solo them. BREAK THEM I HATE THEM THEY MUST ALL DIE<br />
<br />
b)65th mage charm in bot.. FRENZIED BURNOUT (aa) does not fade on charmed pets and they do ~700 to ~1100 DPS. <br />
<br />
This **** makes druid charm in PoN and Storms look weak and balanced.</div></div><hr />

thats because monks will never be happy no matter what sony does - we're not asking for a lot either... just to get rid of some utterly useless spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Monks have SO much more to complain about than shaman.<br />
We just whine about pretty insignificant stuff compared to what other classes have to complain about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The stuff that shaman whine about is just amazingly easy to change.  Doesnt hurt any body, doesnt make other classes jealous, etc.  A simple request, and one yet to be answered.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Kiss my as*.  You obviously know nothing about our class or the sites that support it.  Pre-nerf, monks and shamans were 2 of the most balanced classes in my opinion.  Soe has a tendency to break what's right to fix what's wrong.  Instead of correcting problems with other classes, they just fuc*ed monks badly.  <br />
<br />
What they did to us would be like.....making canni give back less mana.  If it happened and I wasn't a shaman, I'd laugh in your face and say something like &quot;you guys will never be happy, you were over-powered anyways&quot;.  I've had to essentially re-learn how to be a monk, because of the limitations to what we can do post-nerf.  <br />
<br />
Please know what you're talking about before you make stupid comments.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Shamans are still quite a playable class -- even moreso in PoP.  Non-uber monks have been ruined.  I retired my 60 monk.<br />
<br />
Truly, compared to what happened to monks, the most legitimate complaints shamans have are trivial.<br />
<br />
Can't even sell monk stuff on the market these days, btw.  It's not just that too many monks quit; it's that almost nobody who's fully aware of the state of the game(or of any class outside their own) is foolish enough to start a new one up.</div></div><hr />
