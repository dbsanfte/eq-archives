<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ceinwein</div><div class="date">03-27-2003, 06:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey all,<br />
I am hoping to assemble a fear-kiting guide. Part of that process is to identify mobs that can be fear-kited by Rangers. I've assembled a pretty big list. Note that this doesn't include animals under Level 20, as you won't get much xps off them by the time you get your Panic Animal Spell at Level 22. It also doesn't include animals from zones where Fear spells will not work (such as PoJ rats).<br />
<br />
What I really need from you first is some confirmations. I need actual in-game confirmations, not stuff you have gleaned from the web.<br />
<br />
Are all Chokadai from Chardok animals?<br />
&lt;Yes&gt;<br />
Are all Cheetah from Scarlet Desert animals?<br />
&lt;Yes&gt;<br />
Are all Zelniak from Luclin animals?<br />
&lt;Yes&gt;<br />
Are all Rockhoppers from Luclin animals?<br />
&lt;Not named ones&gt;<br />
Are all the Bats from Plane of Nightmare animals?<br />
&lt;Yes&gt;<br />
Assuming the answer for any of the above is yes, can all of them be effected by the Panic Animal spell?<br />
<br />
That's the start. Once I can answer those, I have a list allready complete and I will check it to see if there are any errors such as mobs that can not be feared or such.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.<br />
<br />
Ceinwein<br />
<br />
EDIT: Ok guys, thanks for your help so far. New group of questions / clarifications:<br />
<br />
Can all of the above-mentioned be snared? One person below states that zelniaks in UP can not be. I only was aware of the ones in DP. Are they different?<br />
<br />
What zones do not permit fear? I know of PoJ and Kedge Keep for sure. Any others out there? Specifically, anyone know if you can fear-kite animals in Siren's Grove?<br />
<br />
Is there a maximum mob level at which fear and / or snare will work? Assuming the ranger is Lvl 65, can he or she fear-kite a level 60 mob?<br />
<br />
The list is looking really good right now. I just want to eliminate any obvious mistakes before posting it for review.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gaack</div><div class="date">05-06-2003, 04:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, so Im a moron. but I had a similar question about where/when do we get a Fear spell. I have solo'd almost none at all in 40 levels. I knew there was an actual spell called &quot;FEAR&quot;.<br />
<br />
All I had was Panic animal, and knew that this wasnt fear. It's fear-like and only seems to work on certain &quot;animals&quot;.<br />
<br />
I finally figured out we never got &quot;fear&quot; and that panic animal was what everyone was talking about when they spoke of &quot;fear kiting&quot;.<br />
<br />
Guess people dont want to call it animal kiting, or panic kiting huh?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aredubya</div><div class="date">05-06-2003, 06:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">[QUOTE='Gaack'] Guess people dont want to call it animal kiting, or panic kiting huh?[/QUOTE]<br />
<br />
Nah, not a moron, just ignorant. Ignorance can be fixed - stupidity is forever. :)<br />
<br />
Anyhow, jibes aside, fear kiting isn't specific to one class. Necros and SKs get generic &quot;fear&quot; abilities, usable on all types of mobs. Clerics and paladins get the ability to fear undead mobs. Druids and rangers get the ability to fear animal mobs. In all cases, the concept is the same: fear the mob, and chase after it, meleeing/casting as you go. Thanks to the ranger/druid limitation of only being able to fear animals, and it not being that obvious as to what mobs are animals and what aren't (e.g. why aren't spiders and beetles considered animals? why are griffons?), a guide like this is quite useful to us.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps clarify. I'm eagerly awaiting completion of the guide.</div></div><hr />

Fearing undead just means that they outrun me.  Might have to do some testing, never really tried to undead-kite, now that I think of it....<br />

Pilanthas said <br />
untill the &quot;ancient zelniak&quot; and &quot;enraged zelniak&quot; come around<br />
<br />
Are these two in Dawnshroud Peaks as well? I know you can find these two in Marus Seru, but haven't lived long enough in DSP. Also, keep in mind that the aggro range for Zelniaks in MS is like half the zone - they aggro on you from the very edge of your clip plane.</div></div><hr />

Animals are also in OT that can potentially take you to 50, albeit slow exp near the end as they green out. <br />
<br />
Sharks are animals, found in OOT, Erudin's Xing, and in Qeynos sewer tanks. <br />
<br />
Cudas are animals found in LOIO pond.<br />
<br />
Loads of animals in Stonebrunt Mts also.<br />
<br />
Cougars in IC, as well as dire wolves. Also look to EW for mammoths, wolves, etc.<br />
<br />
Griffins in the Karanas, and Griffenes and Griffawns. There is also a rare spawn in EC, and a two spawn semi rare in WC. all animals.<br />
<br />
Not exactly sure of the levels on all these, you could look them up at the bestiary site though.<br />
<br />
Most of these are relatively mid to higher level animals though.</div></div><hr />

Heh, thanks, I'll be looking for that Anklesmasher - but have to to focus on my main guy for now.  (Not to hijack or anything. Back to Animals.)</div></div><hr />
