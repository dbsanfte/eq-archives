<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This doens't really concern World of Warcraft, but rather The Matrix Online beta (I like beta-testing.. Yes, it's a sick addiction, i'm seeking an online help forum about it.. :D )<br />
<br />
But, it's basically a question about Fileplanet, for those who have experience using the service.<br />
<br />
How does one actually sign up for a game, if you ALREADY have signed up?   Supposably, the keys for the matrix online beta are being made today for subscribers - but whenever I go to the site, to find information, it asks me IF I WANT TO SUBSCRIBE!  But i'm ALREADY a subscriber!  <br />
<br />
How does one get around the fact that Fileplanet seems to have no idea that i'm a subscriber? Because I can get into my account information just fine, so the page KNOWS i'm there, but doesn't appear to think I really am there.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wazbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">When did you sign up, cause it took me a few hours for FP to recognize me as a subscriber.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I signed up for FP very early today, though, and i've DOWNLOADED the client already, it just keeps telling me &quot;You need to subscribe now!&quot; and crap like that. :/<br />
<br />
Maybe it's that the signup page and ability isn't even available right now, but I can't find any sign of even being ABLE to click on anything to sign me up.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think their process is going to be hopelessly buggered until the initial mass of WoW signups is taken care of.  It took hours and hours for my subscription to go through - but in the end, it worked.<br />
<br />
Something I did that may or may not have helped was to email customer support saying &quot;I might be interested in continuing my subscription past this initial month in the event that this issue is resolved quickly&quot;.<br />
<br />
If there's one thing that EQ taught me, it's that EVERYBODY needs a carrot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm through all this now, thanks for the help.  As it turned out, they hadn't gotten anything ready for that particular beta yet.  Despite the fact that they said it would be given out (the keys) on tuesday, it was a while after midnight before I was able to sign up.</div></div><hr />
