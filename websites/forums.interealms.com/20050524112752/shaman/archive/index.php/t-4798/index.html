thats wher ei am. i have the high scale icon form CoM and now i have to raid the hole.<br />
<br />
so any tips ? i have someone in my guild that says 2 groups that know what their doing can do it even if they arent ALL 55+<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Carrieanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Highscale I did as a guild hole raid... He dropped so fast - main point about him is the respawn time of mobs is quite quick. Invis to undead potions are good for just walking straight up there..<br />
<br />
See i your local CT-able guild is doing CT, they'll be killing golems if they're up as CT will shout for assistance from them if they haven't been killed. <br />
So often their interest is to kill them so they aren't going to add in the Cazic fight not for the loot - your interest is getting the iksar child.. just chat it over and I'd bet that you can work somthing out.<br />
<br />
Failing that just keep plugging away at fear raids..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm about to try getting to Kirn this weekend with about 12 people, for a friend's epic. So if we do well, I'll report back with some tips :)<br />
<br />
When I did my epic, I got my group into the Hole by smuggling a COTH mage in with another raid that was going on the day before. When we were ready, the mage (who had camped on the safe ledge outside the undead tower) grouped with my rogue (corpse recovery bot) to COTH everyone to safe ledge. We then used ITU potions to get up to kirn.</div></div><hr />

rofl , thats how i got into area in kael over the weekend to get in a raid that was already going. monk FD his way there and a mage summoned me there. gotta luv it , hope tey never nerf that ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">looks like we planning the hole on thursday.<br />
<br />
anyone know how long it should take to do the hole part ? im told the glems are mezzable and that itll make things go ALOT faster.  Time frame would make getting the raid party mobilized alot easier</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Michael J. Kaspar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Two groups, with some individuals under 55, would be tricky.  The main problem you will have is agro in the city.  Lower level folks will auto agro mobs, and in the city with its funky pathing this can be death to a raid.<br />
<br />
I would recommend you do this:<br />
<br />
1.  Find other characters that need to go there as well.  For example, the Enchanter mob (that needs to be killed) is on the same floor as Kirn, so don't just go there for yourself.  Go there for a few different folks and you might get better participation.<br />
<br />
2.  If you choose to go with two folks, make sure you have at leave a couple higher level tanks, as well as a 60 enchanter.  Highest level pulls.  Monk or SK would be perfect, but as long as someone pulls that understands the pathing, as well as the route the raid needs to take through the city, you should be ok.  I pulled city as a shaman (at 60) and it worked fine.<br />
<br />
3.  Prior to entering the city, and after departing the city on the way down to undead tower, if people go AFK / LD its not a huge problem because the route is easy.  From the point when you start pulls into the city to the point you conclude pulls on the back end of the city, AFK's / LD's will kill you.  You need to be able to kill approximately 15 mobs to make it to the first safe spot, then another dozen or so to get to the docks.  From there, its about 20 mobs on the way out the back side, and you can do that in two phases with a move in between.  Respawn is fast, so if you can't kill enough to make it to the next safespot, you going to be in trouble.<br />
<br />
4.  CoTH is a valid option, however I don't know if sub 60's will agro at the CoTH point.  If they do, you could get a horde of undead coming to play with you.<br />
<br />
One final point... on EMarr there were several raids in a row that did either of the following:<br />
- left Kirn's pet up, thus preventing Kirn from spawning<br />
- screwed up Kirn, thus leaving him agro<br />
<br />
Make sure after you do Kirn you do his pet.  Furthermore, if Kirn is agro prior to you turning in the scale, you will need another way to get faction to go on to the next step.<br />
<br />
Good luck and good hunting :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">if he is aggro can he not be mezzed and then hand him the scale ? i heard of this working on the totemic quest with some part which i cant remember</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dagor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you come across a Kirn and he is already agro.  I would kill him without handing in the icon, bite the bullet chill out for two hours, and do him in the normal fashion.  You get your faction from turning in the icon, so YOU NEED to turn it in.  I believe when you turn in the icon, that Kirn pops, and a new Agro Kirn spawns immediately.  So if Kirn is initially agro, you likely are dealing with the Agro version, and not the one who will give you faction for turning in the icon.<br />
<br />
One thing to note is that the wizzard epic is also based on the Truescale faction...except they get negative faction hits from their epic quest.  So If you have any epic or near epic wizzards with you, Kirn may very well agro on them from even a pretty good distance(through the wall in the hallway).  If you experience this kind of agro from Kirn you can proceed as normal once he has been mezzed/charmed/walked back to his room/blurred.  This happened on my trip to the hole, and once he was back in position and turned in the scale...and all went well.</div></div><hr />
