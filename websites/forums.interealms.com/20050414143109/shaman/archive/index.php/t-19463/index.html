<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a Gainward GeForce 3 PowerPack! TI/200, with the latest drivers.  Does anyone know how to find out if it is DX 9 compatible so I can play Gates of Discord?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Basically all &quot;modern&quot; cards that are currently supported will continue to function. Geforce 2 and up for sure.<br />
You're only out of luck with a voodoo or 3dfx card.<br />
Just run your testeverquest.exe and log into the testserver.  If you can, you're fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Actually, I have a GF2 MX400 64MB on my bot PC.  I cannot get the upgrade to work.  Going to install latest drivers and try it again after the work week and see if thats the problem.<br />
<br />
I am 100% sure that the FX cards are compatible though, thats what I run on my main PC.  I'm not sure how much of a difference 9.0 will make, but it's worth trying everything possible to get my bot upgraded IMO.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Grrrr....release 42.51 and later all have the DirectX 9.0 compatability for Nvidia Graphics Cards.  That was 10 releases ago so getting a compatible driver shouldn't be a problem :D<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gruog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There is a difference between &quot;directx 9 compatible&quot; and &quot;directx 9 hardware support&quot;.<br />
<br />
As long as the drivers support directx 9 then extra features are emulated in software.  Cards which are dx9 hardware accelerated have these new features in the gpu so it will get better performance.<br />
<br />
If you want a DX9 hardware accelerated card then get any Radeon 9xxx is a dx9 card (except the 9100).  All GeforceFX cards are dx9 as well.<br />
<br />
A radeon 9000 pro will give you almost the exact same performance (as the g3-ti200) but will have dx9 in hardware.  Those are pretty cheap.  Anything faster will be a serious upgrade.</div></div><hr />
