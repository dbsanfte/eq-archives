<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rewts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Really stuck on what to work on next, I have 40 AA so far my next choices are:<br />
<br />
Healing adept<br />
SCM<br />
SCR<br />
ND<br />
<br />
I am a raiding shaman who does alot of patch healing so leaning toward Healing adept, but can make good arguements for the others.  Anyone have any thoughts?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Started in on SCR myself, level 2 atm. The extra tick from torpor is very very much worth it after you canni5. Going to max it out and do SCRM once that is done. 50% longer buffs will be awesome as well since we got the shaft on the time the PoP buffs last. <br />
<br />
I have the first level for crit heals also, and doesnt really seem to be worth it, as the crits are pretty few and far between. Perhaps level 2 or 3 of that will be more usefull.<br />

*edit* lol thanks Harvyst</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm really enjoying SCRM.  The extra time on buffs (haste and regen!) as well as the extended duration on Torpor.  An 1800 point heal (2100 sometimes) is much more powerful than a 1200 point heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have SCR3 and I'm loving it... I think Kragster ment to talk about SCR3, not SCM... SCM is mana reduction, SCR is extended duration. I need 4 more points for SCRM.<br />
<br />
Having Swift Like the Wind last for 24 minutes... Primal last for 1 hour 30 minutes... torpor healing for 1800... wonderful :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>TalgurenXev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Combat Agility / Lightning Reflexes is a great AA skill.  Getting to LR5 will take like 27 AA points, but you'll notice mobs missing a lot more and that can help you get that second slow attempt in sometimes before you take the dirt nap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">They are all nice skills. Which one to get probably depends a bit on your situation.<br />
<br />
ND is great. More hps is always good. You actually get more hps from the aa if you have more hps and better gear but it's more valuable IMO when you have less hps and poorer gear. The difference between 1800 hps and 1980 hps is the difference between being able to survive cann v unbuffed and dropping over dead. It also helps to get that buffer buffed so you don't have to worry about low health aggro etc. Depending on where your gear is at this maybe very good for you.<br />
<br />
SCM and SCRM mastery are great. That was the last big skill I finished off. Makes a world of difference on torpor and the cann v and hit torpor once to be back at full health is pretty nice. This would be great with quiesence since you don't have the limitations of torpor anymore. 1800hps for 200 mana is a very effective heal even if it does take a bit for the healing to happen. Also depends some on whay your typical groups look like. If you spend more time in small groups or group with out bards/enchanters to provide haste the duration increase in haste is very nice especially stacked with focus item.<br />
<br />
SCM is great. You can never be to rich or have too much mana. Since you save mana on everything you cast scm is a bigger mana pool and more regen effectively all in one. Alot of people seem to think it's not worth bothering since we have such high mana regen rates when we need it but i've really enjoyed it. There are definitely times when it's hard to find time for a cann v let alone for a bunch of casts of cann 4. When these times hit it's nice to have as much reserve as possible.<br />
<br />
CA/LR is definitely on my list of things to get but it wouldn't be above any of the other already mentioned for me. Sure when you get aggro i sure would be nice if that mob hitting for 900 a pop missed more but I try to avoid aggro when possible. That doesn't mean I won't take a beating when needed and don't from time to time but we aren't a tank class who's job it is to take and hold aggro so I rate others ahead of this.<br />
<br />
Healing adept and healing gift are also skills I haven't picked up yet but would like to eventually. i don't consider them high priority since neither works with our 2k heal to thebest of my knowledge. While slow, inefficient and rather a pain in the ass it's still our best direct heal we have. Depending on what &quot;patching&quot; your doing they may provide little to no benifit for you. I'd definitely look at SCRM before these if you have quiesence.<br />
<br />
Other skills you haven't mentioned. QB is nice with torpor and convinent for other buffs too but probably better saved for later. Personally I wouldn't go past qb2 since you can hit the 50% max reduction with that with focus items and/or cleric spell haste buff.<br />
<br />
MGB is a handy skill for raiding shaman but hardly essential. Focus of the 7th burns threw alot of mana and it's nice to just MGB it after a wipe out or at the start of a raid and be done in one cast. With MGB Po9 and symbol being done too I don't even get yelled at by the clerics anymore =).<br />
<br />
Spirit call is a fun skill. Nice for some extra dmg when you need it or some road bumps to get things under control.<br />
<br />
Radiant cure is a nice skill and is definitely worth 2 points for the first lvl. It cures a fair number of aes and other things in one shot including potentially removing other wise uncurable spells like malo, snare, THO's ae and all sorts of other things. Definitely handy to have.</div></div><hr />
