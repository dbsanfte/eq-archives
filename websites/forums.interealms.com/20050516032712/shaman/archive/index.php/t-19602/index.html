<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">All <br />
priests should offer a similar level of value in solo, group, and raid <br />
situations, and they won't be considered balanced until this is true. <br />
<br />
 Classes are continually being looked at and revised. If there are legitimate issues with your class, we'll certainly be addressing them over time. We're working our way through the classes and given time we'll be addressing each class with any needed fixes. <br />
<br />
 It should be possible to have any priest class function as an effective healer. <br />
<br />
In the light of our recent issues I think I can say that I am still waiting for these promises to be made true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jonat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I can function as an effective main healer anywhere but raids and elemental planes. That is good enough for me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A shaman that is a main healer with slow and malos brings less to the group than a comparably equipped druid or cleric that is healing without any slowing.  Sure a shaman can heal effectively, but unless the mob is long lived, the shaman will have less mana to do other things with than the druid or cleric.  Either of the latter classes can add DPS as well as be effective healers.  If there is a slower in the group (enc, bst, and shm slows are equally effective), then a druid or cleric will be a far superior healer to a shaman as well as bringing far more DPS to the group.<br />
<br />
No, the promises made by Rich Waters have not been fulfilled after a year and a half of waiting.<br />
<br />
By the way, does Rich Waters still work at Sony?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I can function as an effective main healer anywhere but raids and elemental planes. That is good enough for me.<br />
... or LDoN hard, or for some 1 group encounters in pre elementals ...<br />
<br />
Fine if that's good enough for you, but it isn't for me.  If you set the bar low you will never be disapointed, but I guess I expect more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jonat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Its not setting the bar low at all. We have the best damage mitigation spell in the game and you want heals to rival other priest classes who cant mitigate? It says effective healers, which we are. There should be and there are instances where are healing isnt enough and clerics or a druid is needed for a healer. Just my 2 cents.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">quite , hard ldon, raids and elemental planes our healing still needs balancing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Nobody is asking for heals that rival a clerics or a druids.  But shaman heals are falling farther and farther behind those two with each expansion.  Give us a break and give us SOME sort of upgraded heal in GoD.<br />
<br />
The math has been done and posted many times.  Unless mobs last a long time, we are vastly less efficient at healing than either a cleric or druid in every situation.  It's the margin that we have a problem with.  It's grown to large and if the posted spells go live in GoD, it only gets worse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jonat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ok then, what do you consider a balanced heal for us</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">balancing would be able to keep a group healed &quot;as good&quot; as a druid, with our slows taken into account. i.e when we slowed a hard ldon or elemantal plane mob we can effectively heal the tank.  and do so for every mob. this isnt heals that are the same as druid or as high, but needs to be higher than it is now. (but we probably could only slow and  heal nothing else)<br />
<br />
this would still mean that with a  druid/cleric in your group they would still fined it alot easier to heal  than us and still be better to have a better healer in group as a shaman will be pushed badly with nasty pulls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">We have the best damage mitigation spell in the game and you want heals to rival other priest classes who cant mitigate? <br />
<br />
The mana cost of the &quot;best mitigation spell in the game&quot; is the problem Jonat.  We are unbalanced because we have to come up with the mana for that spell as well as for our healing spells.  Our spells cost the same amount of mana as other priest's comparable spells, but heal for much less.<br />
<br />
My guess is that when the heals were balanced, they were balanced using the logic &quot;if a shaman slows a mob by 75%, then they would only heal a fraction of the damage of other priests&quot;.  Such logic does not account for the time and mana spent debuffing, the aggro generated by debuffing, the time and mana that must be spent to regenerate mana, and a myriad of other things that decrease the effectiveness of shaman healing relative to other priests.<br />
<br />
What this means is that a shaman has less mana and time to spend on other things that are important to a group, such as crowd control, DPS, buffing, etc.<br />
<br />
Healing is the most clearcut of many facets of the game where shamans are far out of balance with other priests at level 65.  And this lack of balance hurts the non-elemental shaman much more than one who has elemental or time quality gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I don't know what other shaman think of this but the big problem with shaman being healers and slowing is what I call &quot;the hole&quot;.  Thats the unmitigated damage the tank takes prior to slow landing.  While trying to land slow a mob will toss out somewhere in the ballpark of 3-5k damage.  Although it would take an extra spell gem, or an AA slot, I'd like to see a fast cast 2.5-4K heal (depending on the influence of AA's and focuses) with a VERY LONG recast time, say in the ballpark of 30 seconds.  It could not be used as a consistant heal due to the long recast, but it could be used once per fight to help get back some of the unmitigated damage a MA takes while we try to slow a mob.  We'll still fall behind on our follow up heals, but at least we're not trying to dig ourselves out of &quot;the hole&quot; and the tank might live.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Considering Druids are getting a 1925hp heal for 550 mana, I'd think we should be getting an upgrade to about 1650hp for 500ish mana to keep us in line.  With Focus effects and AA it'd be a decent heal to counter the increasingly nastier AEs as well as a decent all around heal if you're main healing an xp group.<br />
<br />
-OR-<br />
<br />
Supernal Elixir like Heal over Time.  450-500hp/tick healed for abotu 350mana.  Our HoTs were more efficient before and should continue to be so.  Clerics get CE at 59 and SE at 62, we got Torpor at 60 and Q at 65, meanwhile Clerics look to be getting an upgrade to SE at 64... /boggle.<br />
<br />
Here's the thing.  Clerics and Druids, our priestly brethren, are both getting upgrades to both their DPS and Healing, yet the only damage spell I see for shaman is a stupid Disease DoT and I don't see ANY healing upgrade.  We were behind them both by a large margin in healing/DDs before, now that gap grows worse.  <br />
<br />
We are priests, thus IMO Healing should be the area where we do hold up at least somewhat vs. a cleric or druid.  The only class you can say we're competitve with as healers post GoD is going to be a paladin and it's very debateable which of the two will be the better healer there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
In addition to the things that you mention, the whole foundation is changed now.  We no longer slow all mobs 75% due to slow mitigation, yet our heals are based around the assumption that we do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">You guys smokin' crack?  Are you all VT/Time/Elemental-enabled?  'Cause the rest of us aren't.  I can tell you for a fact that most &quot;normal&quot; clerics/druids will go OOM in about 2-3 fights in any Tier3+ zone xp group without a slower, let alone allow them to provide any additional functionality like nukes.  Sure their individual heals are better than our heals, but their heals do not equal 75% slow + Tnargs + Q.  A group can function in these zones with just me as slower and healer.  Substitute me with a druid or cleric and they're gonna be struggling within a few fights to keep up.  Our ability to heal in comparison to a druid or cleric is completely dependent upon the one spell-line that they don't get --- slow.<br />
<br />
The only time the weakness is glaring is on raids when slows don't stack and then it's just a direct comparison of the priests heals.  If/when the mob is slowed, then it's just heals keeping everyone alive, and clerics and druids are much better in this regard, no doubt.  I think some clarification needs to be made as to where our healing power needs improvement, not just some grand overall improvement that could unbalance things the other direction.<br />
<br />
Of course, most xp groups make the point moot by getting both a slower and a healer to join up, with specific jobs of slowing and healing, so it's really tough to compare the healing impact of 2 different classes when both are present at the same time.  But if the standard group setup wasn't the way it is now, and you have 5 non-healing, non-slowing classes grouped and they need one more person to keep them alive, they need to choose the class that's gonna keep them alive the best.  This group is going to be taking on mobs with extremely impressive damage-output.  You have choices: a druid, who just blasts their heals and hope to have insane mana regen to out-heal the damage-output of the mob... you have a cleric who is extremely impressive in their healing abilities but again hope that they can out-heal a mob's damage-output and do it on a consistent basis for the group to pull continuously... and you have a shaman who's first priority is cutting each mob's damage-output by 75% and then using lesser heals to top the party's health off.  That 75% damage-output reduction is tremendous towards keeping a party alive.<br />
<br />
I contend that making our heal as good as everyone here wants it would actually make shamans possibly the best overall class in &quot;keeping people alive&quot; in most grouping situations which is the basis of healing, and this could actually create a situation where a group will just forget about druids and clerics and just grab a shaman to perform both tasks.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, having some better heals would make us more powerful and who wouldn't like that?  But lets be realistic in our wonts in the regards of healing upgrades.<br />
<br />
Although I don't expect an upgrade at all, I wouldn't complain about an upgrade to Tnarg's to put it in the vicinity of 2.5k or 3k in healing for raids and spot-healing improvements... but that would be plenty enough for me.  Improve our healing a little bit, but instead of focusing all our of attention on heals, give us a medium upgrade to our heal that doesn't encroach on druid/cleric healing, and then throw us a few bones in other areas and I'd be happy.  Perhaps improve nukes or reduce the casting times of some of our spells or give us an AoE Malo, but don't improve our healing so much that I become a &quot;healing&quot; class.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">hey Tarthug, you got the idea i was thinking about. what i was thinking was for both heals and dd,<br />
<br />
both nice, quick but long recast.<br />
<br />
so heal 2.5k 3 sec cast , but 30 seconds or so recast for 850 mana. at level 65 (tnargs being 62) the recast i think is the thing to balance it out<br />
it might need to be nearer 60 sec.<br />
<br />
and the dd, 1.4k 3 sec cast 30 sec recast for 460 mana. likely change all poison nukes to this. ratio. at one 65<br />
<br />
i think these would certainly solve or short term healing and dps. but not hugely affect our overall healing and dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I agree with Jonat.... I am by far not &quot;Uber&quot; but my group does LDoN Hards just fine with me as the only healer.  I dont do much other than heal but that's cool with me.  I am the only healer and it's my job in that group.  If it wasnt me it would be a cleric and they could heal the tanks just as well (maybe even better... as clerics they should).   I dissagree a druid could keep a tank healed as well as us in an LDoN hard but I might be wrong.  All I know is that when our Knucklehead Druid casts one of their BIG FOOKIN heals too early on a hard mob (Hasted and buffed up thanks to all the friggin shaman in adventures) we are usually scraping him off the walls after the fight.  Once the mob is slowed (After malos I think I've bounced 5 slows out of ~20 hard adventures) Q and patch healing work fine.<br />
<br />
Let's look at it this way... In a Hard Adventure:<br />
Cleric= Heals and not a whole lot else he can do since he'll be patch healing and wooopy he might throw in a nuke every other or 3rd mob.  His very mana inneficient DD I might add, very impressive.<br />
<br />
Druid= Way too fookin busy with his heals to do much else other than just heal due to the mobs being unslowed and not healing as well as a cleric.  Druids do add a DS which we have parsed to be equal to a Shaman pet in DPS so I'd say they are a wash.<br />
<br />
Shaman= Sure we dont have the Quick big heals but we dont need it and fights are much more controlled when a mob is slowed.  Hard LDoN mobs crank out insane burst DPS and if they are unslowed most druids cant patch heal fast enough to counter 2 big rounds.  We bring our crappy arse pet that does the same DPS as the druids DS but then we also get to throw in FA on the melee.  FA has been clocked at the Safe House as being ~20% dps increase and from all parses I've done on my Rogue and my buddies Rogue it's pretty darn close.  My typical group is Monk, Rogue, SK, Wiz, Druid, Sham.  Dont get me wrong having the druid there as a back up healer is kinda handy now and again but I still stand by that there is no fight that the druid pulled us out of that I couldnt have done alone.... if we had 4 mobs come on the pull, we were going to die no matter what that druid did for healing.  With kiting and rooting my scrub group has taken 3 pulls and lived with just the Shaman, Monk, SK, Rogue.  That was hard and a lot of kiting for a bit but we did it.<br />
<br />
I'm getting tired of the Shaman crying to be honest.  Shaman are a great class, I think we need a few small tweeks but as it stands we are still a great class w/o the tweeks.</div></div><hr />

It certainly gets frustrating. How I cope is on incoming I Q the tank as he gets in range. (Heals ignore LoS as well) That helps alot with the hole so to speak. But with a resisted slow or two I am in spam mode. and damn that is infuriating praying for a crit so I have TIME to try and cast another slow attempt.<br />

Lastly an AA Like Paragon and Spirit of the wood. Except coupled with healing let our secondary effect be a Strikethrough/Percentage of hits landed/ and damage bonus increaser Like 350 hps a tick group based with +15 strikethrough and other mods at the last rank.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Gorgos , i have done a few hard adventures, in one the cleric died, **** happens, i could only just keep the tank up with the damage done even slowed, and my mana was disappearing fast. Add to that that there was 2 mobs, i had no chance, but with druid or cleric (if he been alive) it would have been fine.<br />
<br />
in hard ldon with only a shaman healing you must have been running short on mana, or had a tank so well equiped that he just didnt need much healing, in which case a druid would be able to heal and nuke. Just because you can do somin, doesnt mean you do it well or that if someone esle (ie cleric or druid) was there they wouldnt fine it amazingly easy.<br />
the fact your druid kept getting kill more likely mean druid was`nt as skilled, had less aa, or less gear.<br />
i know in elemeantal planes which seem abit easier than hard ldon to me, i can only keep a tank up for short period before i run out of mana, even with canni 5 etc, i was down 40% by the time the fight finished i couldnt keep that up at the pace most groups pull. but a druid or cleric can, i even grouped with cleric that can do this easliy without kei cos of ft15 etc.</div></div><hr />

If you have a druid casting a heal, you're not the only healer.  If I had a druid dropping a quick heal while I slowed I could play prime healer and pick up heals after the mob is slowed.<br />
Dont get me wrong having the druid there as a back up healer is kinda handy now and again but I still stand by that there is no fight that the druid pulled us out of that I couldnt have done alone.<br />
LOL!  Look at it another way, at what point in the fight is the druid healing?  How many of your mobs are mitigating slow in succession?<br />
<br />
If any of the answers are 1) first half, 2) 3 or more then your druid heals are really helping.<br />
<br />
How long are your mobs typically living?  How are you handling healing on named in LDoN hard?  How much time is usually left over at the end?<br />
If that druid wasn't there, I argue that you'de have a lot more deaths and your advents would go very much slower.  If you're cutting your times close, then the druid is saving you time by reducing your mana regen requirements which I assume are cut pretty tight and likely is saving you the loss.<br />
<br />
I'm getting tired of explaining obvious arguments to people who will not look at or even refute numerical data presented on these boards explaining what should be rather apparent.  If I could heal in some of these situations as well as rich waters promised, I wouldn't care about my low DPS as I would have a needed role, but as it stands, any shaman is almost a liability as by rebuilding the group and replacing the shaman the group could perform better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Well Gorgos,<br />
I admitt that I am not the best equiped shaman around but I can not keep a tank alive in a hard LDoN.<br />
Sooner or later that resisted slow will happen and then the Tank (11K+ tank btw) just dies (unless I get a lucky crit heal)<br />
You however have a druid there to back you up in case this resist happens, so i asume you allready knew that you would run into this situation. So don't give me this BS about being the healer in a hard LDoN, you are healing but when **** hits the fan you let the better healer handle it and when you have your slow landed you go back to healing.<br />
<br />
All I want from SoE is to make it possible for a group to take a shaman in any xp situation and let the shaman be the healer, we are priest afterall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Tauran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I'm going to have to agree with Gorgos. Our healing is fine.  I don't know about the EQ you are playing but in mine a slower is REQUIRED for almost any exp group.  If we could handle the healing and slowing as well as a cleric/druid + slower, why would anyone ever group a cleric or druid again?  Clerics and druids have better healing and other bonuses (rez, port, better nukes, etc) because they need to make up for the fact that you have to have a slower (enc, shm, bst) in the group as well.  For all of you that say enchanters and beastlords slow as well as we do, try playing them for a while and seeing what its like (its close, but no way it is equal).  Also, elemental healing and LDON hards are very possible with only a shaman healing.  Is it more risky? Sure it is but the benefits are greater as well (one shm + five dps &gt;&gt; two supports + 4 dps).  <br />
<br />
PS: I do think the introduction of the BST class was a strong indirect nerf of shamans, and did alot to create the feelings that we are &quot;unbalanced&quot;.  Before they had a 65% slow, of the 3 priest classes, shaman were the only one who could go alone as the only &quot;support&quot; class.  Now clerics and druids can just grab a bst (a dps class really) and be fine.  So alot of the groups that wanted us before b/c they already have a healer want a bst who can do slows+dps rather than the dps+healing that we bring.  This doesnt really bother me much since I make all mine own groups so I just don't invite clerics/druids, problem solved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Poguk,<br />
<br />
you are falling in the same trap shaman were caught multiple times before, comparing cleric/druid healing vs. an unslowed mob against shaman healing vs. a slowed mob.<br />
<br />
Pure mathematically that may be OK, but it has nothing to do with any realistic game situation, you may find.<br />
<br />
You ignore:<br />
- most non-shaman groups will have another slower class inside (sure count their mana cost for 1 or 2 slows per mob into the equation to be fair).<br />
- additional risk of shaman healing, while the mob is unslowed or resists<br />
- substantial better/more versatile set of healing tools of cleric and druids<br />
- additional risk, when adds or ANY critical situation occur (due to our lack of ability to pump out large amout of heals fast). Our heal/second  rate is by far the lowest of all three priest classes.<br />
- aggro risk for the slowing shaman (who is healing the healer, when he gets stomped to bear paste by a 500+ tripling mob?).<br />
<br />
The pure, raw numbers show only a part of the picture.<br />
<br />
There was some massive number crunching done a few weeks before on this board, if you are interested in more data (too lazy to search ;) ), that show some of the problems, when taking such additional influences into account.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Tauran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Well Gorgos,<br />

<br />
<br />
Stygiana, I just don't believe you when you say you can't keep a tank in hard LDON up.  If you truely can't, you just arn't trying hard enough.  If you are having lots of resists, use Malos before, its REALLY rare to get a resists after a malos.  You can malos+turgur a mob in about 7 seconds, if your 11k tank is dying in less than 7 seconds he needs more AC. Yes, there are times where things get hairy (adds, etc) and it IS more risky then having a cleric/druid, but its entirely possible to do several LDON hards in a row w/o any deaths with a shaman as only healer (and by only I don't mean shaman + a druid).  Let your tank take some of the burden (with 11k I assume warrior so disc d is huge, /sheild, even riposte disc).   If you really can't do it with a warrior, just get a pally its even easier (LoH, group LoH, single target and group heals, AND stuns).  I think pallys are way overpowered, but that doesn't stop us from taking advantage of it does it?<br />
<br />
<br />
All I want from SoE is to make it possible for a group to take a shaman in any xp situation and let the shaman be the healer, we are priest afterall.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think this is currently true, with the cavet that you have to have the right group make up in certain cases (i.e. having pallys, rangers, enchaters, bsts; classes that have dps as well as other utility).</div></div><hr />

One resist of Turgurs and mobs were 70% dead anyway.  Cast Malos and then put finger over key to slow and mobs were also 70% dead.  <br />
<br />
And when you slow, it's not real clear that you slowed it very much.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, we plainly would have done fine on the ring without any slower there at all.  <br />
<br />
Globally, this is a good thing because slow had too big an impact, but it is clear that the impact of slow has been diminished.  <br />
<br />
Anyone who says shaman aren't healers is nuts.  We got people who say shaman aren't melee, aren't dps, aren't nukers, aren't healers, aren't pet classes, etc., etc.  To some extent these things are true, but they also aren't strictly true.  <br />
<br />
Of course we heal.  <br />
<br />
What's broken in EQ is that you need 5 clerics or more to do high end stuff.  <br />
<br />
My vision would be to expand the use of MGB healing to limit the use of cheals chains.  Give another class or two a MGB heal, so there's greater diversity of participation and better roster flexibility.  Clerics will still be required and viable - but maybe not required in huge numbers as compared to every other class.  If they need a nudge in other areas to make them more fun/viable, do that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Gorgos,<br />
<br />
mind calculating, how you keep up the mana for<br />
- 1 Malo(s) per mob (you debuff or?)<br />
- 1 slow per mob<br />
- healing mobs damage (without backup help ;) ) - VERY crude estimation somewhere between 5.000 and 8.000 damage per mob (of course that depends, what kind of tank you looking at).<br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
handle adds/resists?<br />
<br />
What is your mana regen - 300+? Never mind, as others pointed out already, even that mana regen won't help you, when the **** hits the fan.<br />
<br />
&quot;(one shm + five dps &gt;&gt; two supports + 4 dps). &quot;<br />
<br />
That equation is wrong, because no slower is only slowing:<br />
- Beastlord: very nice dps, small tank, nice support buffs<br />
- Bard: very nice group support, some dps, decent cc/pulling<br />
- enchanter: unrivaled CC, weak dps, HUGE dps if charmables exist.<br />
<br />
You do NOT loose a full second slot with the 4 dps-group and it is much safer to split the heal/slow-duties on two people.<br />
<br />
The equation is more like<br />
&quot;one shm + five dps &lt; 0.8 healer + 0.2 support + 0.2 slower + 0.8 dps/support + 4 dps&quot;. (the 0.n just to illustrate, that literally no class is hundred percent healer or support or dps,except maybe rogues).<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
I talked about the additional risk of the shaman group already. Grouping is not only about efficiency, you also want to keep the risk of deaths/wipes limited to a reasonable amount.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That &quot;best mitigation&quot; you keep talking about has been in since kunark, and druids and shammies healed as well as each other in that expansion, ergo slow is an added benefit separate from our healing abilities just like nukes and snare are an added benefit for druids separate from their healing abilities.<br />
<br />
How many groups do you know of that -don't- have some sort of slower btw?<br />

We should have the same direct healing ability as druids. Let them keep their ich upgrades as their healing edge, since I know they'd never be happy with the same healing ability as shaman(despite the fact they were designed that way).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">While some of my fellow shamans are not “uber” in their own estimation, they are defiantly closer to uber than I am if they can consistantly solo heal in a hard Ldon.  (Or at least your tanks have much better equipment than the warriors in my guild do).  Maybe I’m just suber.<br />
<br />
If Turgurs bounces once after I malo, the tank is gonna die if I’m the only healer in a hard Ldon.  Turgurs defiantly still bounces on occasion, for me at least, even after I malo.<br />
<br />
Tnags cannot keep up with the damage out put, let alone start to over take the damage out put of an unslowed hard ldon mob.  My tank will be dead by the time I get Krags off (assuming I’ve spent the time to malo and then had turgurs bounce).  I realize that my guild does not have the best equipment (we’re not close to being elemental flagged), so the difference may be in the gear.  I’ve done hard ldon pick up groups with some folks from the top guild on my server, and they seemed to treat the adventure as a walk through Black Burrow, so maybe time gear is all that.<br />
<br />
All I can say is as a shaman with ambition, but still in a small guild without access to particularly nice gear, there is no way I could be the only healer in a hard Ldon, at least not until I can rez too, because eventually Turgurs is going to bounce, and then people in my party are going to die.  I don’t expect to heal as well as a cleric, or a druid.  It would be unbalanced if I had a CH equivalent to a clerics.  I don’t think that anyone who is asking for improved healing has asked for equivalent healing to either a cleric or a druid.  But for shamans to remained balanced to themselves we either need a real slow (equivalent to turgurs) that doesn't frequently bounce, and or lessens mitigation of slow, or meaningful increases in healing power.<br />
<br />
If mobs do not mitigate slow, and I can get it to land Turgurs is awesome.  It is over powered, and thus we should not expect high powered heals, dd, or fast dots and rains of great strength.  But the more I try for harder content with better rewards, the more I see mobs that always mitigate, and commonly resist Turgurs.  I’m not being negative or down on my shaman.  Tormac’s been my main since release.  But with increased slow mitigation, and mobs that have very high mr, forcing me to invest time and mana into debuffing, and or using the less effective disease line, I know that my ability to keep my party alive is falling future and further behind the ability of a cleric.  Maybe once the tanks in my guild hit a gear plateau, I’ll be able to be the solo healer for hard Ldons, but as of today there is no way I could keep people from dying.</div></div><hr />

Shaman bring a lot more to the table than just healing.

But 'no' you say, 'those classes are boring and suck - I want everything - I want all the power and flexibility of the shaman AND I want to heal like a cleric'.  Godmode 4 teh win!<br />
<br />
I'd like to see a druid be the primary healer on a hard LDoN with no slower.  I bet even a cleric would suffer.  How many fights would it take til the druid or cleric was oom with no slowing?  Maybe if the group was time geared and had 300+ AA - but then...in a group like that a shaman could be primary healer just fine too.<br />
<br />
Shaman *can* act as primary healer for many types of content.  If shaman could heal as well as clerics, for ex, and be the primary healer for all content there would be no reason to have clerics - since shaman can do a lot more than heal - who'd ever want a cleric.<br />
<br />
I don't know about y'all, but when I rolled up a shaman I didn't do it with the intentions of being amongst the best healers - I picked shaman because of a variety of things *including* some healing ability.  I never expected to compete with clerics as healers.  Over time, I actually have become more and more impressed with my ability to heal because it far surpasses any expectations I had.<br />
<br />
The saddest part of all of this is that most of the people whining about shaman healing are those that are in the high end for content, have regulary beat the crap out of this content, have got years of enjoyment out of EQ, could probably list numerous amazing feats and accomplishments pulled off solo, in small groups, and in full groups, and somehow want MORE.</div></div><hr />

If I had a druid dropping a quick heal while I slowed I could play prime healer and pick up heals after the mob is slowed.<br />
<br />
LOL!  Look at it another way, at what point in the fight is the druid healing?  How many of your mobs are mitigating slow in succession?<br />
<br />
If any of the answers are 1) first half, 2) 3 or more then your druid heals are really helping.<br />
<br />
How long are your mobs typically living?  How are you handling healing on named in LDoN hard?  How much time is usually left over at the end?<br />
If that druid wasn't there, I argue that you'de have a lot more deaths and your advents would go very much slower.  If you're cutting your times close, then the druid is saving you time by reducing your mana regen requirements which I assume are cut pretty tight and likely is saving you the loss.<br />
<br />
I'm getting tired of explaining obvious arguments to people who will not look at or even refute numerical data presented on these boards explaining what should be rather apparent.  If I could heal in some of these situations as well as rich waters promised, I wouldn't care about my low DPS as I would have a needed role, but as it stands, any shaman is almost a liability as by rebuilding the group and replacing the shaman the group could perform better.<br />
<br />
<br />
this is very true, at times when i look for ldon grps i get told , &quot;sorry we got a bard...&quot;<br />
A BARD !?? when i saw this, i lost it, i mean it was wrong of me to give him a piece of my mind, but the person begged me to come, making me leave a grp i was already in to play with them.<br />
most people when they think of a shaman they immediately think &quot;slows&quot;<br />
not heals, not buffs, not anything else.<br />
i was even once asked to be dps in a grp, one of the other members in the group said &quot;shaman dps? are you somking crack ?&quot;<br />

<br />
and before kuanrk when we had the same heals as druid and cleric, cleric where invite cos they where alot better and effecient at healing which was correct, druid on the other hand werent as they healing was only as efficeint as ours. therefore SoE did correct this rightly to give druids a same healing as us with our slow. but then they added slow migation and faster dps. while druid heal where actually suited for this the shamans wasnt suited to this as our spells where only slight u/g over level, rather than the direct boost druids got.<br />

<br />
I don’t know Zhahz, I think you seriously underestimate the druids in your guild.  Maybe the druids in you’re guild are all out quading in a quiet zone and never exp with you, but I’m happy to have play with the druids in my guild.  They have better healing, better burst dps, and better over all dps than I do, along with some very nice debuffing skills.  Not to mention the fact that I love Pot9.  Oh and snare.  Oh and porting is pretty handy too. Oh yeah and all the general utility spells that they share with us.  Oh yeah and tracking has its uses too.  Druids are certainly just as much “jack of all trades” as shamans are.  Maybe many people don’t realize this because they do not regularly group with them, or don’t play with druid that group regularly.<br />
<br />
As far as clerics bringing only healing to the table, you must never need paci to pull singles, cleric buffs, or rezes if things go wrong.  Tactically speaking I’d rather just have a cleric with paci to ensure we pull singles than a just a shaman to slow in most situations.  Fighting one unslowed mob seems much easier than fighting one slowed mobs and a bunch of adds from the room.  Even with root and dog parking, clerics paci seems a better way to go from my experience.  And I won’t even go to the envy I feel for the cleric I commonly exp with.  While I’m canni dancing he yaulps and actually gets to melee!</div></div><hr />

Tauran,<br />
<br />
Sure I can heal, sure I can handle healing even with 1 add BUT I know that sooner or later **** will hit the fan and the tank will die.<br />
Why? Because I can not keep up with the DPS an unslowed mob does in a hard LDoN mission.<br />
Now I can consider this and get a pally with me to spot heal but then I am not the healer in the group anymore, I can take a chanter with me and mezz a mob when the tanks goes to low to be safe and heal the tank back while the mob is mezzed, I can do a lot of things to actually make the group work but that is not what the intention of the statement was.<br />
<br />
That intention was clearly that every priest should be an option if you need a healer spot filled.<br />
<br />
And when I can not keep up, with my FT 15, my manabuff clickies, my TA, and my 11K tank then how can a shaman without those handle such a mission as healer?</div></div><hr />

This is just absurd.<br />

Anyone who thinks that all druids bring to the table is HEALING should have their head examined. Let's see... second best nukes (or 3rd, can never keep this straight) in the game, charm, snare, Bo9 (bigger hp buff than Focus, and provides mana regen), damage shields, resist debuffs, ports, and evacs. And they can heal pretty well, too - I'd go so far as to say that unless you're in a CH chain, a druid can serve as primary healer in pretty much any situation. Not to mention, guilds are using druids in their CH rotations now, too. A well-played druid brings a lot to a group.<br />

EQ is a dynamic game and the argument for the changes we want are more obvious and needed than they were a year ago.  The quantifiable proof is available on these boards and have been posted by several shaman.  Rich Waters was in a position to deliver those promises, but they have not been acted on.<br />

Druids and Clerics bring as much if not more to the table than shaman do in other utility aspects.  In buffs, we are 3rd place (other than haste when a chanter bot isn't around or FA when a BL isn't around).  Both Druids and Clerics can add more HPs through buffs than we can and 9th adds mana regen.  Druids also pack SoW, Lev, DS, ports, regen, group healing/AC/DS AA, effective DD's, DOTs with - adjustments and an animal charm for impressive DPS.  Clerics have the best HP/AC buffs in the game, best heals, pacify, stuns and of course rez.  I have no idea why you would overlook all these other abilities these classes have unless you trying to be inflamitory, you don't know, or you've got psychological problems.

We may bring more to the table, but it doesn't mean all of it is used or even useful.  Sometimes less with quality is better than quantity.  You do know druids do more than just healing, right?  They have a useful and nice atk-fire debuff, hp+mana buff, hp regen, good DS, snare, a good hp+ds AA.

Yay, another pre-school rebuttal that goes along with the &quot;if you don't like your class, reroll or quit EQ&quot; bullcrap.<br />
<br />
Not one shaman on these boards ever said they want to heal like a cleric.  Not many even said they want to heal as good as druid.  Just better than what we have now.  Stop skewing the facts.<br />
<br />
For shamans like myself who have put many years into developing ourselves, it's not so simple to just switch classes.  In fact, if I told my guild today that &quot;I'm no longer going to be a shaman, I'm going to be a beserker and will need help to plevel and flag me so I can raid with you all again!&quot; you can bet officers and members alike, will go &quot;what the hell?&quot; and might even end up with a /guildremoval.   I didn't acquire my gear just so I can switch a class.<br />
<br />
And for those who think one should quit just because one has issues, there is a thing called friends and even family in EQ.  It's not that easy to just quit, especially if there's much yet to see in the game and you want to do it with these people.</div></div><hr />

Yea, actually both stygiana  and I can cast malos+turgur in LESS than 7 seconds. I'll let you figure out how.<br />
<br />
<br />
With every heal you cast, with spell haste even, you fall behind the damage of the mob.  With spell haste, you are landing between 1.3-3k per heal with AA's and focus, but unless you crit, ANY mitigating mob hitting for 900+ per swing is going to come out ahead on the damage curve even if you chain cast Tnarg's.

As the fight progresses, the mob pulls ahead unless you crit a heal or someone is chain stunning the mob.  In those cases it isn't the shaman's slow that is saving the fight, but some other classes healing or mitigation that is.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, but chain casting tnarg's on a tank whose 1on1 with a slowed LDON mob is way more healing then they need.  And that doesnt even count Q, which should always, always be on the tank.  Q is your best friend on ldon's, if you don't have this running on the tank from before you go to pull till he's full health after mob is dead, you are doing something wrong.  <br />
<br />
Back on topic.  Stygiana, the point of my post was to say that it *is* possible for a shaman to be the only priest on a LDON hard mission (granted, they need good gear and a well geared tank).   Obviously, I would LOVE better healing or a group Q.  But I don't think it is *needed*. Shaman CAN function as primary healers in almost any exp camp.  What my post was about was shaman as healer AND slower, adding another shaman or slower would make it safer.  And yes, I agree it would be risky doing it with a warrior and 4 other non casting melee, but I would argue it IS doable consistantly.</div></div><hr />

Yes, I want to be able to heal as well as a cleric does, factoring in slow. Healing damage on a slowed MOB is where the shaman is most effective. If we can not heal on par with a cleric or druid in that situation we will get outhealed by a factor of three or more in all other situations.<br />

Give it a year and you too will group with 10K HPs tanks, 6K mana paladins and FT15 clerics. We are trying to fix a problem you are only seeing the tip of the iceberg of.<br />
<br />
I can tell you for a fact that most &quot;normal&quot; clerics/druids will go OOM in about 2-3 fights in any Tier3+ zone xp group without a slower, let alone allow them to provide any additional functionality like nukes.<br />
If a cleric goes out of mana healing I cannot even keep up in the first place.<br />
<br />
Sure their individual heals are better than our heals, but their heals do not equal 75% slow + Tnargs + Q.<br />
Actually, yes they do, given enough FT. Mana regeneration gives a proportionally much larger benefit to clerics and druids (and every other class then shaman).<br />
<br />
Our ability to heal in comparison to a druid or cleric is completely dependent upon the one spell-line that they don't get --- slow.<br />
Yes, and that unique spell line gets worse with slow mitigation and fast fights - I have not much confidence in longer fights and fully slowable MOBs in GoD. Do you?<br />
<br />
Of course, most xp groups make the point moot by getting both a slower and a healer to join up, with specific jobs of slowing and healing, so it's really tough to compare the healing impact of 2 different classes when both are present at the same time.  But if the standard group setup wasn't the way it is now, and you have 5 non-healing, non-slowing classes grouped and they need one more person to keep them alive, they need to choose the class that's gonna keep them alive the best.<br />
Speaking post-time that means a cleric, druid or paladin, in that order. <br />
<br />
This group is going to be taking on mobs with extremely impressive damage-output.  You have choices: a druid, who just blasts their heals and hope to have insane mana regen to out-heal the damage-output of the mob... you have a cleric who is extremely impressive in their healing abilities but again hope that they can out-heal a mob's damage-output and do it on a consistent basis for the group to pull continuously... and you have a shaman who's first priority is cutting each mob's damage-output by 75% and then using lesser heals to top the party's health off.  That 75% damage-output reduction is tremendous towards keeping a party alive.<br />
Where do you group that you can consistently slow fully and consistently slow before a MOB starts swinging? that 75% figure will be more like 40% in a typical LDoN hard adventure, if that.<br />
<br />
Although I don't expect an upgrade at all, I wouldn't complain about an upgrade to Tnarg's to put it in the vicinity of 2.5k or 3k in healing for raids and spot-healing improvements<br />
3K is already a lot more then I have seen most people ask for. Heck, myself I do not even ask for a bigger Tnarg's, I want Torpor II.<br />
<br />
All I know is that when our Knucklehead Druid casts one of their BIG FOOKIN heals too early on a hard mob we are usually scraping him off the walls after the fight.  Once the mob is slowed (After malos I think I've bounced 5 slows out of ~20 hard adventures) Q and patch healing work fine.<br />
If your druid gets aggro on a single MOB by healing your tank needs work. If he gets aggro on multiple MOBs you need to ask yourself if you would have survived without that heal, as you state you would rather first slow them all before healing.<br />
<br />
Let's look at it this way... In a Hard Adventure: Cleric= Heals and not a whole lot else he can do since he'll be patch healing and wooopy he might throw in a nuke every other or 3rd mob.<br />
That is more then I do if I play sole healer on hard, which is telling people to get a cleric next time if they don't want to die.<br />
<br />
His very mana inneficient DD I might add, very impressive.<br />
Cleric nukes are better then shaman nukes.<br />
<br />
I'm going to have to agree with Gorgos. Our healing is fine.  I don't know about the EQ you are playing but in mine a slower is REQUIRED for almost any exp group.  If we could handle the healing and slowing as well as a cleric/druid + slower, why would anyone ever group a cleric or druid again?<br />
Noone is asking to do cleric healing on top of slow. We are asking to heal as well as a cleric factoring in our slowing ability. That will still make us heal less then a cleric overall on multiple pulls, spell damage and AE damage.<br />
<br />
Clerics and druids have better healing and other bonuses (rez, port, better nukes, etc) because they need to make up for the fact that you have to have a slower (enc, shm, bst) in the group as well.<br />
Adding a druid on top of a cleric will both add more DPS, mana regen for the group and more healing. Slow is not needed for groups at all. It certainly is nice but slow is just another form of healing.<br />
<br />
For all of you that say enchanters and beastlords slow as well as we do, try playing them for a while and seeing what its like (its close, but no way it is equal).<br />
We are not saying they slow better then us. We say they slow a tiny bit worse and bring five times the damage to the group.<br />
<br />
Also, elemental healing and LDON hards are very possible with only a shaman healing.  Is it more risky? Sure it is but the benefits are greater as well (one shm + five dps &gt;&gt; two supports + 4 dps).<br />
You are seriously saying you can outheal two cleric or a cleric and an enchanter?<br />
<br />
Stygiana, I just don't believe you when you say you can't keep a tank in hard LDON up.  If you truely can't, you just arn't trying hard enough.  &lt;snip&gt; If you really can't do it with a warrior, just get a pally its even easier (LoH, group LoH, single target and group heals, AND stuns).<br />
Thanks for making our point for us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Mitrian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Some of you talk out of both sides of your mouth.<br />
<br />
Clearly the effectiveness of our healing is most lacking in the top end of the game.  Sure, we can be primary healer all day long in BoT and Sol Ro.  I don't think anyone is debating that.  In Time, Elementals, LDoN raids, and yes, even hard LDoN groups, our heals don't cut it.  We're a stop-gap at best!<br />
<br />
You say don't give us heals that the &quot;majority&quot; of us don't need.  Yet on the same thread you talk about how unfair it is that there are ancient spells that only the top percentage of players can access.  This cracks me up.  The fact that our &quot;ancient&quot; is a Canni instead of a heal doesn't change the fact that there's a reason for it being an ancient.  Open your eyes to the world outside your own.<br />
<br />
Don't call us whiners when we present realistic solutions to realistic issues, please.  When you are in the high end of the game (which, by the way, is what Sony developed PoP specifically for), you will see what many of us are presenting as our reality.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Shaman bring a lot more to the table than just healing.  The other priest classes do not bring anything significant besides healing, do not have the same arsenal of options, nor do they have the adaptive flexibility that shaman have.  If you are so very concerned with being the best healer then play a cleric or druid.  But 'no' you say, 'those classes are boring and suck - I want everything - I want all the power and flexibility of the shaman AND I want to heal like a cleric'.  Godmode 4 teh win!<br />
So mana regeneration buffs, better HP buffs then us, evac, damage shield, resist debuffs, ATK debuffs, better nukes then us, better DoTs then us, Track are not significant? How about rez, buffs far outstripping the shaman buffs(except for haste), spell haste?<br />
<br />
The saddest part of all of this is that most of the people whining about shaman healing are those that are in the high end for content, have regulary beat the crap out of this content, have got years of enjoyment out of EQ, could probably list numerous amazing feats and accomplishments pulled off solo, in small groups, and in full groups, and somehow want MORE.<br />
As many of us constantly state, that is exactly where the shaman class is lacking. And why would I want LESS? All I want is to go on, not necessarily as in Kunark but certainly not as it stands now.<br />
<br />
Hmm... I'm only lvl58, but with a 10 sec cast time on kragg's, I personally have a heck of a time keeping up with heals and canni as main healer in an adventure.  Throw in the slowing job....  someone's definately gunna get hurt.  Personally, I'd just be satisfied with a shorter cast time that would enable me to canni more frequently.<br />
No offense, but please, when you come in on a thread discussing 65 hard adventures, post time gear and such please do not make suggestions based on your experience at lvl 58. I will not discount anything someone lower level then me says because he is lower level but you are facing completely different issues then what is being discussed here. If you feel you need adjustments too, feel free to start a new thread, it will be a lot more productive.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, but chain casting tnarg's on a tank whose 1on1 with a slowed LDON mob is way more healing then they need.  And that doesnt even count Q, which should always, always be on the tank.  Q is your best friend on ldon's, if you don't have this running on the tank from before you go to pull till he's full health after mob is dead, you are doing something wrong.<br />
So you never, ever get a resist on slow when a MOB gets a decent string of hits? Never ever get a double pull(or more) that does not immediatly get mezzed? In either of these situations Tnarg's will not cut it, and Q is just a drop of water on a hot stone.<br />
<br />
Back on topic.  Stygiana, the point of my post was to say that it *is* possible for a shaman to be the only priest on a LDON hard mission (granted, they need good gear and a well geared tank). &lt;snip&gt; And yes, I agree it would be risky doing it with a warrior and 4 other non casting melee, but I would argue it IS doable consistantly.<br />
So you are saying you need a paladin to help you heal or a shadowknight to tap himself up in need? You contradict yourself.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>TPFKAFaern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">There was a time long, long ago when Druids and Shaman healed the same. Shaman slow was balanced out by Druid DS's, ports, superior nukes, and equivalent DOTs.<br />
<br />
Clerics did not have the &quot;utility&quot; but with CH and Rez they had their own niche.<br />
<br />
That time was Kunark.<br />
<br />
Fast forward 5 expansions. <br />
<br />
Druids have SUPERIOR heals, while the rest of the equation is still the same. Clerics have that crazy proccing hammer which goes off like a fire alarm in a roomfull of chain smokers. Clerics can pacify, stun, NUKE, etc etc. <br />
<br />
Shaman NEED something. Slow? Please. A good group in LDON Normal has told me on MORE than one occasion to NOT bother slowing just nuke and pull. (Was on my Enchanter). Oh BTW this was with a MONK tanking. <br />
<br />
Now in * NORMAL * LDON with Quiessence (sp), a Shaman can heal, slow and root. At least that has been my experience. <br />
<br />
Shaman need SOMETHING. Personally I vote for DPS because DPS always stacks (unless its Shaman DOTS - albeit I thought they fixed that).  Let Shaman melee. Double attack and higher weapon skills. Or put Shaman on Warrior melee damage tables. Certainly the Clerics won't be threatened as they'll miss the hoopla what with all the &quot;So_and_So has been smashed by the Gods!&quot; spam.  Druids?  <br />
<br />
Let me tell ya a story about a Druid I know.<br />
<br />
Was grouped with him in LDON Normal. Until I did / in dungeon I swear I thought he was a cleric. He healed that well. (Redwinger on Xev).<br />
<br />
Insofar as raids? Let each slow that lands on a MOB slow it by an additional 5%. Even if it mitigates to 2.5% there would be a BENEFIT to having multiple Shaman on a raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Yes, I want to be able to heal as well as a cleric does, factoring in slow.

If we can not heal on par with a cleric or druid in that situation we will get outhealed by a factor of three or more in all other situations.<br />
<br />
Doesn't make sense.  A slowed mob is a slowed mob, and if druids and clerics have better heals than us, then how can we be more effective?  A cleric and druid will always be a better healer than us, slowed or not.<br />

Ohhhhh.. right.  I'm just pawn in game of life.  Nevermind the fact that I play a shaman 4-5 hours a day, 7 days a week.  I don't play in the zones you do, but I do play a 65 shaman all the damn time.<br />

<br />
Yes, and that unique spell line gets worse with slow mitigation and fast fights - I have not much confidence in longer fights and fully slowable MOBs in GoD. Do you?<br />
<br />
Well, seeing as how GoD hasn't even been released yet, I can't give input on that... and I find it amazing that you can.  As for mitigation, I encounter it quite often, and ya know what? I make do.<br />
<br />
Speaking post-time that means a cleric, druid or paladin, in that order. <br />
<br />
Really?  Without a slower?  Amazing.<br />
<br />
Where do you group that you can consistently slow fully and consistently slow before a MOB starts swinging? that 75% figure will be more like 40% in a typical LDoN hard adventure, if that.<br />

Well I'll tell you where: BoT, CoD, PoV, Tactics, LDoN, HoH --- I'm not elemental yet, but I do quite a bit.  I do this neat little trick called &quot;malos on INC&quot; --- works great for gettin that fella slowed within a few secs.<br />

Ever hear about pacification? Blessing of the Nine? Virtue? Supreme druid nukes? Snare? Charm? DA? Ressurection? Not half bad negative resist modifier DoTs? Neat damage shields? Did I mention supreme druid nukes? Oh and evac? Condemnation? Supreme undead nukes?<br />
<br />
You must be smoking some great crack if you think other priests only heal and they got no other options. Granted clerics are pretty much tied up with healing, but even they have some very nice non healing abilities. Not to mention druids are one amazing class that can do a lot.<br />
<br />

- If I'd get 10 bucks everytime I hear this retarded argument, I'd be rich. How many times people have to spell out for you and your horde of people who don't want or can't understand one sentence: NO SANE SHAMAN WITH A HALF BRAIN WANTS TO HEAL LIKE A DRUID OR CLERIC. Get it? One simple sentence. Jesus goddamn Christ, think two seconds before you spew some garbage like this. Now repeat again: NO SANE SHAMAN WITH HALF A BRAIN WANTS TO HEAL LIKE A DRUID OR CLERIC. Get it? Now, your homework will be to look up and understand a simple word: balance.<br />
<br />
Shaman *can* act as primary healer for many types of content.  If shaman could heal as well as clerics, for ex, and be the primary healer for all content there would be no reason to have clerics - since shaman can do a lot more than heal - who'd ever want a cleric.<br />
- Read the paragraph above.<br />
<br />
The saddest part of all of this is that most of the people whining about shaman healing are those that are in the high end for content, <br />
- When you are actually done with farming Sebilis or Lower Guk, and move to higher game content, then maybe you will realize that mobs (1) Hit a tad bit harder and (2) They mitigate slow. Oh and, someone whining about others whining is really sweet irony. You do realize that it will make you a whiner also right? <br />
<br />

Not at all - I may be a litle out of touch but I have not forgotten everyone who is not in time. However please try to understand that the problems high-end shaman are facing will trickle down to everyone sooner or later. You probably already experienced part of it, and it gets much much worse the more FT, mana, focus items or generally speaking, gear and AA the people you group and raid with get.<br />
<br />
When I do LDoN adventures with a high DPS group the only reason I still slow is because I have a slow stick. Even on hard adventures just my feeble healing is probably better. I cast cannibalize maybe once every 5 MOBs because mana is coming our of my ears. That sounds great but it is the same for everyone else. Most other classes can barely manage to run our of mana in an adventure, casting at every opportunity.<br />
It is even worse on raids - it is real rare for anyone to go even somewhat low on mana on raids, certainly for a caster, hybrids still go low on mana, if very slow.<br />
<br />
Shaman have two things they do well, slow and make mana. Both are being marginalized - one with faster fights and slow mitigation, the other by every other class receiving a tenfold increase in mana regeneration while ours merely doubled.<br />
<br />
Just because this is currently mainly a high-end problem does not mean it does not need fixing.</div></div><hr />

Sure, we go on and on about how shaman dont run out of mana (I do), but no one's hurting for mana nowadays.<br />
Some of the assumptions that shaman healing are balanced against have changed.  In the past, a shaman could heal well with slow and canni.  Due mostly to the fact that the cleric would have to med while the shaman could cast more continuously.  Druids were actually the odd man out.  Things have changed and shaman want a little boost in places, just like the other priest classes have already recieved.<br />

<br />
1- Maybe if you cant handle Hard adventures.... your group isnt good enough yet.  &quot;Good&quot; is the wrong word, &quot;well equiped&quot; is probably better.  You think a Scrubby arse group with 4k hp tanks and casters with half a spell book are sitting around picking their nose waiting for their corpses to pop talking in group going &quot;Jeeezus guys what was that???! I sure wish they gave Shaman better heal spells!&quot;<br />
<br />
2- My gear is as you see it in my magelo.  No I dont have FT300+ *shrug* maybe I just canna better than you. (I dont even have a IH4 item yet btw).   <br />
<br />
3- Pssssst dont you get it? We have the same friggin spells morons!  My heal= Your heal.... My C5= Your C5... I think you know where I'm going with this.  Okay so now we've established that all Lvl 65 shaman heal the same given the same AAs *Gasp* you mean if I have more AAs I will be better than someone with Less AAs? Surely you MUST be joking! So then what's the difference? My tank? He's a SK and he doesnt have anywhere close to 7k hp unbuffed.  But we've worked out a plan... see we cover our short comings with smarts.  I'll even give the clueless shaman an idea of how to do it.  On the incoming have the snarer (In our case the SK) Snare the mob.  This will give you more than enough time to Malos and Stick slow.  Mob comes charging, you Snare it and have your tank walk backwards gaining agro if the mob turns at you.... RUN like a scared little girl!  Cuz you gunna get smoked if you dont.<br />
<br />
4- *sigh* I knew I shouldnt have even mentioned the druid being in the group... It's true he has healed our group.  And what I meant by &quot;nothing I couldnt have handled&quot; is that as I'm casting my heal, that moron decided to &quot;help&quot; and used his 2k heal to top the SK from 95% to 100% WTG!!!  But we have infact gone through many runs where the Druid never cast one heal (Even just to top off).<br />
<br />
I dont expect to go into the Elemental Planes and bitch that I cant heal well enough in those groups.  It's a very hard zone and it should require a well ballanced group to handle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Ciele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Its not setting the bar low at all.

lol.<br />
<br />
What is the best damage mitigating in the game?  Single pulling is with lull or feign death, you easily avoid tens of thousands of points of damage over an hour with these tools.  <br />
<br />
Mezmerise comes a close second and is superior in other ways.<br />
<br />
Root can mitigate up to huge damage when used in crowd control.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>kayen85</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">I so appologize to go agianst public opinion but I like shaman healing...<br />
<br />
There was a lot I wanted to write in concern to our healing but I can basically boil it down to a few main points. First though I will state I know as a shaman that I can heal with Q and Tnargs in high end situations 990+ midgates, its not theoretical I do it on a constant basis(In bazaar &quot;trash&quot; gear). Any comments in this post are related to mobs who hit on the level mentioned above and healing tanks with moderate AA and gear. There is no purpose is talking about healing or the dimished shaman role in groups like regular ldon which are so trival that it flat out doesn't matter what your class make up is, or what the class is doing for that mattter.<br />
<br />
Tip of the Day. <br />
If your the only healer and mobs produce very high dps. Just have everyone/you root the mob on inc then slow it then engage. Might take a few extra seconds but sometimes you need to adjust how you play to fit the situation.<br />
<br />
Will use Hard ldon's as example. <br />
- You can you be the only healer/slower in your group (not that I recommend to but will come back to that). No other single class in the game can assume that position. It's what makes shaman unique and of course your ability to this is only stronger at the lower high end of the game say BoT. While our healing power is dimished as mobs hit harder so is that of of all priests. Of course we can't keep up with an unslowed 990 hitter without draining our mana chaining tnargs but what do you think clerics and druids do? They chain their fast heals too and while they are a bit more potent they aren't so much so that the mobs are trival without slow thus you still need a slower. 10 second CH is not going to be fast enough for reliablity in an unslowed situation. Back the point of that while you can do performed both slow and heal duty for a group there is absolutly no reason in the world you should choose too. Consider that both druids and clerics REQUIRES a secondary class to slow or I assure they won't be able to keep up with mob DPS. So lets look at some possible combos for a conviential ideal group.<br />
Primary Heal Slower<br />
Clr/Dru         + Bst + 1 tank + 2 dps + 1 CC<br />
Clr/Dru         + Enc + 1 tank + 3 dps  <br />
Clr/Dru         + Bard + 1 tank + 3 dps <br />
<br />
Perfectly sound groups and I don't believe a group has to have a shaman to function by anymeans thats what is great about eq you can be flexible. But what do all these groups lack? Secondary healer. It's rather intuitive that as the mobs hit for more damage the roll of a secondary healer is more important (Please no: I group with 10k time equiped paladins and clerics cause most people don't). As I mentioned before the one slowed mob vs group any healing class can handle fine. The problem is the unexpected add, the bad string of slow resists ect... Having a shaman to spot heal the tank and/or cleric is extremely valuable to a group and  you can do it with plain old tnargs and it works just fine (note the heal is only 500 less then what druids use thats not exactly a make or break diff when mobs hit for 990). My second point is that you can heal as primary if you have another slower just like every other priest class, you may spend more mana and have to work a little harder but I promise you your tank isn't going to die if the mob is slowed(even w/ midigation). Take a bst or enc, you both slow on inc, one will land and take it from there but just focus mainly on keeping Q up and tnargs when needed. <br />
<br />
This brings me to an interesting observation on game balancing.  If you go back to the chart of primary heal or slower I could easily fill in my shaman a one or the other or in a pinch both (3rd choice primary healer, quite competent for slow). It's clear that clerics only fill in the primary healer roll and druids can fill either healer or dps (druid dps is not usually the first choice). So you have the strongest healing class able get one spot. Second strongest healing class 2 spots one more desirable then other. Third strongest healing class able to get 2 spots one more desirable then other. To me that looks balanced...<br />
<br />
I have witnessed more players die to a slowed mob while a cleric healing then myself. Ever hear this &quot;Crap my CH landed a second to late&quot;. When your best heal is a 2.5 sec 1600-1800 heal and you need to keep casting it your tank say when he goes down to 60% he isn't going to die as long as you keep hitting the button. Yes it takes a bit of mana but our mana regen rates quite more then compensate and its completely in your control weither he lives or dies not the control of the random number generator durring that 10 seconds. And even though mobs hit for 990 they don't have a ton of hp's thus your not going to go OOM unless your group has no dps(then you prob wouldnt be healing anyways). That old argument that the mobs don't even have enough hp's that I should bother slowing or it makes slow worthless should be enough to reinforce that if you are slowing and healing you shouldn't have to be healing very long.<br />
<br />
In conclusion. Shaman can not do everything for a group on his own with no penatly, but if you choose the risks you can provide a service for your group that no other class can, heal and slow.<br />

With mitigation the difference between it and Turgurs won't even be that big. Certainly not big enough to bother blowing mana and time on Malos/Turgurs. If Turgurs is getting busted down to like 40%... 60% is going to be like 35%. Oh nos~ :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

It is not possible for a shaman to do so.<br />
Sure it is possible for you, it is possible for me and for a lot of other well geared shaman.<br />
But do you think it is possible for KurthMcdonough (not picking on your gear or anything Kurth just needed an example).<br />
<br />
And that is where things go wrong, when you need items to perform a basic function of your class.<br />
<br />
We could have a long talk about why mudflation helps creating this problem and why that is wrong but I think we both know the answer.<br />
<br />
Sorry Stygiana, just a quick comment ;). If you say that about shaman, you would have to say that about any class. If KurthMcdonough should be able to do that content without the gear you guys have, then you should equally expect the tanks KurthMcdonough usually fights with to be as effective as the tanks you fight with. And you don't see too many people suggesting that should happen. The ability to peform the function at a basic level is intrinsic to all classes of course. All warriors can taunt, but they cant perform as well as others if they dont have the armor and weapons. Likewise all shaman can cast spells, but they can't use those spells as well as others without the gear, that is part of progression in the game. When your gear is inadequate to perform that task at a particular level in the game, then maybe you shouldn't be performing that task.<br />
<br />
More generally, reading through the various posts in the thread I was struck by one thing that recurrs in many of them. A lot of people are comparing the healing offered by clerics and druids (presumably with with slowers) to shaman who both slow and heal. Yes, under that scenario it is very difficult, but it is also an unrealistic and unfair comparison. I don't know about everyone else, but groups I'm in as primary healer also have a dedicated slower (usually a chanter or BL) unless the content we are doing is trivial for the group. Another thing which seems to be a recurring theme somehow is the idea that our healing matched with our slow should somehow match other priests healing matched with other class slows. This is typically summed up in Sharok's earlier post:<br />
<br />
- most non-shaman groups will have another slower class inside (sure count their mana cost for 1 or 2 slows per mob into the equation to be fair).<br />
- additional risk of shaman healing, while the mob is unslowed or resists<br />
- substantial better/more versatile set of healing tools of cleric and druids<br />
- additional risk, when adds or ANY critical situation occur (due to our lack of ability to pump out large amout of heals fast). Our heal/second rate is by far the lowest of all three priest classes.<br />
- aggro risk for the slowing shaman (who is healing the healer, when he gets stomped to bear paste by a 500+ tripling mob?).<br />
<br />
The pure, raw numbers show only a part of the picture.<br />
<br />
There was some massive number crunching done a few weeks before on this board, if you are interested in more data (too lazy to search  ), that show some of the problems, when taking such additional influences into account.<br />
<br />
In other posts we have (judging from their magelos) clearly experienced shaman saying that they have no problems healing if the group makeup is appropriate.<br />
<br />
Going back to the original post in this thread:<br />

How do the priests compare: (A) soloing - Druids way ahead, Shaman ok, Clerics well......*snickers*; (B) groups - clerics ahead as primary healer, required on tougher content, Druids ok as primary healer on trivial stuff, otherwise a secondary healer/secondary nuker, Shaman preferred slower, ok as primary healer on trivial stuff, otherwise secondary healer/secondary CC; (C) raids - clerics required class - primary healer, druids - secondary healer/secondary nuker - stackable, but you don't really need them, shaman - primary slower/secondary - required class, but doesn't stack well.<br />
<br />
Obviously value is not going to be absolutely level in all areas of the game, the different priest classes do different things. You can't judge value by picking on one aspect alone. Overall the classes are roughly balanced and multi-dimensional, certainly much more so than at earlier times in the game. The devs probably believe that to be the case, so they likely consider priests balanced. That's not to say they won't consider tweaks as the game develops, but at the momement major changes are unlikely.<br />

We are effective healers now. Those who doubt that clearly don't remember the era before tnargs/kraggs, when torpor was a rarity and the exclusive domain of the elite. There is all this talk about how we have fallen behind. I don't know, but that has to be some really good crack you guys are on ;). In the modern game the gap between clerics/druids/shaman healing is much smaller than in days gone by :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Those are obviously raid mob AEs Jzak. The expansion is slated for 50 and up, meaning that will likely have a mob level progression similar to that seen in PoP. You aren't going to see those AEs on yard trash in the entry zone of the expansion ;). There are allready mobs in the game with AEs not too different from those. Guilds that raid in PoP have strats for dealing with those mobs and I'm sure they will develop strats for these.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">kayen85, although i can see what you are getting at, i dont believe you have given a good arguement,<br />
firstly<br />
&quot;Primary Heal Slower<br />
Clr/Dru + Bst + 1 tank + 1 dps + 1 CC<br />
Clr/Dru + Enc + 1 tank + 2 dps <br />
Clr/Dru + Bard + 1 tank + 2 dps &quot;<br />
<br />
all this group only have 5 people? if you had a cleric and a druid or 2 or either you have a back up healer and more than enough healing to heal unslowed mobs. and in these cases there are slowers. so the extra cleric or druid can nuke the mobs for more damage than shaman can as a back up healer. also booth druid and cleric can root to. both can lull, druid only outside, but cleric anywhere. this means they can reduce the likelyhood of bad pulls.<br />
<br />
next.<br />
&quot;Tip of the Day. <br />
If your the only healer and mobs produce very high dps. Just have everyone/you root the mob on inc then slow it then engage. Might take a few extra seconds but sometimes you need to adjust how you play to fit the situation.&quot;<br />
<br />
not all mobs are rootable. and root can break quickly. this also applies to the other priest but a good tank should tak the ones that cant be rooted while any other can be.<br />
<br />
also<br />
&quot;When your best heal is a 2.5 sec 1600-1800 heal and you need to keep casting it your tank say when he goes down to 60% he isn't going to die as long as you keep hitting the button&quot;<br />
<br />
are you talking our best heal? our best is 1950 but 10 sec cast? or oiur best fast heal is quick heal is 1300. now maybe you have the aa for healing which will put that up to somewhere about what you say, but for a druid or cleric is does the same. except their heals will be great than ours. and so really better back up.<br />
<br />
the point you miss is, why would you want to get a shaman, who heals less, does lot less damage, and who slow is only marginally better? and pretty much irrevalant when mitagation is counted? groups are now better balanced without shamans.<br />
<br />
again i point out just because you can do something doesnt mean poeple will bring you to groups. soon enough peopel will begein to realise what i and many other shaman can see, and that is you dont need shaman anymore. this is what poeple are fighting against.<br />
<br />
finally.<br />
Tauran <br />
<br />
&quot; Well said Kayen.&quot;<br />
<br />
seems you dont look at things critically, but all is good and rosie if it support your veiw. But there are players who see a different side and i still think their view is valid. Just becasue when you have all the aa and some nice top end gear it becomes easier, doesnt mean that other class with same gear and aa wont find it trivial where you find it hard . back to point just because you can, don`t mean that a differnet class  can do it alot better and easier, it is all comparsion.<br />
<br />
Tugela , for once your post are ok. but<br />
&quot;Overall the classes are roughly balanced &quot;<br />
this is the point shaman are not balance correctly this is what we are argueing, in most points the balanceis small but large enough to cause proeblems, admittly some argue for too much, but better to argue for too much and get what you need rather than argue for to little and get nothing or tiny u/g.<br />
&quot;We are effective healers now&quot;  we are not effective healers, we can heal but not effectively , we are effective backup heal, but all other priest class are better, thats about it..<br />
<br />
and if you have a slower already, but no healer then shaman would be last resort as a healer (ie no druid or cleric available) i would imagine given the right aa and equipement as palidin could function as a main healer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Those 'clearly experienced' shaman do not represent the 63+ shaman as a whole, neither for AA, gear or experience.<br />
<br />
I don't want to belittle those ubers in any form ;), but when you base your arguments only on that PART of all high level shaman, your arguments will be staying flawed from the start.<br />
<br />
Maybe that's a general point. In my opinion you have NO chance to achieve any class balancing, when you focus on the top-end of the player spectrum.<br />
<br />
I will keep it at that with a general disagreement, seems rather pointless to continue that discussion for another year :).</div></div><hr />

Yes I remember those days, when we had long and heated discussions about the drop rates on those spells.<br />

<br />
Also when you play your warrior as your main, and your shaman as a funny twink do you really think you have a good overview of our problems? or do you think you just do not see the problem?<br />
<br />
the fact remains that our healing was balanced in a pre-mitigation era.<br />
When mitigation was introduced our healing was not upgraded and our slow was downgraded.<br />
So all i want is to be able to perform as a healer again and for SoE to correct this situation, I dont want to have a cheal, i dont want to be the main healer in every situation, I dont want to be irreplacable BUT I do want to be able to keep a tank up in the zones they designed for my level of players</div></div><hr />

No - a cleric and even a druid will heal better on unslowed MOBs then a shaman heals if he has to slow first.<br />
<br />
Yes, under that scenario it is very difficult, but it is also an unrealistic and unfair comparison. I don't know about everyone else, but groups I'm in as primary healer also have a dedicated slower (usually a chanter or BL) unless the content we are doing is trivial for the group.<br />
Of course in that situation the group would be much better of with a druid or cleric in your stead.<br />
<br />
Another thing which seems to be a recurring theme somehow is the idea that our healing matched with our slow should somehow match other priests healing matched with other class slows. This is typically summed up in Sharok's earlier post:<br />
You took a single point out of Sharok's post and failed to adress the others. What happens when you get a hasted LDON hard MOB that resists the first slow (after Malos)? This will happen sooner or latter and in that situation people get splattered all over the wall. Similar things happen on multiple pulls - a paladin or druid or cleric will handle those a lot better then a shaman.<br />
<br />
How do the priests compare: (A) soloing - Druids way ahead, Shaman ok, Clerics well......*snickers*;<br />
I kinda agree - though shaman are not too well off either. Only druids can have worthwhile soloing abilities.<br />
<br />
(B) groups - clerics ahead as primary healer, required on tougher content, Druids ok as primary healer on trivial stuff, otherwise a secondary healer/secondary nuker, Shaman preferred slower, ok as primary healer on trivial stuff, otherwise secondary healer/secondary CC;<br />
For most exp groups a druid will be nearly as good as a cleric, while providing mana regen and damage shield damage(at the very least). The secondary nuker part is flat out wrong. Druids nuke on par with magicians, second only to wizards. Add to that damage shields and charm (and DoTs at least on par with shaman DoTs).<br />
<br />
(C) raids - clerics required class - primary healer, druids - secondary healer/secondary nuker - stackable, but you don't really need them, shaman - primary slower/secondary - required class, but doesn't stack well.<br />
You need exactly as many druids as you need shaman - one. Shaman debuffing is replacable by magician casting malos and enchanters slowing. Sure, shaman do it a bit better, but we are hardly required (which is fine - no class should). And shaman stackability is, as you admitted, horrible.<br />
<br />
Obviously value is not going to be absolutely level in all areas of the game, the different priest classes do different things. You can't judge value by picking on one aspect alone. Overall the classes are roughly balanced and multi-dimensional, certainly much more so than at earlier times in the game.<br />
What 'one value' would that be that we are picking on? I am glad though you realized that we do not in fact have more utility spells then other classes do.<br />
<br />
We are effective healers now. Those who doubt that clearly don't remember the era before tnargs/kraggs, when torpor was a rarity and the exclusive domain of the elite.<br />
Rare spells do not make a class less powerful as such - it means a lot of people will not reach their potential. Conversely common spells do not equal power. If every shaman would be handed a full spell book upon leveling would we heal better?<br />
<br />
There is all this talk about how we have fallen behind. I don't know, but that has to be some really good crack you guys are on ;). In the modern game the gap between clerics/druids/shaman healing is much smaller than in days gone by <br />
If you mean that now clerics and druids are superior healers in every situation now (that is, in time gear) whereas shaman used to be the best healers in long fights you are correct. I am not saying that we should outheal clerics in groups, but to state that our healing actually caught up to clerics is simply false.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem with torpor, aside from the issue with the drop rates, was that it snared and slowed the person it was cast on, which weren't exactly desirable properties for melee. Allthough you could heal efectively with it, at the time I used to use it mostly for downtime or caster healing only, with chloroblast and sup heal as combat heals for melee. That didn't really cut it imo. Kragg had some uses but wasn't that popular since it was slow casting for the amount healed.<br />
<br />
When they redid the priest healing spells for PoP we initially had an upgraded version of Kraggs on test briefly as well as tnargs, that corresponded to the druids upgrade for their 58 75% CH. I think the spell was a ~3k heal, but it was removed from Lucy after a very brief period. It wasn't a very popular spell from what can recall. Most thought it too small. The Devs evidently thought that we either didnt need the spell or that it was overpowering, who knows. That was after Rich Waters made his quote, so its likely that that the heals we got in PoP was their version of what priests should look like at that time</div></div><hr />

<br />
That beastlord is gonna need a healer and maybe a back up healer to round out the group. He might even need a shaman/bard/chanter for resist debuff to land slows on hard even single group content. I've seen what happens when a shaman is replaced by a bst even in BoT. What was a smooth running group can go bad quickly or at the very least slow to a crawl when the bst calls out his 5 resist in a row on slow and we have to add in another person just to help the bst land slows. At that point why not boot the bst and get a chanter/shaman who can debuff for himself and land better slows, even if not a lot better.<br />
<br />
A cleric needs a slower and maybe a back up healer for some content. Not to mention that clerics slower will need a mr debuffer at times.<br />
<br />
A shaman needs a healer back up, he's self contained slow and mr debuff. And can be primary or back up healer.<br />
<br />
A chanter definately needs healing, he's not gonna slow everything and keep himself and a group alive.<br />
<br />
No class out there can slow for a group, debuff for himself and keep a group alive, except shamans at certain levels of play and with a little luck some pretty impressive levels of content.<br />
<br />
Why should a shaman be the one class who doesn't need a little support? All the other slowers lack in mr debuff ability, healing or both. Yet shaman debuff their own slows resist and can heal respecteable enough to keep a tank alive vs some fairly high level content(even if a little luck is needed at times). <br />
<br />
All I really want is canni 5.1 or something. A big chunk canni spell with a long refresh time. I don't want more mana regen, just all that tapping of canni 4 condensed into one button push and a 45 second recast or something. I know this isn't important to many of ya, but I use canni 5 and still tap canni 4 constantly. I wouldn't mind to mana inefficiency of our nukes and other spells if I could cast the actuall damage or heal spells more often, rather than spending so much precious time in todays EQ of fast furious rights, hitting canni over and over and waiting for spells gems to refresh after. To be clear its not laziness, its the fact that while I'm tapping canni, I'm not healing or dps, I'm doing nothing.<br />
<br />
Oh well, sorry if I came across as saying shaman don't need anything. Just saying all classes have weaknesses, its way to easy to just look at a classes slow % or a non slowing classes heals and say &quot;they are replacing shamans!&quot;<br />
<br />
edited btw I good place to start is meaningfull buffs. In todays game even my twinks are nearing max stats in their important stats. Not more buffs to cast but something unique added to the all in one focus line. I dunno a little raw stacking attack, mebbe a little bit of stamina regen even if small, 5 percent overhaste, a tiny stacking damage shield, a plus to riposte chance, ANYTHING to make us the melee buffers again. Stats never did mean a lot IMHO, but being a buffer was obviously a huge part of our class, I have 30 pages of physical stat buffing spells to prove it:) I know some will groan, I don't mean another perma mem'd ferine spell, just some perks added to our mostly useless stat buff line. As the game progressed its funny we only cast our focus line for hps, thats ironic we got a nice all in one spell and nowdays our tuna line is all we really get out of it on most people we cast it on besides alts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It would be nice to be able to function as a main healer outside of easy xp situations.  It would again be nice to be capable of functioning in a dps capacity, but we have the hand we're dealt.<br />
With the level of equipment and aa's available, there are few places where a shaman can be the main healer where a paladin cannot.  A shaman will give a bit less downtime beweeen pulls.  But if the content is not manageable with paladin heals over time+quicks, it wont be managable with shaman heals over time+quicks.  Neither is acceptable in raids or more than trivial xp content.  A great many people dont seem to think its asking too much for paladins to get a better raid-worthy heal, yet the same people complain that shaman shouldn't.<br />
Sometimes I wonder if the current devs really DO see us as a hybrid class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">Personally I would say that we should be healing at about 3/4 of what druids are healing now so that we can actually make a DENT on the damage that a mob is doing.  And the druids and clerics should be healing about about 150% of their current so that they can have the option of going it without bothering to slow (with their DS's and reverse DS's upped in value to make them even desire such an option).<br />
<br />
<br />
  I really am tired of a game where everyone is nearly afraid to fight a mob without it being slowed.   People should be perfectly willing to take on the majority of the game with STRAIGHT MELEE.  Debuffs should be somthing extra... not something required.  If that were ever the case then shaman would still be unique in being able to debuff strongly (partially matched by enchies) instead of EVERY debuff being whored out to the entire EQ community until we wonder why we don't just /follow the healer and go watch a movie.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">A cleric needs a slower and maybe a back up healer for some content. Not to mention that clerics slower will need a mr debuffer at times.<br />
<br />
A shaman needs a healer back up, he's self contained slow and mr debuff. And can be primary or back up healer.<br />
<br />
A chanter definately needs healing, he's not gonna slow everything and keep himself and a group alive.<br />
<br />
No class out there can slow for a group, debuff for himself and keep a group alive, except shamans at certain levels of play and with a little luck some pretty impressive levels of content.<br />
Yes, shaman are indeed the only class with both slow and heal - every class has a unique combination of spell lines. I do not see druid heals getting nerfed for having 9, I do not see cleric rezzes nerfed for having complete heal, I do not see beastlord slows getting nerfed for having paragon of spirit.<br />
And I do not agree that only shaman can keep groups alive in extreme situations. Clerics and paladins do far better in most 'oh ****' situations and druids do at least as well as us.<br />
<br />
Why should a shaman be the one class who doesn't need a little support? All the other slowers lack in mr debuff ability, healing or both. Yet shaman debuff their own slows resist and can heal respecteable enough to keep a tank alive vs some fairly high level content(even if a little luck is needed at times).<br />
(speaking post-time, on mitigating MOBs) Druids heal better then we do even without a slower and do more damage on the side and can give mana regeneration to the group and have at least as much utility as we do.<br />
<br />
All I really want is canni 5.1 or something. A big chunk canni spell with a long refresh time. I don't want more mana regen, just all that tapping of canni 4 condensed into one button push and a 45 second recast or something. I know this isn't important to many of ya, but I use canni 5 and still tap canni 4 constantly. I wouldn't mind to mana inefficiency of our nukes and other spells if I could cast the actuall damage or heal spells more often, rather than spending so much precious time in todays EQ of fast furious rights, hitting canni over and over and waiting for spells gems to refresh after. To be clear its not laziness, its the fact that while I'm tapping canni, I'm not healing or dps, I'm doing nothing.<br />
And that is only going to get worse as everyone gets more mana regeneration while only shaman have horribly inefficient spells to make up for our shrinking advantage in mana regeneration.<br />
<br />
btw I good place to start is meaningfull buffs. In todays game even my twinks are nearing max stats in their important stats. Not more buffs to cast but something unique added to the all in one focus line. I dunno a little raw stacking attack, mebbe a little bit of stamina regen even if small, 5 percent overhaste, a tiny stacking damage shield, a plus to riposte chance, ANYTHING to make us the melee buffers again.<br />
Did you even read the proposal? You just typed out this huge post detailing why we do not need enhancements and then repeat some of the biggest parts of the proposal word for word.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What is the best damage mitigating in the game? Single pulling is with lull or feign death, you easily avoid tens of thousands of points of damage over an hour with these tools. <br />
<br />
Mezmerise comes a close second and is superior in other ways.<br />
<br />
Root can mitigate up to huge damage when used in crowd control.<br />
<br />
Snare can mitigate up to 100% of damage when kiting.<br />
<br />
You are talking about damage avoidance. These tools are used to avoid incoming damage. Slow is used to mitigate or lessen incoming damage.</div></div><hr />

I was going to post that this wasn't true, and then I started working on the math... not gonna post all the numbers, but, basically, shamans' slow+heal is better than druid healing without slow only if the mob slows 75% (full).  Any mitigation at all and you're correct: the druid heals better without slow than the shaman does with (although only with KR, not with sylvan infusion, which remains worse even with 75%/50% mitigation.. only surpasses tnargs with 25% mitigation &quot;slightly&quot; slowed, which is hardly any mobs in the game).<br />
<br />
Shaman really aren't healers at all anymore.  We've had that role completely taken away from us and replaced with that of the &quot;slower&quot;.  We really belong more in the category of enc/bst now than dru/clr.<br />
<br />
As such, though, we really ought to have better dps.  Enc, in addition to bringing more useful buffs to the group, can really dish with charm.  Bsts just dish, period.  If I'm going to be thought of as a slower, don't penalize me for being able to cast a 1300 hp heal.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">This is just absurd.<br />
...<br />
Clerics are a different story. CH has been their albatross for a lot longer than slow has been ours.<br />
<br />
You forgot snare for druids. Some mobs run at low health and with a runner it can get ugly.<br />
<br />
Well, clerics still have kazad / virtue, BoR, stuns (hello gater!), rezz, good nukes and some decent melee DPS when undeads are around. And more then one time a cleric saved the puller with DA / CR without getting agro. And they can pacify. Sounds like a little bit more then just healing.<br />
<br />
I don't want to be able to be main healer for any XP group. I wish TM would be faster (3-3.2sec to get effected by spell haste items, or right down to 1.5-2sec). 3.8sec are ****ing slow for a patch heal. Of course I wouldn't mind if SOE would make TM healing 1.5-1.7k. And the HoT we get with GoD isn't that I would like to see. Sure, 360HP / tick are +20% to Q but Q was / is still a weak for higher EPs / time. I would be so happy about 400-450 HP / tick for 300-350mana...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u79"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p79">If a cleric goes out of mana healing I cannot even keep up in the first place<br />
Hello!  You completely missed the &quot;unslowed mob&quot; part of my statement.  You need to work on your reading skills.<br />
<br />
I kinda missed this one and I feel it is worth saying it again: PoP and to a lesser degree SoL and LDoN increased the amount of mana regeneration available to all classes. However this was a flat increase, meaning everyone got a potential extra 50 or so mana per tick - regardless of how well that class regenrated mana before. Now, no matter how casual or how uber, how hardcore or laid back you are there will eventually come a point where noone really goes out of mana in a LDoN adventure or a short raid. That means our mana regenration ,which we pay a high price for in terms of raw spell power and efficiency is completely or at least largely negated.<br />
<br />
In addition to that individual fights got a lot shorter and nastier in terms of MOB HPs and MOB damage. LDoN also introduced a need for constant movement and due to zone design a need to be able to handle multiple pulls or an efficient way to split them.<br />
Shorter fights mean our slow is devalued because the amount of time the MOB is slowed grows smaller compared to the amount of time the MOB is unslowed (the time spent debuffing it).<br />
Harder hitting MOBs mean higher damage spikes and thus a need for fast, big heals.<br />
Constant movement means less cannibalizing - other classes mana regeneration is not similarly affected.<br />
Multiple pulls again devalue slow and add a need for group and/or fast heals.<br />
<br />
Now, on top of that you add slow mitigation, which easily halves the effectiveness of slow, even when looking at the lowest amount of mitigation and you have several factors that, while not individually all that bad, combine to vastly reduce the amount of healing, damage prevention and mana regeneration a shaman is capable of.<br />
<br />
Back to your statement - Yes, given sufficient gear a druid will outheal a shaman even without a slower in his group and he will add more HPs to the group and he will add mana regeneration to the group and he will deal more damage then a shaman. To counter that a shaman will have his feeble group haste - single target haste will cost too much mana and time to even halfway keep up with the druid's healing.<br />
And to top it all off that is the most favorable shaman position - it gets a lot worse if you compare damage potential, healing with an enchanter in the group, group heals, pacify and such.</div></div><hr />
