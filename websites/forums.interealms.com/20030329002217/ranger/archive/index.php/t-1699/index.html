<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mythryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A friend and I play on the Firiona Vie server and recently took to dueling as a nice way to pass the time while people are afk.  We duel only down to 1 red bubble so as to not cause too much downtime ;).  The problem is, I haven't yet beaten him.  I buff up, camo, and root his pet immediately after he accepts the duel.  I snare him via tangling weeds/snare and stick to him as to try and interrupt his spells.  He kindly responds by standing right next to his pet, forcing me to either melee or pull back and plink away.<br />
<br />
I haven't yet tried all out bow kiting, I don't know if I could dodge his missile spells fast enough while staying just out of range of his other spells (using trueshot bow and range 100 arrows).<br />
<br />
Is it possible to beat a mage at these levels?  Am I missing something?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Strongboww's corpse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You could always move vs. getting hit. even aoe rain can be negatived if you move fast enough:)<br />
<br />
<br />
Mage missile spells do not &quot;track&quot; they are a straight line of attadck deal, just like bows, but slower</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>farmatyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Don't remember where I read this, but it seems like a wonderful strategy. First, get him on tracking before you start the duel. Don't touch the pet at first. Instead, snare the magician. This will agro the pet, who will run after you. There is a fairly short range on how far away the magician can issue commands to the pet, pull the pet way far away from him, cancel magic if you have it (if not, use a 2 hander for the DS) and kill the pet. It takes 6 or 8 seconds to resummon a pet at level 16, so he doesn't have much chance to get a new one up before you interrupt him. Don't dot, nuke between swings, and beat him down while he tries to channel through with a couple nukes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Maed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">group with him and camo him so his pet goes bye bye.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mythryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">*bonks self*  Those last two suggestions are so apparant (running pet out of range; invising mage).  Invising the mage is especially evil &gt;:-&gt;, I'll have to try it.  Thank you both.  I have dodged both the rains and missile attacks, but missiles act like arrows, and they can take sharp turns (just not along the z axis).  I love dunes ;).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>SolipsisSaVatar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Root the mage first, then root the pet.<br />
Also make a hotkey for hide and when ever it refreshes, turn off attack, hide, and resume attacking<br />
<br />
/attack off<br />
/doability 1 (assuming hide is in your first abilities slot)<br />
/attack on<br />
<br />
If you hide succesfully you will drop off the mages targetting.<br />
<br />
<br />
**edit-forgot you don't get hide until 25, root the mage! :)**</div></div><hr />

Also, con pet.  If pet is green, run out of mage's range and simply kill pet.  Mages can be tough.  I found that ignoring pets in dueling helps, they are far less of a threat than the nukes from caster.  Also important as ranger against mage: Endure Fire- with DRT and endure fire, my fire resist is 57.  Mages only have fire and magic spells, not cold like wizzies.  Thistlecoat for extra ac and little dmg sheild.  And snare.  They hate this.  Once snared most try to run away somehow leaving back open to higher dmg hits.  And if he stands there by pet, use lowest delay weapon you have to interrupt, and use kick only when he begins casting as ensured interrupt.  You end up with dead mage and poofed pet who dies with the wussy mage.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>f15e0476</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think its a heck of alot easier to kill a mage at hig lvs then low lvs.  Low lvs are hard to duel mages.  At 54 i just straight up don't cast or anything on a mage just beat them to death.  Dueled a 54 mage 5 times in a row and splatted him all 5 taimes couple did come close.  Mage pets are so easy to resist its not even funny.  Just ignore the mage pet and run at the mage swinging with a good 2 hander.  If  u stop to root that pet or do anything with it.  Mage is gonna be able to get a few nukes in which hurts 80 dam or so for your lv  700+ my lv hurts u got to keep him on the run.  If its a earth pet and it acually roots u nuke him while u are rooted.  I know its harder to resist the earth pet at lower lvs is why i was saying its hard to win. U can try to root the mage and snare him if u like and his resist are low.  I don't spend much time trying over and over to get a spells to land 3 times and i am done trying.  That is just my 2 cents on dueling a mage its more for higher lv  then lower though.  I would say root or snare the mage pet when lower lv to get him out of the way since it is more of a problem having it root u.  And just ound him as hard and fast as u can.   I say 2 hander cuase he can dam shield himself and that hurts with 1 handers.  Hope this helps sorry its so a crappy post but i am at work at shouldn't really be on here lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Filledubois</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well, I wouldn't try that with a really high-level mage with their epic pet. If they're that far along, they probably have root too (Earring of Living Slime is mage-usable and has unlimited charges of Root). Their epic pet has a massive damage shield and, in duels against a well-played, well-equipped Ogre warrior, wins almost half the time. That's the pet only - no mage nukes involved.<br />
<br />
I'm sure there are good tactics against uber-mages, but I don't know what they are. Getting rooted and beat to death by Uberjabober is no fun, let me tell you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Elured</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Not particularly appropriate to rangers, but funny:<br />
<br />
60 non-epic druid (highly contested VSR, grar) duels epic 60 mage.<br />
<br />
Druid wins 3 times in a row; pet dies instantly at the beginning.<br />
<br />
Mage is going insane!<br />
<br />
Star rubies sure are costly, but boy was it funny.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>oodd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Get a fast 1hs weapon to interrupt his casting.<br />
<br />
Open fight by letting him pet you.... back up and bring the pet with you out of his range so once you root it he either has to <br />
A) Run to it so he can dispell root<br />
B) Fight with no pet<br />
<br />
Then proceed to melee him and if he tries to run its like reverse bow kiting  =)<br />
<br />
Funniest thing when ppl run from rangers it like playing into my hands.  I can just track you and I prefer to kite you with my bow and just save my kick/melee to rush in and interrupt if you try to SS/Gate.<br />
<br />
Most pet classes do not practice good pet control in that they wont  /pet back off if the pet gets to far away.</div></div><hr />
