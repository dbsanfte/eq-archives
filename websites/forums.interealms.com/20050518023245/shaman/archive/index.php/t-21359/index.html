<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does anyone know if there's a place to get technical info on everquest models... I would probably ask this on the dev boards but they're set up so that only SOE employees can start threads ... <br />
<br />
I'm talking about polygon counts, texture sizes, number of bones, animations and such... I know the old school bear form had 3 heads and about 695 poly's but it's one of the few I've been to get ahold of... Like what would be the poly/texture budget for the Blunt kitty of justice for example... or an eventual bear form upgrade. <br />
<br />
I remember seeing screenshots of the original vah shir model rendered in wireframe back when luclin was coming out.... I'd love to see more of these. This is mostly a personal interest since making mods isn't an option but I am pretty curious... <br />
<br />
Granted that releasing this information might be unwise as there's bound to be polygon envy between the classes. OMG! The clerics have a higher resolution texture and 5 more poly's on their epic !!! This is a slap in the face !!!!  :D  :D  :D  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I was actually looking for something like that the other day (but more a &quot;triangle/polygon counter display&quot;). This way, I could try to see if I could figure out and see whether or not EQ is laggier than ET because of a crappy engine, or just tons more polys (thinking a combination of both)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well these things yu mentioned are still in conceptual stages, so guessing their poly count is kinda hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">A ballpark figure would let me start having fun with the 3d modeler :) . But like I said, since you can't make Mod's for eq, it's mostly a question of curiosity. <br />
<br />
As for performance... I'm no programmer so the game just works or it doesn't.... I'll assume they're doing their best to find a good compromise between graphics and performance.</div></div><hr />
