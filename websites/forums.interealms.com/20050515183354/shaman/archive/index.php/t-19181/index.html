<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Rumor has it that the Dev's have confirmed (somewhere) that raids in GoD are going to be designed for 54 people.  Can any confirm or post a link?<br />
<br />
I must say, that's really gonna suck if it's true.  Forcing guilds to recruit is one thing.  Forcing them to downsize is something entirely different.  This is especially true after guilds had to beef up in PoP.<br />
<br />
If this rumor is true, you'd think Sony would know better than to screw with average raid sizes given the present sizes of guilds.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">54 is kinda logical, I was thinking about this and thought if they are going to reverse the mistakes of large raid sizes they need to do it gradually not from say 72 to 32. 72 to 54 even though is still a kinda of a big jump, you naturally get people leaving, by adjusting the recruitment rate I don't see it as too big of an issue apart from the &quot;suddenness&quot; (can't think of better word), which 72 people raid forces will be subject to and the problematic perhaps lack of people when time is to be farmed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ciele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">When the raid feature was first put in during PoP it was originally limited to 60.  Unfortunatly that was way too few to defeat the early content without the subsequent mudflation from better equipment.  Now you can do everything in PoP with 60 people when it was first released, and untuned there was no way you were going from Plane of Tranquility to Plane of Time with a 60 person raid.<br />
<br />
Of course they quickly raised the raid size to 72.<br />
<br />
I'm sure something like that will happen with GoD.</div></div><hr />

Landragoran,<br />
<br />
i can understand, that you want to get content usable for your playstyle (assuming a rather, large hardcorish guild there). But we do NOT need any more expansions, that are designed focussed only on some specific part of the playerbase (be it uber or casual). This utter nonsense started in PoP has to end, better sooner than later.<br />
<br />
We need content and expansions usable and enjoyable by ALL players and guilds of all possible sizes and styles.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If there was actually worthwhile loot dropping in LDoN raids, more people would do them. Only because PoP introduced 72 man raids, we now can't go back?<br />
Do you know how many guilds started to struggle and had to mass recruit for Time? To be able to field 72 people on any given day, you'd need a roster of 150 people and that's where the problems start. The more people you have at a raid, the less the individual(skill) matters.<br />
<br />
No content in the game should ever take more than 40 well geared players(read: 2 months worth of end zone gearing up later). So 54 is what you are aiming for at the beginning.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Personally, I'm all for lower numbers for raid content.  Pre-PoP raid sizes were much smaller, and people had a lot of fun then.  I don't see why just because PoP required zerg-sized armies,  every expansion after it has to as well.<br />

<br />
Yeah, but this is fine- at least in this case they didn't force you to buy an entire expansion, most of which you won't use and will never see, just to get the convenience of PoK books.  I applaud SOE for the design of this expansion thus far. There is absolutely zero reason for a casual to buy it, but unlike Luclin (bazaar), LoY (bank space, armor dyes), LDoN (1 group casual alternative) and PoP (PoK books), they're not bundling core game essentials into an expansion and calling it expansion content.<br />
<br />
Let other people buy the expansion if there's nothing for you as a casual- at least this time you're not paying for something you won't use anyway.<br />
<br />
Kudos, SOE!</div></div><hr />

I also find it humorous that people are ok, with having to exclude people from your guild, to do a raid.  Would these same people, with their close knit groups/ friends/ guilds, like to tell a group of their buddies to sit this raid out, there just isnt any room?   Then why is it ok, IF you are elemental flagged?  /boggle  The most logical thing in this whole thread, was where someone said dont limit the size of the raid (up to 72 of course), and just go with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">There is absolutely zero reason for a casual to buy it...<br />
<br />
I'd be satisfied if this was the case.<br />
<br />
You may be right in saying that this expansion is being designed for the benefit of the ubers - after all many of the Devteam are now recruited from them - but if only the ubers (about 10% of the playerbase) buy this expansion then its sales would be unprecedentedly low.<br />
<br />
So I expect the Devteam will make sure that there are features in GoDs that will persuade casual players to buy it.  Still, from what I've seen so far everything is open to question: only the most naive casual player will be preordering this expansion.</div></div><hr />

I dont think many of us here knows how many 3 group targets there will be in GoD. There could be tons for all that I know. But if there are none at this point I bet its too late to complain.<br />
<br />
As far as I know you bought LDoN and farmed the hell out of it even though you knew in advance that there were no 3 group raid targets. So as long as you buy it and spend lots and lots of hours in it even though you dont like large (?) parts of it do you honestly think SoE will focus on improving those things you dont like in the next expansion?<br />
<br />
My guess is they will try to make some raids that satisfies guilds like FoH and Afterlife to make them keep playing since lots of people look up to them and try to be like them (=much more time spent on EQ). And to ensure that enough people buy GoD they will make something that is appealing to casual players which the new berserker class might very well be since it will have to be pretty interesting from the start to make people start a new character from scratch. What gets left out are the &quot;in-between&quot;-guilds because they are not &quot;worth&quot; focusing on.</div></div><hr />

A mere three weeks from release and there is absolutely nothing of interest that I can tell for a casual player.  No one I know and play with on a regular basis is buying this- most of us consider WoW our next expansion since we will never finish seeing all of EQ as is before that time.  GoD breaks the tradition of bundling core game upgrades into expansion content, but is a return to a true expansion, ie, you don't lose anything major w/o buying it.<br />
<br />
If the spells were significantly better than they are thus far and obtainable w/o either raids or a ton of AP's that might be a viable casual hook, but certainly that isn't the recent track record.<br />
<br />
Save your $30 (or whatever) if like me you see nothing of benefit to your playstyle.  At least you're not subsidizing someone else's enjoyment a la PoP.</div></div><hr />

Lost Dungeons of Norrath adventures were a great addition to EQ. They are a perfect thing to do when you only have a handful of friends/guild members online.<br />
<br />
However, smaller guilds need new content that allows them to work together as a team too. When I start having to cancel my planned raids and tell people to &quot;go do adventures&quot; instead, because we can't find any raid content suitable for us that is available - they are not going to be happy. People will burn out on adventures after a while if that is all they have to do, and start to quit the game.<br />
<br />
Planes of Power had some very nice options for us: Bastion of Thunder Towers, Overlord Banord Paffa, Mujaki the Devourer, Drunder Minibosses, Plane of Storms events. I just hope that Gates of Discord has some similar content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Y'all are forgetting a couple big things casual players will want:  spells and AAs.  Now I know that the spells as they stand on Lucy are pretty blowy, but we all know that's just SOE mind games, and in fact some of the latest changes have actually been halfway decent spells.<br />
<br />
And then there are AAs.  There's innate run speed 2: the return of innate runspeed, which may or may not become a requisite AA like the original.  There's more regen, a second specialization, and a chance to channel through stuns.  There's an AA that let's your group buffs affect pets (although it costs an insane 20 AA).  And then there's a whole lot of crap: two pet buffing AAs, critical DoTs, an endurance regen AA, and Spirit Call 2.<br />
<br />
Now admittadly most of the shaman AA blow more than (insert crude reference here) but this is just the alpha/beta/soemthing like that list of AAs.  And even if the list doesn't change, there's a bunch of cool AAs for other classes (Fing clerics get Gather Mana and a chance to come back to life when they die!) so casual players of those classes will buy GoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">I see lot's of problems with balancing content vs. scale of the encounter.<br />
<br />
My guild is quite large and LDoN for RAID content has been a total bust for us.  We are currently having about 10-20 people wait on a list in TimeA while we have a full raid of 72 clearing B.<br />
<br />
If GoD raid content is set to 54 what then?  SOE will be putting us in an impossible position as far as maintaining status quo with the guild and keeping everyone happy.  In theory LDoN raids make a nice alternative to when there is simply NO content available in PoP, which happens a lot these days with so many people in the elemental planes, however again accomodating a large guild where you can only take 36 people isn't going to happen.</div></div><hr />

But SoE are only concerned about 2 things:<br />
<br />
1. Are you going to buy the expansion?<br />
2. Will you keep on p(l)aying if the expansion is not everything you want it to be but still has a few goodies?<br />
<br />
If enough people dont buy it and/or cancel their accounts I am sure SoE will work their butts off to improve the game for us. If it goes like it always does and most people buy the expansion and keep playing because there is no real competition then I have very low expectations of the amount of fun in the GoD-expansion.<br />
<br />
My personal &quot;usage&quot;-% of the last 2 expansions: PoP 10%, LDoN 5%....yet I still bought both and I am still paying. So blame me ! LOL :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">There are lots of content for 18 people to do, you know why you don't do them? because the loot sucks compared to what you can get with more. <br />
<br />
What you guys want is better loot, less people to get the loot, that does not make any sense. 18 people fun raids? take out inny in LOY.. ya doesn't happen because you get a 80hps ring that's dropable from elem tradeskilling.. that took 60+ to get. (beating rz). Take out trak take out lots of stuff (vindi is fun), do 18 man ldon raids (too hard? that's the challenge and it's doable).<br />
<br />
What people want is time caliber loot with gore caliber difficulty.<br />
<br />
Guilds are recruiting more and more to be able to get to time, like you need 72 active people so you have to recruit more than that to field that much on a semi constant basis. Now you tell the guild to cut that down that's crazy people will get their feelings hurt. <br />
<br />
What I hope for are 18 man trials that lead to 54 man trials, that lead to an open area where you can fight some other things, pop like/time like kind of virtual flag that lasts a month or something like that.<br />
<br />
That would give decent loot to the 18 man people. Better loot to the 54 man people. Then after that the world is open, your guild is 70? run through the 54 trial x2, your guild 50 and you beat the 54 man trial x1 now do the main encounter(s) and see what happens.<br />
<br />
This can change too like you need multiple 18 man trials multiple 54 man trials. So when a 72 person raid does the 54 man trial they can switch up members and do a staggered flagging runs through the trials. (appropriate loot for each trail based on difficulty).<br />
<br />
Even better would be if a lot of encounters had locked doors where you need to beat a crazy enounter to unlock it, the unlocking only lasts say 15 min not long enough to get to the unlocked door. So guilds would have to cooperate. You do the unlocking encounter we do the door behind that. and change it up. Lots of fun stuff can be done like that, requiring multiple guilds to do multiple encounters at the same time in different zones, end result being some kind of raid points for all the guilds involved. This can be scaled in many ways too. bah I type a lot at work =]</div></div><hr />

<br />
What you guys want is better loot, less people to get the loot, that does not make any sense. 18 people fun raids? take out inny in LOY.. ya doesn't happen because you get a 80hps ring that's dropable from elem tradeskilling.. that took 60+ to get. (beating rz). Take out trak take out lots of stuff (vindi is fun), do 18 man ldon raids (too hard? that's the challenge and it's doable).<br />
<br />
What people want is time caliber loot with gore caliber difficulty.<br />
<br />
You are incorrect.<br />
<br />
We like our guild's size. We do not want Time caliber loot. We do not want to participate in huge raids. We want more encounters like the ones that I mentioned:<br />
<br />
Bastion of Thunder Towers, Overlord Banord Paffa, Mujaki the Devourer, Drunder Minibosses, Plane of Storms events<br />
<br />
with loot that allows us to improve our characters, even though it will never approach the loot obtained from twelve group raids.<br />
<br />
We have done Vindi and Trak many times.<br />
<br />
I *really* wish Sony had created some LDoN raids with 18 people in mind, rather than 36. If there is a LDoN raid that is reasonable to attempt with 18 non-elemental people, then I would love to try it. Please let me know which one.<br />
<br />
I want to see NEW content designed with smaller raid forces in mind. And no - I do not want to see all of the loot rot when we win - because that is no fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Hmm with the same logic a raid of 150 people should get the best loot of them all. However, this is not fun. <br />
I do think raids should be smaller but there is a big difficulty in how do you differentiate people. How do you prevent raider_24 Guild_x having exactly the same loot as raider_24 Guild_y. I think with the technology of instancing SoE are considering this question on Eq2. Since before instancing, smaller guilds meant more competition on targets and other problems.</div></div><hr />
