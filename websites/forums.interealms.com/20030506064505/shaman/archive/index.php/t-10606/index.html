<br />
Anyone have any good ideas on a nice replacement? I've already got one ss bracer. On dragon alignment, etc etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I just upgraded my Coldain bracer with the Bracer of Deep Sea from NToV.<br />
<br />
Are you searching for the exact focus effect? Or do you just want a better bracer?<br />
<br />
If you want that specific focus effect you are stuck with Bracelet of the Deep Sea (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=5831)</div></div><hr />

Spirit Wracked Chord :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ArminiusXev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah I agree, up till today I was torn where I was gonna put that cord that I am soo close to getting. Now its a no brainer.</div></div><hr />

I missed something, what's the change pls ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tallanas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yes, more info please, I am mid-way through this quest, and if I don't need to waste my time on it because it has been nerfed, then please let us all know!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Unconkable</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It use to work on slows and snares and the such. Now its strictly dots :(</div></div><hr />

I have just flicked over to the general forum and read the sticky thread...<br />
<br />
How depressing. A HUGE nerf for the higher level shamans, but even at my mid level, this has just screwed two pieces of gear and made it FAR harder to solo. Those adds wont be rooted as long, nor slowed as long...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Either the sta or wis braclet from UP...12 ac, 6 to all resists, and 15 stamina or wisdom.<br />
<br />
barbed rubicite 13ac, 35 mana/hp (i think?), 5 int/wis<br />
<br />
cultural is pretty good too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>malden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I had just finished the quest Monday night to get mine. Talk about a let down. :( <br />
<br />
Guess I will need to work on getting a few levels so  I can start attending HoT raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">#1 - No cultural for vah shir<br />
<br />
#2 - Spirit wracked cords are slated for my arms. I just need the urn, got everything else (undead dragon sinew) and ally faction and the 2nd quest's ring. It's lore so I can't wear it twice.<br />
<br />
#3 - I guess I'm looking for a good hp/wis combo. Looks like Barbed Rubicite is the best so far, as ss is only 20 hp. As I am already clocking in at 248 wis, I really don't need more wis... in fact I've been thinking of swapping some items to lower wis and sta in exchange for more hp.<br />
<br />
Self buffed, my sta is 263, and sta over 255 generally yields less hp than under 255. And if I ever get a decent bp, that'll add more sta...<br />
<br />
So I'm going to pass on the Bracelet of Sense route or the Bracelet with sta, since either gives me diminished returns at this point. <br />
<br />
Looks like barbed rubcite it is. <br />
<br />
Unless there's a better new pop chain wrist?<br />

*grumble grrrr*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Anything above the barbed rubicite is pretty much Vex Thal, VP, or tier 3 planes loot.  Looks like I'm headed for barbed ruby bracer as well ..  /sigh.</div></div><hr />
