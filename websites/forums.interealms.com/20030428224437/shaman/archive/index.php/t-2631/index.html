<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ender</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Made a shaman on fennin ro. Currently about 57 and some decent gear. Epic/Ntov sheild and other stuff. Check magelo if you want to know more. Fact is I want to trade this shaman on fennin for a similar one on Xev. Regret &quot;trying a new server&quot; and adapting to people I dont know and a server I was really new to ( still am ). So if you are interested send me a tell :) or email at eqbobmar@netscape.net.<br />

Need we say more?&quot; Thanks. and what am I doing wrong with my magelo? doesnt seem to have the link effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ender</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Also that I want to do it because one of my family members (on xev) where my monk is. We grouped all the time and I wanted a shaman and try a new server. Now im cpmpletely regreting it. He wants me to get on xev as much as I do with my shaman. I will so not do it if I have to strip epic/ntov/no drop gear. Sorry. Aint happenin ) So do what you please. Rare that I will geta reply on someone. Am considering similar trades on xev like a 55+ enchanter or 54+ cleric etc. Want to bring him over the xev with my best bud.</div></div><hr />
