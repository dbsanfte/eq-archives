<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dashel</div><div class="date">04-30-2002, 10:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This past Saturday, my girlfriend tells me she is going to do some charity work with her company.  Sounds great, no worries.  She then proceeds to tell me its in Harlem.  OK, still so far so good.  Now I ask well when are you leaving and how are you getting there?  She tells me she is leaving at 7am, driving into the city and taking the subway from there.  <br />
<br />
For those who do not know, Harlem is uptown in Manhattan (NYC).  It is a lower income area and is predominantly a black and hispanic community.  It was my understanding that it was not a great place to be, especially for a young girl by herself on the subway.  I told her no way is she going by herself, I had thought she was meeting people at work and all going in a group.  <br />
<br />
Long story short I went with her.  We got there with absolutely no problems.  We were not sure we were going the right way after we got off the subway and I asked 2 guys passing by if they knew where the street  we were looking for was.  They were both very polite and helpful.  <br />
<br />
The area was clean in general, especially by NY City standards.   The buildings were a surprise to me; great architecture!  Some really stunning churches in particular.  <br />
<br />
Anyway we got to where we all had to meet up and set off to the local YMCA to start painting.   Everyone we met involved in this was great.  All the people from the community were saying thanks to us.  It was awesome.  We had a good turn out and we got the job done by about 2pm.  Had a great lunch donated by deli, and had a good time doing something nice for some neighborhood kids.<br />
<br />
I felt so damn guilty for worrying about letting my GF go alone to Harlem.  I feel that if she said, “well we are going to do work in Midtown”, I wouldn’t have said a word about it.   I know better now but does that make me a bad person?  I mean, her mom and dad called to see how she was doing.  She told both of them where she was going and they didn’t say a word.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On the flip side, her company wouldn't have set up the project if they didn't feel it was reasonably safe to do so, and from what I've heard, Harlem is a lot cleaner and safer than it was 20 years ago.</div></div><hr />

It is tough being a woman and living in a city.  I always am checking behind me when I walk to my car if I go to the store alone.  My husband always asks me to wait until he can go with me which is sweet but sometimes I want to be alone.  But I do feel better knowing that he cares enough to worry about me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You were worried about a loved one, due to a perceived threat.<br />
<br />
You cared enough about BOTH that loved one and the work they were going to do that you went with to help instead of forbidding her to go.<br />
<br />
You were wise enough and open minded enough that you also updated your opinion about the area in question.<br />
<br />
If more people were like you, we wouldn't have as many societal issues as we do...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rankil</div><div class="date">04-30-2002, 10:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The guilt and sorrow you'd feel had something bad happened would far outweigh the guild you feel for possibly over-reacting.  As a student on a quiet campus in Northern New York I hate when my girlfriend goes places alone, especially at night.  The threat there is minimal, but still enough to cause alarm.  I don't feel that you over-reacted and be happy that you had a nice day in the city doing something good.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At any rate its stupid to go to ANY part of town good or bad alone and ESPECIALLY if your a young woman.<br />
<br />
By simply going as a pair you are practicing smart safety.  And frankly it sounds like the charity thing might have been good for you too and was probably a great bonding experience with your girlfriend.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't feel guilty... Providing for the safety of you and your loved ones is perfectly natural.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kahla</div><div class="date">04-30-2002, 10:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Depends where you are in Harlem, My brother used to live in Harlem but he was just on the edge of it near Columbia where he was going to school.<br />
<br />
Certain parts of harlem are not the most fun places in NYC.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are insurance companies bad because they charge more for homeowners insurance in neighborhoods with higer crime rates? I don't think so. It's a calculated risk, and if the crime rate is higher, the risk is naturally higher.<br />
<br />
The bad area of Denver is Five Points - nowhere near what you would find in Chicago or New York, but still.... The shop owners and many of the homes there have bars on the windows. Is it because they're prejudiced? No, they're prudent. I've met very nice people in that neighborhood, but I still won't walk there at night. I cleaned and cooked at a homeless shelter in that area - but during daylight hours only.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dashel</div><div class="date">04-30-2002, 11:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the support everyone,  makes me feel better.  I'm probably more guilty of being over-protective than anything I suppose.<br />
<br />
Bleh I dunno I just felt guilty because, i'll be honest I didnt want to go. I had a pre-conceived notion about the area.   I'm really glad I went now.<br />
<br />
Anyway thanks again for listening. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nitefox</div><div class="date">04-30-2002, 12:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We would call you stupid if you hadn't gone with her.  Nothing wrong with being cautious.  I'm sure people in that neighborhood would have done the same thing.  You did the right thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aelitan</div><div class="date">04-30-2002, 12:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think you were wrong at all.  Here's a possible flip side for you to know that you're not alone.<br />
<br />
I'm a competitive shooter.  Not to drag guns into this, but my wife and I shoot Sporting Clays.  We have a club with a very good safety record.  Anyone is welcome to join the club, we have all walks of life, ages, genders, whatever.<br />
<br />
We had a tournament a few weeks ago.  Normally, we get a local youth organization to score for us, as it frees up the members to enjoy the tournament.  We donate a sum to the organization that pays for uniforms, trips, whatever.  Plus the competitors all chip in at the end to tip the trappers for their service, which also goes to the organization.  This time, we had a local high school football team.  It was my job to show the kids what to do, what to say, and how to do their jobs.  Only one of them had been there before.<br />
<br />
About a half dozen of the kids were african-american.  While talking with one of the chaperones, she told me that these  kids were scared out of their wits.  I realized why as I was asking.  A bunch of young black men coming out to a club back in the woods filled predominantly with middle-aged white folks carrying guns.  <br />
<br />
At any rate, I made sure all the competitors treated the kids with respect and kindness.  There's no place for being rude to someone trying to help you.  The competition went off relatively smoothly, the trappers did a great job, and everyone had a fine lunch together afterwards.  As I spoke to them, every one of them asked me to try to get their team again next time.<br />
<br />
It's human nature, nothing to be ashamed of.  I know that I would have a problem with my wife going to certain portions of our city at night alone.<br />

My uncle moved to Denver from Chicago a few years ago; I was showing him around and I'd comment on this or that area being unsafe, to him they looked like solid well-kept neighborhoods.<br />
<br />
It is human nature to fear that which is strange, some of that fear may be perfectly reasonable, however, much is not.  That is why it is worthwhile for people to expand their knowledge of other people and cultures, even if those things are in your own city.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tevyn</div><div class="date">04-30-2002, 01:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I always thought the bad part of Denver was a bit closer to South Park...... :D</div></div><hr />
