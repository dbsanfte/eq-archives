<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok beyond our big stuff, like healing the controversial new slow and all the other yada yada we talk about.<br />
<br />
<br />
Throwing.<br />
<br />
I think everyone here has pretty much at one time or another looked at the cleric melee upgrade and gone *** is this shizit. Well, this is a way for us to get back a lil ground there while remaining unique to our class. So we dont get bash. Im a 300+ pound barbarian chiseled out of rock, but a thin lil female elf can out bash me. She can out bash a 400+ pound ogre thats 3 times ( literaly ) her size. Ok whatever, it doesnt make sense, but its obviously not going to change for us at all. <br />
<br />
So they should give us throwing. Give us a very down graded version of the zerker throw. Heck just give us a trainable throw, to say 100 or 150, something that will make throwing these potions they gave us semi dependable. You cant deny that the shaman is inately a tribal entity. They are spear chuckers, our very epic is a spear.<br />
<br />
No this doesnt make all our problems go bye bye, but cant you deny that having a semi reliable snare option, that has a down fall of costing money every time we use it, would be a good thing. That draw back i think would balance it for our class. Besides, i cant imagine too many people complaining about us getting snare, especialy with the lack of imagination that has gone into us for quite some time. It would extent our utitlity roll, it could give us a stun ability that can replace our lack of bash also.<br />
<br />
So what you think ? It just seems a natural progression with all these shaman only made potions we are getting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>kyrial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd be happy with just<br />
a) a new heal<br />
b) a nuke that's not crap... <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Unless I can throw healing potions (at players) I'm going to have say that I'd prefer they focus on the big controversial stuff (or keep ignoring us, which seems alot more likely).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just give up. The way shamans are now is the way they are going to stay. Atleast until WoW is released and probably even longer (=forever).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">We already can throw our potions. The problem is the potions, not our throw skillz.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">yea but our throwing skill sucks, hence you miss with the potion..<br />
<br />
*edit*<br />
<br />
well i thought it was a good idea /shrug   oh well, back to bitching about the usual stuff i guess. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Throwing things as a means of DPS that cost as much as our potions do would cost ridiculous amounts of money, unless we got something like &quot;Endless Bearskin Pouch&quot; or something.   :D<br />
<br />
That being said...feh, I'd rather get real upgrades than this.   :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">DPS ?<br />
<br />
Im talking utility.  Snare and Stuns is what im talking primairly. besides, why does it have to be either/or. Like i stated in my first sentance, this topic was meant to be about something OTHER then the normal grips that are repeated over and over in so many threads. Was a fun idea in my book and if nothign else gave you a chance to not think about how screwed we are or arent.<br />
<br />
Anyway, i would still love it :)  Give me snare and a trainable throwing skill so they dont miss, a stun that i been wanting since level 20 and it would be a nice chew toy for sure. I mean just think about stunning a giant as he gets ready to gate, how many times have you not exp'd in a area cause you didnt have a stunner or even a snarer. No this wouldnt replace people but would help us fill in another utility roll and give us more desirablity in a group and flexabity in a role.<br />
<br />
Honestly my idea was that we would get another line for shaman only, like these potions, but lower cost and stackable.<br />
Endless bearskin puch is a fun idea though :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">its not gonna happen, no way does Soe want shaman to be even more desirable. We got thrown a bone imho with PoP mobs needing to be slowed, they surely aren't gonna throw us one were we can snare, stun etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Either remove slow mitigates and only put it on name<br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
add an AA that reduce slow mitigates<br />

<br />
we are fall behind priest class because we have powerful slow spell, but our slow are slowly nerf by add mitigates mob everywhere + mob die too fast</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I dont hold my breath for any changes any time soon.<br />
One huge ass petition and giant sized feedback later, with daily /feedback reports, various emails from likely every member of the Crucible that gave a rats posterior and the only Dev comment that we can get is that one about 'we know Spirit Call 4 and 5 are broke&quot;.<br />
I know that is a milestone, hell any Dev comment right now is nothing less than a miracle...but I dont expect SOE to do anything fun, give us any upgrades, or give us any bones at all.<br />
The new potions are a nice toy, and excited me initially, but now? Meh, its nice to be GMd in alchemy, but buying an expansion just for that and some marginal spell upgrades, AAs that NO class is happy about and getting my ass handed to me by light blues isnt what I had planned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Lemy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Frankly I want the HP portion of our Focus to get a serious upgrade or just give us a 1k  HP buff that stacks with all HP buffs.<br />

But its sad how quick this thread went right back to the same old issues. Was hoping we could avoid the same old arguments and explore a NEW and FRESH idea. I mean what does thowing potions have to do with slow mitigation, Spirit call and bad healing ? <br />
<br />
Mind you im not disagreeing with you on anythign anyone said above or even blaming you for frustration cause i understand it. Was simply hoping to aviod it.<br />
<br />
Nevermind though, sometimes shizit doesnt work out. Tis all good my friends, all good ;)<br />

But I do not want something beyond our big issues. Fun, small abilities are for classes without big issues, so they have something to play with while other classes get fixed. We do not need toys, we need fixes.</div></div><hr />

anyone who says this has never parsed a clerics melee dps, I do roughly 20-25dps on a good proc day, or just about what shaman pet does, in no way does cleric hammer procs mean anythign infact I still feel kinda silly swinging a hammer when the group is too good for the area we are in and heals are not really nessisary.<br />

I think shaman were never concerned about the hammer and proc, it was the bash ..<br />
<br />
Atleast thats what im talking about, hence why i thought throwing stun potions might be fun.<br />
<br />
Hey it works for the beserkers, they gotta but stuff for their snare and stuff, so i figured something cheap like that....  but anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I like it, it goes with my opinion that shaman should get a low capped double attack and a better slam, shaman have drifted miles from the course we were on when the game came out. not that its not expected but we are falling further behind with every expansion. giving us thrown potions and not giving us a throwing skill is just one more insult. really what are they smoking/snorting/shooting at sony to come up with this crap? its as if someone were activly trying to piss off the shaman comunity.<br />
<br />
once upon a time we were the best of the priest melees, we have a line of spells designed to buff our melee abilities, we have an aa that increases them further...to bad its all 5 expansions out of date (I pulled the number 5 out of my ass, I really dont care enough to do the math)<br />
I played a rogue when eq came out, I could give you a list of crap I suffered through til that class was fixed but what it comes down to is this, while not as broken as rogues were shaman have been in need of a major fix for a helluva lot longer with out the slightest hint that there are fixes coming.<br />
<br />
so yeah on top of the big stuff this would be a nice addition.</div></div><hr />
