<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">they totally dropped us right after our epic.<br />
<br />
they introduce the epic after we can all be lvl 50.  they give it to us with a totally new melee skill of piercing.<br />
<br />
if you are over lvl 55, go to the bazaar and tell me what piercing weapon you are saving up plat to buy.<br />
<br />
go to allakhazam's look at piercers, and from PoP you see two.  the crap Tribunal Loyalist, and Times Antithesis.  TWO on a whole EXPANSION!  one, no one will use; the other so few will get.<br />
<br />
worse?  i did not see a single shaman piercer on allakhazam that came from Yekesha.  not one.<br />
<br />
our melee skills suffer so badly, the avatar proc'ing stuff is better off on any other class that does not have the ability to already cast avatar.  our melee skills suffer so badly that on the high end, if the weapon does not have a clickie or great proc or effect, on the medium end a good proc or decent effect, and on the low end a poor proc; we have nothing to equip.<br />
<br />
so many of us use the Delightful Orb of Forgotten Magic for the proc, (cold based just like our spells) and it is ALL/ALL.<br />
<br />
haste items are just as bad.  so so so few are marked shaman that a solo'er ends up using one marked ALL/ALL if they want to melee.  and not a single shaman useable weapon has haste on it.<br />
<br />
i know.  i know.  95% of the shaman on this board to not care about melee, do not care about haste, do not care about the ATK number.<br />
<br />
but, we all had to beat on stuff to at least lvl 34 (over half our lvls), and probably lvl 50+.  i beat on everything that is not going to rampage and kick my butt, or takes a MAgro or MTank (depends on your server) with a dedicated healer.<br />
<br />
i have tried to say before we were falling behind on the gear.  unfortunately, the ubers just looked to see if they added more gear slots that had 100hps or more.<br />
<br />
i will not equip a book in primary.<br />
<br />
i will not wear a dress.<br />
<br />
i will not start a BST to be my Main.<br />
<br />
when Sony finally says that is the vision for shaman, i will cancel my account.</div></div><hr />

True, they could have just left it as us having 1hb and 2hb ONLY.<br />
<br />

This and the rest of the no piercers except for Tribunal spear and TA are a good point.<br />

We aren't a melee class.  We can get haste through other pieces.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
No, we care but we realize we are a caster class.  We can put out some melee, but that isn't what we are designed for anymore.<br />

We have one or two robes shaman usable and only iksar and frogs have a robe graphic.<br />

 WE ARE A PRIEST CLASS GUY.  Our melee is not important.  Try to root and dot some mobs, if you want to try to tank mobs that hit for 500+ please go ahead.  When pop was released our solo tactics changed from slow and tank to root and dot.  Yes, i miss slowing and tanking but now adays this is not possible.  Our melee skills are all capped at 200, One hand blunt, 2handblunt, 1hand piercing.  Before you complain about skill caps look at knights and thier 2handed caps of 225.<br />
Go re-roll as a beastlord man, stop posting this crap.  We are not a melee dps class.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kenton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">We are not melees or a hybrid of melees. I will agree I dislike the Sony vision of shaman lately but it has nothing to do with melee. We are nothing more than a caster in a bit of armor. We never were a hybrid melee and likely never will be. I wouldn't turn down a step towards making us more like a melee oriented on the level of clerics but I won't hold my breath and I knew going in I was a preist support class.<br />
<br />
For pure cosmetics, yes I agree its gonna be a sad day when all shaman are sporting 2 books with stats and focus affects. I don't want see see shaman looking like druids from the kunark era:)  I'd like to see some shaman specific weapons and shield with those same options. But in the end its cosmetic, I'd really only be using a weapon to whack an annoying green who sit aggroed me somewhere.<br />
<br />
As for your concerns, I think you are on a pvp server?, maybe melee is more important to people there when every tom, dick and harry has crazy high resist. I won't discount your concerns, I just don't understand eq pvp well.</div></div><hr />

If you want to melee, theres plenty of toys out there for you, those 3 are just off the top of my head. <br />
<br />
We're not a bloody melee class so it's just that, toys. We wont ever get double attack and we wont ever get a damage bonus to our weapons, so stop crying.</div></div><hr />

Technically we might be a priest class but some would argue that we are worse &quot;priests&quot; than a paladin that is a melee hybrid. How do you like that? To me it looks like SoE thinks of us as a Bastard class. If they could get away with it I bet they would love to delete all shamans from the game.<br />
<br />
You also seem very confused about the difference between wanting to do some damage with a weapon and to be able to tank a mob. Before PoP you didnt kill mobs with melee and nothing changed in that regard with PoP. What changed is that now we cant even take a few hits anymore. A positive change?<br />
<br />
Kenton:<br />
&quot;I knew going in I was a preist support class&quot;<br />
<br />
You might have know but when I started playing all those years ago I sure didnt. To me shaman looked like a fun class that had some good spell both offensive and defensive and still had the ability to smack mobs around. Fun - until the nerfing began :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">So many places to go with this.<br />
<br />
We are priest classes by category but not by total definition. To call shaman pure priest class is the same as calling an enchanter a pure caster in the same vein as a wizard. Like the enchanter, who is not a dps machine (excluding late game charming) we are not priest whose focus is healing. Our tools lie elsewhere (buffage).<br />
<br />
Shaman were also given the best offensive melee skill caps (200) and very destructive dots (at the time) to compensate for our lack of healing ability. While we fall into the priest class technically, we are on the outer fringe of that class. A fringe that bridges hybrid. Hybrids however can actually hit at a much greater frequency when they get weap skill to 200 as well as for more average damage. That gets into a whole different subject.<br />
<br />
As for weapons, there are lower end proc'ing piercers that are great for melee use at lower levels. They are not uber or cool or anything but functional. Their usage in combat does what it should - helps to raise skill and the proc's add damage to target. Use them to max your skills.<br />
<br />
Then move on to another type weapon (or switch out throughout your career) to max all skills.<br />
<br />
Once piercing was maxxed, I moved to 1HB and picked up a soulstripper. It is still in my bag and still gets used for the 75 dmg/heal proc. Or I pull out my Corpsegrinder for the 100 heal and hits of 100+ (average 60 with the usual scattering of between 20 and max dmg.) <br />
<br />
Do I use them for PoP mobs hitting for tons of damage. No, and I am not meleeing those mobs in TEH FACE. Neither are warriors or rangers or paladins or shadowknights soloing those mobs without some kind of healing support. But I can kill some of them solo, unlike the melee classes, because I can root/rot and pet/dot and aggro kite. I can in TEH FACE take on mobs that would either kill or at least require tons of recover time for a tank and I can do it and then move on to the next target in far less recovery time.<br />
<br />
What I am saying is, in reponse to the original poster - there are other weapons available with decent stats, decent procs. It doesn't have to be piercing. As far as piercing goes, how many out there are doing a low aggro 1200 dmg dot? Shaman epic is it.<br />
<br />
Have shaman been left out? Yeah, in the course of 'class balance vision' we have. With melee maxxed skills of 200 we should be significant melee damage fighters. But, sadly, since we were given those skills and it was 'overpowering' the 'vision' changed our chance to hit (priest tables) and increased the max skill level for hybrids and pure tanks. Were we compensated by enhancing our priest abilities? No, we can't heal better than we could in Kunark, relatively speaking.<br />
<br />
Clerics and druids can. Palys can. Pet classes even got pet heals. Our heals have gone through the expansions with minimal increased healing power when bounced against the damage taken by the newer mobs. If I recall correctly from parses, based on damage taken to damage healed our heals have decreased in effectiveness while druids, clerics, etc. have actually kept pace.<br />
<br />
There is a lot more wrong with the shaman class than not having a cute weapon with good stats available to you in the definition you want at the upper end of the game. Lots of threads deal with what those problems are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Retron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I started playing EQ just over a year ago, as the result of a free cover CD on a games magazine. No expansions, so not knowing much I rolled up a warrior, who made it to 10 and was then deleted.<br />
<br />
I decided I wanted a pet (and a wolf sounded better than an elemental or skeleton), so chose a shaman. I didn't know much about Beastlords then, not least because I didn't have Luclin.<br />
<br />
The description of a shaman sounded like a battle priest to me, so (cleverly) I put most of my starting points into STR, then some in AGI and STA to round of the numbers - and yes, having a base WIS of 80 haunts me to this day! ;)<br />
<br />
Anyway, up until the 30s I was perfectly fine at meleeing, but as I moved through the 40s and 50s I realised that I just couldn't cut it as a semi-tank anymore. Nonetheless, I capped alll my melee skills on principle, thinking that as we have the highest caps of all casters it might make a difference.<br />
<br />
In reality, it didn't. Two things hurt the shaman melee wise by the time we ding 51:<br />
<br />
* Lack of a damage bonus. No, I don't think we should get one added (as we're just a caster, albeit more sturdy than druids and the robe wearers). <br />
* Caster damage table. As I understand it, most melees are on a better damage table than us right from the off, meaning their hits (when they connect) will do more damage than us casters. Shamans along with the other priests and INT casters are all on the same damage table, I've found, so fully buffed an INT caster is capable of the same maximum damage hits as us. They have lower combat skills, so will hit less often and for less damage on average, but the top cap is the same.<br />
<br />
Therefore, at level 50 we have the same caps as a warrior but are already doing much less damage.<br />
<br />
Post 51, the melee classes move up to a different damage table, doing even more damage on average. Whereas before they were only one tier above us, they're now two or more (as IIRC beastlords get improved damage tables at 55 and 60 - not 100% sure though). This is when I pretty much stopped meleeing in groups, as my damage was puny compared to others. I then soloed a lot in Dulak, eventually meleeing between JBB casts (funded by the absurd gem drop rate there). Rabid Bear was a must buy for me, and to this day I still find it great fun :)<br />
<br />
Even though it's only for a few short minutes, having double attack and a decent ATK makes soloing great fun, although the thought of catching ripostes for 300+ puts me off using it to solo in the Planes. <br />
<br />
The point of this post was to say that even if we did have a double attack AA, or improved caps, we'd still be on that caster damage table. IMO, an AA to move us to the pre-50 melee table would be better, as it would restore that &quot;one behind&quot; position with regards to melee classes and could hardly be considered unbalancing. As it is, we're stuck with level 49 skills and a level 1 damage table, which is why we're so poor at melee (IMO). <br />
<br />
As for equipping books, I &quot;won&quot; one yesterday, when everyone else in the group passed. It gives me 50 more HPs, around 60 more mana and Extended Range IV.... but I'm a shaman, a battle priest, and even though I'll not be meleeing at all in hard LDoNs, equipping it to me would mean conceding that I really am lousy at melee. I know I could just swap it out for a weapon when soloing, but it just feels wrong somehow to wield it....<br />
<br />
And as a final point - after getting Luclin and the rest, I did indeed make a beastlord, although he's only level 45 even now. Proper melee, watered down shaman spells and a great pet.... but my main is and will always remain my shaman.<br />

He among many of us I believe, would like a better piercing weapon other than our Epic, which could be an upgrade but also easy to achieve.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Armak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I was thinking about changing class a few month ago. AB is so full of twinkage Shamans that you step on them everywhere. After some carefull considiration i decided against a class change. <br />
<br />
WHY?<br />
<br />
Simple that the versaltility of the shaman is enormous. <br />
<br />
Been playing EQ since june 1999 and played shaman since january 2000. Have seen some up and downs in EQ and the Shaman class. <br />
<br />
Still the way the shaman can handle himself in a solosituation/groupsituation/raidsituation makes him a very fun class to play. I have on my second account played, Cleric (45), Monk (52), Warrior(54), Paladin(56), Ranger (55). and no one of these classes had showed any promise of versatility as the Shaman have. Now i know that i havent played them to lvl 65 and 100+ AA. Still i cant see them be able to give me the same satisfaction as the shaman does. <br />
<br />
Shaman is not the king of DPS, but with a good tank with major tauntskills you can stack DoTs so you do 200+ DPS without any major danger. Done it on raids, its fun making 1200+ dmg per tick on boss mobs. (BU, Bertoxx, BoS, AncientBaneNife, BaneNife, Bane + burning affliction) <br />
<br />
Shaman is not good at melee but with some AA points (LR5) and some half decent gear you can tank almost anything ourside EP thats atleast &quot;mostly slowable&quot; and not a boss mob without any outside help on heals.<br />
<br />
We can make a group/player better with out buffs STats/attack/AC/Haste.<br />
<br />
We make kittens out of tigers with our Debuffs and slow <br />
<br />
We can keep a group alive when the Cleric gets overrunned. Slow and heal. I can be main healer in a BoT group, if the critters are slowed, np.<br />
<br />
the possibilities playing a shaman are great and its big fun, you just have to try different things. Ofcourse it gets boring sitting on your ass in a BoT group day out and day in only casting slow. Same thing if you solo all the time. Do different things and enjoy the power of the shaman, because its great</div></div><hr />

<br />
This i think is the problem at the moment in that we were given big dots etc to make up for lack of healing.<br />
Nowadays we have good dots but not the best,but very poor heals.<br />
If we are still to be classed as a Priest Class then we need to be given a new blast heal.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Bonestomper has made a couple valid points on the lack of droppable gear to upgrade from the epic (especially notable in piercers) and that our melee skills have recieved no upgrades.  We used to be the best &quot;in teh face&quot; priests and the only thing that gives us any claim to that title these days is a spell (turgurs).  In every other respect, a cleric can put out more DPS and stay in melee longer (assuming mob attk speed is constant).  I don't consider this mitigation a nerf, but a change.  Necro's a few expansions ago wanted more group and raid desireability, SoE gave them twitch and they protested and have been hunting all the old SoE dev staff ever since with cars and assault rifles.  The class changed in a way it's players had not seen, but they got what they wanted.  We got more mana regen in Kunark and we've been paying for it ever since.  The shaman class was changed.  Accept that your melee is gone and move on.  In LDoN I do more damage to myself than the mobs do and if I meleed I'd be risking almost certain death, not to mention ridicule from my party, screwing my DPS (even more), and hosing my mana regen, not to mention I'd lose my nomination as &quot;Best Actor in a Supporting Role&quot; nomination from the international house of shamans (pancake anyone?).<br />
<br />
Despite the couple of valid points that were made, let's face it, we aren't getting much from SoE, and if the messed up spells on lucy are any indication, I don't want to waste what little hope I have of getting better mana regen or a better slow on fighting for more melee skills.  I'd sooner be the 3rd best healer, or the 2nd best DoTer (not really ... my dots, other than bane, are collecting dust), the &quot;best&quot; slower (it's arguable, but we still got the belt), the 7th best nuker, than be the 9th or 10th best meleer.  If I'm going to complain, I want to keep my requests to SoE very simple, and I'm not going to waste it on &quot;would be nice items&quot; but will focus on what will make me more effective in groups and raids.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I miss the power of Envenomed Breath/E-bolt.  Those spells had impact.  Our dots now do a lot of damage, but there's no meaningful impact - outside the fact that using them gets you summoned and killed.  <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I don't see how it can be changed.  When you raid, one person can't have that much impact really.  That's just the nature of having 50 people fight one mob.</div></div><hr />

Spiritblood is right on the mark here. Open your eyes folks. I've been talking about marginalization of shamans for the last three expansions, and now its here.  People are still trying to justify our stagnation with claims of how &quot;versatile&quot; and &quot;powerful&quot; we are.  Nonsense!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">As long as we don't fall behind the other classes, I don't mind a few flaws.   <br />
<br />
While I don't really care about doing melee damage, I get ya Bone, Shaman have always gotten the shaft from Verant and SoE.<br />
<br />
We don't miss Alchemy because we never really had it <br />
<br />
We started out with a class tradeskill that was totally broken.  This does not bug most folks too bad since all tradeskills were painful and now most Shaman don't pay any attention to Alchemy since it is so expensive.  But I have to say that I am still angry over the issue because Alchemy is one of the reasons that I selected a Shaman in the first place.  (Over Warrior or Rogue as I was going to be a Barb regardless)  As a class we don't really miss Alchemy since it never really was a viable skill.  Don't get me wrong it is okay, but it ain't as easy as foraging.  <br />
<br />
DoTs took a hit to keep folks from Soloing<br />
 <br />
Our DoTs also took quite the nerf in the first few months of the live game.  I can't really remember the numbers, but it seems like the damage was halved along with the time it took the DoTs to work.  All in all many Shaman said that the change was okay and I am not in a position to dispute as I was still in my early teens at the time.<br />
<br />
Remember the Overwriting Splurt? <br />
<br />
When our epic was released the DoT was a proc that would overwrite itself!  Tell me anyone at SoE was paying attention to Shaman at this time.  Our 50-60 spells were darn near impossible to get and were ALWAYS more expensive than any other classes spells on the whole.<br />
<br />
Agi = WASTE of MANA <br />
<br />
Then we started to get data that seemed to indicate stats and thus our buffs were not so important and that equipment made the character.  I hope that the new Endurance Bar and the way the melee stats contribute to it will make buffs more important again.<br />
<br />
Woot one overpowered spell (Canni line is nice too) <br />
<br />
I really think that the end of the Slow line was overlooked and thank goodness or Shaman would be hurting for a role in EQ.  I don't think the Devs had any idea how powerful this spell would be, but unfortunately we have paid for it with interest.<br />
<br />
Misery loves company <br />
<br />
None of this would bother me at all and I know that other classes have been screwed before.  Druids got a reputation of beeing a bunch of quading jerks who could rake in the exp, but they spent awhile lobbing for changes to make the more useful in groups.  I think their concerns were valid as were the concerns of Warrior and Monks.  Rogues were totally screwed over with the lack of locks and broken poison.  I am not saying that we are special case but we need to keep our collective voice at the same level as every other class to make sure we do not slip behind.  If it is harder for me to solo because of a change then so be it, but don't let us slip behind so that it is harder for us to get selected for groups.<br />
<br />
Just don't replace me with a Beastlord <br />
<br />
This is a social game.  I like to solo but I don't want to be forced to solo because no one wants me anymore.  And don't give me some lame example of how Shaman are still very much desired in LDoN groups.  I am Joe Average Shaman and I am here to tell you it just ain't true.  We are slipping behind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Glencannon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">A lot of things have been brought up here, I'll address each one as best I can:<br />
<br />
Lack of upgrades from our Epic-- I'm level 65, have about 70AA's, and am two kills away from being in PoTime.  I still use my epic, because I haven't been able to get a better Primary.  Not that they aren't out there, they are just super-rare.  There are pretty much ZERO shaman specific Primary items out there.<br />
<br />
Lack of melee abilities at high levels--  I started my shaman in June '99.  I started him because I loved the idea of being a battle priest.  I loved the idea of being a walking utility belt, as well.  I could do it all, just not as well as the other classes that specialized, but that was ok.  Well, our melee skills went away with Kunark.  And our tanking skills went away with Velious/Luclin/PoP, depending on what sort of guild you were in, and if you had access to Torpor.  What used to be a major part of being a shaman (am I the only one that remembers what the original berserk line did?) has been totally neglected/ignored/nerfed by Verant/SOE over the past three years.  <br />
<br />
Lack of healing abilities at high levels-- we were always, in the past, supposed to be the same level of healer as a druid.  However, we were supposed to have the better Heals over Time, since druids could do so many other things (nukes, evacs).  Well, SOE/Verant overfixed the druids, who are now very capable healers in groups in PoP, but they have totally hosed us.  2K heals in Elementals are crap.  Period.  <br />
<br />
What I really, really love are the people that come to this board screaming about how they don't want to be a healer, let the druids have the good heals.  And then someone screams about not being able to melee anymore, and all the suggestions they get are &quot;delete and reroll a BST&quot;.  And then someone complains about how our DPS is irrelevant in LDoN because mobs die so quickly, but others say our DPS is fine, if you want to be DPS, roll a ROG.<br />
<br />
We have been nerfed into oblivion because of the elders on this board saying for years that we are &quot;fine, leave us alone&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Congratulations.  We USED to be the best class in the game, because of our versatility and usefulness.  Every other class in the game has passed us, becuase they bitched long and hard on their class forums.  The ONLY thing we ever got accomplished on this board was getting Alchemy fixed.<br />

The weapon dmg/delay was atrocious compared to fellow priests.<br />
(druid 20/30; cleric 20/32)<br />
<br />
Back then, it meant alot.<br />
<br />
About 2 months later, they finally changed it to a more respectable level compared to the other priests, or all other classes for the matter.  Ever since then, though, my faith in Verant plumeted.  It really told me that whoever at Verant was taking care of shamans, was really not in touch with others.  I have never gained any confidence with Verant/SOE ever since, expansion after expansion.</div></div><hr />
