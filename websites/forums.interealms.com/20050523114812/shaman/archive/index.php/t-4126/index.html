<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shakasa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The perk:<br />
<br />
You’ll need a pet you can command for this trick. Either summoned or in the<br />
<br />
Enchanter’s case, charmed. All you have to do to see if a rare spawn is up is<br />
<br />
type the command: ‘/pet attack (name of monster)’ For example: ‘/pet attack<br />
<br />
yelinak’. Then assist your pet by targeting it and typing: ‘/assist’ you’ll now have<br />
<br />
Yelinak targeted (if he’s up)! This is a great way to look for rare spawns at the<br />
<br />
zone entrance!<br />
<br />
The catch:<br />
<br />
You need to know the names of the spawns you’re looking for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jebuss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Very, very cool :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wobbs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Great tip! thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I remember they nerf the pet's range few month ago, so you can't use pet to find the target that too far away</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Reeannon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I used this technique to find the dorf for the prayer shawal.  You position your pet, then you click your mouse to the position he is aiming in.  You will either get the dorf target or the trigger that sets off all them dang giants.  This took a lot less time and stress, because I'd didnt trip the dam giant trigger at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It used to be that you could use the /target command to do this.  If they were in the zone you'd get the &quot;cannot see blah blah&quot; message.  If not, nothing would be texted to you.<br />
<br />
I hated that little secret nerf/fix. :p<br />
<br />
Thanks for sharing!  Hadn't thought of trying it this way.  Gotta keep the ol' book of shaman poor-man's-method of tricks rolling strong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Believe this was fixed a few patches ago, wont work for me anymore at least and heard reports that it doesnt work for others either.  I even tested it by finding a mob up then getting really far away and trying it, didnt target it or get any message from pet (for a while if mob was up he would say something to ya if not he just sat there).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jonaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">As others already said, this doesn't work anymore.<br />
A pet that's out of range of a given target (with /pet attack yelinak) doesn't get the target, hence you can't use this trick anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">This was a great way to check if spawns were up. It was also really useful in PVP to target your opponent from across the zone then cast the vision spell -- allowing you to see through his eyes and locate him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">works for burrower <br />
<br />
&quot;/pet attack the&quot;<br />
<br />
its not targetable so you get the &quot;that is not a legal target master&quot; message</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">also, you can check if spawns are still up with a pet, you just can't target them anymore.<br />
<br />
try this.<br />
<br />
go to somewhere and find a specific name of the mob you wanna find.<br />
<br />
/pet attack name. if it's there, he should say &quot;that is not a valid target master&quot; or something of that sort<br />
<br />
if he's not there, pet won't say sheet :D<br />
<br />
pet will not target the mob tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tantobourne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Nice tip, post it in Gart's sticky at the top of the General forum.</div></div><hr />

Erm nope, the pet now just says nothing because the mob is too far away.<br />
Don't stick this thread, it doesn't work anymore!</div></div><hr />
