<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Janudana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all, I'm new here. Visited this site a few times, and finally am posting on the boards.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I can no longer really fight anything at the Oasis, not that I'm complaining mind you due to the fact that I hated that place, with the annoying Madmen, and dry boned skeleton constantly attacking me when i'm just selling at the gypsies, but anyways, where can I go besides HHP, because I've been there before and well...the bottom line is that I'd like to go somewhere besides there, and let me repeat, I don't have SOL, nor POP, so it kinda limits me. (i wanna go to PC!!!!!!!!!!! WAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!!!!)<br />
<br />
Thank you so much in advance for any help.</div></div><hr />

Unrest is phenominal... You could do spiders in Guk (if you get in trouble, run past frogs... they'll whump the spiders). Take the boat for Lake of Ill Omen, or even Overthere (be careful not to die there...)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Janudana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thank you for all those nice ideas. Turns out that I got to the town itself though, and I just love how easy the exp is there when u have a decent party. Thanks for the other ideas though, cya</div></div><hr />
