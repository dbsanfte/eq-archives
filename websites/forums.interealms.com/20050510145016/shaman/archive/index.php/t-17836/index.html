<br />
Basically put mobs in all the old safe spots for 40-50 range such as stables, temple etc.  Kinda sucks, because I liked the CoM to xp if I was kinda busy off and on in RL.  Pull a stable, rest in courtyard, do laundry, pull again, etc.  Now Mobs in all safe spots on about a 10 min timer.<br />
<br />
New mobs are LOY types, hit a bit harder but have about the same hp as old.  Have to break spawn in temple, stables and goo room. Generally a bit harder than before.<br />
<br />
Still a good zone though, minor upgrades to loot.  I mean minor.<br />
I like it cause its kinda quiet, fair zem and its not DL/KC.<br />
<br />
Don't know about changes to Reavers, etc.<br />
<br />
Lars.<br />
