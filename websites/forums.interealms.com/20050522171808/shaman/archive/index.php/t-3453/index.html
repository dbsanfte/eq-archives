<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">how hard is it to obtain ?<br />
<br />
12k is alot . i could work for it . but with wanting to up alchemy and having 7 alts . it would mean giving up alot of other things . but this seems to be a VERY powerful item for a shaman . i could heal and DD . thats too sweet to not have</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The JBB drops off Arch Duke Lytol in the crypt area of Old Sebilis.  To enter the crypt, a rogue must open the door.   The crypt is actually a pretty good place to farm loot if you can get a good crypt group (as of this writing, I have been in TWO crypt groups).  The heiro cloak drops there as well (along with a nice 10 slot, low weight box which is my sole souvenir from my time in the Crypt).<br />
<br />
The named are relatively rare, and the JBB is the rare drop off Lytol.</div></div><hr />

I did not think I would have a chance  anytime soon for another so I bought it.  The next one I saw for sale was double the price I paid and as you see from Batalon's post the price is now around 12k pp.  Though my guildie is happy I bought it since he used it to solo to 60 and still has it until my shaman levels up to use it. :D</div></div><hr />

well something more obtainable for my level maybe .<br />
<br />
Spirit Stone.. anyone heard of this ? i heards this mentioned in another thread in the cantext that it allows us to port like driuds  . seems unlikely but ...  is it for real ? i did a search on it and it didnt seem to do quite what he claimed , but i was unable to really find out its full functionality . just a small stats list</div></div><hr />

I havent seen a JBB being sold on Luclin for over a month, but several people offering at least 20k... My advice is to sell whatever you can and get one because I would glady pay more then the 15k now.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Forget the spiritstone and bind in the Firepot room in TD.  Instant port to 12 Antonican and Kunark cities including: Halas, Grobb, Ogguk, Cabilis, Rivervale, Kaladim, Akanon, Erudin, Kelethin, Felwithe, Freeport and...one more I can't think of.<br />
<br />
Easy access to Luclin via Gfay wiz spire, Cabilis takes you to the LoIO zone line, so easy to get to DL area.  The only thing annoying is getting to Velious, but Thurg gate potions can take care of that.</div></div><hr />

I got my JBB for free.  It was a gift to me from my friends on my RL birthday (coincidentally) - they traded a centi longsword and a gorganga idol for it like 1 week after luclin came out.  I was level 57 or 58.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>dirtybax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">My JBB cost me 8k on D-Ro.  Seconds later I saw one being sold for 12k, and the guy said he had offers up to 10k already.  <br />
<br />
Spiritstones sell for 5k on my server iirc.  A Spiritstone in no way compares to the powah of the JBB though.  The Spiritstone is more of a toy I think.  Especially if you are a Barbarian - ports you to EF - yay...<br />

8 Yeskan Warmace drop<br />
and 35+ hours of camping it during a week-end and half the next week (other shamans were getting tired of seeing me there :P )<br />
<br />
I even got 5 hiero cloak (gave them all to friends who helped me camp the jbb) during this time and many hours i didnt kill the Hierophant because i was alone only camping the arch duke room.  <br />
<br />
I made more money then twice the worth of the jbb but they are extremely rare on Vazaelle and go for 25-30kpp easy (at that price they dont last more then a day on the market)</div></div><hr />

I got another in the crypt and sold it for 35k.  Then would have had another but the group I was with demanded to roll for it so I did and I lost.  I could have claimed it but I didnt feel like arguing with people.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Thyrm Jarlson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">8k from a guildmate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">15k.  I turned down numerous sellers wanting 20k+, and it took a month to find one at this price.<br />
<br />
I know of others on my server that have sold for 11k, 12k, and 15k.  I don't personally know of any that have sold for more than 15k but I am sure that it happens.<br />
<br />
One note - sellers get all weird about this item.  They get cagey about actually agreeing to sell it to you because they think they can get the world for it.  I think it's because non-shaman don't understand why it's so good for shaman so it's hard for them to put a price on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Looted first one at lev 53, got a second from guild (sold that one a bit later to a friend of a friend to pay for coffins/stones for guild raids)<br />

Recently, I bought one for 8k and a Granite Face Grinder. It is SOOO worth it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Lets see:<br />
<br />
First one I paid 16k for, sold it for about the same.<br />
Next one, I paid 12k for, sold it for 18k.<br />
Next one, I traded Club of the Ice Ocean and something else for it, can't remember.  Sold it for 16k.<br />
The one I have now, I paid about 12k for.<br />
<br />
I think that's pretty accurate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Jarren Icewulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">I paid 15kpp for mine at level 51. (Povar)<br />
Then a couple months ago I bought another one for 15kpp for a guildmate (lvl 47) that desperately wanted one. But I had no pp at the time, so I sold my Shield of Bane Warding for 22kpp. After buying the JBB for him got the following from him:<br />
Ceremonial Iksar Regen Breastplate<br />
Acrylia Studded Cloak<br />
Acrylia Studded Tunic<br />
Wurmslayer<br />
Mammoth Hide Cloak<br />
Froglok Scale Cheastplate<br />
Cobalt Gauntlets<br />
His help with MQing any of the Parts needed for Shield of Bane Warding quest im doing again.<br />
His soal<br />
With the left over money I had and after selling a few of the above items, I then bought me a horse to compliment my JBB.<br />
Needless to say guildmate is level 51 now and also has a horse.<br />
<br />
And just for interests: 2 guildmates and myself (all 3 shaman with JBB and horses, (lvls 54, 53, and 47 at the time) we took on the Great Spire Lord in Mons Letalis by kiting it around near The Grey zone. Once aggro was on one, he would just go around in a mini circle, while other 2 casting JBB over and over, when aggro switched to one of them, he would do the mini circle thing. We did this several times taking turns till it died. A group of level 60s watched us and were kinda amazed. A little later when Lord spawned again, we did the same thing, cept only 2 of us this time. Took a little longer, and other Shaman took the Harmtouch and nearly died. He had to zone into the Grey, heal himself then come back out and start JBBing..while I did the mini circle thing.<br />
I hate to sound like a couple of druids kiting around a tough mob, but it works. I have to definitely agree that a JBB is extremely a must have for a Shaman.</div></div><hr />
