<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">April 28th, 2004 <br />
---------------------- <br />
<br />
Headlines! <br />
<br />
- A new storybook has arrived! Make sure you read it to find out what Tondal is up to now. <br />
- A new adventure zone is live on Stormhammer! <br />
- A new adventure zone has moved from Stormhammer to Live! <br />
- What are the &quot;HOT SPOTS&quot;? <br />
- Plane of Knowledge open to everyone! <br />
<br />
<br />
New Adventure Zone goes to Stormhammer <br />
----------------------- <br />
- We have added a new adventure zone which should be a challenge for 2 groups of about 50th level. <br />
A party of adventurers is missing and was last seen working with the undead. Will you brave the catacombs to find them? <br />
<br />
<br />
New Adventure Zone moves to Live <br />
----------------------- <br />
- The adventure zone currently on Stormhammer will move to live servers. You can visit the Lost Pyramid of Galuuk Korr. This midlevel adventure zone will allow you to explore a monument from the lost elvish city of Takish Hiz! Now you must find what was left beneath the sands. Good luck. <br />
<br />
Hot Spots <br />
----------------------- <br />
Try out the new Hot Spot zones which give a boost to Experience while adventuring in them, in a similar manner to Paludal Caverns. The current Hot Spots are: <br />
<br />
- The Castle of Mistmoore (20th to 30th level) <br />
- The Lair of the Splitpaw (35th to 45th level) <br />
- Dulak's Harbor (40th to 45th level) <br />
- The Tower of Frozen Shadow (30th to 35th level) <br />
- The Gulf of Gunthak (35th to 40th level) <br />
- Hate's Fury (55th to 60th level) <br />
- The Crypt of Nadox (50th to 55th level) <br />
- The Torgiran Mines (45th to 50th level) <br />
<br />
These Hot Spot zones are generally aimed at characters level 20 to 51. The Hot Spot zones will shift from time to time, so watch for messages giving clues as to where the new ones may be. <br />
<br />
<br />
Plane of Knowledge <br />
----------------------- <br />
All EQ characters can now access the Plane of Knowledge whether they have purchased Planes of Power or not! <br />
<br />
General <br />
----------------------- <br />
- We have decreased load times when zoning. <br />
<br />
<br />
Gates Sewers and Vxed <br />
----------------------- <br />
- Rare NPCs in the Gates sewers and Vxed will not spawn at the creation of the expedition zone. They will now spawn after the zone has been occupied for some time. <br />
<br />
<br />
Items <br />
----------------------- <br />
- Skill percent-mods now work for Ammo slot items. <br />
- Grand Tunic of the Oracle and the Grand Robe of the Oracle have had a type 7 augmentation slot added to them. <br />
- Lungi of the Forbidden will display a robe graphic once again. Monks and Beastlords will be able to swap the robe in for a leather looking BP with the same stats by visiting Garath the Trader in East Wastes. You will be able to swap the items back and forth with Garath for your desired look. (Lungi? Lungi? What is a Lungi?) <br />
<br />
<br />
Spells <br />
----------------------- <br />
- Characters in illusion form can again be targeted. <br />
- Bull Rush is now a magical resist. Please do not use in a china shop. <br />
- Balance of the Nihil has had its Mana and Slow percentage increased. <br />
<br />
<br />
Tracking <br />
----------------------- <br />
- More NPC's in Qinimi now leave tracks for trackers to find. <br />
<br />
<br />
Firiona Vie <br />
----------------------- <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
so yeah slow gets upgraded + mana upgraded  <br />
hotspots will be owny to xp in those un croweded zones !!!!!!  <br />
and fly wont spawn on  expo   ~ <br />
and the greatest  SKILL ITEMS WILL WORK IN AMMO  !!!!! !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just so I save someone else the effort: &quot;Hot Spots&quot;?!?  Just another example of dumbing down the game to make it easier and easier!  Why, back in my day...  ;)<br />
<br />
Anyway, nice that the slow went live, and hopefully the zone time thing is true - my zone times skyrocketed after the dx9 stuff went in. :\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I like how they specificly said balance of the nihil. Like.. &quot; ok shaman SEE SEE YOU HAVE YOUR ****ING ATTENTION NOW SHUT UP&quot; <br />
<br />
rofl.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yea i really hope the loading is better. I stopped playing cause it was so asinine.<br />
<br />
Im actualy interested in the new zone though, is it LDoN content or just a zone having to dow itht he story. New zone usualy means new loot, which means cash to be made ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm actually pleased with at least 1 part of today's patch!  The hot spot thing is just a great idea.  Encourages travel, exporation, etc.  I may be well past those levels, but I just think it's a great idea, and I'm glad they took it off the boards and implemented it!<br />
<br />
/asspat SoE!<br />
<br />
Chutoi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">While they're at it, why don't they make Shar Vahl accessible without having to own the Luclin expansion, so Ogre and Troll Shamans can buy their DoT spells.<br />
<br />
What's up with trackers not being able to track certain mobs lately? And Eyes of Zomm not opening doors anymore? It's no fun having to organize a raid and fight your way to a mob just to find out it's not up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">they're encouraging SEQ usage!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Nihil sorta fixed.<br />
Hot spots are a nice idea.<br />
Some small fixes.<br />
<br />
Good patch.<br />
<br />
<br />
If they can set those hot spots without bringing the zone down you could make great quests out of those. Kill the King in Guk and the ZEM goes up!<br />
<br />
With less then 10 people in BoT, cast a certain spell (wake of karana?) after killing a wing boss to up the ZEM!<br />
<br />
Escort an NPC from Vox' lair to the zonein to get double the experience for an hour!<br />
<br />
Talk about unlimited potential.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">give the NPC 50k plat and ding 10 levels.<br />
<br />
<br />
Im with ya brother !<br />
<br />
Ok so i have too many twinks that i want 50+  Sue me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>herkybevo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">From what I have been reading about the new zone, most will not be happy about it.    What people are saying is, that it is an instanced zone for the Tak adventures and is Capped at lvl 50.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">&quot;We have added a new adventure zone which should be a challenge for 2 groups of about 50th level.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now THIS sounds interesting.  TWO groups.<br />
<br />
Could this be a stab at designing the game toward more tough things to do for casual players or just players who are not raiders, with good rewards you can get without 71 friends?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">With what they give out for &quot;good&quot; rewards in lvl 50ish ldons I doubt that very much. Pretty much any item that I saw drop in a low 50's ldon adventure was worse quality then stuff that could be gotten by the same group in some place like OS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I like the hot spot idea. Its kind of annoying that if you want decent exp in that range, you are shoe horned into PoP. The only problem is travel time to yksha... they should make a gunthak stone. I realize tox-_&gt; Paineel --&gt; warrens --&gt; stonebrunt --&gt; gunthak isnt THAT huge a journey, but it would get people using an underutilized expansion even more. Oh, and I am pretty sure they got the level range for crypt of nadox and torigan mines reversed heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hehehehe, I was thinking the same thing Flabbo, Tor Mines can be a tough SoB at times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tidykat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">OK, I'm not fully sure how this Hot Spot stuff works.  Did they jsut raise the ZEM for those zones?  Or doyou need to be huntingthere for a long periodof time for it to go into effect?<br />
<br />
I took my pally(40) out  to the easy boat(stormwavei think) in dulak before the patch and he was getting 2-3% a kill, and aftfer the patch, the same mobs are yielding the same amount of XP, so I assume the zem did not get raised, but does if you are there for a long period of time?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">&quot;Pretty much any item that I saw drop in a low 50's ldon adventure was worse quality then stuff that could be gotten by the same group in some place like OS.&quot;<br />
<br />
Two things, though.  <br />
<br />
First, a group of low 50's wouldn't have a very easy time in Old Sebilis at all, at least not at the mobs that drop the best stuff, like the Fungi King or Juggs, so they probably either shouldn't get those rewards or couldn't.  To me, at least, it seems hard to justify the best of Sebilis loot as something appropriate for a low 50's toon, unless he just had it given to him by a level 65.  So it's not fair to expect Sebilis level loot for a group of low 50's.  Can't slight LDON too bad in comparison on that account, especially if you're not even doing a hard.<br />
<br />
Second, the main thing that got me interested in that little note on the patch message was that they said &quot;TWO&quot; groups!  Something that needs to be done by more than one group can definitely fairly have a better reward, or a greater number of drops, than what needs to be done by one group.<br />
<br />
I remember doing two-group &quot;mini-raids&quot; in my 50's.  They were a lot of fun, and small enough so you still felt the personal contribution of everyone there, and still felt your chance of getting goodies wasn't incredibly small.  I would love more stuff like that in the game.  And their saying &quot;two groups&quot; made me wonder if that's what they're experimenting with putting in.<br />
<br />
As an instanced zone, it couldn't just be overrun and KS'd by jerks trying to twink their alts or just be obnoxious, either.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm hoping it turns into something interesting.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Beafly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Why would we want Nihl to overwrite Turgur's?

<br />
<br />
So does that mean just the % bonus, or do the stats show up as well?  Does this mean that shams have an ammo item worth having now.<br />
Anyone try their GM award there yet?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Galamann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Any 65 shaman see is hate's fury is decent exp for us?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Good thing I'm locked out for 2 more days!<br />
<br />
<br />
I actually like the zone (hell, its not the same as ikkinz!), and think the difficulty is fine.  I'm sure I'll find out how they messed it up, hop you dont mean 'they gimped it'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">From what I have experienced so far in Dulak the xp is the same as it has always been. Dulak (and Gunthak) always had a decent ZEM.<br />
<br />
Before making a blanket statement I need to check out T Mines, Nadox and Hate's. All of the other zones listed had a decent ZEM, however. I am leaning towards the opinion that nothing was changed but it was listed as a patch to encourage more occupation. Getting more folks to go to a zone that had a higher than average ZEM for the level hits me as SOE's version of a ZEM improvement.<br />
<br />
If you have a group of 40-45 in Dulak ... it is going to be extremely nice xp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">So does that mean just the % bonus, or do the stats show up as well?  Does this mean that shams have an ammo item worth having now.<br />

<br />
Ok I tried it, ammo slot still doesn't allow stats but the skill mod does show up in the tradeskill window of the medicine bag, Alchemy skill 200 +5% becomes skill 210.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">While they're at it, why don't they make Shar Vahl accessible without having to own the Luclin expansion, so Ogre and Troll Shamans can buy their DoT spells.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Most of them, actually.<br />
<br />
IIRC, when the frogloks took Grobb, they killed off the only DoT vendor accessible to the trolls and ogres outside of Shar Vahl.  The only evil vendor left is in Cabilis, which isn't exactly accessible for the other evil race shamans.  Kitties are absolutely neutral to everyone, though, so they've been able to buy them from the DoT vendor in Shar Vahl...but if you don't have Luclin, this might be a minor problem.  ;)<br />
<br />
The DoT vendor has like virtually every DoT spell from level 5 to 49, as well as a few other handy spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">And I just got done farming the stuff for Blood Of Nadox w/ my lvl48 mage twink.  talk about bad timing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Would be happy to tell you about it Tulkor, but I think I jumped the gun on my statement and its funnier to find out yourself if its changed once again. Uqua was fun and the most fun with it would be that its a whole new zone everytime you zone in as they change something all the time :p</div></div><hr />

Not sure what his faction is but I know there are no guards anywhere near him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">That's a minor problem anyway.  Create a level 1 Iksar, twink it with cash via the shared bank slot, buy the (droppable) spell scrolls and hand them back via the shared bank slot.  Yeah, it's a design flaw for sure, but they don't need to give you access to Shar Vahl to fix it.<br />
<br />
I'm surprised those spells are not available in PoK, actually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Gilador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I'm the author of EQ Companion. One of the new features I have added to the yet-to-be-released 0.795 version is experience tracking. It shows how much experience you are getting per hour and how much experience you gain per mob.<br />
<br />
I just happened to hunt in Torgiran mines the night before the patch and I was parsing my experience gain. I was getting 1.3% AA per kill then on average.<br />
<br />
Tonight after the patch I was getting 1.52% AA per kill killing the same mobs (I did not get any named mobs either night).<br />
<br />
Looks like they increased the ZEM by 17% at least in Torgiran mines.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>LilGnomeLovin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">EQ Companion?  Do you have a link perhaps?  Sounds interesting....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">I did notice one other thing after the patch. The goats in GoD now proc pets constantly as they fight, but they only last about 6 seconds or so. Possibly they changed it to stop people from pre-spawning the pets and then doing the real pull after they depop. It does get kind of interesting in IK when you have the named and 4-6 pets up at once ;).</div></div><hr />
