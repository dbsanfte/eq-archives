<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just letting some of my excitement run over and thought I'd share.  Last night was a good night.  Grouped with a bunch of guild mates and a few alliance mates in PoN at the high level spiders.  We used the raid feature for about 3 hours there, killing the lvl 60+ spiders.  Accumulated at least 2 yellows of AA while there.  Felt good.  <br />
<br />
Especially impressing a high level druid in our guild by not dying at all during the night.  :)  I'm 56 and I was the main slower.  Few resists, and slowed as the pull was coming in.  Became a joke between us to see how quickly I could slow and not get aggro or die.  :)<br />
<br />
Then at the end of the raid one of my guild mates handed me a Tae Ew Shield after I remarked that I wanted one real bad!  Woohoo!  And if I can get the needed parts, the chest and legs are within my grasp as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sounds like a fun night, that's good at any level.<br />
<br />
One suggestion - I rediscovered the use of the Maloxxx line in PoN.  I was just getting too much aggro from bounced slows at your level there, so I started using Malosini first.<br />
<br />
Now, Malosini has the SAME resist check as Turgur's, and that's why I quit using it in the first place - I figured I might as well slow it straight off.  But Malosini has a MUCH lower aggro rate than Turgur's, and in POP that is Significant.<br />
<br />
Two bounced Malosini's keeps the mob on the MT.  Two bounced slows puts him on me, where it's that much harder to slow him due to interrupts and I'm less prepared to deal with his damage output than the MT.<br />
<br />
Of course, he's on me after I Malosini and then Slow, but hey, he's slowed then :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fulgrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Congrats on the shield and yes it was a good night...<br />
<br />
<br />
But I didn't win anything and Im only level 55 but I will tell you...<br />
<br />
I only had 3 resists on those spider from cripple... the whole time I was there....and Ice spells seemed to land for full most of the time while posion DD was resisted half the time...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I found that my Malosi was not landing at all most times.  And with a Paladin for a MT, I literally could cast the first Turgur's before the spider got to the camp.  It's amazing how well a Paladin can get and keep aggro.  :)<br />
<br />
I even pulled out Bane of Nife and used it quite a bit.  Got 2 or 3 resists with it, but never got aggro unless the spiders procced FD on the MT.  That's definitely an interesting thing to see.  LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah, my wife is usually my MT and she's a warrior... warriors have seen a sad, sorry decline in their ability to hold aggro compared to the hybrids.  YMMV.<br />
<br />
Turgur's was being resisted enough to make it very dangerous at 58-59, fighting blood ravens and gnarled treants duo and hobgoblins grouped.  Only tackled the high-level spiders once and had a group of higher-ups to help us, I don't remember a resist problem but I think a mage was mala'ing for us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Resists rates in the planes are very streaky similar to the giants in Kael. I always malosini on incoming to help land slows but sometimes you get 2-3 malosini resists also.<br />
<br />
It's one reason why I love going back to non- plane zone like sebilis and chardok where mobs have totally gimp resists and you can slow 90% of the time on first cast without malsoini.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">We did have an Enchanter along to Tash, and he was only 51!  He was a bot of the MT.  Let's see if I can remember what we had...<br />
<br />
60 Paladin (main tank)<br />
61 druid (puller)<br />
56 Shaman (me)<br />
55 Shaman<br />
60+ wizard<br />
57 Wizard<br />
58 Necromancer<br />
60 Rogue<br />
56 Warrior<br />
51 Enchanter<br />
57 Ranger (for a bit)<br />
60 Druid<br />
<br />
<br />
Think that was it.  We had just under 2 full groups most of the time.  Only 1 death the whole time, and that was the MT on a freaky pull.<br />
<br />
Resists are commonplace for me on the Treants and Ravens, but I seem to have better luck on the Hobgoblins and did extremely well on the high level spiders.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Forgot this part.... Got my first Slow mitigations last night on those lvl 63 spiders.  The consorts.  Infernal Consort and something else...  Got &quot;mostly successful&quot; on all of them, and they seemed as easy to slow as the others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Heh, I think that same guildie sold me my shiny new Tae Ew Shield over the weekend.  <br />
<br />
Glad I could subsidize yours- hehe.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hehehe.  Ephemeral is our resident tradeskill fanatic.  GM in 2 or 3 skills already with trophies.  He did the actual combines and Stromgold did a lot of camping for the Tae Ew stuff.  We also have a BD project going on for the tank types.<br />
<br />
I think they say that half of what they make they sell to help fund the rest of the combines that need to be done.  They're working with other GM smiths of varying races to accomodate each race in our alliance.  Going good so far.  :)<br />
<br />
If you can't camp it or kill for it, then make it.  Some of this stuff rivals some of the better equipment out there that drops from mobs.</div></div><hr />
