<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ictus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Experience: Post-50 characters will now gain far more experience from hunting NPCs at or above their own level than ever before. This is a test of a potential new system. Briefly, the idea isn't really that much of a stretch: The larger the risk you take, the larger the reward should be.  <br />
<br />
How is this working? Is it worth getting a group together go and try to exp on level 60 mobs? Or is this just a raid perk for those with the final kill?  I am assuming that if your lvl 60 you have to fight at or above your level to get the bonus, so are there any lvl 60 mobs that a average equiped group of lvl 60 players could kill for exp at a worth while rate?<br />
<br />
Experience: Post-50 &quot;hell&quot; effect levels are gone. There are no longer any levels in EverQuest that are anywhere near twice as hard as their previous levels. Please note: This does not change the amount of experience required to go from &quot;No experience in level 1&quot; to &quot;Full-bar in level 60.&quot; It's just about smoothing out the trip.  <br />
<br />
Now that the &quot;hell&quot; levels are gone, how bad are the levels now? <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">wonder how they going to remove Post-50 &quot;hell&quot; effect levels to make it fair for those lvl 50's player, <br />
<br />
these lvl58 will most welcome this change since they don't need to face big hell level when ding<br />
<br />
I think change on exp from higher NPC is for PoP expansion, there are almost zero chance to apply this exp in current exp group, except name which aren't main part of exp; maybe PoP will have lots of high level/low hp exp mob ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Loradenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Will the smoother track from 50-60 make it take more exp to fill your exp bar in 60 though?</div></div><hr />

- Probably. The same time it should lessen the XP loss in 60. Right now I lose about 19% XP from one death.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tolfu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I am just barely into level 59. Does smoothing out the exp to take away hell levels mean that I will see a slight roll back on my exp bar? I mean, if they smooth out lvl59's hell bar without just flat out getting ride of the required exp and instead roll it back to the lower lvl exp bars, than people at level 59 (or 54) will either see exp bar roll back, maybe I might even drop a level?......or they got a free ride getting to the hell lvl, not having to deal with the more smooth exp bar in the non hell levels. Yes, I think I even confused myself, hopefully someone understands.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah, was wondering about this as well.<br />
<br />
Let's say it takes 100 xp points to get to level 60.  I have 80 of them.  Now they're changing where the &quot;level markers&quot; are to smooth out the progression.  Am I one day going to log in to find that I have lost or gained a level because 80 xp now represents a different spot in the progression?<br />
<br />
If 54 and 59 are currently big hell levels, it stands to reason that the smoothing would move people in the low 50's up, right?  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The way I understand this XP change:<br />
<br />
Currently in level 54, player X has Y amount of XP. This is let's say 40% of the total XP needed for level 54. Now, when this change goes live, player X is going to have Z amount of XP, which is equal to 40% of current level 54. So in all the XP line won't change, one still will have 2 bubbles out of 5 (40% XP example). However, it won't take ages to get to 55, the road will be much smoother.<br />
<br />
So basically Verant will convert your current XP to the new XP that corresponds exactly to the same % of the level you are currently in.<br />
<br />
Of course I can be wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Your XP bar won't move.  Those that are currently at the beginning of 59 (or end of 58) will benefit because they won't have to do nearly as much xp in 59 as they would have before.  No one will end up being penalized.  If you aren't 50 yet it won't matter  51-60 still will be the same amount of XP.  If you are in the 50's already (say at 55), it won't matter because the levels you already did (51-54) will end up absorbing some of your future level's xp so you'll end up having to do less xp overall.<br />
<br />
No one loses out, except the person sitting at the beginning of 60 and they haven't filled their xp bar.  Even then, the benefit of not losing as much xp on death will make up for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Walgurorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It's looking like I made the right decision to work on AA at 58 then :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>howjan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I would assume they are still tuning this so anything said is probably premature.  But higher lvl zones that were ok xp before are definitly worth taking a crew into and crawling around in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'm unsure how the mob exp thing will work though.  Currently, a mob drops X exp.  If he's light blue or higher for you, then you get a slice of the pie.  Now, each player will see the mob through different &quot;exp glasses.&quot;  Does that mean that a grouped level 50 used to get y% of mob with exp X when grouped with a level 60, he now gets y% of the exp he sees with the level 50's exp glasses or the level 60's exp glasses?  Because the amount of exp they each see is very different, that's a vital statistic.  If it's the level 60's exp glasses then it means that the only benefit that a level 50+ will get by grouping with a higher level player is loot.  Exp will now be radically slowed down.  Can you say exp DAoC?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bamana DeMoro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Curses!  Now I have to fill up my xp in 60 before the patch!</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is only a guess as to how the extra XP might be implemented, but here goes -<br />
<br />
If you kill a light blue, you suffer an XP penalty.  As I understand it they apply a multiplier of 0.5 to the XP from light blues.<br />
<br />
Extending that concept - what if they just apply a multiplier of 1.1 to whites, 1.2 to yellows and 1.5 to reds?<br />
<br />
The overall XP for the mob is split among the group members as usual.  Then your share gets modified by the multiplier determined by your level relative to the mob's level.  Net effect is that the total XP awarded from that kill is higher than the XP of the mob, just like when the total XP from a light blue is lower than the XP of the mob.<br />
<br />
If this is the way it's done, it has no penalty to anyone - the level 60 in your group gets full blue XP, you get even-con or yellow XP which is more than you would have gotten.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">This has an interesting side-effect for anyone who's in their lower 50's.  Verant is going to &quot;smooth out&quot; the exp requirements for levels 50 - 60.  So each level going to take more exp to fill.  Therefore, let's say that now it takes it takes 100 mobs from 53 - 54 and 300 from 54 - 55.  When the patch comes out, it'll take 200 mobs to get from 53 - 54 (in game it'll actually be the average of all 10 levels, not just the two I used for an example), so the lower level plateau levels will be substantially harder for the Player to get to.<br />
<br />
You'll no longer have the huge pains of levels 54 and 59, but it's going to take you MUCH longer to reach those levels (which also have some good spells for you to use during the long levelling period).</div></div><hr />
