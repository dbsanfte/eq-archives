2) Do you think they should increase the level limit?</div></div><hr />

I think they are still cleaning up after that to some extent.<br />
<br />
I really don't see actual levels being increased for that reason. I'd expect more non-level based character advancement such are more AA skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaynia</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 07:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It would be somewhat possible to increase the level cap without grossly trivializing current encounters or throwing class balance out of whack. They could add yet another exp pool that would work as follows:<br />
<br />
After you max out level 60 any exp not allocated to AAXP would go into a PoP exp pool. Unlike AAXP, the amount of exp to &quot;ding&quot; would not be constant and would scale upwards as you would expect post-60 levels to (well, maybe not make it quite that harsh.... I dunno). Exp loss from death would still be taken from your regular exp pool meaning you'd have to max out your regular exp pool again before you can go back to work on the PoP pool. These PoP &quot;points&quot; or whatever you'd want to call them would act as levels but only when in PoP zones. In pre-PoP zones, the cap would still be 60. Throw in a bunch of new equipment/spells/disciplines/AA abilities/etc and make anything that would throw off class balance or trivialize encounters in pre-PoP zones have a minimum level of 61 or higher. Then the worst they could possibly do is mess up class balance in the new zones, but this is all going to be very high-end stuff so you'd be presumably going with friends and guildmates and whatnot so I don't see there being a big problem with people being excluded like some classes experienced (mostly in pick-up exp groups) after Kunark came out and still do experience to some degree. That'd probably be the way I would go about raising the level cap if I were them. Or at least use an idea somewhat like that. I'll admit it's a little rough around the edges and could probably use some work.</div></div><hr />

A little complicated but still very creative.  If they put something like that in I really wouldn't mind it.  Raising the current lvl cap like Kunark however...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yuma</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 10:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Raising lvl cap would throw current encounters IMO, things that would require a raid force could be done with a single group. But then again VI could raise lvl/abilitys on current high lvl mobs to counter this, which would throw lower lvl peeps in the deep end cause then theyd need to suddenly raise lvls/people for raids. Could u imagine camping a mob for weeks, and after PoP it spawns and instead of conning Blue and tough, its Red and is the love child of the Sleeper and Vu'lakk.</div></div><hr />

Oh Thats a good one!  Your right though. Anything they do they will have to revamp the mobs if they up the levels.  One thing they could do, is revamp as well alot of older zones that don't see much action.  I would really liek them to up PoH and PoF in power.  Not the entry areas, but perhaps the &quot;castle&quot; areas of each.  The closer you get to the gods the harder the mobs get.  Right now, CT owns PoF.  ALso, Droga, Nurga, PAW and all them could be level 45+ zones if they wanted to be.  Kunark was revolutionary in ideas, they just needed to flesh it out more.  THey need to take and make more zones like SEbilis so I'm not sitting at level 55 LFG and beign told &quot;Your not high enough&quot;.  That is just sickening.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ranyn</div><div class="date">05-11-2002, 06:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing I'd find kind of interesting, although I know it'll never happen, is to allow people to become split class. My ideas for it...<br />
<br />
Limit it to the 60 crowd as they did with AAXP and 50+.<br />
<br />
Secondary class would be limited to level 30 (No warriors with CH :) )<br />
<br />
Max level would become 90 (60 in primary, 30 in secondary)<br />
<br />
Weapon and armor restrictions would continue to be based on your primary class.<br />
<br />
Each level post 60 would cost as much as it takes to fill the lvl 60 bar (after all, you're not becoming that much more powerful, so there's no need to gain huge amounts of XP to be able to cast that level 4 cleric spell)<br />
<br />
I think it would lead to some really interesting character development. For example, many shaman complain about not having Rez. Under this system, with lot's of XP grinding, they could get the level 29 rez. (Although I think my shaman would end up becoming a secondary monk :D )<br />
<br />
<br />
Rangers could get backstab :)  (although since they'd be capped at level 30 for rogue abilities, they'd max out at 150 skill)<br />
<br />
Wizards who want more HPs could become secondary warriors.<br />
<br />
Warriors with the abilty to cast all of the 30 or lower druid ports anyone?<br />
<br />
<br />
Like I said, I know it'll never happen, but I do think it'd lead to some interesting, and more diverse, characters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Warrior/Druid = Ranger with more hitpoints/AC, just don't get the bow skills, or the high end spells.  Big whoop.<br />
<br />
They'd have to allow Hybrids to do something on top of Multi-Classing.  Perhaps, not allow us to do so, and have it so no one can multiclass into our class (why would anyone?), but give us even more AA skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EriulEA</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 12:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It might not be as incredibly unbalancing as you think having dual class characters if they were restricted to race-specific class-options and lvl caps on the secondary character.  For example, much as I would love it, I couldn't be a wood-elf Ranger/shammy or Ranger/monk.  I'd have to be a Ranger/druid/bard/rogue, etc... And with level caps on the secondary character, you wouldn't see Human warrior/clerics chealing themselves.  <br />
<br />
Granted, humans could be ranger/monks, but I never said it was perfect.  Just interesting to think about.</div></div><hr />

Besides Paladin/Warrior for dual wield, how about.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ranger/Enchanter for self-clarity<br />
Ranger/Druid for gate and ports<br />
Ranger/Magician for pets<br />
Ranger/Rogue for rogue hide&amp;sneak, picklocks, pickpocket &amp; backstab<br />
Ranger/Shaman for haste and other buffs when soloing<br />

Allow only UNrelated classes to  multiclass. Rangers couldn't multi with druids or warriors but could on the Cleric, Wizzard, Necro, Mage, Chanter.<br />
Necro/SK could multi with Druid (think Drzzt or whatever his name is spelled), Chanter, Mage..... you get the picture. <br />
Basically, the hybrids would be disallowed their parent classes but allowed the others, Parent Classes would not be allowed their hybrid cousins class which would eliminate the warrior/ranger multi etc.</div></div><hr />

I can't wait for the new &quot;pet pathing&quot; aa ability but who am I kidding they can't fix pathing. I play a necro also so I'm a bit jaded about the way pets path. We already have been insulted with the pet hold aa ability which they should've implemented at lvl 1. Atleast the problem is somewhat addressed with Summon companion.<br />

<br />
Ethereal Bladed Naginata (my favorite)<br />
The Coldain Ring series (my second favorite)<br />
Most epics, story-wise (mage and wizard are both practically plotless and too hard)<br />
<br />
Problems with these great in-game stories that everyone would love to participate in (many not just for the &quot;lewtz&quot;)?  You need very strong support.  There is very little built directly into the game that is as cool and fun as these quests without requiring very large amounts of people involved (2 groups aiming for a single person's reward is a large amount, to me).<br />
<br />
I would like to be able to round up some of my friends, and over the course of a week participate in a great quest that ends with one or more of us having a cool little item.  Instead, the best my friends and I can do is the &quot;Messenger Run of Truth&quot; which is like just about every other quest in the game: Run back and forth with messages for silly and minimal conversations, then kill something slightly tough at the end for &quot;ph47 13w7z&quot;.

But honestly, just stop and think of multiclassing just about any class with a 30 necro... scary isn't it.

I know EQ is not (strictly speaking) a 'role playing game' anymore(read it on the boards somewhere) but aren't some of the multi-classing proposals a tad. . .odd?<br />
<br />
Warrior-druid? troll scratching his butt porting you all around? sorry, have trouble visualizing that. . .<br />
warrior-necro? errr, you DO realize all the faction problems that will arise from this, no?<br />
<br />
If they're going to impliment multi-classing, they should restrict your alternate class to other classes your race/deity is capable of supporting.<br />
<br />
Not sure bout every_single_ race/deity/class combo around, but you'd still see ranger/rogue, warrior/druid (not sure here, can warriors worship tunare?) and rogue/SK's. . .<br />
<br />
Obviously, my idea is half baked at most, but it's still a thought ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kullaas</div><div class="date">06-15-2002, 11:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem is, the Cleric/Warrior/Rogue/Wizard combo that currently dominates EQ isn't a completly intentional effect on VI's part.  It's a problem that dominates high end raids:  High end content dictates that each class can only play one role.  This is more a function of the nature of the high end.  Thus, classes that has strength in diversity, get screwed.  The raising of the level cap doesn't dictate that this domination will continue.  It depends more on the nature of the content in POP. If they simply increase the damage output and HP's of mobs, then yes, it will stay.  But if they create new, different content, I suspect other classes *may* rise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yzen Danek</div><div class="date">06-16-2002, 12:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Instead of multiclassing, I'd just like to see greater specialization. Not the aaxp type, which isn't really specialization at all, because given enough time and effort, you can have all the abilities. No, I mean real specialization, where you choose an area of focus for your character, and get better at it, at the expense of other possible foci.<br />
<br />
e.g. Ranger specialization choices.<br />
<br />
Path of Nature's Servant - improvement to the effects and durations of buffs and/or heals, access to new buffs not otherwise available.<br />
<br />
Path of the Stormcaller - improved nukes, access to ice based spells.<br />
<br />
Path of the Blademaster - increasing damage bonus to offhand, innate atk bonus, new melee discs.<br />
<br />
Path of the Marksman - increased chance to hit, new bow discs.(For example, the ability to make a 'called shot' for double damage once every 2 minutes, which wouldn't be overpowering, but could make for an amazing pulling tool solo and in small groups).<br />
<br />
Like spellcaster's specialization or tradeskills, the early levels of specialization could be equally pursued, but past a certain level, you would need to choose one. Your choice would of course depend upon your playstyle; while PoNS would be a moderately weak spec for a solo or single group player, being able to cast a better CoP, SoN, FoN, or CoE than a ranger of any other spec would be an amazing asset for your guild.<br />
<br />
The main thing in my opinion though is having to choose. The biggest problem I see with aaxp is that it only promotes diversity in the short term - eventually we will all have all the useful abilities.</div></div><hr />

Not sure bout every_single_ race/deity/class combo around, but you'd still see ranger/rogue, warrior/druid (not sure here,<br />
---- can warriors worship tunare? ---- ....<br />

Read my signature one post above!! hehe ;D Of course I'm a woodelf, so I'm not sure if the other warrior races can.<br />

I hope they raise the cap, even if we have the exact same skills we had at 60, I just want to see that number go up. <br />

you're a bit of a mazochist, eh ?</div></div><hr />

If there was a path than made Rangers more of a Strider type Ranger, and less of a Robin Hood type, I'd be overjoyed!!<br />
<br />
[edit] Perhaps a way would be to add 'Discipline' AA points, as a 4th tier of AA. i.e., so many AA points in 'Class', then you can start buying Disciplines with AA.<br />
<br />
[edit 2] Of course, to be fair, Verant would have to come up with a 4th tier for non-disc classes, too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
None of that will happen of course. What I would like to see is the level limit increased by maybe only 2 or 3 levels. Here is my reasoning:<br />
<br />
Most guilds have not even caught up with being able to hunt some of the major Kunark areas, let alone Velious and Luclin. The 2-3 extra levels would now allow the medium-sized guilds to go out there and enjoy the major Kunark/Velious and some Luclin areas. Meanwhile, some of the greater zones in PoP can be made challenging for the &quot;Ueber&quot; guilds without them having to first completely clean out Velious and Luclin and head up there with 50 or more people.<br />
<br />
I am of course also hoping for a bunch of new spells for all the classes, and new AXP skills. And a PET! :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Seriana</div><div class="date">06-17-2002, 05:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, assuming that the new zones START at the difficulty level of the current planes - why not let us advance to level 65 or 70?<br />
<br />
That 18 or 19 hard zones.  If 4 or 5 are the level of Hate or Fear, then the rest will scale up from there and be REALLY hard.<br />
<br />
We might need to be lvl 65 or 70 to beat the highest level ones.  <br />
<br />
I do think they should cap things so you will not be attacked by mobs more than 20 levels below you, and you can't attack them.  Once you hit level 61 that is.  This could help eliminate the uberness of higher level PC's, while still allowing hunting in some lower level places.<br />
<br />
As far as new stuff to give us - how about all of our parent classes spells up to and including level 39 once we hit level 61?  And then access to the next spell levels as we level too?<br />
<br />
By the time we are level 70, we will have all the Druid spells up to lvl 50.  Not too bad I think.  Of course the Druids will be getting even more powerful spells as they level too, so we won't be taking anything from them.  And, with our meager mana pool, mobs are in little danger of us nuking them to death.</div></div><hr />

Sub-classes would be way to unbalancing...<br />
<br />
Besides Paladin/Warrior for dual wield, how about.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ranger/Enchanter for self-clarity<br />
Ranger/Druid for gate and ports<br />
Ranger/Magician for pets<br />
Ranger/Rogue for rogue hide&amp;sneak, picklocks, pickpocket &amp; backstab<br />
Ranger/Shaman for haste and other buffs when soloing<br />
Ranger/Warrior for ability to wear warrior armour <br />
<br />
Wizard/Monk! :D Manaburn that dragon then FD!<br />
<br />
Oddly enough, in the roleplaying game I've played over the course of the last 7 years, my main character is a wizard/monk.  Started off as a spell caster, learned the ancient martial arts, but ultimately went back to the mystical arts.</div></div><hr />

Even if it did damage as bad as the druid's bear pet I would want it.<br />
Or maybe an outdoor familiar that gives you a tracking boost or some other neat perk.<br />
AA skills that allow you to cast certain spell types (cold damage) - they dont do more damage than our fire ones, the damage type is just different.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see some AA skills that aren't all about 'raid efficiency, uber dps,etc' - could they just be you know, fun?<br />
<br />
Everyone currently goes for the same AA advancement pathway it seems - I'd just like to see more variety and depth in the skill tree with some pathways closed off when you pursue another.<br />
<br />
It would be kind of neat if a ranger could forsake a certain branch of  AA like archery (yeah I know its a stretch) to open up another advancement tree that lets them lean more towards casting like a druid (access to casting spells like frost and a larger mana pool).<br />
<br />
Also having some AA skills attainable for the 30-50 people would be nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeninya</div><div class="date">06-22-2002, 12:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">or, how about a &quot;crippling shot&quot; archery skill...  just like wizzy manaburn but for achery ^_^ (ok, maybe slightly less damage than manaburn)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I never liked the 60 thing. 50 was okay, nice round figure, but 60 is like a hiccup hehe. We should at least make it 75 or 100, just sounds better. But imagine the time it would take! lol<br />
<br />
They could raise the bar, but they would need to make it like the old world dragons/level limit if they do. If you were to become a certain level, you could no longer fight certain lower level mobs.<br />
<br />
AA is kewl and all, but eventually the new will wear off and ppl will not have any new goals to reach, thus, the end.<br />
<br />
The one thing that drives me in game, is reaching the next level (and of course better gear, but you can only reach so high)<br />
<br />
One I were to max out levels, AA pts, I would really be bored with the game. I mean, new content is good, but really, how long does the fun last?</div></div><hr />

With the growing number of high end guilds on each server these days there are just not enough mobs to go around.<br />
<br />
And unless they want to revamp the whole of the old world as well they can't make chars to powerfull or a lot of stuff ( allready has realy) will just become trivial.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Llanoldar Lluindar</div><div class="date">06-24-2002, 01:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think multiclassing could work if you restriced the options.  For one thing you would only be able to use weapons that your second class could use if your first could, OR VI could put restrictions on the power of 2nd class weapons you can use much like the restricted level system already in place, which would keep multiclassers from using the wrong epic weaps for instance.  For another thing, each class could only mc with certain other ones, heres a basic list (melees/priests/casters):<br />
<br />
OH, and one other thing, no breaking deity rules, you can only multi with classes that have same deity (racial restrictions would need some serious thinking about, but some can break racial restrictions) , note that this gives a slight advantage to agnostics, but they dont get the new awesome deity armor plus they miss all the deity quests in PoP.<br />
<br />
Paladins: Warriors (no dw), clerics (more spells), shamans.<br />
<br />
Rangers: Rogues, monks, BLs (pet would be like 55 druid spell to a 60 ranger coming from a 30 BL multiclass) and bards (all dw capable, no warriors cause we're not defensive, and since we cant cast while moving/fighting, bards songs are about half or less usefull).<br />
<br />
Rogues: Warriors, and monks (no rangers cause they shouldn't get spells)<br />
<br />
Monks: Warriors and rogues (since they cant use pierce no BS, but they do get hide/sneak and pp).<br />
<br />
Shadowknights: Warriors (again no dw), necros (more spells), and rogues (no dw, but BS with a low max dmg restriction, like 1.25 -1.5 their normal max hit as max dmg for bs and no minimum).<br />
<br />
Bards: Since bards have a funky mana pool they can only multi with melee/hybrids but dont get any spells, instead they get all the skills that class gets capped at 120, as well as additional hp/ac.<br />
<br />
Cleric: Paladins (makes em tougher, no swords tho, and no LH cause there are evil clerics), shamans, enchs (get all spells except that they only get 1 single target mez and only alacrity for haste) and BLs.<br />
<br />
Shamans: BLs, clerics and warriors (no dw)<br />
<br />
Druids: Clerics, rangers (no dw), wizards, shamans (no 2hp).<br />
<br />
Beastlords: Shamans, bards(see above), and warriors (no double attack)<br />
<br />
Wizards: Magicians (No pets, just summons and other stuff), enchs (see clerics for this), and druids (no 1hs skill).<br />
<br />
Magicians: Enchs (see above), wizards (no ports), and druids (no ports!).<br />
<br />
Necros: Sks (no slashing), and wizards (no ports!) and enchs (see above).<br />
<br />
Enchs: Wizards (no ports), magicians (no pets) and necros (no pets).<br />
<br />
Boy that took a long time...feel free to comment, and keep in mind its a rough idea.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Basicaly, your character would be capabale of entering certain zones and would possess certain powers that are disturbingly strong, but you cant affect anything on the &quot;Real World&quot; of norrath anymore. You basically ascend among the gods.You can still travel there, but you cant be affected by the mobs and you cant affect them. <br />
<br />
You would be able to play in the planes, however, against planar bad guys and in planar zones.  Perhaps an Immortal's purposes would be to carve out a plane of their own....<br />
<br />
Just a thought. It would be a fun way to do real estate and a sensible way to controll people soloing Kunark Dragons. <br />
