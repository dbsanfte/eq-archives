<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I've been unavoidably removed from the game for quite a while now, almost since the release of Gates.  As such, I know that Caanus is FAR behind the power curve.<br />
<br />
  Well, back when I was hitting into some of the higher end of Luclin mobs (near to PoP release) I realized that with a bit more of an upgrade to DPS and sustainable healing capability that RC was probably a doable solo.<br />
<br />
 So, my question is... which of you is the one who is willing and talented enough to pull it off?   There is no doubt in my mind that it CAN be done now with our capabilities.  Someone wanting to train themselves for the endurance required and find areas of the zone safe enough can practice on the giant zebra/yak thingy (forgot his name, the one who barely fits in the entrance and isn't nice to fight there cause the AE would reach zone in).  With the stun of the yak you would have a slightly safer simulation of the damage spikes RC will toss at you, so I think that they may be a fair comparison (actually Mr. Yak/stun may be the harder one).<br />
<br />
<br />
  So, despite the glory-hound part of me that says to keep my mouth shut until I have the parse showing that I did it, I want to know who has the gear, AA and most importantly.. guts, to pull this one off now.<br />
<br />
<br />
  And if not RC, find another.   I think that it'd be quite a nice boost for many people to have a new ultimate skill solo to work toward.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Rumblecrush is no challenge nowadays.<br />
<br />
As much as it's going to hurt a few people, Yeldema was not a hard solo back then either, though. In fact, I'd say RC is today exactly what Yeldema was at the beginning of Velious, so that was a good pick, actually.<br />
<br />
It's hard to say what a challenging mob would be for a Shaman nowadays. There are many nice mobs that would represent a challenge, but which we just can't get to or get them to us without outside help. <br />
<br />
For the sake of naming a goal for any highend Shaman, I'd say XTC in Ssra. I have tried him twice and have gotten him to 68%. That's good enough for me to assume that with a good amount of practice and the abolute best gear available there's a slim chance to win before DoN.<br />
<br />
Another challenge for highend Shamans is the PoF named horse or spider. Those are not easy to beat, albeit a totally different kind of fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">even solo?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">even solo?<br />
<br />
Yes, RC is an easy pull and an easy kill. Solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hrm, so which mob out there WOULD be a nice challenge for skills all around, anyone have any ideas?<br />
<br />
  I guess 3 expansions has pretty much stripped my understanding of our exact powerlevel at this point (fortunately)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Did try the PoFire named fire dude near the entrance but he hit just a bit too hard and got me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>FloppyDisks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">LDoN Normal Solo Win?<br />
LDoN Hard Solo Win?<br />
<br />
Assuming you have two friends get the adventure with you etc. then only you zone in.<br />
<br />
&lt;grin&gt; What about one of the named outside Emp Ssra's chamber?  That  would be one hell of a long fight.  :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Seems to me that the LDoN wins would be a bit too easy, unless you specified assassination type.   If it was collect or rescue it'd just be a matter of killing enough mobs fast enough, and I doubt many would have problems with that.<br />
<br />
  I forgot about Comm3, always intended to test if I could have done the entire emp key solo.  From what I recall of them all that those would be is simply long, if RC isn't actually a problem at all then I highly doubt the AE effects of those guys would do much we can't handle.</div></div><hr />

I haven't waded far into oow yet, just been camping NC named.  Someone who has some xp in wos might be able to point out a tough named.  Or something in the ruined city of dranik perhaps?<br />

XTC is a good idea though :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Those 3rd floor named for the insignia don't summon, I don't know offhand if they're root-immune.  I tried kiting one down as a bard, it was going all right until he pathed too close to one of the pillars and I got quite a few adds :)</div></div><hr />

I remember RC raids.  I think he quads for 1k ish only but unslowed he hits really fast.  One of these days I should try 2 boxing him (of course then I have ramp to deal with).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I'd be satisfied with a seru duo :p<br />
<br />
an SK buddie and i are going to try this actually, but someone has been farming the **** out of him so we have yet to find him up.  if we get the chance to do it i'll let you know how it goes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">RC is easy to split from his guards because he runs extremely fast compared to them, therefore just pull him and start running to the iz.. checkin back to make sure that he's following.  He'll outrun his guards who will eventually give up chase.  After that you just have to make sure that you keep him close to the zone edge to not get any of the other things to add.<br />
<br />
He hits hard when he hits, but once slowed and crippled he hits fairly slow.  Hardest part about him I thought was that he tempted to interupt me a lot, and that's what eventually killed me.  Stunned me a bunch too from that (damn, if I was an ogre it would have been easy).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">i attempted RC once. had no clue how to get him solo but as mentioned above he outruns the guards and you get him solo if you don't agro any trash mobs. that's what i did but i agroed a robe also. they was both slowed but the combined DPS was a bit much so i zoned.<br />
<br />
i also did an LDoN adventure solo back in the 65 days. completed it after the extra 30 minutes thanks to an LD :(</div></div><hr />

What was it at when you started? 50?<br />
<br />
Seriously, I know the School Leader pretty well. There's no way you got him to 45% on your own. <br />
It used to take me about 12 mins to duo him with a warrior that pumps out 350 DPS and me DoT'ing and nuking as well. It would take a Shaman 30 minutes to get him down to 45%, if he didn't have to worry about the healing and the School Leader isn't really slowable(he is, but cures it every tick), so that its damage to a Shaman is quite substantial.<br />
<br />
Happen to have logs or screenshots?</div></div><hr />

school leader dose indead cure him self but with chain casting TA inbetween heals it gose back and forth, spirit chanaling helps lots on this fight aswell as being able to use your mount in NC, i was raid buffed at the time so i had 12,000 hp and 2100 ish ac with a 9500 mana pool and you can tell buy my maglo. also a good thing to know is that our Curse of Sisslak line adds cuse counters wich hes self cure dose not take off only poisen des and dispell letting the dot run its full corse with out getting dispelld<br />
<br />
and as i siad i did not kill him</div></div><hr />

As I said, I know the School Leader. I am not sure why you posted your magelo. 12K HPs(Where did you get the 400 HPs from?) and 2100 AC aren't bad, but they aren't incredibly high either and even less are they going to explain how you did over 200k damage(including regen) while keeping yourself alive. <br />
Even if you maintained 200 DPS(you can't use a pet as its gonna get raped the second the School Leader blurrs itself and he does that every 2 or 3 ticks), it would take you a good 20 minutes to get him to 45%.<br />
<br />
But how did you do 200 DPS while casting TA(which is actually a waste of time considering a tick is 6 seconds and the cast time is 3), heals and DoTs?<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'd be curious to see some logs, if you decided to try again.</div></div><hr />

 the extra  400 hp are from guild tribut , leader aa's and the clicky off my mask if the inferno<br />
<br />
looking threw my eq file i was able to find about the last 10 min of my fight my spells are off i  and my pet seems to be OOR most the fight and had to remake him once or twice<br />

I just stuck around one morning at 4am after the rest of group bailed and I couldnt resist giving him a poke when he popped. I actually went completely OoM at one point, damage was coming in too fast to cannibalize, the only thing that saved me was a huge stroke of luck when he turned to flee, and there just happened to be no roamers in his retreat-path.<br />

There are things you can believe and others you just can't. The reason I asked for logs for the School Leader is that I already knew it was a lie. <br />

<br />
12k is decent for the high end, it's not the average, don't get me wrong. Buffs add about 3k HPs nowadays, so that somebody with 8.3k unbuffed HPs tops out at 11.3k(just gear + raid buffs). Then you can add the Form of Endurance clicky for another 180 HPs, putting you at 11.5k. Personal Tribute, Guild Tribute, Group LA and Raid LA and voila you're sitting at 12k.<br />
<br />
That said, even 15k wouldn't be enough to solo the School Leader.</div></div><hr />

I did most of my soloing there before I got sisslak and new poison dot and it became a lot easier after they were available.  The ones that cast are easier obviously (like granitecrush and the Orniae whatever the foul near him).<br />

Ok, I tried this yesterday... I easily single pulled RC to the zone line. He was slowed and crippled before I got him to camp. I began the fight with symbol, oak, clair, and self buffs. With tribute I am around 9K with those.<br />
<br />
I got him to 80 percent before I realized I just wasn't going to have the mana to keep up with healing myself and being able to kill him so I left.<br />
<br />
Giac, what else do you think I need to add to my magelo before I can take him down, if you don't mind.... I like challenges, but see a gap in either my approach or my gear. If it's the gear I can work on it and come back later, if it's the approach I can go back and work on that now by trial and error.<br />

Your HPs are high enough, but you are lacking in the AC department. I honestly don't know how much this factors in, but you're missing the Omens defensive AAs as well, which coupled with the relatively low AC probably forces you to bridge heal yourself too much and draining your mana.<br />
<br />
If I was you, I'd get the Omens defensive AAs(might not be an option as 50 AAs will take some time) and Healing Boon 3(I'd get that first as this will make your HoTs even more efficient) to make up for your low AC(getting higher AC will take too long).<br />
<br />
Other than that, try to use the new Cripple, if you have got this, and make a smart use of Spiritual Channeling(that alone should solve all your mana issues), but the actual key to an easy win is to keep your HoT up 100% of the time(don't refresh it late or a lucky bash will interrupt you and it will drop).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">Thanks for the response Giac, I appreciate it. I do have the new cripple and thought about using spiritual channeling, maybe next time.<br />
<br />
Defensive aa's were next on my list but I don't get much time to grind these days so I'll go HoT first, then hit the aa's. I'll try again when I get half way through the omens aa for defensive to take another benchmark.<br />
<br />
Again, thanks for the time you took to give me information, I appreciate it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">HTs are resistable, DTs were never resistable as far as I know.<br />
<br />
Aammer of Fallen Alliance on Prexus resisted one once. I used to read their mainpage when he did the updates, it was pretty oldschool though. I think this was during a Fear raid, when CT tried to DT him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">Karshak, I agree with Giac that tis all about aa, but I disagree that your ac is unfixable.  You've already had some success with MPG trials, getting more items from there will be a big deal.  Back, Shoulders, Face, Secondary, Range, Finger are all great upgrades for you, plus hp augs from RSS.  Raw hp doesn't help reduce mob dps, but it does allow you more leeway for Spiritual Serenity to do it's thing, so that you don't need so many blast heals.<br />
<br />
Capping out Reflexive Mastery and Defensive Instincts will make the biggest difference, imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Naghite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">I partially resisted many a DT in PoA before they changed it to irresistable (bah UN, bah!! ) :)  I never did live through one back then though....I was probably running 3K hp raid buffed /wink.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">Karshak, I agree with Giac that tis all about aa, but I disagree that your ac is unfixable.<br />
<br />
Where did I say it's 'unfixable'? I just pointed out that acquiring the ~200 AC he's short, will take longer than my other suggestions. The same reason I am suggesting to get Healing Boon 3 before the defensive AAs. This won't reduce the mobs DPS, but up his passive healing(Something that is vey important when you are unable to use the Canni spell much due to interrupts and high damage output).<br />
<br />
Anyway, next time you try, just use regen a Cleric AC buff and VotB or the ranger AC/DS buff(Guard of Earth is their newest, which is more AC, but like the previous versions of the line doesn't stack with VotB). Throw in a DS potion to maximize your DPS and you'll win. It's all in how you use Spiritual Channeling.<br />
<br />
Another thing: Don't bother using anything but magic DoTs(Anathema is too mana inefficient and the Epic casts too slow, so leave those out).</div></div><hr />

RC's rampage makes it impossible to use a pet. This wouldn't be a problem when fighting Statue and make up plenty for the mana you lose from not being able to meditate during the fight.<br />
<br />
Anyway, it's all theory, but I don't remember Statue's minimum hit being too high, so that its Damage Interval must constitute the larger part of its damage. This means that high AC will reduce its DPS by far more than it will RC's.</div></div><hr />
