<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>scarnage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I'm typing this at work, so I am only like 85% sure this is even the right name for the AA, but I'm thinking about training the AA that creates a healing ward (as described in the AA box)...  Can someone with that abiltity explain how it works?  For example, is it stationary once called?  Does the shaman control when it's triggered or is there another trigger?  How much does it heal?  Pretty much anything a newb might need to know would be appreciated  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think you're getting two AAs confused:<br />
<br />
Call of the Ancients   - stationary ward with a regen<br />
<br />
Lasts 5.5 minutes, 30 minute refresh, wards do not stack (clerics, druids and shaman all receive this ability)<br />
<br />
Call of the Ancients I - 30 hitpoints <br />
Call of the Ancients II<br />
Call of the Ancients III - 50 hitpoints<br />
<br />
Ancestral Aid   - group heal over time, can be MGbed<br />
<br />
Lasts 5 ticks, stacks with all other heal over time (except other shaman Ancestral aid), recast (15 minutes? not sure).<br />
<br />
I would highly highly recommend Ancestral Aid. You can start training this ability at level 67.<br />
<br />

8:  Increase STR by 30 <br />
9:  Increase Hitpoints v2 by 278 per tick <br />
10:  Increase DEX by 30 <br />
<br />

<br />

8:  Increase STR by 60 <br />
9:  Increase Hitpoints v2 by 305 per tick <br />
10:  Increase DEX by 60 <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Very good guide Sam - I just have a couple of questions<br />
<br />
1) I wonder why you haven't marked Ancestral Aid as a &quot;must have&quot; - personally having got level 1 a few days ago I see it as very useful for grouping and almost essential for a raiding shaman?<br />
<br />
2) You put Origin as as a &quot;must have&quot; - I'm puzzled why a gate to home city for 7 aa is a must for a class that can cast gate?<br />
<br />
Not trying to have a go at you, just puzzled over these two choices?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>darkark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'd like the origin AA, just so I could bind myself anywhere and still know I have a safe way to get out of wherever that was, in case I die.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tebion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">@darkark: when you buy a spiritstone fitting to your race you can have that, too, without spending aas :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I need to fix that - AA is must have. At the time I did it, I wasn't yet 70, so those last few were based on others' opinions. Also, I really like SC#/ASC#, even though it maybe doesn't make much of a dent in some mobs, it can buy time and give interrupts.<br />
<br />
Several folks have asked me to give more explicit info on the various aas, like percentage increase each level... does everyone want that?</div></div><hr />

Nope, but you got Gate.<br />
<br />
And yeah Samanna, that'd be cool to see on the site, IMO.<br />

Between Spiritstone, PoK Gate Necklace, and Bind I have 3 legitimate &quot;spots&quot;. Orgin is WAY WAY down on my list, thats for sure. Even if I suddenly got 200 aa tomorrow, I dont think I would buy Origin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Nope, but you got Gate.<br />

If you die, you are already at your bind point. Gate will do nothing for you...</div></div><hr />

That's why you keep a second Spiritstone in the bank.  ;)</div></div><hr />

Hope your not one of these who think pok books dumbed the game down :).<br />

Seems a waste of 7 AA to get this ability but hey some people seem to like it.<br />

Um... thanks. If you could actually point out what needs to be changed, I'll change it. Or point me to a reference with these details.</div></div><hr />

I still like my bogus AA more than yours, though, because RL whisky still gives a better RL glow than even a successful &quot;I soloed Quarm&quot; hoax could ever do.</div></div><hr />
