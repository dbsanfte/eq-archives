<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Stareff2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Havent seen a good discussion in a while regarding the two. I am 56 now and am quite Happy with my mana pool and wis. I do however feel like my base may a tad bit off according to some talks Ive read about and the advantages of more hp/sta than of wis and mana.<br />
<br />
I know that after 200 wis the mana conversion rate drops. Also I typically get a HoV or Aego or the like unless I want a PoTG or etc.<br />
Fully buffed I average 3800-4k hp's which is plenty to take DMG (when needed, ie slowing a resisting mob). I really feel I dont need any more HP than that. <br />
<br />
Anyone care to help my thinking out a bit here? What do I do pre and post 60. Ill leave a magelo link to help you all see where im at. Some of the gear just sux and will be my next purchase.<br />
<br />
I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this topic! Thankls Shaman brothers and sisters.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Seems like you've got a decent balance going there...  I tend to skew towards HP/AC myself whenever possible, and yet somehow I'm still at like 260 wis.  I just figure that hitpoints can save your arse when something decides it doesn't like you, and can always be turned into mana when needed.  <br />
<br />
It really becomes more of an issue when you get Cann5 though...  That takes 1924 hitpoints to use, so it's nice to have enough hp to do it unbuffed after a rez and to be able to do it mid-battle without drawing low HP aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Basicly, I feel that it starts with Wis and ends with HP.<br />
<br />
At level 1, Wis is the important stat for mana, but as you go up in levels and get access to Can2, Can3, Can4, then Can5, HP slowly takes over as the primary stat.<br />
<br />
My shaman was my first character and I've only been playing about 9 months, so I had to learn that lesson the hard way.  ;)<br />
<br />
BUT, I do believe that no matter how important HP is, you should always keep an eye on your wis.  If a new item will give you a net increase of 25hp but cost you 8 wis, you might want to rethink it.  Wisdom isn't critical once you get Can V, but remember that Wisdom DOES affect your fizzle rate.  You can get around this with the SCM AA ability (reduces fizzles as well as cutting mana cost of spells), but until you have SCM3 I'd make Wisdom at least a secondary priority.<br />
<br />
But even with SCM3, you should always strive for the highest HP you can get combined with as good a wis as you can manage.  I have several pieces of gear that has no wis, but I also do a great deal of LDoN and have a few +wis augments.  I augment my no-Wis gear with Wis augs.<br />
<br />
Augments make it a bit easier to keep your wis up while concentrating on HP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Channeling skill affects your fizzle rate, as does your casting skills in general. Never heard that wisdom does, mines only 192 and I don't fizzle any more than my druid that has 240.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">HP is largely irrelevant until L 58. Obviously, more is better for purposes of staying alive, but your HP pool before L 58 has no effect on your mana regen capabilities. It doesn't in any meaningful way affect how fast you can get mana back. <br />
<br />
At 58 it starts to matter, because you'd like to have enough HP to use Kragg's mending efficiently for cannibalize purposes. That means you need around 2500 self-buffed to get full efficiency out of it, and at that HP level it's still QUITE dangerous to use near anything aggressive. So more would be better. When you get Torpor at 60 you'll use that instead.  When you get Canni V. you need over 2k unbuffed hp to stay alive when using it, and at least 3k selfbuffed (more?) so you don't get low HP aggro from using it. <br />
<br />
All IMHO. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gildanni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I recently started switching over to HP/AC, and <br />
can see a big improvement on just about everything.  I keep thinking that I can still lose some WIS items but since I started getting some better items, I think my WIS has gone UP.  It's a HUGE difference, going AC/HP than WIS route.     Most of the newer items I have gotten still have WIS, and STA on them, just better HP and AC.  In my younger leverls, WIS was the in thing... and now that I'm over 60...no matter what I do, I still gain WIS.  *shrugs*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">... and now that I'm over 60...no matter what I do, I still gain WIS.  *shrugs*<br />
<br />
Yea I'm mostly HPs gear, but all the upgrades that I'm looking at now<br />
have wis and HPs as well. I surely would like to get over 200 wis unbuffed. Not for the mana but for the fizzles.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't have hard parsing, only personal experience and corroborated agreement with other casters in my guild.<br />
<br />
When I got level 56 and started getting my 56 spells, I had a TERRIBLE time with fizzles.  I was fizzling an average of once every 4 casts on my spells 55 and over for non-alteration spells, and about 1 in 8 in alteration (my specialization).  But then I got some decent +wis/+hp combined gear, wis went up about 15 points, and the fizzle rate dropped drastically.<br />
<br />
This was with channeling and magic skill maxed.<br />
<br />
Channeling and the magic skill determine fizzles until you get into the over-55 range of spells, then wis (or int, if you're an int caster) starts to matter.<br />
<br />
I can't back it up with &quot;hard numbers,&quot; but I know plenty of casters who agree that your casting stat does matter once you get into the PoP tier2 range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">we all do it different.  i tend towards AC a bit, with an eye to balanced resists; when hunting for HP's and wis / mana gear.<br />
<br />
plus i will never go without a haste item again.<br />
<br />
hit points are termendously important, but without AC a shaman is just a Druman who has to convert to mana first before he uses it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Wis is crap and virtually meaningless for shaman at all levels.  Hit points are god at all levels.  AC is DemiGod.  +Raw Mana is nice.  Not uber, but nice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
That pretty much summarizes my views on this topic.<br />
<br />
I think a young shaman should aspire to reach a high wisdom for a large mana pool, as shaman aren't very mana efficient early, damage isn't that high at lower levels, and the returns on regen/canni dancing aren't huge.  It's not very hard to get a nice high wisdom early in your shaman career and I feel it pays huge dividends as you have a large supply of ready mana complimented by canni/regen.<br />
<br />
As you level up and naturally upgrade your gear I think it's good to begin to shift to higher ac/sta/hp gear around about 50ish.  There's a bunch of gear that seems to be common for us in the 50-60 range that's rich in ac/sta/hp with good +wis/mana too.  I believe that if you get many of these common items for in for that level range you'll be doing well.<br />
<br />
I personally started to switch to +ac/sta/hp gear around 46th after getting my first taste of 300's hitters in PoN (any doubt about +ac/sta/hp was erased by that mighty convincing experience).  I've aspired to never get below 200 wisdom and I'm near the 2k hp unbuffed mark (which I've seen recommended here by many vets).<br />
<br />
With my style I don't take many hits unless things are generally rough - but it's nice to have the comfort level of extra hps to live to contribute to getting those rough situations under control.<br />
<br />
I'm only 55th so I can only speculate on 60+ gear.  I expect that less pieces of 60+ gear will come from the bazaar and those that do will be brutally expensive.  I expect most 60+ gear to be high level drops via conquest and/or raiding (for those that raid).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Wis (and Sta for that matter) at lower levels isn't that great though, because the return on mana/hp per point of Wis/Sta isn't very high early on. <br />
<br />
Items that grant pure HP or Mana are much much better for the early levels in most cases.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Raw hp/mana gear are god at lower levels. Somewhere around level 30 you'll start to see a decent mana return for wis gear, but up to that point WIS gear is pretty much a waste IMO.  Coincidentally, around the same time you'll start actually having useful slows and thus drawing aggro from time to time so HP start becoming more important as well.  :o<br />
<br />
The only time I could see going for wis/mana gear is if you were predominantly a root/rotting soloist.  If you take hits, be it from tanking while you solo or drawing aggro from slowing in groups... HP will be more useful.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pretty sure this has to do with your level vs the level of the spell you are trying to cast rather than your wisdom attribute.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">You can never have enough hps. That's my primary criteria for selecting gear. Mana, wisdom, ac, they all will follow naturally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Baz4</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">As usual, I agree with Sciek.<br />
<br />
Key point - 1 point of WIS = 1*(level/10) points of mana.  So - at level 20, one point of WIS equals only 2 points of mana.  <br />
<br />
HP and AC are not variable by level, so are more valuable at lower levels.<br />
<br />
In th elong run?  WIS will show up anyway - my base level WIS is only 70, and I have not sought WIS gear since I got Canni 3.  After hitting 60 my WIs just kinda floated on up from the 160 I was comfortable with to 220 (without bearform, clarity, etc.) as I found upgrades based on hp/ac/mana.</div></div><hr />

<br />
According to the help windows displayed on the new character creation screen, Wis affects the fizzle rate on wis casters, int on int casters and cha on bards.  If WIS didnt affect fizzles, I dont know why SoE would have gone through the trouble to say so...try making a new char, and reading the menus presented as you click on the diffent stats for a shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I look for +HPS, +AC, +mana, +sta, +wis, focus effect, and +resists, in no particular order.  If a piece has all of those, great!  I don't go &quot;the hps route&quot; or &quot;the wis route&quot;; I look for well-roundedness.<br />
<br />
The key is to increase your defense (sta/hp/ac), increase your mana pool (mana/wis), and improve your efficiency (focus), and resist those nukes.<br />
<br />
<br />
That about covers it for gear, for pretty much all levels.<br />
<br />
Then work on levels, AA, and a complete spell book.  And learn tactics and how to play a shaman and be successful in many different scenarios.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">This is slightly off topic but I'm going along with the thread-jack.  I still fizzle all the time and my wis is close to maxed for my aa level (290 max atm).  <br />
<br />
Honestly as a wis caster your wisdom won't effect the fact that you were BORN to fizzle, and I wouldn't put alot of stock into maxing wis just to decrease fizzles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I look for a couple of the major focus effects first (burning affliction, because i like it,  affliction haste,  spell haste.  I solo primarily because i'm not that high level yet, compared to the rest of you)<br />
<br />
And after that, I balance my stats out between them.  I recent saved up enough for an iksar ceremonial chestplate (at level 24, too.  And you can't believe how big of a pain that was !  But it was worth it.  Big AC boost from my bloodstained tunic,  plus once a mob is slowed, it can only barely get ahead of my regen.  Undoubtably will change, but it's nice for now.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Hit points are great, and easily converted into mana (if slowly for me).  <br />
<br />
Basically, it's:   Prime focus effects (some things i just can't seem to think about life without.  These usually have acceptably good stats.  I have been trying to pick them carefully enough that I get more use then just the effect),   hit points,  wisdom,  AC,  Stamina... then whatever.  +mana probably, but I haven't shopped for so much that I can say I have a definent path.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Vortecks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">You want to be able to both cast alot of spells (mana pool) and be able to take a beating.  My goals that i set 2 months ago for myself were 3Khps unbuffd and Max wis 355!!  At the time these seemed like unreachable goals but slowly i'm getting there. <br />
<br />
 In 2 months time my Unbuffed Hps went from 2150 to 2700(ND3 helpd alot).  My wis has gone from 275 unbuffed up to 316.  Some of of this was from minor upgrades but the majority of my stat increases have came from LDON!!!  LDON can be the answer to capping your stats for the ppl that are not EP flaged, like myself.  There are some very inexpensive stat augs out there not to forget the +6 STA and WIS that can drop during adventures.  Yes it will take time and some luck(rolling for augs) but it can be done.  <br />
<br />
This is my BP .. no its not a drop from some uber mob in the EP it what i made from my LDoN adventures<br />

I say go for the well rounded aproach when looking for item upgrades.  Look for items with WIS, STA, HPS and MANA!  <br />
