<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>woon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all, heres the deal. I have lvld up a shaman before to lvl 58 and a necro to 51, both pre pop. now my newest char woon is ready to hit pop<br />
at lvl 47. Actually I thought I was a little low but I went to poj (2nd time xping in pop) last nite and had no problem at all with the trash mobs. Now my question is this, What would you pop vets have to say to a pop newb? What are the things you wish you had/had'nt done when you first went to the planes? Im pretty well versed on pre 60 shaman solo and group tactics and have good gear for my lvl and I will be updating it to get more hp. I do solo alot but im betting at my lvl thats a no no. I usually dont have a hard time finding a group and usually have higher lvl friends and guildees ask me to join them. So what advice, stories, or anything relevant to starting out in pop can my fellow shaman add? Thanks for listening</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm far from experienced but I can help you with a few tips from what I've learned so far.<br />
<br />
-PoJ was a decent grind spot for grouping, but the 0 loot wasnt an option for me with spell costs coming up. Only grouped there once.<br />
<br />
-PoD/PoI/PoN where you will probably be hitting alot to grind and solo in PoP from level 53ish to level 56ish.<br />
<br />
-PoI/PoS try to get in here from level 56 plus. great exp compared to tier 1. Places that stick out as gems is the dillos in PoS and a good golems group in PoV.<br />
<br />
all for now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">here is my tips : <br />
<br />
- tier 2+ mob is lvl60+ and high resist for low level, <br />
- many won't see invis, mob won't follow you when you run too far(about 3x spell range), but they still agro you when you come close again<br />
- warrior suck, especial the one with windblade;  cast your slow carefully when warrior taunt<br />
- exp from PoD/PoI/PoN is close to dungeon from old expansion, but it is difference story when you hit PoV/BoT/CoD/Tactic and higher tier</div></div><hr />
