<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dikmer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My wife plays a 63 Gnome Shadow Knight. In a group, she uses a Heavy Windrider's Lance, but when we duo, she often pulls out her epic. The proc on a SK epic, if you're not sure, is Soul Consumption, a life tap over time for 60 HPs over 4 ticks. <br />
<br />
Yesterday we were screwing around in the Iksar Jail in Sebilis, farming cash gems and basically having fun. She got a stack of DoTs on her by one of the necros, so I popped my Radiant Cure. <br />
<br />
Kensha: Dear, I think your cure took away my Soul Consumption. <br />
Me: Soul Consumption? You mean your epic proc?? <br />
Kensha: Yeah, it just proced and now it's gone. <br />
<br />
So we waited until the timer reset and tried it again, and sure enough, Radiant Cure took away her epic proc. We tried it several times to confirm it. Soul Consumption has some poison, disease or curse counters on it, and Radiant Cure will remove it. <br />
<br />
Is this something that we just never noticed before, or is this a legitimate bug?</div></div><hr />

<br />
i casted malos on myself yesterday...and tried to cure it with RC2, and it took 3 times...wth is up with that?  thought it was suppose to remove 3 detrimentals or whatever</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hibbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I can't confirm this myself, but I've heard there is currently a bug with lifetap over time proc's.  Instead of giving life, they take it away.  Innoruuk's Curse and Greenmist were both mentioned as being weapons this affected.<br />
<br />
If the proc is basically a DOT now, maybe radiant cure cures it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">RC only cures things that have disease or poison counter code associated with them.  It's entirely possible that they screwed up and placed disease counters on the target AND the sender for the spell.  Even though the spell's not damaging you, removing the counters would &quot;cure&quot; the spell.  I'd be interested if it continued to damage the target.  You can easily check this by /dueling, uding the spell and then RCing and see if the target is still getting damage (ungroup before you duel, of course).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">wrong<br />
<br />
Radient Cure has a chance ( a better chance the higher you train the ability to cure poison, disease, curse and magic )( malo/cripple included )<br />
<br />
its a &quot;must have&quot; aa</div></div><hr />

<br />
4: Remove Detrimental (n)<br />
<br />
Where n=1 for RC1, 3 for RC2, 6 for RC3.  The Remove Detrimental component has a chance to remove any negative effect, whether or not it has counters.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Red buff icon = detrimental<br />
Blue buff icon = beneficial<br />
<br />
The Soul Consumption buff on the caster might be considered detrimental, if so then RC would remove it. Is the SK's buff icon red? Sounds like a bug anyway.<br />
<br />
Soul Consumption (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=1930&amp;source=Live) doesn't show any counters, so the Remove Detrimental part of RC would probably be what's getting rid of it.</div></div><hr />

OK I guess dumb newb question...is radiant cure the only way to remove malxxx line of spells (besides the random dispel magic line)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">is radiant cure the only way to remove malxxx line of spells (besides the random dispel magic line)?<br />
<br />
As far as I know, yes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yup. Makes them Jord Far really irritating to fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kaneex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">so basically...when i tried to cure my malos with RC2..it has 3 attempts each cast (remove detrimental 3), and it still took 3 casts to cure it..that sucks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Wargbearjumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Another thing to keep is mind.. is that Radiant Cure might be acting normally and the SK Epic is the problem.... I just read another thread on my home server board about how Weapons that Proc a DOT/Lifetap effect  (SK Epic, Greenmist were the two main examples cited), are currently not working correctly and the Effect is actually doing Damage to the Target, AND the Weilder of the weapon.   So, this could be that Soul Consumption is itself broken and Radiant Cure is acting properly and clearing a &quot;Detrimental Effect&quot;.<br />
<br />
Warg</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">One thing that really irritates me, is how we get notified with RC.  If I have a DoT on me and RC cures it, it tells me that I'm cured.  If one of my group members is DoT'd and I RC, I see that I cured someone in the group.  If everyone is DoT'd, then RC isn't concerned with group members at all, it only tells me if it got MY DoT and nothing about theirs....  Instead of writing fancy code, they should've just told me everyone who got cured (or 'your target is cured,' for each person cured).</div></div><hr />

<br />
From glancing at my wife's screen, I believe Soul Consumption is a blue icon with a red border.<br />
<br />

<br />
Well, it's healing again now, so it's no longer a DoT to the weilder. But apparently it's still considered a detrimental effect and thus needs to be addressed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The border is where it shows detrimental/beneficial.<br />
<br />
Red Border = Detrimental = RC can get rid of it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seems the effect on many SK procs is bugged. Instead of damaging the mob and giving you a heal over time dot.. it is damaging the mob and giving the sk a damage over time effect on themselves instead of the heal. So RC is &quot;curing&quot; the damage over time effect that should be a heal over time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Walknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Has anyone else had their RC cure a few members while not curing you?<br />
<br />
I have and it sucks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">RC only cures things that have disease or poison counter code associated with them.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bzzzztttt...<br />
<br />
RC Removes spells with the appropriate number of counters and also has a chance of removing detrimental spells that do not have counters.<br />
<br />
I've used RC to remove several counterless spells from myself and group, it's just not as reliable on counterless spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I've definately noticed a change in RC's reliability against detrimental effects (IE malos), RC2 used to be almost 90% reliable, it rarely failed, now its a 50/50 shot usually =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">If everyone is DoT'd, then RC isn't concerned with group members at all, it only tells me if it got MY DoT and nothing about theirs....

<br />
It does do that for disease/poison/curses, but not for detrimental.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I think I may have actually had it cure a mob before.  The first and last time I went into CoD I used RC about 10 seconds after I had epiced a mob and I got the message &quot;Your curse of the spirits has worn off.&quot;  Since I obviously don't have a lot of experience in CoD it could have just dispelled itself but the timing was odd for sure.</div></div><hr />
