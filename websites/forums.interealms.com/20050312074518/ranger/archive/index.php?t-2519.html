A lot of interesting stuff, but the two or three times he mentions fletching its either to say he doesn't really see it as a major issue and to comment on how it (along with Jewelry) is a perfect model for how they want to have skill progression set up.<br />
<br />
Apparently Yakatizma has not actually attempted raise fletching past 200 recently.  Acryllia arrows solving the problem my arse... :\</div></div><hr />

Also I think they are unrealistic when it comes to fletching gaps. The gap between 202 and 250 is hudge.</div></div><hr />

ever wonder why you can't melt a large 14 wt brick down into smaller pieces?  How does a goblin in runneye or Sol A manage to put the 14 wt brick in his little speedo?  thats probably why you can see plumbers crack :D</div></div><hr />

Vi, to fix fletching, please think about adding things like the following.<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Bow Staffs:<br />
<br />
Steel Staff : base stats : 39dmg 69delay 150Range<br />

<br />
But to be honest how many players could you see buying them? - especially when you cover the cost of the failures - very very few.<br />
<br />
Now if they were to bring out the ability to craft bows of the DN standard that would be really interesting but as always Archery problems impact on fletchers - again with all the bugs in archery could you see many players buying DN standard crafted bows even if they were introduced?<br />
<br />
Doubtful in my opinion<br />
<br />
but it would be nice to be able to craft DN bows for friends etc<br />
<br />
Getting Fletching above 200 cost me a small fortune and has had an impact on my equipment ever since <br />

<br />
Fletching runs off Dexterity, Jewelry runs off Dexterity, Tailoring will run off Dexterity soon.  Basically that means whichever is highest of Intelligence, Wisdom or Dexterity will be the stat checked for chances to raise skill.<br />
I'm just really happy that we finally got a straight answer on this one so I can stop asking for wis buffs when fletching and just get Boon of the Garou and go for it!<br />
<br />
We did add the Acrylia arrows, and I know the Acrylia drops need to be significantly increased.<br />

<br />
But agreed, to make Fletching &quot;work great&quot; as Yak seems to think, making them good alternatives or better than DN bows is a must. I'm talking at least 30 damage with a 35-40 delay (vary as you wish) with stats. Barring new types of cam/plane options, this means the base staff must be 36-39/62-67. My pick would be a 38/66, for an end result of 32/39 if you use the 'best' of everything. Due to the way Trueshot damage scaling works, they may have to make it a single recipe to avoid the construction of a 38/66 bow which might be imbalancing with Trueshot, or maybe not as I would take a 32/39 for 24/7 better AM3 damage. Hell, if you're worried about deflating the value of DN bows, just make it so we can restring them (assume a linen string base), and add stats to them somehow via fletching.<br />
<br />
Frankly, I'd like to see Rain Caller used in another quest to create a +dex/hp/sta bow that will perform slightly better than Double Recurve Velium under the Trueshot Disc. Maybe substitute the stats for a good chunk of archery skill mod. Make it tough via using common drops off of deep (but not rare) mobs in unused places. Dragon Nec, Grieg's, the Hole, go back to Kedge even... But this would be a perfect way to close the DN vs Primal/Doom gap with the significant improvement in archery available through aaxp. Cause as of now, it's a very tough case of haves vs. have nots based on your guild and sleeper status, which doesn't fit well with a skill that's attainable with enough work by anybody.<br />
<br />
(PS, don't tell me that Primal's supposed to be a huge difference from other stuff.. I know that. But Trueshot and AM3 exacerbate the issue because the damage and ratio on primal is much better than anything else. Other primal weapons hold their own due to the proc alone, you can get better, and most do and swap for procs.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Based on the staves I listed above, <br />
<br />
Silk  Shaped Compound Steal Bow would work out to:<br />
33dmg 42 delay :: Compairable to DN without threatening the 5 top bows.<br />
<br />
Silk  Shaped Compound Ceramic Bow would work out to:<br />
12dmg 24delay : Again no threat, but a fast shooting/skill up option</div></div><hr />

&quot;Feedback/Suggestions on Trade skills and Archery:<br />
<br />
This feedback is written from my viewpoint as a Grandmaster Fletcher (205), Ranger and Grand Master Archer.  My beloved in the game is a Mistress at all trade skills and so it may reflect some of her views as well.  She was the one who made me my fleeting quiver (the weight reduction listing is worthless btw arrows weigh not a lot and it would be better showing the delay reduction), and I'd love it to be 8 or 10 slot not 6 slot the same as a tailored.  A 10 slot tailored backpack is more attractive as it can carry loot after you use your arrows and arrow components before!<br />
<br />
I must thank you for the new receipes for Fletching (post 202) and Tailoring (under 250), much appreciated.  However after the drop rate patch to decrease gem and increase rune drops in Tenebrious Mountains on Grimlings, Acrylia is very rare.  Ok, I understand that people were making silly money, but for tailors velium inclusive armour is more difficult and yet velium drops in more than one zone and more frequently than acrylia.  I understand acrylia doesn't even drop in the Acrylia Caverns but only in the Tenebrious Mountains.<br />
<br />
This leads to two things; first farming by tailors or chars who are wanting to sell to tailors for large amounts; second arguments between tailors and fletchers and tinkerers about the camps.  I personally got a very sharp message from one char to get out of the camp because Tailoring is more important than Fletching.  This was ignored but concerned me.  In my experience if you are lucky to get one of the two camps, you stay for 6 plus hours because of the drop rate.  Camping to get acrylia is very boring.  Most people in the zone are 45 plus and usually one person holds each camp.  Yes I know I don't have to do it but I'm not in an uber guild, I'm 5 plus hours ahead of most players on the server and I roleplay my 53 pathfinder to have fun.  He wants to be the best at his chosen craft; he only took up smithing to make stuff for fletching.  Tailors can make serious money from acrylia made items, fletchers can't.  In fact SoL introduced the Endless Quiver AA skill for rangers,!<br />
 which means the market for high end arrows decreases every minute.  So my skill in fletching is solely for my own self satisfaction.<br />
<br />
The best bow now Compound Shadewood 21 dam 39 del 200 rge is great, but no one 45th level plus will buy it because Velious bows are better, the worst Dragon Necropolis Velium bow is 30 dam 40 del I believe.  Most bow users are Rangers; in fact our 55th discipline revolves around it and our Luclin spells and AA skills too.  Yet I heard conflicting feedback from the last Fan Faire, someone said archery is not an important form of combat for rangers or anyone and that a possible epic mark 2 for rangers would be a bow?  We have countless concerns with archery: line of sight, vertical targeting, mobs in walls, no minimum damage, no large delay bonus, arrows disappearing etc and no one is willing to treat this as important as its not seen as a primary form of combat.  And please can Rangers have a 252 Archery cap.<br />
<br />
To decrease my frustration and increase my enjoyment of the game and enjoy roleplaying my Pathfinder Elf I have some ideas on helping listed below.  I don't think these are major changes and don't just impact one Trade skill.  The Coldain Shawl quest is a great example of how I believe you want to improve the usage of Trade skills.  Here's another from the viewpoint of a Fletcher/Archer.<br />
<br />
Recipes :<br />
<br />
Chisel (Smithing), Ore Splitting (Smithing)<br />
Large bricks and blocks of acrylia are good for no recipes I understand and are sold to vendors.  Could there be a Smithed item called a Chisel, which splits a Large Block into 2 or 3 large bricks? A large brick into 2 small bricks? A small brick into 2 small pieces?  You can combine to create blocks so why not the reverse?  This could also work for Velium.<br />
<br />
Ceramic (Pottery), Velium (Smithing) Arrow shafts<br />
As Smiths can already make acrylia and steel arrow shafts could there be a recipe for velium arrow shafts? Also one for potters to make ceramic shafts?<br />
<br />
Acrylia, Velium (Smithing) and Ceramic (Pottery) arrowheads<br />
Steel arrowheads make 10 magic arrows why not these 3 materials?  Therefore arrowhead receipes are needed.  The ceramic ones could involve longer range? Could the velium be enchantable to enable a velium shard proc?<br />
<br />
Steel, Acrylia, and Velium (Smithing) bow staves plus Ceramic bow staves (Pottery)<br />
In the Bowyer book bought at Merchants it has always mentioned Ceramic and Steel Bow Staves as being more powerful than Darkwood.  These were never introduced.  Why not add the recipes for staves for the four materials above?  The Velium one could even be enchantable first?    This would also encourage other trade skill use by Fletchers who can't afford the 244pp or 390pp for Darkwood or Shadewood bow staves? BTW you need to update that book to include Shadewood for the book version bought on Luclin?<br />
<br />
Steel, Acrylia, Velium and Ceramic bows (Fletching)<br />
The logical step from the receipes above for the staves.  For example one material results in lower damage lower delay?  Another longer range less damage more delay? Another larger damage more delay (the normal) and enchanted velium could even make a bow with a plus to dex or archery skill?  All other combinable items then can be added, cams, strings, planes. So a person could go for super fast low delay high range or max damage long delay longer range etc.  Some of these weapons may need minimum strength to use?   Or minimum required level or archery skill?  The enchanted velium could mean velium proc on arrow hit? (up to 12 dam?).  The new recipes for the Shadewood bows give you different ranges depending on the number of cams used, this feature could also be introduced on these stave bow recipes.<br />
<br />
Bow Cams<br />
Bow cams either bought or made by a tinker decrease a bows delay and also its damage.  In real life it decreases delay and increases damage and accuracy because it's more consistent and less strain on the archer, however a compound bow has less range than a longbow? So make a cam included bow recipe; decrease delay as is, reverse the damage to plus 1 not minus 1, knock 25ft off the range and add plus 5 percent to accuracy per cam for materials? This would vary the resultant bows created for staves of lower quality than Shadewood.  Again in line with what has been happening with Luclin items.  This does not make uber bows.<br />
<br />
These receipes make what ore drops for Acrylia and Velium more flexible in its use.  It gives 3 trade skills more receipes.  I know I would start pottery if these items were in the game.  Fletching provides a bow user more choice and they need situational bows rather than the one they have.  Certain Luclin no drop weapons are situational why not Trade skill items?<br />
<br />
I hope these suggestions are useful and I'd love some of the them to be introduced.  If you want more information contact me directly or my fellow rangers at The Ranger's Glade website for their views.<br />

Player made items should not be greater than or equal to high level dropped bows. Do a search for Primal Bow vs. War Bow of Rallos Zek to see what happens ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is just it.  They should not be greater than the best dropped bows in the game but with the time, effort, carpal tunnel, PP investment  they should be close.  You still can't make a bow that is better than Raincaller.  Which I attained with a guild group at level 35.  Very easy to do compared to what it takes to get to 200+ Fletching.  <br />
<br />
And while we are on the subject.  The Wood-Elf Fletching Kit better be RANGER usable.  If not Verant is saying a Fairy Wood Elf Song singing guitar strumming Bard can make a better bow than me, a Half-Elf Ranger Grandmaster Fletcher.  That would be total Bull****!<br />

<br />
Acrylia also drops in The Deep. However, the drop rates suck. I did an exp group there recently. We got 2 Small Bricks and a bunch of Small Pieces. While this is good for tailors as they can use either, it sucks for fletchers as we can only use the Small Bricks.<br />
<br />
I've also found that when friends are in The Deep for exp with no fletchers or tailors in the group, they ALWAYS and without fail give the Small Bricks to the tailors due to tailoring being a worthwhile tradeskill while fletching is that goofy thing that only Crydee does.</div></div><hr />

Ultimately, many of the trade skills don't provide you with anything that you can't get simply on your own through raids and such.<br />
<br />
What does Verant really need to do?  I know some people are tired of hearing this, but Verant really needs to look at how Dark Ages of Camelot applied tradeskills. DAOC has some awesome ideas about this - when I was playing DAOC the tradeskill system was the most impressive thing about it to me.  In DAOC, the tradeskills were actually USEFUL....so useful, in fact, that crafted armor and weapons were frequently better than anything you could find even in dungeons until you got to a high level (which in that game was past 40th).<br />
<br />
Some of the things that made the tradeskill system in DAOC great:<br />
<br />
1) While practicing your tradeskills, you would create things, and actually sell them back to the NPC merchants (if you wished) for a small profit. EQ has always been dead set against this and have quickly nerfed anything of the sort.  A rather disappointing stance, I must say.<br />
<br />
2) Things made with tradeskills in DAOC (namely armor and weapons) were enormously popular because of the high quality that could be crafted.  Think about this for a minute....in this day and age, who bothers to buy banded, fine steel plate, or any of the imbued armor?  Who bothers to buy crafted or imbued weaponry?  No one in EQ does.  Why?  Simply because a player can spend less, or even get for free, something better on their own by dungeon delving and slaying monsters.  Verant has made dungeon delving and slaying monsters the only really vialble way to aquire equipment.  Remarkably linear, and limited, thinking on their part, and a rather huge disappointment.<br />
<br />
3) Most of the items in DAOC can be made with materials that can be found on the merchant NPCs in town.  Its still very time consuming, and still challenging, but you normally don't have to travel through the four corners of the world gathering rare components for one item.  In EQ, this is becoming very commonplace.  To make the situation worse, EQ is making players who wish to raise their skills to be able to do it via only one way, and that one way usually involves making a product who's components are either rare, or/and are scattered about Norrath and must be hunted for.<br />
<br />
I sincerely hope that Verant has learned some valuable lessons on their tradeskill system.  In EQ2 I would love to see the tradeskill system a vialable alternative to aquiring items, weapons, armor, etc. by dungeon delving and slaying monsters for equipment.  Its much too late for that now in EQ, but a diverse and useful tradeskill system would be a boon to their future endeavors in EQ2 by making tradeskills an alternative to the linear &quot;hack n' slash&quot; system EQ is based totally on right now.</div></div><hr />

    Now you can take the Large blocks of Acrylia and break them into 2 small pieces and break the small pieces down to a piece of acrylia using a chisel.  I do not know what it trivals at though.  But my friend did it for me last night after I farmed for an hour in TB.  I had 4 large bricks and 5 pieces and broke it down to 13 pieces, had myself a Studded Cloak made and sold it promptly right away knowing these prices will drop.  I only got 2 pieces off of the two laborors I saw one was MT the other 3 pieces were actually off the orefinders.  I also made 200pp in gems and runes so all in all not a bad little trip up there.<br />
<br />
But wanted to let you know pieces of Acrylia are now a little more available.</div></div><hr />

Agreed.  Why do they persist in calling them tradeskills, if you can never make a living doing them?  Given how Odius practicing tradeskills can be, how many people would really build vast fortunes by doing tradeskills instead of adventuring?  And what if they did?  Too bad Verant feels it is so necessary to force their &quot;correct way of doing things&quot; down our throats..... or, given the sensation, maybe up our *** would be a better way to describe it.</div></div><hr />

I would have to STRONGLY disagree.<br />
IMO, player made items should be the best available.  However, they should require drops frrom said high level encounters.<br />
