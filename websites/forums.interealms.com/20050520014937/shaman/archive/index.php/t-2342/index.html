<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Spritabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello!<br />
I've been lurking here for a couple of weeks (man, if I'd only found this place before 49...).<br />
Anyway, having spent some hours going over the accumulated wisdom, I decided it was time to raise my AC in the cheapest way possible: Defense. I've worked hard at it in 49 and got it to 171 from 147. Then I partnered up with a monk and proceded to own basement in KC until almost 55. Then I went solo again, and went to the sweet spot in HK. I tanked my way through a bub and a half of mobs there, but not ONE increase in defense, so now I'm stuck at 171. <br />
Anyway, my question is: How do I raise my defense quickly at 55? I've considered not slowing mobs, but that seems just a tad too dangerous, since I'm in no way an Uber twink. Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>snt_asher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I know that you can get skill check on pets did it just the other day just find a MAGE or a BST and see if you can borrow there pet for a bit. its a bit slow but worked for me when i was im my 30's and had no defence got it to 150 from 30 in like 2 hours</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Traps to raise defense (From Monkly Business)<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
I was a few points shy of 230 at 50th level even despite a lot of solo and main tank duty. This changed a couple days ago in the Tower of Frozen Shadow.<br />
<br />
On the second floor, with the ghostly students scholars and such, there is a nice little trap that did me a favor (2 really). Just to the right of the Librarian is a very small grey platform with some bones around it. If you wander by, a_skeletal_hand will claw at you. It is not targetable and does not move at all.<br />
<br />
I was curious about it at first (thought it was a rare mob) and after a few rounds of it attacking, i realized it was a trap AND 229 defense. Yay. A few rounds later 230. Yippee. It hit for 30 max, and only took a few rounds for the raises. Might be worth a try for some of you folks who have tried everything to raise this skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Spritabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks a lot - I'll try that for sure! Let's me get a bit of revenge too: Spritabe vs. Snow Cougars, part II /cackle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">A couple other things to make sure of:<br />
<br />
Make sure you're buffing your AGI and DEX.<br />
<br />
The tougher the mob you fight, the greater your chance of getting a skill raise.  I was stunned at the difference between light blues, wimpy dark blues, and tough dark blues.  Tougher = better.<br />
<br />
To raise it in a hurry, though, I like the dueling pet idea.  <br />
<br />
Anyone know... can you get weapon skill increases dueling a pet?  Might be a nice way to get my 2HB skill up to a decent level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Also, find low blues and these work ok.  My advice is solo SF's if they are still blue to you in OOT and just Epic/Pet/Dot/Jbb them until you get your defense up.<br />
<br />
<br />
Maxxed mine as early as possible because of the sagely advice on this board.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">And don't forget to buff your AGI.  Your defense will raise significantly faster if you buff your AGI.  The difference was night and day on my warrior twink.<br />
<br />
Chutoi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">AGI?  Melee skills are 'supposed' to go up from Dex according to Verant</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">*nod* but if your going to specifically tank these mobs, the added AC is probably a bonus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Maybe it's VI's random number generator, but I PL'd my warrior twink to 45 in 3 days.  If I had AGI on, his defense would skyrocket.  If I didn't it would barely move.  Seriously, I'd see strings of 5-6 increases right after I hit him with AGI buffs.  I may be making a new &quot;charisma helps slow&quot; rumor, but the empirical evidence from my experience indicates that AGI plays a substantial part.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">AGI? Melee skills are 'supposed' to go up from Dex according to Verant <br />
<br />
Melee:<br />
<br />
Offensive skills: dex<br />
Defensive skills: agi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Spritabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well, that trap thing didnt work at all. Stood there and took about 5k worth of damage before I got sick of it and gated. Glad I spent  3 hours killing greens for that random key :mad: <br />
<br />
Any other suggestions?<br />
<br />
Yes, I had Deleriously Nimble going the whole time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>bakkal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">My recomendation is to keep playing a shaman how you want to, and to quit looking at the defense skill. If you continue to fight blue mobs and slow/tank them it will go up.  Don't make it such a chore.. Play for fun and when you get the defense increase every once in a while, rejoice.<br />
<br />
It always amazes me when people go to green zones/fight pets in the arena/let traps hit them for hours instead of just going out and having fun.<br />
<br />
Sort of like those people who refuse to level until they max every skill.  *sigh*<br />
<br />
Bakkal<br />
<br />
Then again if having fun means find the way to get your defense up immediately. Have at it..  Get on big raids and get yourself pounded on though.. Only makes sense that the higher the mob cons the better chance you have at increases. Always held true in the lower levels, no reason for it not to be that way now.  <br />
<br />
Juggurnauts anyone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Find some blue melee mobs, Slow them and tank them, cast an occasional DoT. That should raise Defense quickly. Not sure what you could fight at 55 though. That would seem to be the best way..........you are at least getting exp while you raise your skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Sorry that the trap didn't work for you :(<br />
<br />
I just maxed my defense just fighting Sentient Suits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Graal the Dorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Offense skill - STR<br />
Weapon skills (all of them) - DEX<br />
Defense skill - AGI<br />
Dodge, parry, riposte - DEX<br />
Rogue skills (other than poison - no clue on that) - DEX<br />
Monk skills - DEX<br />
All other general skills besides tradekills - INT<br />
All tradeskills other than smithing - the highest of INT, WIS, and DEX<br />
Smithing - the highest of INT, WIS, and STR<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
No other class has the tools to raise defense that shamans do. Buff your AGI, put on AC gear. Go find a high blue mob and slow it, cripple it and then tank it. Have chloro/regrowth up and only use your mana for debuffs and heals. Melee the mob to death.<br />
<br />
The higher the mob you are fighting, the better chance you have of a skillup. Crippling the mob will lower its damage against you alot if you are borderline on AC and the mob is a high blue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Spritabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Hehe, thanks for all your suggestions. I think I'll just let the thing go up on its own. I've been camping the nobles for a while now (2 bubs into 55), and needed to do something else. <br />
I actually had a mage friend of mine let me duel his pet (he's 55), and did this for about 30 minutes. Pet was hasted and I just took the beatings - NO defense raise, so if anyone else was thinking of doing this, my advice is don't.<br />
<br />
Funny part is that I somehow got from 171 to 172 without knowing how.. Hmmmm :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Well, off to raise my fishing skill! Thanks again :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jenoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Thats sorta odd, my little druid (lvl56) got 2 skillups in defense when I was being chased across dreadlands by a mage epic pet (that was deep blue at the time)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sepisis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">You're expecting the skill points to come at a reasonable rate.  Don't.  I only got 3 to 5 per level soloing sea furys 50+  Defense seems to be one of the slowest raising melee skills there is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Spritabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Meanwhile, my Offense is at 198! (Woot) :)<br />
<br />
Aye, Defense does seem to raise slowly - I'll get there, I'll get there...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Actually you are a bit off Graal, Offensive skills= dex(as stated), defensive = agi(as stated). That's for all classes. Monks dont go off a dif stat than warriors, neither do shamans or rangers or rogues, etc.<br />
<br />
General skills = int/wis<br />
Tradeskills = int/wis- although smithing can also go off of str, and fletching/tailoring goes off of dex(note dex ONLY applies to these two, no other tradeskills)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Graal the Dorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Actually, I'm not wrong. Not on Offense. Offense is STR. I'm not sure about dodge, parry, and riposte but I am quite sure about Offense.<br />
<br />
EDIT: ahh, I see what it is. You misunderstood what I was saying. By saying monk skills, I meant things like flying kick and whatnot. I don't know jack about monk skills, but I do remember VI specifically saying that monk and rogue &quot;special&quot; skills use DEX. <br />
<br />
The Offense skill itself, not offensive type skills, but the skill with the NAME Offense is reliant on STR.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>BryeLLe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Defense definitely raises slowly. An SK friend of mine that did all the tanking for a regular group didn't get 200 until 46. Spirtabe, the pet method does work, just stick with it. At level 52, I raised mine from 157 to 165 in an hour on a necro pet, 165 to 172 tanking for my rogue friend on ice giants for about 3 hours. No clue how much it's going to take to get to 200 though. I was pretty low to begin with. Ugh, I've got a long way to go. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>humburto</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">well i have been at 200 defense for quite a few levels (since 47). Personally I can't see why anyone would not be able to max their defense unless they played a druid pre 50. I have always gotten hit and hit back. Another option if you're desperate is to save your 5 skill points you get for leveling and buy some defense. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Spritabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Well, I'll giva you some clues as to why my defense isnt maxed out atm:<br />
1) Didnt find this board until the day after I hit 49, and so had to figure out how to play my shaman myself and<br />
2) My 'mentor' is a wizard who thinks shamans should be all wis and nothing else. Naturally, being a complete n00b, I played after the wis-school until I found here. My AC now hovers around 750 and my unbuffed HPs are just sort of 1200 at 55. Yes, I know. Trouble is, the few money I do have are in the bank, waiting to be spent on Spells (I have about 6k and none of my 56 and over drop spells. Also, I am guildless atm. No fungi, no jbb, no epic and no horse. Hope this answers your question.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Ravynn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I found my defense lacking by about 20 points when I hit my low 50s. Burning Woods did the trick for me. Just pull something that doesn't hit too hard, (greater barbed skeletons, moldering gorillas, ember hornets) slow it and tank it while the puppy beats it up from behind.  Keep your AC buffed (The rage line is great when you're doing this.) and your agility up.<br />
<br />
This is not a quick fix but it does work. It took me about 3 weeks of soloing in BW for 2 to 3 hours an evening to max mine. Most nights I'd get one defense increase or two if I was really lucky.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Get your AC over 800 at least (even if just buffed) and take job as main slower for your group when you raid in UP or Kael or somesuch.   Throw out a slow right away, and let the cleric in group heal you while you gain skill.   Also, make sure you have up Delerious AND rage.   Both do AGI, and stack.<br />
   You should be able to get in a couple whacks from a yellow/red or at least dark blue each fight, and raise skill rather quickly without going outside normal hunting much</div></div><hr />
