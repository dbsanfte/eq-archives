 If nobody would buy the spell at 15k, he would drop it to 10k. Then he would drop it to 7k. Then 5k. Then a smart Shaman would buy it...<br />

Tell that to the goober on Maelin who had 3 copies of Q at 10k ... then 4 hours later, same 3 copies at 15k. I swear prices don't go down on Maelin as items don't sell ... they go up!  Pretty ... lame in my opinion =/</div></div><hr />

I started playing EQ less then 5 months ago,and I have a frog Shaman. I dont think that is is because we were made is the reason that the spells are so high priced, I think its because ppl are greedy first off, BUT there are some uber gear that is dropable and ppl want it for their chars, and they know we will pay the high prices because so many ppl want and/or need us in group/guild/raids. And on the server I am on I really dont see alot of Frog Shamans. So I will have to disagree on the reasoning that was stated above<br />

Heck I've seen Spirit Quickening (yea that crappy pet-only buff) for 10k. sheesh. If there's no one selling a shm spell people automatically slap a  50k price on it it seems like, and then adjust from there.<br />
<br />
It's easy to tell the rare shaman spells. Do a bazaar search on them, then sort by price. However!!! Folks in the higher levels know how expensive shm spells are to get, so your friends are more likely to give you a drop than not.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">/nod steelbear. It's all the resellers that fvck up the economy :-\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The reason shaman spells are expensive are that our level 60 spells (Malo, Torpor) were crucial to how effective we were at fighting/raiding at high levels. They didnt drop very commonly and only from high level targets. So people who got them sold them at a high price. We paid that price and very soon we were accustomed to paying high for spells. When PoP came out we were expecting to be paying higher than most for our spells, so we paid higher than most.<br />
<br />
Or maybe not... if it makes sense that's what I think</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Cateye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Q at 15k???<br />
Hell gimme, I buy all 3 copies, not that I have the money but at that price my friends or my guild would pay, that is damn cheap!<br />
FYI: On 7th Q goes for 60-100k...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The sad thing is that some shaman have had to resort to the reselling of duplicate spells at inflated prices (gouging their bretheren) in order to afford the other spells that they have to buy when they can't get them to drop.<br />
<br />
It has become a nasty cycle that I don't see ending unless the supply is increased.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Spell price on Xev are looney tunes.<br />
<br />
6 Months ago I thought about buying Faern either Pox or Bane. COuldn't find one and the other was 500 pp. Today? Checked the BIZARRE and Poxx is 30k.<br />
<br />
Torpor? 20k<br />
Malo? 10k<br />
<br />
Good point about Froglok Shaman and re-sellers. I have had people buy something I was selling for 250 gold then turn around and add 100% + to the price. <br />
<br />
L A M E.<br />
<br />
For that reason alone I feel ZERO remorse for the (re-seller)person who mistakenly drops a 0 from the end of a price.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Discordja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">uhh .. you think frogloks have any impact on the spell market?  <br />
<br />
Lesse, I'll alt tab over right now .. 3 shaman over level 50 on tholuxe .. none of them over level 58.  They sure did fuxor up the spell market I tell ya what.  <br />
<br />
Most frogs are twinks, they don't get past level 40.  The impact frogs have on spell prices is .. ehh .. nothing at all.<br />
<br />
Oh, there are 12 barbarians from 51 to 64 .. and 18 65 alone .. I can tell you what race I think has the largest impact on the spel market.<br />
<br />
And it's not that shaman spells alone are out of whack .. almost everyone's spells are.  Yesterday I saw a copy of sha's revenge (the 65 BL slow for 160k) in the bazaar.  <br />
<br />
child of bertox, funeral pyre both 40k+<br />
wave of marr 20k<br />
cry of thunder 20k<br />
aura of hate 25k<br />
Strike of Solusek 70k<br />
Erjav Lost composition 25k<br />
Vallon quickening 30k<br />
<br />
That is just what I can find in the bazaar right at this moment. <br />
<br />
Someone find out what hand of virtue goes for.  Legacy of the Nine.  Ferocity.<br />
<br />
They are paying out the nose just as much as any shaman .. the difference is the spells we pay big plat for are so class defining we can't not get it and shrug it off ..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Mantronix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I bought level 65 shaman spell Malos the other day for 2300pp in the bazaar. Either the price of Malo went down tremendously or someone forgot to add an additional zero to the price.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">It's mostly supply and demand. Some of it is rarity, but has been said about, prices tend to be set at that which people are prepared to pay.<br />
<br />
Shaman rune spells vary enormously in price, from ~10k to ~40k. There are roughly equal numbers of each coming into the world, so this has got to be because it's the price people pay. A shaman might pay 40k for Quiescence, but wouldn't pay that for Ferine Avatar, so Quie stays high, FA drops.<br />
<br />
One thing I've noticed though, on Xev at least, prices for Malo have dropped considerably (from ~50k to 15k), but Torpor has stayed roughly the same (~40k).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gakal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">All down to supply and demand....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>shamanhappy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I have started to search the bazaar, on a regular basis <br />
for spells and spell componants..<br />
<br />
<br />
I paid 10k for the componants for torpor<br />
5k for the componants for malo,<br />
<br />
then while going thru the bazaar saw <br />
2 strange happenings....<br />
<br />
words of revenant for 500pp (normally goes for 5-10k)<br />
then i saw breath of ulthor for 1kpp (normally goes for 10k)<br />
<br />
so i bought both of them...<br />
<br />
<br />
now i have pox, had to pay 20k for words of agony..<br />
<br />
<br />
so i always search bazaar for shammy spells and componants<br />
to see if someone forgot a 0<br />

The other day I was trying to buy my 55 pet, some guy had it up for 7k saying 'that's what my shaman paid so I want my money back'.. forget that.  I am hoping shaman spell prices will drop across the board with time.. the other day in the bazaar I saw 6 copies of torpor all up at once, only went as low as 24k.  I got REALLY lucky a few nights ago and some price gouger forgot one zero pricing malo and I got it for 2.5k. <br />
<br />
I *did* check other classes' spells, and they're all dirt cheap relatively.  Only a couple Druid spells were in tens thousands, and sunstrike.  My necro bro starts whining about buying spells and I tell him don't even start.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I don't have any experience about other classes high end spells, but how many other classes have as many spells as Shaman do that cost so much?<br />
Torpor at least 40k<br />
Malo at least 40k<br />

Fo7 120k<br />

Just a few for example from Drinal.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">It really isn't just shaman spells, all classes have some expensive spells, we just have a few more of them.<br />
<br />
Heres some info for the two classes I know:<br />
<br />
Shaman<br />
Quin 40-50k<br />
Torpor 20-30k<br />
Malos 25-30k<br />
Malo 20-30k<br />
Ferine Avatar 10k<br />
Blood 15k<br />
Fot7 30-40k<br />
<br />
Cleric<br />
HoV 30-40k<br />
Armor of the Zealot 20k<br />
Mark of the Rightous 20k<br />
The Silent Command 10k<br />
Yaulp6 10k<br />
Divine Intervention 20-40k if its ever on the market, seen it for 100k once before, not like any guild thats really going to make use of it can't get it rather easy<br />
Mark of Kazad 5k<br />
<br />
Any of the pet classes top level pets are usually outrageously priced. <br />
<br />
The big difference for shaman is that Torpor/Malo make a larger difference to our abilities then I'd say any two non bought spells make to any other class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Shaman spells are expensive?  Hrm, that's funny I bought Malo, Torpor, and Avatar for 5k each on tribunal back in Velious and that was the standard price.  Amazing what a little cooperation among shaman can do for prices on a server... :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I have all my 65 spells except Fo7.

I'll cast FoSoul on every single tank - every time, before I pay ~30k for a group HP buff.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Kilaara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">As a tank in first place I am always a bit amused when casters - and there are the same posts on other caster boards - think that their special spells are really expensive.<br />
<br />
When you take your best buyable Spells ( Torpor / Malo .... ) and compare these to the best buyable warriorweapons ( aggrowise ) in game ( Blade of Carnage / Szeptre of Destruction ) you'll see which one are really expensive.<br />
<br />
I know that you do not have only 2 spells and the summary of your spells - when you would all buy them - is also real high, but on my last server these 2 warrior weapons were sold for 300 k (BoC ) and 180 k (SoD).<br />
<br />
I know you will now say ... moment we need these spells really and a warrior can take other stuff or go and kill the mobs for these items, but in real a shaman would not die without torpor or Malo .. he is a bit weaker than like the warrior with some lesser weapons. ..<br />
<br />
And trust me I have a 58 cleric and a 60 necro so I know some prices. Yesterday I bought Funeral Pyre for 15 k .<br />
<br />
Some stuff is a bit more expensive than others, but thats a part in each class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">That's nice kilaara, however warriors that -need- boc are in guild that raid aow and get it anyway. SoD is too rare to mention.<br />
<br />
Warriors are expensive to gear up...but it's gotten a lot better since bazaar started working. It's also pretty much the same with any other class...to get good warrior equipment you need to raid. I think I have 2 droppable items on mine, those being his rings.<br />
<br />
Warriors don't have to cough up 50k at level 60, 30k at 63, 40 at 64, etc..<br />
<br />
Then again my warrior was in no way able to generate plat as well as my shammy...<br />
<br />
15k is a sweet deal on funeral pyre imo...I think in all my luclin raiding(roughly a year's worth before i retired my warrior) I saw 1 copy drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Gildanni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">On BB, it varies alot.  I recently bought Avatar for 2k, and Malo for 12k.  When I bought Malo, Torpor was being sold for 70k.  Now that it's several weeks later, I see Torpor is down to 35k.  Q is anywhere from 35k (yesterday in the bazaar) to 100k (last week in the bazaar).  I've needed some gear upgrades, but am holding off to save up for any spells I may need to buy.  At almost 62, I'm still missing several spells 60 and under.  I see them in the bazaar, and only got lucky with Malo and Avatar.  Just keep looking is my motto.  Every now and then ya get lucky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">OK, what's with the few rants about people buying stuff in the baz and selling it for a higher price? You mean to tell me if you saw malo for like 5k, and you already had it, you wouldn't buy it up right away and resell it? Of course, that's a bad example, as I'd think most would offer it to a friend who didnt have it first, but for a normal run of the mill item that you see at a low price, you bet your ass I'm buying it. Just the other day, someone was selling tae ew blood for 750. Bought all 4 of them, sold it in less than an hour at 1500. <br />
<br />
If you ask me, the problem isn't the reselling, the problem is the drop rate. In my opinion, 20-30k is an acceptable price considering the rarity and the usefullness of the spell.<br />
<br />
Don't hate the playa, hate the game :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Problem is that at first it was complained how rare are Torpor and Malo, by shamans, and how it would make their life so much more better, and how they'd sell their sisters/brothers and dogs and cats and goldfish for them. Then someone's lil' brain got the idea and when that person got the spell, it was put up on sale for a crazy price. Shamans screamed and moaned, and then some shmuck shaman went and bought that spell for that money. Some other shamans did so too and soon it was clear to those 'elements' that shamans may talk and moan, but they still will smack out the buck to buy the spell, no matter the price.<br />
<br />
We brought this on our head by ourselves. Whatever, I rather hunt for a long time for these spells then pay to some moron some crazy cash. Got Torpor when hunting, soon will get Malo, unless I get lvl 65 versions of one/both. I managed so far without these spells fine and will manage further. I will get them for free, and those money hogging morons can choke on them.<br />
<br />
And Canni 2 I quested. It isn't that long and hard quest at all, get a tracker/porter and do some travelling. I did it with my druid friend, and for some other pieces I gathered some friends/guild members. Fun was had by all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Wulfson Soulforger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Prices on the 7th are dicked up.  There is some shaman ass or bazbot, name starts with a K, that was selling Pox for 60k.  I sent him a tell saying, dont you think thats a bit overpriced?  He went on a tirade about how rare it was, how he never saw it for sale and on and on and on.  I politely told him he was an ass and I would tell all my friends to never buy any gear from said MULE.  Now, I didnt get my copy of Pox til lvl 63 because to me, 15k was too much and I am about the most unlucky sumbich imaginable when it comes to rolling.<br />
<br />
I personally sell shaman spells I get extra for 1/3 of whatever the going rate in bazaar is or whatever it was when I was a strapping youth dreaming of being able to cast the damn things.  Most times though, I just give them to shaman friends who I know will never have the plat or the grp to get them what they need.<br />
<br />
And for the warrior who says our &quot;spells&quot; arent near as expensive as his gear, You sir are correct for about 30secs.  Then you add in our gear and our spells, and well, our PPS (plat per second hehehe) GOES through the roof.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The money that is put into spells each level is lost forever.  Once a spell is scribed its gone.  <br />
<br />
Weapons can be resold.  Gear can be resold.  You mention SoD/BoC.  These items are some of the very special items that never devalue.  If anything they increase in value as time goes on.  If you buy it today for 200K I would bet that you could resell it tomorrow for 200K.  Even if you only sell it for 150K you are still recieving SOME kind of return on your investment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">It's a joke to compare availability of 2 specific warrior weapons to class spell costs.<br />
<br />
There's a million weapons that drop or can be bought which will serve the same purpose.  <br />
<br />
Gearing an effective warrior is so easy and cheap these days.  Just picture getting your gear and then shelling out for spells.  Then picture that you have 2 spells that you, and everyone else on the server, knows are huge class-defining spells.  <br />
<br />
Warriors can function and be awesome without a SoD or BoC.  Shaman need malo/torpor - and their gear - to function fully.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Haha shaman spells too expensive, I had to pay like 40k for torpor, and quite a bit on my lvl 60-65 spells intially, I think I have spent in the region of 150k on spells. But in this process I have learnt to farm money and camp mobs myself or with others. I think I have made 500k in total maybe more. A guild can help you get a load of spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>UnionTK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">As a tank in first place I am always a bit amused when casters - and there are the same posts on other caster boards - think that their special spells are really expensive.<br />
<br />
When you take your best buyable Spells ( Torpor / Malo .... ) and compare these to the best buyable warriorweapons ( aggrowise ) in game ( Blade of Carnage / Szeptre of Destruction ) you'll see which one are really expensive....And trust me I have a 58 cleric and a 60 necro so I know some prices. Yesterday I bought Funeral Pyre for 15 k .<br />
<br />
Some stuff is a bit more expensive than others, but thats a part in each class.<br />
<br />
Comparing gear to spells is stupid, I need items in those same two slots you have, I just want hps/wisdom/mana/focus effects/etc on them instead of dmg/delay.<br />
<br />
All characters have the same number of inventory slots to fill with the best possible items we can... AND casters have to get their spells.<br />
<br />
Back to that topic, guess I'm just lucky, I haven't had to buy any of my spells and the only ones I'm missing are Primal Avatar (/rude noone wanting to go anymore) and the componentless EB...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>uglytobone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I say mostly supply/demand. When there are 3-5 Torpors available for sale daily, 15k is lowest price. When there is 1 for sell once a month-- 60k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">It helps to be looking for your spells early too, as prices and supply/demand are always fluctuating.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Perelandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Of all the classes I have messed with (basically most casters), shaman get the shaft on spell prices - especially pre-PoP.</div></div><hr />

more Torpor and Malo spells would be available, and the prices would<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>woonie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Earlier in the thread someone posted a list comparing cleric spell costs to those of a shaman.<br />
<br />
There were some more spells that you didn't list...<br />
<br />
You listed...<br />
<br />
Shaman<br />
Quin 40-50k<br />
Torpor 20-30k<br />
Malos 25-30k<br />
Malo 20-30k<br />
Ferine Avatar 10k<br />
Blood 15k<br />
Fot7 30-40k<br />
<br />
Cleric<br />
HoV 30-40k<br />
Armor of the Zealot 20k<br />
Mark of the Rightous 20k<br />
The Silent Command 10k<br />
Yaulp6 10k<br />
Divine Intervention 20-40k if its ever on the market, seen it for 100k once before, not like any guild thats really going to make use of it can't get it rather easy<br />
Mark of Kazad 5k<br />
<br />
But you forgot some...<br />
<br />
Primal Essence - I have only seen this spell for sale once and that was for 60k<br />
Pox of Bertoxxulus - 70k on my server - Zeb (page 73 a component sells for 45k)<br />
Khura's Focusing - 14k on average on Zeb<br />
<br />
The above doesn't even mention the other spells that all sell for less than 10 and more than 5k.<br />
<br />
It is a shame that people can get their level 61-64 spells much easier than their 59-60 spells. Sony never changed the drop rates and they have made the components nearly as impossible to get.  IMO, I think of it as a bug...the game is bugged because the spell drop rates were never corrected when they added the higher levels.<br />
<br />
All classes have spells that cost alot of pp...but what other class has as many spells that consistently sell for 10k or higher?  I have priced out the spells for other classes hopefully trying to find company for my misery, and I couldn't do it.  I saw some other classes that had spells here and there that were expensive but not on the same level with shamans.<br />
<br />
It digusts me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Lorddaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">is it just me, or should the new revamp kunark zones that have level 60 and 61 mobs in them start dropping the level 58-60 spells?<br />
<br />
i already know that once my Shaman and SK duo are 61, i'm going to be living in skyfire untill i get both of thier spells. from the GW's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Sony never changed the drop rates and they have made the components nearly as impossible to get. <br />
<br />
Then you are grinding in the wrong places.  Take a group to Cazic-Thule, you will see very good component drops.  I also saw good component drop rate in Veksar and Chardok / Chardok B.<br />
<br />
I got Pox, RGC, PE, Group Acumen, Levitation and Everlasting Breath ALL from research.  It works.<br />
<br />
Components do not tend to drop in the PoP zones, so if you exclusively grind there you will not see them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lemme know when you have to pay anywhere from 100-300k on a held item to perform your primary job. Comparing gear to spells may not be perfectly valid, but I think you can make a very strong case that comparing weapons for melee classes to spells for casters is quite applicable.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>kEMAN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">All wis caster spells are out of this world pricing wise.  One of my alts is a mage and you see post all the time about which spells they can research to make the most money.  Torpor/Malo are always on the as big money makers.  Also I paid 10K each for 2 level 63 spells for my druid but i bought 1 level 63 and 1 level 64 spell for my mage for a grand total of 4K.  Now for my druid they were my last dot and highest charm, i got a deal on them.  The mage was his 1400 DD spell black steel and the girdle spell, both those are sweet ass spells.  I have already bitch that nerfing zone that are good for farm pure cash like PoG is making it harder to make pure plat to buy spell that are so overpriced it isnt funny.  Someone at sony have their heads so far up their asses they have no clue about the Real EQ.  Hell it isnt hard when u are a developer with a best gear and full Spellbook.<br />

<br />
Casters have to wear equipment too...  and you can't resell scribed spells.<br />
<br />
I've brought up 4 characters to levels 55+ (ranger, monk, wizard, and shaman) and overall the shaman has cost wayyyyyy more to maintain than any of the other three....  when you add up equipment upgrades and then having to pay ridiculous amounts of cash for spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">I remember one day, searching for spells, and saw pox for 890pp.  Bought it up, and memmed it quick as I could, before I could sell it.<br />

Some of the spell prices really boggle me.  What more, the fact that people actually pay the prices makes it worse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">I bet shaman spells would get a lot cheaper if shaman weren't so necessary for raids and people stopped playing them because of their utility.<br />

Yep, I bet a good solid shaman nerf would drop the price for malo through the floor.  Be careful what you complain about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>kellz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">I agree with whomever posted back a few...  part of the problem definitely is people with lots of disposable cash price fixing.<br />
<br />
There's a guy on Tallon Zek that keeps buying any copy of Pox that comes up lower than his 25k he's got it at.  I think this morning he had a total of 4 copies up.<br />
<br />
/obvious whine on <br />
<br />
I suppose it would be less annoying if he'd just put up one at a time at that price.....  but having the 4 copies, I can hear in the back of my head &quot;HA HA&quot;.<br />
<br />
/whine off<br />
<br />
<br />
I've just made a mental note of what spells I feel I REALLY need....  and others are just going to be gravy if I happen to stumble across them.<br />
<br />
but then again...maybe I'm just crazy  :)</div></div><hr />

There is a small group of people on Cazic-Thule that do this on all classes rare spells.  I haven't compared our spell prices to other servers, but if they are running their cartel correctly, they should be pretty high.  <br />
<br />
Of course, this effects everyone on the server, not just shaman.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Twiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Well im on Quellious and i don't understand why you all are willing to pay so much for spells when you have 5 other options.<br />

1) Join a decent guild. Any decent guild after raiding asks who needs 65 spells still and turn in the ruins to try to get you your spells.<br />

Heh you guys are at 65 what are you doing without a decent guild that's willing to help you out. Ok mabey your in some type of family luv guild who cant do anything besides ask you to help them and thats fine but in return why dont they chip in to help you get your spells..ever hear of guild banks? Ya unless you got a guild banker who just twinks his own chars you should have plenty to get your spells with. All those little items add up alot of guilds have there guild traders ect ect all things you can do to get the money you need at no expense to you.</div></div><hr />

You can look at it that way but ask yourself this. What are you going to do with that SoD/BoC or what ever weapon you bought for several hundered plat after you upgrade it? oh I know you will sell it to someone else and make back a lot of the money you invested in it. What is a caster going to do when they upgrade a spell and has the older one in the book that is usless now? I know not make anything back on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">I bought level 65 shaman spell Malos the other day for 2300pp in the bazaar. Either the price of Malo went down tremendously or someone forgot to add an additional zero to the price.<br />

LOL they forgot a zero i bet :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">I'm in a fairly decent guild, we would get on average 2-3 runes a week (Raid).<br />
<br />
I waited and waited standing by as the Officers handed in rune after rune after rune and spec after spec after spec to the Otter trying to get BoS and BoU, 6-7 months later...I have everything except those two. They were the onlty two I ever wanted (was given the rest of my PoP spells)<br />
<br />
Plus I was unlucky, I only ever won one Rune (non raid) I handed it in and got Ferine avatar, a duplicate....sigh. Every spec I handed in netted me a duplicate aswell, these I hand out to the guild first and friends second.<br />
<br />
So I decided to do something I told myself I never would, I got sick of looking at the inflated prices on Brell average 18k for BoS and BoU.<br />
<br />
I put FA up for sale in the Bazaar, I priced it as high as the market would allow, it sold, I bought the two spells I had been hangiing out for for 6-7 months and had enough left over to restock my food bag.<br />
<br />
Now I have all my spells, (except Ancient and componentless Enduring Breath) the guy that bought FA memmed it, I memmed my spells, we are both happy.<br />
<br />
I wont do it again, but was I wrong?<br />
<br />
Should I have farmed something, sitting hour after hour killing PH's hoping for a rare drop?<br />
<br />
All the other shaman in my guild had FA</div></div><hr />
