<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kinelory Opiates</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As we all know, mounts take their share of food from our inventory when we are riding them. I was curious do they eat food at a certain rate or at the same ride the rider does? I just finished of innate meta 3 the other day, but i'm still not noticing much of a differance. (I'm constantly on my mount). Is my mount effected by innate meta3 or is it continuing to eat at its own rate?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">mounts won't eat food , it just make your food last shorter(this is easier to implement than make mounts eat food), I think it make your food duration half when ride a horse/lizard<br />
<br />
innate meta3 will increase food's duration(by x2 ?), since food is so cheap those day so this skill just help you save 10-50pp/months from Halas pie/Grobb drink</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kinelory Opiates</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">oops! i was under the impression they did w/ the message 'you and your mount are hungry'. <br />
Thank you very much. you've answered my question =)</div></div><hr />
