<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>xacnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I will be running a Vox raid on Saturday, July 28th, at Noon, EST, providing that she is still up.<br />
<br />
All keepers and friends are welcome.  I'm sure you all know the level restrictions, but just in case, I'll post them anyway.<br />
<br />
Characters from 46 to 52 are welcome to come engage Vox, any higher levels are welcome for buffing beforehand and rezzing afterward, if necessary.<br />
<br />
Anyone who is coming, please try to be there at least a half hour early, and anyone willing to do ports, please let me know, either in the boards, or ingame.<br />
<br />
Be forewarned, this is my first attempt at leading a raid.  I have been researching tactics and I am relatively confident in what must be done, however any input from more experienced players would be much appreciated.<br />
<br />
I hope to see many of you there.<br />

I will definately keep an eye out for you tho... in the future.  Do you have a website.?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>xacnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Helek, I hate to say this, but we do not ahve a website to speak of.  At one time, about a year back, UWS was rather large, not as large as KoE, but still nothing to scoff at.  However, with the launch of Velious, we found that we were not large enough to do hardly any epic encounters, so many of our higher level characters left UWS to go to larger guilds, more capable of raids.  Our guild has essentially died out, but we still have a younger generation, so I am staying to try to return the favor.  UWS helped me out a lot when I was starting, so I am helping our younger players in turn.  Unfortunately, one of the higher characters to leave was our webmaster, so we no longer have any website.<br />
<br />
Harryfooty, sounds good.  We may need you in more than one respect.  Your damage will be excellent against Vox, but if all does not go well, we may also need you to drag corpses back.  I was hoping a rogue would come.<br />
<br />
Wedeln, good to hear it.  We'll need at least one mage for shards of the core, love that cold resist!  And of course, your other abilities will be quite useful.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't mean to sund gloomy on the corpse retrieval subject, I'm just trying to be practical, this is my first attempt at leading a raid, and I may fail.<br />
<br />
So far, good response, I'm also going to have as many of my guild there as possible, unfortunately RL does come into play, as with Helek, some of me guildmates have conflicts, I put up  aguild MoTD so I should have 6 or 7 turn out from UWS.  And I will definitely have Blaen, a level 54 monkey for pulling the IGs.<br />
<br />
I will be there probably anywhere from two hours to an hour and a half before noon EST to begin clearing the IGs.  THis could be a great source of decent loot and good xp.  I will need a few more than just myself and Blaen, however.  If you are interested in helping clear the IGs, please post to that effect, I want two groups for that just to be safe.<br />
<br />
group one:<br />
<br />
Myself, enchanter level 48 probably 49 by then<br />
Blaen, monk 54 now maybe 53 by then<br />
open<br />
meleee<br />
Cleric<br />
open<br />
<br />
group two:<br />
<br />
open<br />
melee<br />
snarer<br />
melee<br />
cleric<br />
chanter if possible<br />
<br />
Any input would be great.<br />
<br />
Hope to see you all in Norrath!<br />

<br />
Maybe I can delevel so I can have a shot at the scale... :D <br />
<br />
Or better...  /auc WTB white dragon scale!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aneron Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Xac I would love to attend to help you out....lvl 51 Pally here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kindonini</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Greetings Xacnar! My husband and I will be there! I am a 50 druid, with him you have a choice, he has a 51 shammy or a 48 pally. Just let us know what you desire more. We will also help you clear the IGs beforehand if you still need a hand with that.<br />
<br />
Looking forward to it!<br />
Kindo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>xacnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ok, some respoonses:<br />
<br />
Kindonini, sounds good.  I think with your husband, I'll opt for the shaman as I seem to have lots of melees so far, but that is subject to change, I will definitely give a firm request on his character by Friday.  I look forward to meeting you ingame.<br />
<br />
Aneron, sounds good as well, see you there, maybe we can get you a book.  ^_^<br />
<br />
Grayeyes, no need to weep, I'll be around.  You will meet me eventually.  I know that you really would rather meet me than haev a silly white dragon scale.  Perhaps we could all go after Gorenaire sometime.<br />
<br />
And, as always, my little discalimer.  There is nothing to guarantee that Vox will even be up on Saturday.<br />
<br />
That aside, I look forward to seeing you all ingame.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>xacnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Grayeyes, I don't see you on the Roster.  It doesn't look up to date anyway, but I was just wondering what class and level you are.  For curiosity sake more than anything else.<br />
<br />
Secondly, Kindo, I forgot to mention that your and your husband's help on the IGs would be great.  I definitely want you there.<br />
<br />
Sorry about the two posts, this isn't a bump, honest.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Harryfooty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">What is the white scale for?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>xacnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Vox raid will be beginning on 12noon EST providing she is still up.  All people of appropriate level are encouraged to attend.<br />
<br />
If someone with a cleric click stick would like to attend, that character would stand a VERY good chance of getting a scale or some other loot in exchange for rezzes all around.<br />
<br />
I will personally be reimbursing all clerics for any dots used.  This will probably drain my bank account, but it's worth it.<br />
<br />
Anyone who wants to clear IGs, I will be having two groups as stated before hand.  Please meet at snowflake, in Everfrost peaks at 10:00 am EST.  I will be clearing IGs even if Vox is not up, this shouuld be fun for all.  I have a 54 monk for pulling, and two 49 warriors, and a 50 monk that should be there.  If Kindo and her husband's shammy could come that would be great.<br />
<br />
Aneron, If you could come for clearing the IGs, please do.<br />
<br />
Anyone else, that leaves 4 open slots if Aneron comes, it would be great to have a cleric, but not necessary.  If you want to come, please send Fedora a tell.  I will try to be ingame at 9:00 am EST.<br />
<br />
For those who can come, I'm looking forward to meeting you ingame.<br />
<br />
For everyone else who can't attend, you're missing out. ^_^<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>cledian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">i should still be on, (cough) if wife doenst pull the plug..so pencil me in..<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Zadu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">lol Gray is a lil old for Vox, she is just dreaming.... <br />
She is a 57ish bard...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>xacnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Well, I had to postpone the raid until about 4:00 EST due to not hardly any people showing up, but at about 3:00 it was really starting to look like a Vox raid.  Problem is, I got a bit too hasty.  I gave the go ahead when we had five good groups, about half of us over 50.  It was looking as though she was going down, but we just didn't have enough people.  I probably should have waited until we had about 40 people.<br />
<br />
I saw LOADING, PLEASE WAIT when her red bar was at her d, and she hadn't completley healed yet.  Apparently, I was one of the last to die, which says a lot about our group's druid, Kastigier.<br />
<br />
It was my first attempt at leading a dragon raid, and I'm not upset at all.  I learned a lot.  I didn't go into it cold, Ruwen and Blaen were incredibly helpful.  I will be leading another raid on Vox, though not for a little while.  I need to lick a few wounds and see what I can learn.<br />
<br />
I do think, that if my first lead against Vox can get her down that far, than I am capable of leading a successful raid against her.  Any input or strategy would be much appreciated.  I hear Aranuil is rather adept at leading raids; if you would like to give me a few pointers, I would really appreciate it.<br />
<br />
And one last clarification, before I lick my wounds, Fedora is may main, Xacnar is one of my secondaries.  I use Xacnar online because I've had the character for years before even EQ was around.  I just happened to warm up to the enchanter class moreso than the wizard class.<br />
<br />
See you all in Norrath, don't be afraid to send me a tell if you need an excellent chanter.<br />
