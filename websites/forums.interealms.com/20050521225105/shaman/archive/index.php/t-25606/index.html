<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jeyche Deychundei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i just reciently nuked my puter, and after formatting i installed EQ, i found that i was missing disc 1 of SoL, is there anywhere i can download it without having to rebuy it? or will i have to go out and splash the cash?<br />
<br />
apologies if this is taboo and not liked on this forums, but i gotta ask... im stuck in shavahl</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm pretty sure you can download all the expansions with the patcher if you are already flagged as having owned/registered them on your account. The only thing having the discs does is save you some downloading time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>jeyche Deychundei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i thought that but i installed PoP and it only patched from pop upwards, i then installed SoV/kurnak and still no SoL</div></div><hr />

<br />
Look under advanced and make sure SoL is checked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>jeyche Deychundei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">it wasnt there... if yu havent installed it, yu cant update it, what i did find tho is if someone sends yu their Everquest.exe that has the all the expantions installed yu can patch in all the expantions</div></div><hr />

I had this problem it was because I had the UBI version I downloaded another patcher and SoL download was able to be ticked.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Go here and click where it says download this file.  Will have EverQuest.exe file in the zip.  That's the patcher which I DLed and was able to patch the entire game on my computer with no CDs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I tried re-installing recently useing the original cd, yea the one with the movie intro on it, was close to amused that it didn't patch, but hey at least i got the tutorial.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">you can download any expansion you want using the patcher.. its just a matter of having the cd-keys to be able to use them on Live.. so if you have SoL's key then you will be able to use it</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
tried that, it says &quot;luclin isnt properly installed, please find the CD's and reinstall&quot;<br />
<br />
cant do it from the sony live site it says <br />
<br />
&quot;you already have SoL please login to an account that doesnt have this expantion enabled&quot;<br />
<br />
