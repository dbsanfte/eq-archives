<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Since Sunday I have been unable to zone into or stay in Noble's Causeway or Walls of Slaughter for more than 1 minute without either: a) Locking up and getting disconnected, or b) Failing to enter the zone without my system locking up. (This is usually Noble's)<br />
<br />
Now this is what I have done (often repeatedly) in attempts to alleviate or eliminate the problem:<br />
<br />
1) Run Disc De-Frag<br />
2) Run Scan Disc<br />
3) Deleted the Following:<br />
<br />
a) UI Files Folder<br />
b) User Data Folder<br />
c) EQClient.INI File<br />
d) EQGFX_DX8.DLL File<br />
e) EQGraphicsDX9.DLL File<br />
f) All files pertaining to the toon in question<br />
<br />
4) Reinstalled Mother Board Driver<br />
5) Reinstalled DX 9<br />
6) Upgraded to latest DX9 driver<br />
7) COMPLETELY deleted ALL old files and replaced with EQ Platinum and OOW Expansion<br />
8) Run Advanced File check<br />
<br />
And I STILL Lock up when entering Noble's Causeway. (I don't know about Wall since I can never get there)<br />
<br />
Your advice is solicited and appreciated. <br />
<br />
Yes I know I posted in the wrong forum. I am beyond frustrated. <br />
<br />
System Specs: 733 MHZ, 256 Ram, NVidia 100/200 Vid Card, DSL, WIN 98 SE.<br />
<br />
Note: I had previously had some problems locking up entering Natimbi and Nedaria's, but could re-start the computer and be good to go.<br />
<br />
That is NOT the case with Noble's and Walls.<br />
<br />
Note also: I have experienced Walls for hours until Sunday. At that point I locked up trying to zone in to get my corpse and have basically been locked out since then.<br />
<br />
Note also also: Dranik's Scar I can zone into. It's Noble's for the moment and Walls (when I get there) that is giving me problems.<br />
<br />
Note also also also: I have talked to the live CS guys no less than five times.<br />
<br />
Perhaps this is God's way of telling me to quit EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I used to have the same problem, locking up or LD'ing on zones. Talked to tech support nine times before someone suggested to me to turn off Windows's QOS Packet Scheduler. No bloody clue where it is or what it does (perhaps control the size of data packets?) but once I turned it off, my LD problems were solved -- and back then, I was on dialup with Windows XP. He said all Windows versions have a packet scheduler of some kind, though, so perhaps take a quick look around your network settings for it.<br />
<br />
Also, perhaps adjust your datarate.txt file? I was once told 3 works for dialup better than 5 does. Whether or not that's true, I don't know, but it's worth a shot ... and you can always adjust it back to 5 if you're of a mind. It's just a text file in C: Program Files: EverQuest.<br />
<br />
Forgive my ignorance ... computers aren't my real area of expertise. But those worked for me, perhaps they'll work for you.<br />

<br />
QoS (Quality of Service) is the idea that transmission rates, error rates, and other characteristics can be measured, improved, and, to some extent, guaranteed in advance. QoS is of particular concern for the continuous transmission of high-bandwidth video and multimedia information.  The packet scheduler takes the information from the packet classifier, creates queues for each data flow, and then empties the queues at the rate specified by RSVP when the flow was created.  This is the definition for QoS.  This is from a quick search on QoS.  It sounds like it might effect someone on dial-up more than someone on DSL but worth checking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I had a similar problem in Gates, and here is what I did. I didnt use the current latest video driver, I used the one before it. This solved my problem. When OoW went in, and they added that Video Driver message, I tried updating again, and same problem, would crash constantly upon entering any Gates zone (was OK in DS, but dunno about Nobles, didnt actually make it there) so I went back to the one before. Using it now, and its working fine. <br />
<br />
My video card is an old GeForce 2 GTS though, so this may not be a solution. Worth a shot, you got noting to lose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I don't know what vid card you're using, the name doesn't even remotely ring a bell, but otherwise you got a machine that can run both WinXP and Win2K, so I would suggest switching to that, since Win98SE is beyond unstable.<br />
You might want to add another 256mb of ram, but this will not be crucial to reinstalling your OS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Aye, I realize it might seem stupid, but seriously consider switching to the NT kernel from the DOS based Windows.<br />
<br />
Yes, I realize it used to work.  In Haiku:<br />
<br />
Yesterday it worked.<br />
Today it simply does not.<br />
Windows is like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">QOS will re-order the packets going out of your machine based on &quot;priority&quot;, in other words, it will allow what it considers high-priority traffic to break in line ahead of lower-priority traffic.  I am not sure what priority the Windows QOS scheduler thinks your traffic has.<br />
<br />
QOS has to be implemented end-to-end, i.e. if you have a router anywhere between you and the other end that does not support it, you don't get QOS.  That includes a Linksys/DLink/whatever in your own home, something at the cable company/DSL company's local head end, or any of your ISP's routers you go through to get to the Internet backbone.<br />
<br />
I had crashing problems with the latest ATI drivers; reverting to the previous ATI driver fixed it.</div></div><hr />

I still run a 98se machine on EQ and its not unstable. But my 2000pro machine runs it better due to the fact that it has newer drivers and handles broad band better. I will tell you that moving up to 512 of main memory will help 100% and going to a new video card will help also. Most problems are due to those 2 things then any others. If you move up to 2000 or XP and you want a system that runs then get 512 of main memory or 1 gig if you can afford it. XP uses 200 meg just for its self. <br />
 Also a 733 Mhz machine is not really up to the task anyhow. Will it run EQ yup but to run at any degree of speed turn off all the graphic oiptions for sure. If you can afford it, looks like the best bet would be to move up to a new machine. Sometimes its just not worth upgrading the old to try and make it work.<br />
<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">aside from updating your system specs, I would say try deleting the zone files and re-running the patch program to dl them again. Probably won't help, but it's worth a shot</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yea, I agree with the ram, you could probably get 256 more megs pretty cheap. I'm guessing PC100 or PC133 for your system? <br />
Check out here http://www.pricewatch.com/m/mn.aspx?i=33&amp;f=1<br />
256 for 25 bucks and 512(if your system can handle something that large) for 30 bucks.<br />
Updating your video drivers is helpfull also, maybe check out the video card forums,sometimes some drivers are more stable then others the people chatting away there talk about that stuff sometimes.<br />
I would do that datarate thing too, if your going LD I would lower it, although it sounds quite a bit like your having hardware/software issuses and not connection problems.<br />
Minimize running as little software as possible. First off get rid of any spyware from your system. Install these two programs. Ad-aware<br />
http://www.download.com/3000-2094-10045910.html?legacy=cnet<br />
and spy-bot search and destroy(I use this one)<br />
http://www.safer-networking.org/en/download/index.html<br />
Next look in your startup folder from start-&gt;all programs-&gt;startup you should be able to remove any programs from there. If you are unsure about any programs just make a temp folder and move them to that folder.<br />
Next, and this is my favorite one removing the startup files from the registry. First don't be scared as long as you don't touch anything else you'll be fine, second don't touch anything else.<br />
Start-&gt;run enter in regedit<br />
Now from here you will see like 5 different folders you are only going to want to go int hkey_current_user and hkey_local_machine. Here is the folder rout you want to go.<br />
hkey_local_machine -&gt; software -&gt; microsoft -&gt; windows -&gt; currentversion<br />
and<br />
hkey_current_user -&gt; software -&gt; microsoft -&gt; windows -&gt; currentversion<br />
<br />
Now in the currentversion folder of both you will see folders that start with run, you are pretty safe to delete anything in those folders, if you are unsure you can probably post up what you see here and we can tell you what you can delete.<br />
On a side note if you install sypbot search and destroy  they have a section that removes the start up files for you(I would actually rather do this much easier)<br />
After you install spybot search and destroy put it in advanced mode(go to mode from the top buttons and hit advanced). After you do that you will notice on the bottom left of the screen you'll get some new options, click on tools now click on system start up. Whala much easier and you can click and unclick the files from being startup at system start up.<br />
I had a system similiar to yours a little slower amd 450 for around 300 or so I upgraded to a 1.5GHZ with 512 DDR ram</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Another suggestion since, prior to my video card swapout (from a Geforce 2 GTS to an FX5200), I lagged pretty seriously in both zones you referred to. Turn the clip plane as far down as you can (but not too far so you can't see) and see if that helps. Also, there's an &quot;Advanced&quot; button in the Display tab of the Options menu, try toggling all the pixel shader/vertex shader stuff off if it's on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>KalSeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Never heard of a Nvidia 100/200 card.  Try different video driver as was suggested.  Also in the EQclient.ini file they added a command for vertex shaders.  Your video card probably does not have 2.0 shaders, and maybe not even 1.0.<br />
<br />
Also as others suggest, more memory will help you out not just with EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">NVIDIA GeForce2 MX 100/200<br />
<br />
Yeah, thinking of upgrading RAM. $25 for 256 MGB is pretty sweet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If your machine can handle it like 5 bucks more for twice as much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I think that the video driver recommendation seems to be the best thing for you to try without having to resort to spending money.  I would try dropping back a version in Forceware drivers, or using beta drivers to see if that may also fix your problem.  My friend was having all kinds of lockup issues with EQ and the Sims 2 and going to the latest beta drivers fixed his problem.  <br />
<br />
What I really want to say is you need to have a beefier system to run EQ nowadays.  I think you should check for the biggest memory upgrade your motherboard will support and do that, as well as picking up at least a Geforce FX series video card (a 5600 or 5700 would probably be as far as you would want to go without your CPU limiting your performance too much).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>7ekno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Go to EQ directory, delete all *.txc files .... that the texture caches ....<br />
<br />
Your Graphics card sounds kinda old, turn off Pixel Shader 2.0 and Pixel Shader 1.x .... in Alt-O &gt; Display &gt; Advanced section ....<br />
<br />
It will almost certainly be a Graphic issue ... so, to maximise use of 256MB RAM, turn off the models ya don't care about, leave your toons model on and leave horses on ....<br />
<br />
Use Texture compression, and select medium or lower quality textures ...<br />
<br />
Thats about all I can recommend at the moment .... <br />
<br />
Good luck,<br />
