<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I stopped playing about 2 months ago. Had some time left on my account. The blurb that pops up says characters will be saved for 3 months. <br />
<br />
Q: Do I need to renew w/in a month or otherwise face deletion of my toons, or does the old axiom, &quot;They never delete your characters still apply?&quot;<br />
<br />
Am thinking about coming back when I get a second puter hooked up is the rationale behind my question.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Pumyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Mileages vary, but the majority of people I know that have stopped playing for 6-12 months have returned and found all their characters intact. I know of one person who stopped for 5 months and found his main toon missing, but he got it restored in some way.<br />
Most opinions are that toons are not deleted on a regular basis from inactive accounts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fibonacci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Toons are guarenteed to be there for 3 months.  However, there has only been a single wipe of old characters to date and that was within the first year of EQ and limited to level 1 characters only.<br />
<br />
Rest easy.  Your stuff will still be there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Aye, chances are that they will still be intact.  It takes very little memmory to preserve the characters on an account.  It also means that people will return and pay more money if SoE will keep the toons alive.<br />
<br />
I took a 9 month break and all my characters were still there.  I would feel confident in doing so again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Chances are the characters will still be there.  There is a possibility however that the gear will be gone.  A cleric I know returned after a 6 month break and every cp he owned was gone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>woon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Tarthug sounds to me like he got hacked or someone who had his acct info took all his gear :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah, the only way your account will be modified is if someone else uses it. You're pretty much going to have your characters around indefinetely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It was a long time ago, but I doubt he was hacked.  He's been re-geared, quit, come back, started a new class over, quit, come back since then.  He now keeps his account active when he quits, he just no longer plays.  I need a scorecard ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jormal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Two friends from my old guild retired for about 3-4 months at the beginning of 2003. When they returned their accounts had been wiped. They went through the whole CS route to attempt a recovery and we're never able to get them back.<br />
<br />
These we level 65 characters with 200+ AA and over 180 played days.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Baldrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I just came back within the last week and a half or so after a 6 month break and everything was there on both accounts</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I've taken several breaks of varying sizes over the years - all toons were there at each return.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Taabya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I took a 2 year break and paid once every 3 months to make sure I wasn't deleted, but I've never heard of anyone's characters being deleted while they were inactive.</div></div><hr />
