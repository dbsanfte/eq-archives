<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>faulcker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Thing I see about the OoW spells on TEST is it they are a rehash of the same old same old...  It's PoP + 20% effectiveness.  All classes are getting the same thing.  What would make this whole expansion really worthwhile would be to give each class a new &quot;special trick&quot; via AA likely, or spell even, that will define them and make them unique, but not overpowering at high levels.<br />
<br />
Most shaman seem to agree that at the low end, middle, and middle/high end of the game, shaman are great in single groups up to BoT or so.  And maybe GoD, haven't been there much, so cannot comment.<br />
<br />
One of the things that sucks at the high end I understand is lack of things to do except spot heal or attempt in vain to land a spell.  Oh, and the constant requests for f'in FA.  So, we need to be SPECIAL, but not overpowering.  Let's forget slows, forget issues with slow mitigation... those are built in.  Mobs will mitigate because the game should never have created 75% slows in the first place, much less give it to multiple classes.  Mobs are only as fast as they are slowed, because rarely will any group or raid engage a mob and just &quot;not bother to slow it&quot;.  I'll stop that rant and get to what I'm really proposing.<br />
<br />
We need something that will make multiple shamen effective and useful, not unbalancing.  We are tribal medicine men, right?  How about a line of AAs that allow you to &quot;perform&quot; some kind of ritual that will modify the tanks.  You activate your ritual on a member of the raiding or group force and your ritual can help in certain ways.  It will be a lot like disciplines, I guess, some may help damage avoidance, or damage mitigation.  Some rituals on a cleric will help their healing or healing haste.  Some rituals will help wizards crit by appealing to the gods to empower them energy.  <br />
<br />
Each of these rituals would share the same timer, and multiple shamen could not stack the effects on a single character.  Another problem would be shamen holding off their ritual so that the MT will always have the mitigation on him/her, this would have to be considered.  Maybe a PC can only recieve the same ritual after a certain time.<br />
<br />
This is just an idea I had as I'm searching for something that will make us unique and desirable in most circumstances, yet will not hurt the balance in the game further than its current state.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">So, stackable buffs? I actually like this &quot;ritual&quot; idea, to make multiple shaman useful. Perhaps apply it to debuffs. Imagine if Turgurs' stacked, giving cumulative 2% more slow after the first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Finally they acknowledge stats are useless and extending the lines would be a waste. now if only they could retroactively change the spells like they currently are for the omens spells:<br />
<br />
avatar = +10% damage, and Agi = +10% chance to avoid melee :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Now that we are seeing these types of effects on ALL class spells, I am wondering what kind of cap they put in place for them all.</div></div><hr />
