<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tawnay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just wanted to make a short post and say that I think this forum is great!  I am new to the Crucible (been lurking for about a week now) and have found so much informtion here my head is swimming!  Thank you!<br />
<br />
I am a level 60 Shaman and still have so much to learn (Can you say n00b!?).  Thanks to all of you and all the great info here, what I need to learn is a bit less now.  :)<br />
<br />
So, here is my official &quot;Hello!&quot; and I hope to be making posts in the future if I have anything useful to add (don't hold your breath :p ).<br />

Don't worry, gonna search my brains out before I ask a stupid question.  However, if I do post a dead horse,  I can take the flames with the best of em. :p<br />

<br />
Hi all :)<br />
<br />
I always regretted back in my Hate raiding days that the E'Ci Shaman community didn't seem to be that tight.  I'm afraid that one of the reasons was our lack of 'stackability' which put us into competition for groups, raids and getting to do the good debuffs far too often.<br />
<br />
But I've been very much enjoying the company (and general playfulness of Shaman in bearform) during large raids alot lately.<br />
There are some awesome shaman on E'Ci. ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">we need to start a shaman channel on e'ci, how about shaman:shaman?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Nah, don't bother with a password.  Yes, the channel stays up for 24 hours - but it's also created instantly when someone joins it.  Passwords for common public channels simply result in folks trying to join, not being able to because of the password, and they go somewhere else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">&gt;&gt;I always regretted back in my Hate raiding days that the E'Ci Shaman community didn't seem to be that tight.&lt;&lt;<br />
<br />
Once upon a time we were a smaller, closer group, but E'ci being as old as it is people have retired, changed professions, or jumped to other servers over the years. <br />
<br />
We had a board set up for Hate armor and general shaman topics, and many good discussions went on there. I'd say it was as good as the Crucible, for shaman on our server to get information (no offense, Thantu) ;) I think I probably was familiar with most every high level shaman on the server, at least by name, back then when I was the 'Listguy'. <br />
<br />
But times change, and that board fell out of use when E'ci raids switched from mostly public to private/guild only.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Meschit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hello bruddas and sistahs. Looks like E'Ci owns this block. So what should our colors be? &lt;gold tooth grin&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Irksome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Rathelon ran the Hate armor list for a long time, no?  I remember those boards, they were active and useful.  And we had a decent Hate armor list system on E'ci when many classes were spending the whole raid arguing about who got what.<br />
<br />
I think Rathelon has it right;  many of the 'core' have retired, guild associations have become dividing influences, and the total number of players has increased dramatically.  It also seems like the ratio of shaman to other classes has increased in the last year or two.<br />
<br />
Oh, and, hi!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I didnt really set that board up. Thordan, Krelian, and others set it up, I just did the upkeep on the gigantic list for a while after they moved on to bigger and better things. <br />
<br />
I think the E'ci population has actually decreased overall, and many of the older players changed professions or left. Meanwhile the newer players have moved up, so we are left looking around at all these new names and thinking there was a boom (not realizing all the ones who are missing).<br />
<br />
Rams, Darvim, Brocht, Kalder, Nuuk, Lamman, Drunna, Bjornan, Torfi, Jariten, Balguran, Nahmid, Bobogaum, Banky, Ketaos, Barce, Barbyon, Krox, Frazen, Inkidu, Jayger, Borlanis, Terieni, Baphometo, Whallas, Rayrok, Onei, Sopaca, Delendra, Aack, Manimal, Loch, Kayleigh, Klane, Baldaorm, Bearpaws, Wretch, Bumudin, Moch, Oberhauss, Lazz, Wulfger, Eagleknight, Krisa, Lupe, Timan, Giantbane, Jopie, Thordan, Krelian, Mallaur, Banam, Dancin, Hilda, Freja, Karlace, Scorne, Aethar, Sunosx, Catamount, Kambuk, Sasimi, Belezaar, Boogaroo, Pout, Nebudchaneezer, Jawbonee, Vinan, and all the rest I havent named....<br />
<br />
I only ever see a handful of these folks anymore, though I can name a few more who I know play a new character now...but the rest I never see nowadays</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Zyran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Welcome Tawnay!<br />
<br />
And when running around on Eci you see a cute kitty shaman.. it's probably me!<br />
<br />
I'm really surprised there aren't more VAH shamans though<br />

I jsut got canablization today ^_^. I've been on Ec'i forvever( Since Dec 03, 1999) Go Ec'i!<br />
<br />
We should have a shaman channel for help and advice to other shaman. I would help with that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Irksome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Damnit, Rathelon, you just made me go sentimental.  Some of those names were good friends, and are long gone.  /sigh<br />
<br />
Irk</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Yeah, I hear ya, Irksome. Some old friends in that list that I havent seen for a long time. /mourn Krisa, Jopie, Giantbane, Jariten<br />
<br />
Some are still around though, in one form or another, and I even saw a couple shamans recently that had been MIA for a long time. I saw Torfi the other day for the first time in a while, and Banky gave me a tell the same day. He just came back after 6 months. <br />
<br />
Vinan, Delendra, Qualm, and Bearpaws are on my friends list and play regularly still. <br />
<br />
I think Thordan and Mallaur are still out there, they just keep to themselves and their guilds. Same with Barbyon, I think, but I dont know her that well.<br />
<br />
Nuuk is still around, but I think he plays his warlord mostly. Likewise with Brocht and Nahmid; they both have 60 monks now. Kayleigh has her druid, of course. Catamount plays other characters, also.<br />
<br />
Ketaos, Inkidu, Wretch, Lazz, Lupe, Timan, and Sunosx have all been sighted recently by me, though I dont know how often any of them play.<br />
<br />
As for the rest, seems they've vanished into the spiritworld.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Brocht</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Man you made me sad with that list Rathelon!<br />
<br />
And HEY the last time I saw you YOU were a MONK! :)  (ok ok so he was not yours..)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">&gt;&gt;And HEY the last time I saw you YOU were a MONK!&lt;&lt;<br />
<br />
Hrm. That would be my brother's monk..cant remember what I was doing that day...might have been moving him to ToV for a raid so he could be there when he got off work. :) <br />
<br />
Couple of other old timers that werent on the list; Ironhide and Targar. Seen Targar posting here but havent seen him in game. Have not seen Ironhide in a long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>fethanin-eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Wow, there are more eci shamans on this board than i thought :)</div></div><hr />
