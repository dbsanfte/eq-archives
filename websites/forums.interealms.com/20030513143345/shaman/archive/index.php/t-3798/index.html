<br />
 the current one is just plain dumb.  it doesnt even have to be in tga format, ill convert it &gt;:)  but having it in tga format would make it easy for anyone to use right away.</div></div><hr />

It's the Beastlord Brown set about 2/3 down the page.<br />

Would someone mind posting an easy little walkthrough of how to switch a spell gem?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Nicely done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Joril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">changing icons is easy if you have a graphics program that can load .tga files.   paint shop pro is a good one for this.<br />
<br />
the graphics files are located in the uifiles directory, then under the appropriate subdirectory (ie: default, or whatever you named your new one)<br />
<br />
there are 3 sets of files:<br />
<br />
gemicons01 - 02.tga - this is the spell gem icons<br />
<br />
spell_icons.tga - this is the old icons for the spell gems, the effect window, and spell book<br />
<br />
spells01 - 05.tga - this is the spell effect and spell book icons<br />
<br />
all of the icons are listed in these files.  all you have to do is cut and paste between files.  for instance, the icon for focus is that ugly dream catcher.  find the dream catcher icon in the  gemicons and spells files and cut them out (if you dont know how to do this, then you shouldnt try altering anything here, you can crash the skin which will crash EQ to desktop).  then find the old shield icon in the spell_icon file and copy it, then paste it into both the gemicons and spells files. <br />
<br />
if you have all three files open you can paste the copied icon into the other two with the &quot;paste into selection&quot; option.  that way you dont have to worry about resizing anything, it will automatically fit it to the appropriate size.<br />
<br />
this can be done with any icon to replace any other icon.  i liked the new  orange eye icon, thought it would be good for acumen, so i copied it and put  it instead of that weird shield like thing acumen had.<br />
<br />
also icons are used for several differen spells, so when you replace the icon one spell it will replace it for all of them.  for example talis of epuration uses the same icon as talis of jasinth.  i found a icon in the new set that had the shield with the poison and disease  items, though it was perfect for talis of epuration instead of the what ever ity had before (i dont remember).  now all my resists have the same shield with a time for the appropriate resist.  problem is talis of jasinth, which is disease only, has the icon for disease and posion resist.  i didnt think this was a big problem since they dont stack anymore and i wont be using jasinth.  this is just an example of spells using the same icon.  usually they are all in the same class so its no big deal, but sometimes its not.  i dont think anyone will run into anything strange, but you might.......  if you do and dont like it, can always change it back &gt;:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Patito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Here's some that I made, I took the bear from Yzzy's spellbook background. It changes the bearform illusion to a bear instead of that ghastly thing it was before. I also changed the pet spells and summon companion to a wolf. Here's a picture of the changes:<br />
<br />
http://homepages.wmich.edu/~p9boersm/eq/icons.jpg<br />
<br />
And here are the files you'll need to download:<br />
<br />
http://homepages.wmich.edu/~p9boersm/eq/icons.zip<br />
<br />
To install these, open up your EverQuest directory, go into the uifiles directory, and unzip these files into the directory of your current skin (if you haven't installed any mods, it'll be in the default directory) and overwrite the current files. (might want to make a backup copy of the files just incase you decide you don't like these)<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
<br />
Updated file further down, this one is still available if you'd rather have it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Love them, thank you so much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Oh, can you please come up with something more shamanlike for agi/sta/group agi/group sta?  Those hideous big blue hearts and god awful boots MUST GO.<br />
<br />
Other lame icons which need replacing:<br />
<br />
Slow - too busy!<br />
Root - too lame!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Patito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">OK, I'll work on replacing more. Do you guys like the wolf icon? There's another one with just the head of the wolf howling and a sparkly thing behind it like in the old icon. Would this be better for one or both icons? Any suggestions for a slow icon? I also want to improve on the bear a little bit when I have time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Maybe, howling wolf for summon pet and standing quietly wolf for summon companion?<br />
<br />
I really can't think of a good slow icon, maybe a red hourglass? Something more simple would be an improvement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Patito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Here's the picture of the other wolf I mentioned:<br />
<br />
http://homepages.wmich.edu/~p9boersm/eq/wolf.jpg<br />
<br />
Since it's Turgur's Insects, here's a icon for an insect that was already in use for another spell. I can change slow to this, or if anyone else has some other suggestion I'll see what I can do:<br />
<br />
http://homepages.wmich.edu/~p9boersm/eq/insect.jpg<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
added an insect with an hour glass (couldn't get the hourglass to look good by itself):<br />
http://homepages.wmich.edu/~p9boersm/eq/insect2.jpg<br />
<br />
I'm at work right now, so I'm limited in what I can do. I downloaded the spell icons for 2, 4 and 5 that I posted, but missing 1 and 3 until I get back home. I was thinking about making a half bear, half human cut down the center, there was a wolf icon like that. Or else I'll try shrinking the bear a tad and adding a blue glow behind it like in the other icons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Patito,<br />
<br />
Thanks, the Bear Icon is working now, however the transparent bear is not, *sigh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">In a few weeks I beleive Glori will have lead us to the promised land of a cool shaman skin :)<br />
<br />
Edit:  My ex-roomate is a graphic artist.  I will see if I can get him to take a look and maybe design some changes.  He is really good with all that artsy crap so he may be able to whip up some new icon graphics.<br />
<br />
Also,<br />
<br />
Has anyone found a skin that shrinks the damn spell bar.  It's huge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Patito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The transparent bear? Did I miss something? I thought there were just two, the one large icon for spell book and buff window (in the spells05.tga), and the small icon for the spell bar (in the gemicons02.tga).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Blackdust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">These Icons are awesome. Thank you so much for posting them. I like them much better then the originals. You rule.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Patito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Some more ideas being submitted for your approval (yes, slow day at work).<br />
<br />
Here is a revised bearform:<br />
http://homepages.wmich.edu/~p9boersm/eq/bear.jpg<br />
<br />
here's another idea which I think sucks, so I figured I'd post so you can all get a good laugh.<br />
http://homepages.wmich.edu/~p9boersm/eq/bearform.jpg<br />
<br />
here's another wolf that's already in use that could be used for summon wolf or summon companion (but I think I like the above two the best).<br />
http://homepages.wmich.edu/~p9boersm/eq/wolf2.jpg<br />
<br />
Looking back at the insect ones, the insect with the hourglass is just about as busy as the original slow.<br />
<br />
Here's the current slow icon so you can see.<br />
http://homepages.wmich.edu/~p9boersm/eq/slow.jpg<br />
<br />
Here's a red hourglass for Gloriana, maybe this will work better than the insect idea.<br />
http://homepages.wmich.edu/~p9boersm/eq/hourglass.jpg<br />
<br />
Let me know if you like any of these and I'll remake the files with the new icons. I kind of like the root spell, but I was thinking maybe a vine or something may look good. Not sure how I'll do it yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I like the red hourglass a LOT, I love the insect idea, but I'm afraid it will get too smushy as a spell gem.  A vine would be great for the root icon, can't stand those BOOTS!<br />
<br />
I like that howling wolf icon, I think thats' the ranger CoP buff, so I get that one quite a bit.<br />
<br />
The revised bear form is pretty cute (I already downloaded your other one last night and am LOVING it), I don't suppose there's anyway to make a polar bear for barbarian shaman?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Wow patito -- very nice icons. =) I really like the insect one -- much more distinctive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Patito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I'll redo the .tga files and post them later today as a .zip, computer at work is a mac. I'll include the revised bear for bearform, howling wolf for summon wolf pet, and leave the current standing wolf for summon companion, and make a file for both the insect and the hourglass for slow. I like the insect better, so that's what I'll use, but do the hourglass too. I'll look to see if I can find a good polar bear image to use for a barbarian version too.<br />
<br />
I'll repost the whole set as I update more icons. Agility, stamina, and root.... any others that suck? Any suggestions for icons for those spells? One thing I thought of, but wouldn't work well for lower lvl shaman, is do a rhino, raptor, cat, and brute head to go along with our group stat buffs.... but what the heck does a brute look like?<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
<br />
One more question... insect icon with or without the hourglass?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Oh! Acumen! It should have an eye, I just can't get used to it.<br />
<br />
It looks like ultravision has a purple eye (and I would guess infravision has a red eye?) How about a really wild shiny white/silver/gold eye for acumen?  Or an eye with a shield for the pupil?  <br />
<br />
And Brells, should not have stupid pink heart.<br />
<br />
Hmmmm...if you look at the icons that Juujuu modified (a .jpg about 3/4 down the page):<br />
<br />
http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=3765<br />
<br />
in the middle section (labeled spells03.tag) there is an icon with a suit of armor, that might be kind of cool for Brells.<br />
<br />
I'm also not wild about SoW looking like SoE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Bear icon looks good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Patito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Some quick ideas for Acumen (I like the third one the best):<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Oh yeah, that acumen (third one with eye/shield) kicks butt.<br />
<br />
Not as wild about the SoW, let's face it, that winged shoe is just poofty.  We are shaman, we don't have some goofy little winged shoe.<br />
<br />
The blue shield is awfully pretty by itself, it might make a good Brell's icon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Nice icons!<br />
I cut and pasted them into my layout.<br />
<br />
The only other one that is annoying me still is the Malo/Malosini. <br />
I really liked the black color around the old one so it stuck out, and thats what I did to mine currently, but something else besides a wolf with fire above his head is in order I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Patito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Ok, here's the updated one. To install, same drill as before.<br />

Form of the Bear<br />
Acumen (also changes invigor and extinguish fatigue)<br />
Brell's Moutainous Barrier<br />

For the one with slow insect, download this file:<br />

WARNING: This will change the icon for any spells using the same graphic too. So if you happen to play an enchanter alt and use the same UI skin for him, all your illusion spells will have the bear graphic.<br />
<br />
If you want me to create a mod just for you with select icons or maybe move around some other icons you don't like. Email me: patrek98@yahoo.com<br />

Added Brell's icon change, also fixed the hourglass version.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Rubadub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Hi fellow shamans:<br />
<br />
Anybody have an idea why I get an error message when I type<br />
<br />
/loadskin buffmods<br />
<br />
I am following the following directions which I got from http://newui.technosapien.net/:<br />
<br />
<br />
Instructions for loading skins/mods in game:<br />
<br />
1. Go to the uifiles directory in your Everquest folder, Right-Click on the DEFAULT folder there, and select &quot;Copy&quot;<br />
<br />
2. Then Right-Click in the same folder as default (beside it) and select &quot;Paste&quot;<br />
<br />
3. Re-name &quot;Copy of  Default&quot; a new name, keeping it short <br />
<br />
4. Download the file you want and un-zip them.<br />
<br />
5. Drag all the items in your un-zipped file folder into your new folder, (you just named a short name)  it will ask you &quot;do you want to copy over....&quot; select &quot;YES TO ALL&quot;.<br />
<br />
6. Log into Everquest<br />
<br />
6. use /loadskin &lt;folder name&gt; (this is why you keep it short)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Patito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Rubadub, what mod are you using that's giving you that error? I don't see any problems with what you're doing. Just be sure when you type &quot;/loadskin name&quot; that &quot;name&quot; is the exact same spelling (not sure about capitalization, but I'd make sure anyway) as the directory you pasted the mod in, and that that directory is in the uifiles folder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Brek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Now someone just needs to make a program where we can select icons we want and build the image file that we want and replace it accordingly... :) give the programmers something to work on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Patito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Brek, a program like that would be so sweet.<br />
<br />
<br />
Updated Spirit of Wolf icon, check above and redownload the .zip file if you want it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Here's the inferface I am using now. All of the window modifications were done by other people, but I did some modifications to spell icons and spell gems myself. The changes are:<br />
<br />
- spell bar no longer has book button<br />
- spell book is smaller with page buttons underneath <br />
- inventory window is arranged like old inventory, destroy button larger and off to the side away from other buttons<br />
- windows selector window has text tag removed<br />
- target window shows percentage of target's health remaining<br />
- group window shows percentage of group members health remaining, as well as green pet health meter if they have a pet<br />
- player information window has first name, last name, health bar, mana bar, fatigue bar, experience bar, alternate exp bar, current and maximum hps, and percentage of mana remaining.<br />
<br />
Changes I made to spell icons are:<br />
<br />
- changed Form of the Great Bear icon to a bear head<br />
- changed Spirit of Wolf icon to winged boot instead of winged shoe<br />
- changed healing spells to red heart with white hand<br />
- changed all regen spells to 3 red sphere icon<br />
- changed the blue heart (stamina buffs) to flexed arm<br />
- changed malo series icon to a skull<br />
- changed slow series to curse icon<br />
- changed talisman of epuration icon to a shield with disease and poison indicators (instead of fire and wolf)<br />
- changed shaman AC buff line to reflective silver shield<br />
- changed pink heart icon to silver shield with blue flash<br />
- changed acumen to purple eye icon (KEI also used this icon)<br />
<br />
I may have changed 1 or 2 other icons, but these are the ones I remember.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Patito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">The files are fixed to reflect the change in the gemicons02.tga file where they were moved over 1 pixel on the 7/31/02 patch. This was because those icons would show a small gap in the spell bar gems. I also changed the spirit of wolf spell again. I didn't like the wolf, so I made it the winged boots, which are by far better than the pansy slippers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Yay winged boots!<br />
<br />
Will it also show up on Group SoW and the black fur boots SoW icon?<br />
<br />
I was looking at the remove curse icon and it would make a dandy Malo/Malosini icon, it's suitably dark and sinister looking.<br />
<br />
With SoW fixed, the only icons that still desperately need replacing are:<br />
<br />
Agi/Sta, Group Agi/Group Sta<br />
root - maybe (I hate the boot)<br />
Torpor/Regrowth - no more hearts!  I'm looking for a heart-free EQ experience</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Patito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Yep, it will replace all the pansy slipper icons! Unfortunantly, it will also replace it for SoE too, so when a druid casts that on you, it will be disguised as a non-pansy spell. I don't know about everyone else, but I really loathe SoE. The bobbing up and down makes me sick, can't cast my boots to refresh when it's blinking, and every single druid that passes by you feels like they have to give it to you.</div></div><hr />

You might want to check out mine for the changes I made to healing and regen spells also. The healing spells are still a red heart, but it's the one with a white handprint in the center instead of the shiny one. And my regen/torpor icons are 3 red spheres that fade away...it fits with the way regen affects our little red bubbles, I think.<br />
<br />
My malo icon is the same one Patito is using for Cannibalize, and my turgur line icon is a dark hand with a dark burst behind it...looks like some sort of curse icon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Yeah, I would love to see yours too, Rathelon, but I'm not quite sure how it would work to replace icons created by two individuals.

If I download your spell gem changes (very interested in your Torpor/Regrowth options), wouldn't I lose the ones that he created?  It looks like the files he gave me are for ALL the spell icons, not specific ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">If you download mine, it would replace his files. Here's a screenshot of what mine looks like with inventory and spellbook open;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Patito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">I'll combine both of ours for you Gloriana if you want to pick and chose between the two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">That would be great, Rathelon's regrowth icons are really nice.  I think I prefer your Skull for cann, not Malo.  His shroud of the spirits is also pretty nifty looking, I think it's silvery enough not to get confused with the blue shield of Brells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Loradenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Think you can do this for me too Patito?  If so here are the ones I'd like.<br />
<br />
All of the ones you changed, plus his Shroud of Spirits, regen/torpor, and Malo/sini icons.<br />
<br />
Thanks alot if you can do this for me!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">I've got many of the icons changed back to the older style of icons, with some small writing overtop to indicate exactly what kind of spell it is that I'm looking at.  I've posted it in another thread, but here's the links again, as I don't think a lot of people here saw my post.<br />

<br />
This is the collection of icons that I have editted.  I've actually made a few more edits since I took this screenshot, labelling the lull, stun, paladin line of regen, and some other icons.<br />

<br />
And one for you too Loradenn:<br />
<br />
http://homepages.wmich.edu/~p9boersm/eq/loradenn.zip<br />
<br />
I used the one with the insect for the slow icon, I can change it if that's not the one you wanted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Thual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Thanks Patito!<br />
<br />
I have been lurking this thread and I am more excited about your icon changes than any of the other mods I have seen out there. I am using all yours now, I LOVE the insect slow...<br />
<br />
Anyway I also like a few of Rathelon's as well. I'm pretty much in line with the set you did for Loradenn. Thanks for posting it.<br />
<br />
One slight request? Can you post an updated image of all of the current icons (your main one, the one for Gloriana, and the one for Loradenn)<br />
<br />
I would just like to see the all right in front of me before I decide which to use. If not possible I understand. <br />
<br />
Thanks again, great work!<br />
<br />
EDIT: For clarity, this is what I am talking about.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Aw, Patito, you're the best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Patito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">Here's what I did for Gloriana and Loradenn:<br />
<br />
http://homepages.wmich.edu/~p9boersm/eq/icons2.jpg<br />
<br />
From top down:<br />
Summon Pet<br />
Summon Companion<br />
Form of the Bear<br />
Acumen, Invigor<br />
Brell's Mountanous Barrier<br />
Slow<br />
SoW, SoE, any other speed spells with the slippers (sorry, no pic right now)<br />
Shroud of Spirits<br />
Regrowth, Torpor<br />
then on Gloriana's file:<br />
Cannibalize<br />
or on Loradenn's file:<br />
Malo, Malosini line of spells</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Loradenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Sorry, I forgot to mention that, but I prefer the hour glass if you can for me please. :)  Wish I knew how to work with the UI myself. Hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">The hourglass is great, but I just had to go with the bee, it's so cute.<br />
<br />
I think for Malo/malosini...if you look at the handy icons that Juujuu posted, on the very left, second box down, buttom row, second to the left there is a black icon with a white star, I think that looks suitably menacing for Malo/malosini.<br />
<br />
Of course, it's also the icon (I think) for remove curse/greater remove curse, so, those should be swapped to....maybe...the big blue hand that's in the same box, second row down, on the right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Blackdust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Woot, these are getting even better. You guys are coming up with some very creative icons, the look great. I especially like the addition of the cann icon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">Went to ToV last night with my guild using my new interface (icons) for the first time. Turns out KEI doesnt use the acumen icon. My acumen is pictured above, but when I had KEI cast on me it looked like the default Cannibalize icon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Alminah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">First I want to thank you all so much... I've taken icons/ideas from all of you and mixed together to suit me and my playstyle and I like the result a lot :)<br />
<br />
For Malx I took away the scythe from a spectre icon http://www4.tripnet.se/~feline/eq/ui/malx.jpg I think it looks good (I mean horrofying ;))and suits the debuffline <br />
<br />
And while I'm at it... anyone figured out a better looking icon for horses than a boot with wings yet? (...alas scale of wolf and spirit of scales uses the same icon as well, but I never ever use them anyway)<br />
<br />
Thanks all, again :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>coryn braun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">Patito-<br />
The Canni icon is cool as hell.  Really diggin the skull with the blue nova thingy behind it. =p<br />
<br />
And I prefer summon companion #1 over #2.</div></div><hr />
