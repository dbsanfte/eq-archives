<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lyndar</div><div class="date">04-10-2002, 11:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My wife (50 almost 51 cleric) and I have been hunting Eastern Wastes for a couple of levels, and it's time to move on.  We tend to hunt as a pair, sometimes adding a warrior, chanter or bard from our guild.<br />
<br />
We've done dungeons back in the 30's, and could use some more indoor/city practice, but my wife is quite claustrophobic. (Note to self: talk her into Run Speed 3.)  Any recommendations for a non-Luclin zone to do 51-53?   <br />
<br />
Hole entrance?<br />
City of Mist?<br />
Karnor's?<br />
<br />
After EW we're fairly poor, so I'd like to combine exp hunting with at least SOME loot;  I definitely need weapons upgrades, but I prefer to bear weapons I loot or quest.  (Right now I'm still using Swarmcaller, with DHY / Centi SS.) <br />

<br />
Mobs are a nice mix of blue and light blue at 50.  Picked up 500p and two Wraithbone Hammers while making my level.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lyndarra is closterphobic?  Bah.  :-p<br />
<br />
What bow are you using now Lyndar?<br />
<br />
CoM is actually not that bad for that pair in my opinion also.  What you really need to do is get into some full groups and take on Velks or DN  :)<br />
<br />
Talk to you soon!<br />
