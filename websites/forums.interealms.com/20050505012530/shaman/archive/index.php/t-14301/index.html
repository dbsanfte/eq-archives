<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've put off installing a custom UI for too long. Firstly it was because it wasn't quite stable, and many people were having problems each patch, but lately I've just not gotten around to it.<br />
<br />
What I'd like is some recommendations for custom UIs suitable for shamans. I don't want anything flash or fancy, I can do without pretty pictures for spells etc.<br />
<br />
My basic requirements are fairly simple: displaying HP numbers, stats, exp bars etc without having to open the inventory window, % displays on experience bars, nice layout, and not too different from default UI.</div></div><hr />

They have screenshots of most of their things, so you can see ahead of time what you are getting into.  Also handy, you can just put EQ in a window and /loadskin &lt;name&gt; 1 to bounce around as you download new ones, or the same if you are manually modifying any of your files.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I took several minor tweaks and I'm very, very happy.<br />
<br />
The one called &quot;3tabpet&quot; is one of my faves.  It makes your Pet window have 3 tabs at the top - Pet, Inventory, Statistics.    The Pet window has your weapons and range item at the bottom, the Inventory has all your worn gear, so for swapping stuff out quickly it can't be beat.<br />
<br />
The second one I forget the name of, but it turns your hotkey bank into a smaller hotkey bank but with all your inventory bags lined up on the right hand side.  This is a godsend, let me tell you, especially for gear-swapping.<br />
<br />
The last change I took was a group window that lists me as well as my group, shows the health % of every member (the normal one does this now I believe) and expands the pet health bar out into a seperate bar that's more easily clickable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've looked at EQinterface a bit, I was really after recommendations from experience.<br />
<br />
Thanks, Twoflower, that's just the sort of thing I was after. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, if you're going to THANK me, I'll go look up the info, hehe.<br />
<br />
3tabpet window (this is a later version than I use):<br />

Group window (avi-group2b.zip is what I use):<br />

Hot button window:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">OH!  I almost forgot the other tweak because it's not a custom UI window.<br />
<br />
I cram as much UI as I can at the bottom of the screen and then use the /viewport command to make sure there's black behind the text.<br />
<br />
Right now I run in 1280x1024 mode and use<br />
<br />
   /viewport 0 0 1280 720</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Foggy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I use the vert UI - it is v nice and uncluttered.  Also, all the windows fit together nicely so I do the same as Weiss and arrange them all at the bottom of the screen then change the viewport so I dont miss anything behind them. Works a treat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I can't remember the name of it, but there's a pet window that includes you, target, group and group pets. If you're like me, it's nice to have all the high priority stats in one area. There's also a very nice hot button mod that includes inventory slots and experience bars. I prefer the experience bars away from the group window as it means I'm not constantly reminded high slow my XP is going up.<br />
<br />
Other mods that have helped me a lot:<br />
<br />
Mafoo's spell mod. It takes up more screen space but it has the name of the spell gem and the NUMBER. Very handy for quick casting.<br />
<br />
Mini buffs - just makes the buff effect icons a lot smaller.<br />
<br />
Mini Selector - reduces the size of the main window selector drastically. Very handy.<br />
<br />
Right clickies -  an inventory mod that allows you to place all your right click items on the screen. I haven't actually used it yet, but it seems like a great idea if you don't want to see your whole inventory.<br />
<br />
Also (you never know) you may not have used the extra chat windows yet. Just in case you haven't, right click on the chat window and start a new window. You can then filter chat and combat reports to different windows. I have a main social, guild &amp; tell, and a combat window. The best 'mod' in the game, I think.<br />
<br />
If only there was a way to alter the font size in new chat windows...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Apache Soulhealer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You can modify chat font size in any window.  Set the window as the &quot;always chat here&quot; window. Then type /chatfontsize # where # is 1 to 5.  Worked for me.</div></div><hr />
