<br />
Ok!  There's not a one of us who hasn't experienced this.  Right now, I'm going through a period of aggravation with the buffing lowbies/noobs thing.<br />
<br />
Let me clarify.  I will gladly dole out sow, lev, invis, utility buffs like candy and without a second thought.  I feel sorry for anyone without sow, to be honest!<br />
<br />
What gets me is lowbies running up to me with &quot;can u buff me plz&quot; and then just standing there, waiting.  First thing that runs through my mind is, speak english!  Second is, why do you single out a 65 shaman when you're level 14 and then get mad when I say no?<br />
<br />
Curiously enough, if someone (anyone) approaches me for buffs (outside of a raid and not someone that I know) and offers a donation, 99.5% of the time (unless I'm in a hurry going somewhere) I will buff them for free, even if they are level 1.  What irks the fire out of me is having noobs approach for uber buffage not on thier level or remotely near it.  What do I look like, thier personal plvler?  Because that's what it amounts to.  I don't recall anyone zipping over to plvl my shaman when I was little.  I have alts myself (well, only one that I play) and  would NEVER ask for a buff higher than a sow without offering a donation.<br />
<br />
My question is, how do YOU handle these scenarios?<br />
<br />
Usually my first question is, &quot;Do I know you?&quot;   Because you never know, could be an alt of a friend.  I always buff my friends upon request (and sometimes I just ninja buff them!).   If they say no, I am sometimes at a quandry of what to do next.  Half the time I just /say No.  And then I leave.  The other half, I ignore them.  I feel guilty about both of these reactions though.  Maybe I shouldn't, but I do.  I try to be nice to everyone but I've got my limits.  I've gotten to where I HATE to walk by the nexus stone in POK, because it's worse than the Nexus for these sorts of problems.<br />
<br />
Oh - and I feel very sorry for enchanters and clerics.  But at least they get paid (most of the time).<br />

1. &quot;Alright.&quot;  Mem and cast endure cold, spirit of snake, and see invisible, then sit back down and pay no further attention to the beggar.<br />
<br />
2. &quot;Sorry, oom.  Give me 100pp for a KEI, and I'll buff you.&quot;<br />
<br />
3. &quot;What buffs do you want?  If you don't know what you want, how can I be expected to know?&quot;  Then, regardless of what they answer, ask them why they want that buff.  Ask them what they think it does.  Explain to them how wrong they are, and mock how little they know about the effects of stat buffs.  <br />
<br />
4. /roleplay  &quot;Sorry, I'm a warrior.  Want to buy one of my SoW potions for 125pp?&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If they ask nicely I will HoS them and sow and I'll take off.  I get bugged a LOT for buffs in PoK especially.  If they don't ask very nicely I might ignore them and pretend I'm AFK or something.  That works great cuz you didn't have to say no, they just got tired of waiting for your response. <br />
<br />
If the petitioner is reasonably high level, I almost always give whatever they ask for.  The exceptions are people I don't care for, or members of one certain guild . . who never ask anyway.  <br />
After all, I ask for buffs also sometimes.  I usually offer dots in exchange tho, since my buffs are considered worthless.  /sigh<br />
<br />
If someone offers to pay me to buff them with something, I always do it for free.  <br />
<br />
 Oh, if I am pressed for time and a noob asks, I will ignore their tell.  Or maybe I'll say I am in a hurry.  If I am pressed for time and a high level asks, I will probably find the time anyway if they are close to me.  <br />
<br />
Look at it this way tho.  Today's noob is tomorrow's lvl 65.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Given the amount of time and effort it takes for me to buff someone (very little) vs. how much it helps them out (can be a whole lot), I will usually always buff people if they ask politely or semi-politely.<br />
<br />
If I don't want to buff people (usually only when im in a bad mood), I go /role and pull out my winterstorm.  You'd be amazed how many people can't recognize a shaman if they aren't holding a glowing spear.  If I get asked for a buff anyways, I just don't reply.  Very few people will persist in asking for buffs if you just run past them and don't answer.<br />
<br />
My favorite is the people that are sneaky about it.  I was in bazaar the other day and this monk came up to me and asked me for a SoW.  NP, I always have sow up when I am in bazaar or nexus or a newbie zone.  SoW helps people out a lot and is basicalyl manaless, so I cast it.  So, I cast sow on him, and he says thanks runs off.  A minute later, he comes back up to me and asks me if I could cast khura's on him!  I learned in school that this is called the &quot;foot in the door&quot; approach to getting something you want, heh ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
So I made a hotkey<br />
<br />
/r Sorry, but I now charge 1 leather padding per buffing session. Leather paddings may be obtained at the bazaar, or you can make them via tailoring.<br />
<br />
So far, I've gotten 2 leather paddings. Not too shabby.<br />
<br />
And a bunch of annoyed tells, and totally confused people... I'm amazed at the number of non-tradeskillers....<br />
<br />
I do have one soft spot. If anyone asks for a str buff for smithing, I give them FoS and primal, and tell them the durations so they can be prepared. I like to help a fellow tradeskiller out. Got a smither in my guild who will actually ask where I am, and if I'm accessable, makes a run all the way out to me to get her smithing combine buffs.<br />
<br />
Smithing at 175, but about to do another run as soon as I complete this stack of padding....</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I buff those whenever I got time and mana to spare (which is the same to a shaman anyway). What bugs me the most is that my normal buffs cannot be cast on chars lower lvl 45 or so, so I have to browse the damn spell book to those last pages to find those old buffs.<br />
So in most cases I go with Sow and HoS (which I moved to the more commonlz used spell book parts for exactly that situation). If I am asked for something specific I go ahead.<br />
Until now I refused every donation.<br />
<br />
What bugs me more are the people running to me, hailing me and then waiting for me to do something .. what exactly I can only guess. The others that bug me are the ones that ask you to PL them in zone XYZ. I rarely find the time nowadays to PL some friends Alt .. so why should I go waste my time PLing someone I don't even know.<br />

&quot;can u buff me plz&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;What's a 'plz'?&quot; is my normal reply.  Clever ones then say &quot;please&quot;.  Idiots say &quot;plz = please&quot;, to which my reply is &quot;No, 'plz' is a random collection of letters, 'please' is a word&quot;.  I generally buff people once they've shown a basic grasp of proper English.  If a person can't make the effort to type out a proper &quot;please&quot; then I can't be bothered to mem up a spell and wait for the refresh (anyone else find the refresh on SoW beyond stupidity?  I mean why?).<br />
<br />
I get irritated with people who think I owe them buffs.  People who are willing to pay for buffs I will buff and not take their money, the fact that they were willing to pay to me means they actually value the fact that I'm taking time out to help them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If I'm feeling mean, I'll answer a newbie's 'can you buff me plz' with 'Yes, I can buff you like you wouldn't believe. I can give you 100s of extra hitpoints, better regen than a fungi tunic, haste, stat buffs..., I could turn you into an indestructable newbie killing machine.' Then I'll just walk away. <br />
<br />
Usually I'll either ignore the request (especially the inarticualte 'buffs pls'), answer with 'busy' if it was a polite request and I just don't have the time or mood, or with where I am so they can find me for buffs if I'm not busy. <br />
<br />
I am a sucker for sowing someone on a CR, even now with PoP. I've been on the oppisite side of that too many times with alts and always appreciated a sow in that situation. Same goes for requests by people doing trade skills. I'll go out of my way to buff them just because I know how much of a pain that can be sometimes.</div></div><hr />

I hate looking through my spell book for spells I can cast on someone &lt; 46. Besides low levels have it so damn easy these days with KEI vendors all over, no hell levels, exp bonuses till 30th, mudflation, etc. By 20th even a brand new to everquest player could easily by a weapon in the 12/24 range. Something like that cost 10k when I started. <br />
<br />
I should just start telling them that I deleted all the spells that I could cast on them. But I usually just ignore beggars. <br />
<br />
I'll buff anyone and everyone with SoW. I usually have it up or at least know where it is in the book so it's no biggie and not having sow all the time blows.</div></div><hr />

Exactly, weapons like that werent even around for the loonggest time, until at least after Kunark.  Pre Kunark it was Yaks and Mithril 2handers going for 10k.  8/24 and 21/40 (with haste) respectively.<br />
<br />
If the time and Mana, I buff.  Granted, I have deleted many of the low level buffs from my spell book, but when I feel put out I remember just how damn good it felt to get buffed by a shaman when I was a youngster.....</div></div><hr />

Also, the level of the requestor DOES factor into my decision to buff strangers.  But then, I find a higher level character will almost always have the courtesy to offer a donation, OR they aren't asking for &quot;buffs plz&quot;, it's, &quot;Could I get a focus?&quot;.  I'm much more willing to dole out a focus to a high level toon who isn't asking for the full lineup and has earned thier place than I am to some lvl 10'er.<br />
<br />
I actually did start a conversation once with some noob who wanted buffs, and explained that it would suck up all my mana, but after 10 minutes of going through this, he seemed just as clueless as when I had started talking, so I decided not to go that route anymore.</div></div><hr />

Funny about the use of &quot;plz&quot; and &quot;u&quot;.  I was grouped quite some time ago with a DeWd type, who liked using such language.  The cleric refused to heal him after fights unless he used proper English.  They got into quite the debate until he was mobbed by a few wanderers.  He was screaming &quot;heal me now will u plz!&quot; and she kept responding &quot;speak properly&quot;.  This repeated numerous times, all the while with him getting beat on.  She had been sending me tells saying how much she hated those words.  After a bit, she watched as he died.  He returned quickly, as he was a lizzie, and asked &quot;Can u rez me now, plz?&quot;</div></div><hr />

The only thing that irks me is the lvl 10 twinked out in lvl 50+ gear that demands buffs, these folks I usually dont buff. Although they would be great candidates for charging 1pp per 10 mana used, because they obviously have the plat.<br />
<br />
Just for fun I try to go to newbie zones once a month or so with my wife (62 druid). We each invite newbs until we have full groups then we target each other and put out our best group stuffs. We will move from freeport to qeuynos to shar vahl to mysty thicket even to halas. These runs take just a few hours and are a nice break from grinding or raiding.<br />

I almost never ask for buffs unless its someone in my guild but every now and then I need kei. So you go to a chanter and they want 100pp. When you say wow thats alot they say well my spell cost alot. Umm ok so do mine. I guess the next time a chanter needs topor to stay alive Ill just say that will be 100pp my spells cost alot you know. Be safe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Well, sounds like it's just me, but I tend to buff any and all whenever someone asks me.  Now, don't get me wrong, I don't volunteer to buff someone if they are just standing there, but if someone hails me and sends me a tell, I tend to do it.  Usually they ask for sow, and I give them that, but if they ask for more then I will give them more.  I typically of course ask them their lvl first, and then if they are too low, then I will group with them and buff them up properly.  If I'm already in a group though, I will just pull a couple other buffs out and give them the lesser versions.  <br />
<br />
It was bad last night when I was standing near the Nexus portal in PoK waiting for another shaman to come so that we could go and duo in the PoJ cave area looking for that Imbue Justice item.  I was standing there, and seriously had like 10 newbs around me.  Probably would have been alright, but a guildee was there on his alt character asking for a buff, and as soon as I gave it to him, I got a mess of tells asking for sow.  <br />
<br />
Either way, I don't usually accept a donation.  I remember how hard it was to have money in the bank when I was that low of a level.  It wasn't until around lvl 55 that I got lucky with some rolls and started playing the market a bit then I actually started having money in the bank.  I remember around level 37 or so going out to OT and just making enough money in one solo session to get a new C3 (I always pay 50pp for one, up to 100 if I'm desperate).<br />

I will go out of my way to buff some of my closer friends, especially if I'm not busy or bored.  Since there are a bunch of my RL friends on my server, it makes it a bit easier, since I know that I will get something in return eventually<br />
<br />
What did make me feel bad today though was that there was 62+ cleric donating Virtue or Aego for donations, because she was broke after buying a horse and owned someone some money.  Point is, she is a good game friend of mine, so I tried to give her the 3k that she still owned for it.  Of couse, she wouldn't accept it, but at least she knows that I was willing.  So..I'm hoping that this translates to free Virtues and free rezes whenever I need it :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
on Sullon, you cannot buff the other team because it is hardcoded pvp teams.  normally you buff your team to the max, because you never know when you will need some assistance.  also, on SZ; KEI is 100 plat a pop.<br />
<br />
on Prexus KEI is only 20-25 plat a pop.  and there i am an uber twinkie.  if i have KEI, i am overflowing with mana and it takes more time to re-mem spells than it does to buff a person and med to full.<br />
<br />
the part that gets me is that other classes still think STR actually does something other than help against being encumbered and perhaps with blacksmithing.  every melee wants it, and it doesn't do squat.</div></div><hr />

But I was lvl 12. I had to move on from the orc camps eventually.<br />
<br />
I was doing fine, and then I got a pair of skeletons. No problem, they were green, but with my abuh bare fists, it took a bit to kill them. Then that damned cat jumped me.<br />
<br />
Well, I figured it was gonna be a CR. Half health and a yellow con cat beating on me I start limping for the zone, hoping against hope that I'll be able to find myself again. (Didn't know about the /loc command yet. /bonk!)<br />

That was, even to this day, the most fun 15 minutes of my EQ career.<br />

I sometimes buff beggars, always buff people who offer to donate, ALWAYS buff any honest to goodness newbies that I happen accross if I have the time and mana.<br />
<br />
And just for giggles last night...<br />
<br />
Enchater_01 says out of character, &quot;C3 for donations at bazaar zone line.&quot;<br />
You say out of character, &quot;Melee crack for donations right next to the enchanter. Sow/HoS/Nimble/Riotous/Regrowth/Haste the whole package. By the way, I have 200kpp worth of spells to pay for when I hit level 60.&quot;<br />
<br />
...the sound of crickets chirping...<br />
<br />
No big deal, I really didn't expect anything, but 60 seconds later, I zone into PoK and before I EVEN BLOODY REALIZE I've finished zoning:<br />
<br />
RandomNewb_01 tell you, &quot;Could you hook up a hose?&quot;<br />
<br />
I know what he means.<br />
<br />
But I respond, &quot;Yes. I need 200kpp for spells. Can you help me out?&quot;<br />

I've decided that's going to be my response to everyone who isn't a friend or (bless them) trade skiller who's just looking for a free PL session.<br />

I will happily provide CHA buffs for people restocking dots and stuff...and Focus for people doing tradeskills, but no, I am not digging through my book to find a buff that works on your level 14 begging ass.   Sometimes they ask nice and I do, but not often.<br />

What pisses me off is when someone sends a tell for buffs and then ISN'T ANYWHERE NEAR ME.  If you are asking me for a buff you damn well better be in /tar range.</div></div><hr />

Punk kid was in PoK on BB yesterday demanding that someone give his level 9 self 10p for spells, because he couldn't afford them on his own.  Several helpful people suggested places he could hunt to earn the cash.  He said he'd been at it for a whole 2 hours, only came up with a couple of plat, and wouldn't it be better if someone just gave it to him so he'd go away.<br />

To all Shaman with those god incredible buffs (Not STR, lol), charge the beggars. Make a hotkey, ooc what the buff does and how long it lasts and buff the crap out of them.<br />
<br />
One word of advice - payment up front.<br />
<br />
I used to sit in Nexus with my Chanter doing KEI for &quot;donations&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, my stiffed rate was 1 in 8.  My 10pp or less rate was 1 in 8.<br />
<br />
Now I cut to the chase:<br />
<br />
/ooc Selling KEI. Open a trade window for group invite.&quot;<br />
<br />
If I KEI you once and you die that evening before it runs out - come back for free second hit.<br />
<br />
If you put 8 silvers in the window and are a 57 Beastlord - please.<br />
<br />
Sell your buffs, if so and so wanted Avatar, HoS, Regen, Haste and a doggie to boot - should have rolled a Shaman.<br />
<br />
I'm convinced tho - a lot of people are just plain ignorant in game. Have had my dual-wielding Monk (Human) asked for SOW, (most often) as well as other buffs. Heck I had one mental midget ask my DE Enchanter for Sow.</div></div><hr />

Funny about the use of &quot;plz&quot; and &quot;u&quot;.  I was grouped quite some time ago with a DeWd type, who liked using such language.  The cleric refused to heal him after fights unless he used proper English.  They got into quite the debate until he was mobbed by a few wanderers.  He was screaming &quot;heal me now will u plz!&quot; and she kept responding &quot;speak properly&quot;.  This repeated numerous times, all the while with him getting beat on.  She had been sending me tells saying how much she hated those words.  After a bit, she watched as he died.  He returned quickly, as he was a lizzie, and asked &quot;Can u rez me now, plz?&quot; <br />
<br />
LoL  this is great.<br />

I almost never speak properly in game... I am an Ogre... but I hate the garbage speach also.<br />

Most of the time I will buff people that are hunting in the same area to just be social and agreable.  It tends to generate quite a bit of goodwill and if we end up compeating for the same kills things tend to be more reasonable.  I can be quite generous but I expect people to leave me alone if I tell them no.  If I have mana and time I am glad to do it.<br />
<br />
I almost never ask for buffs from anyone outside of the raid context and even when raiding my buff requests are very minimal.  I have yet to buy a single buff in my entire shaman life.  I am a shaman of the God Rallos Zek and I will not reach out my hand in weekness.  I can understand people that do ask for buffs or even purchase them but I am a grumpy old independant cuss and I am just not going to do it.  Hell,  I almost never get a rez either unless it is from a group member / raid member.  I have yet to pay for a rez althow I don't mind paying to get a friend a rez.<br />

The best, best requests :picture this, your in PoK, restocking yourself on Holy cake (sigh) and as you pass the bank you see a green con twinked out the behind warrior..<br />
you finish making your expensive food some food, and sit over by the nexus port, talking to a few friends, before you go level for a bit.. the same warrior stands, not only in front of you, but litteraly on top of you. inspects you 3 or 4 times.. and says 'can u buff me plz im on a cr'...now, normally if someone is on a corpse run, i am more than willing, but i know for a fact he is not on a corpse run, because not 5 min ago i saw him at the bank... soo i say 'hmm, if you can tell me what the heck a plz is, sure thing.' jerk_01 says' plz=please... what did you ebay or something?' at this point i spit my cherry coke on my keyboard, laughing. i say 'd00d! ***, i r more l337 dan j00, ur a noob!' at this point i'm laughing so hard my roomate is over my shoulder wondering whats going on.. and the noob says to me 'dood, jsut buff me plz'.. okay fine.. scale, inner fire, and that all important ultravision. at that point he puts all his armor back on, and hails the cleric standing next to me..<br />
<br />
I mean, lordy, if you are going to ask for buffs, not only do you use correct english, but don't lie... especially when your below level 10 and there is no such thing as a corpse run for you.<br />
hmm, and always.. when your naked, after you died on a long raid. your tired, irate, and ready to kill the next person who bugs you.. noob_02 inspects you, sees your naked, stands in front of you and /shouts can someone buff me plz?! then they hail you...<br />

<br />
This is what they will see when they inspect me prior to asking for buffs.<br />
<br />
You obviously want something. I will give you 3 choices. 1. Inspect Me.   2. Free buffs.   3. Free money/items.  Oh, wait. You inspected me.  I would have Chosen choice 2 or 3.  Hope you liked what you saw.  Have a nice day.<br />
<br />
I also, don't buff anyone who doesnt know proper english(ie.. dood/leet speak).  You can tell when someone doesn't know English very well but are attempting.  I will buff these people with no problem,  because I know they are at least trying.<br />
