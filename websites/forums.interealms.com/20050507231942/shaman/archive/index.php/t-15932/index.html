<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Armageddun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is Spirit call worth the AA?  It would amuse me very much to see a few extra pets spit out of me and go attack the mob, but it would also be nice to get some of the Combat AA's as well. Which would be better to have for soloing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Razco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, i like spirit call for soloing, it comes in handy to release FREE dps every so often. I only have the first level of it. And only Been parsed once on it during a IV fight in Akheva ruins. Heres the parse if it shows up. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brensaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's great for pushing mobs. It's great to sick on the adds. It's great every 15minutes.  I went for the full amount of pets and dont regret it at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Juff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Great when soloing difficult casters - they don't get to channel through the push generated by 4-6 pets often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bugsnatcher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ok, I have a dumb question on this topic, how does this work when you already have a pet summoned? For example if you have the third level of spirit call and you are soloing something and get an add and you want to use spirit call to control the original mob to get the add slowed or whatever, does it summon 3 extra dogs, giving you a total of four or what happens? I've been kind of curious about this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you have the 3rd level of SC, it will summon 5 extra pets in addition to Goner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've seen lots of problems caused by the push from those many pets.  No way to control them once they are out there, except going invis to kill them off.<br />
<br />
OTOH free damage is free damage and in the right situation it can be nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Asraguard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hey Guys/Gals,<br />
<br />
I really enjoy using Spiritcall and don't really find any limitations on it. Mana free damage is always good.<br />
<br />
There is the concern of push but all you do to overcome this is run a circle around the mob as soon as you cast it. That way you get pets all around the mob and you can actually assist in pinning a mob quite well. Of course on a raid with lag to deal with you cannot always do this so you have to use your judgement a bit.<br />
<br />
On Rizlona in Sol Ro Temple we had someone running a parser of all melee damage and I was quite pleasantly surprised to see that my Spiritcall pets pumped out 71DPS for the duration they were up. Stack that on top of n00ks and my DPS for that fight would have been reasonable which is rare for a shammy :) . Also quite funny was that 71DPS on my pets was enough to beat some of the pallys ROFL!<br />
<br />
Cheers,</div></div><hr />

The extra pets arent like regular pets they act like a dot with little dogs attacking the mob<br />
<br />
When you use the aa 3-5 dogs pop out of your chest then attack the mob you summoned them on for 60 secs but you can't control them after they are summoned they will attack anything that attacks you though<br />
<br />
they don't have individual names like the regular pet they just say soandso's pet they dont show up in the pet window either</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Bugsnatcher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">thanks for clearing that up for me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The push the pets generate is good and bad .. and it all really boils down to knowing when to use the aa. <br />
<br />
On a raid the pets can help position a mob and pin it against a wall, or they can slide  the mob down the wall if they're too far one way or the other.<br />
<br />
so while they DO provide some usefullness they can also be annoying in that situation .. and like anything it's the way you use them that counts.<br />
<br />
As far as soloing or goruping goes .. extra free damage is extra free damage and good :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Helter Skelter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Does anyone know what level these AA ability pets are?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Level 58, just like the 61 pet I believe.<br />
<br />
The push they do is the best part of them.  Positioning is a big deal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The proudest moment of my EQ career was when myself and three other shamans &quot;positioned&quot; Auliffe Chaoswind right off the edge of his platform.  :cool: <br />
<br />
Usually we try to equalize the pets around a mob, but I guess it doesn't always happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I keep forgetting to cast the little buggers!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>peleg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I got it and certainly don't regret it by any means.  Its a nice skill, the extra DPS is great, only issue is it seems more of a novelty than anything else.  Apparently not a lot of shaman on Xev have or use it, because every time I do in a group, people say &quot;how'd you get so many pets?!?!&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">this aa is pretty useless on PoP raid, since almost all mob can't corner</div></div><hr />
