<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kraum Ravensbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know you need to hail the 4 stable men in Bazaar.. I hail them and guess what.. nothing.. no text from them whatsoever.. pre patch i know they said something so now its broken and have to wait for it to be fixed unless someone knows which stable guy will buy back which bridle? I have the cheapest one</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Epyx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">As you enter turn left. You will see a guy in the right corner that is the tan bridle guy...I know cause i pawned my tan bridle once before =/<br />
<br />
Even if you guess wrong though I am pretty sure they changed it so that NPCs give items back that are of no use to them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hiklo Amondson: tan horse<br />
Aldo Amondson: brown horse<br />
Wendal Amondson: black horse<br />
Galic Amondson: white horse</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>MagnoMightyMidget</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ok dumb question INCOMMING LETS KILL IT!  How much cash do the horse vendors give back from your original purchase.  I dont plan on selling Mr. Ed yet but if they nerf his mana conservation usefulness he's going straight to the glue factory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">They give back about 85% of what you paid, I believe.  They don't give you raw cash, though.  They give you some bag or item of sorts that you sell to a vendor for the money (remember to buff CHA).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I got 6700 ish and paid like 7.1<br />
<br />
<br />
Not bad for 4 levels of use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>MagnoMightyMidget</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thx, hopefully they don't nerf Mr. Ed further but it's nice to know I'm not stuck with him if they do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Minimum cost for the lowest priced horse is 8400 pp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dredak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I accidentaly clicked on my bridle while at an NPC vendor and I noticed it said he would pay somewhere 'round 8300 for it.  Can you actually sell your horse back to any NPC merchant?  I didn't find out because I don't actually want to get rid of my horse.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Groggog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">No, you can't sell no drop items to NPC vendors, they will tell you 'I am not interested in buying that.' or something similiar.  Lots of no drop items have a value if you click on them in the buy/sell window, that is why you have to hand in the item to the correct vendor and he hands you the bag or such that can be sold.</div></div><hr />
