<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>xano</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">got a Worked Dragonhide Bp in bazaar tonight for 10k. 31ac 3 to all stats and 50hp and 50m. better that Shissar scale imho, that runs for the same price. I have seen this same bp go for 15-20k before and figure as soon as i can get my velious quest bp of any flavor so i can figure i can atleast turn around a resell this when i get mine. Any ideas or anything toss a reply, i burned my last 10k on it and now gotta squeese some pp outta some other areas to get back in good standings for my own security =)<br />

<br />
Also, what level are you, do you have torpor? :)<br />
<br />
If you're 55 or below, or a barb/ogre/cat I'd consider selling that BP for a profit and buying an iksar ceremonial BP - regeneration is better than AC. You'd probably pick up an ikky BP for 4-6k.<br />
<br />
But this is just my opinion, and if you like your new BP too much to sell it, that's cool :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>xano</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">LVL 58 got a fungi and such, epic etc etc. Iksar and all. was wearing a barbed ringmail before when i wakled about, used fungi when in grps or soloing.

There is no better bp to wear pre 60/torpor than a Fungi.</div></div><hr />
