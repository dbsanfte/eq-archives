Ok, where at exactly on these maps are zlandicar?  A loc and which lvl it was on would be really appreciated.  Got stuck down here the other night, need to know where i'm at so I can figure out how to train the entrance :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Inqubus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">approx. -300, -300 on that map.  Basically the dead end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You don't need to train the exit.  You can camp in to the north wall a few times and you'll pop back to the exit, like you do to get through SG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Peh, swim though SG, the waters lovely, and once you learn the route its an absolute doddle, I spend about 4 seconds in the water and even on the rare occasions that I get stunned a couple of times, the horses rarely take more than a bub of hps of me, even when I've had to swim it naked.<br />
<br />
If your really worried, just get a beefy melee to show you the route, once the horses get agroed and trained to the waterfall bit, they take a good 10 minutes to reset so you can just bob around in total safety (I've used this to get a level 10 spotter through in the past).<br />
<br />
As long as your swimming skill is half decent its just as fast if not faster to swim/run through sg than it is to get succored, and its loads fast than camping twice in the north wall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah I've been running through SG for the last year or so.  It was just an example, since everyone and their mom knows the SG camp trick.  If you will notice, the thread was about getting out of zland's lair, not getting through SG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>GeddarRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Trick to SG is to swim ontop of the first 2 horses then dive down to avoid aggro, if 2nd is up you can eat one fish hitting you much easier than 3 if your low on the hp scale.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Aye, sorry for derailing it a bit =)<br />
<br />
And yeah, regarding getting out of zlands lair, if your right at the back and are not agroed on logging in, either load gate or just camp against a northern wall.  As long as your are not too close to the waterfall you'll probably find you only get 2 rats tops on you, anymore and chances are unless your especially beefy, your going to get killed regardless, especially so running through the spiders and beetle trap uninvis.  If you do log in with lots agroed on you, just die and get a summon =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Krytog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">keep a thurg gate potion on ya at all times. My connection crashed shortly before we engaged zlandical and couldn't get back on. it was a pretty intense login since I was setup for raid buffing. I managed to get the rats slowed and off me somewhat while running and doing flips off the wall to confuse them. In battle fury I missed the bloody potion on the first search through my pack. It took a few chloroblasts but I ended up with over a bubble of health still and safely in thurgadin. The lessons to remember is always keep slow and root memmed, keep a fast gate potion rdy if.  :)<br />
<br />
you may be able to get everything rooted to let u sit to mem gate depending where you are. Worst case is you have to beg someone to SC for ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Wait a minute .. this is a shaman board.  Why don't you just gate? =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">One time, I was in blackburrow and fell in some hole when I ran into a tree.  I was kinda stuck down there.  I was level 5 at the time, and I didn't know to buy my gate spell.  I was begging for help in /ooc and /shout and everyone kept making fun of me because I didn't buy gate yet.  No one would help me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">hehe, poor little Colal... :P</div></div><hr />
