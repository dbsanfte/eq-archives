<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kayen85</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Warning: Long... This is targeted at 65 Shaman who do not have access to groups who regularly do Hard LDON aventures.<br />
<br />
I like a good challenge and high risk LDON adventures are fun, exciting and the risk vs reward is just about perfect. Exp is noticeable and loot drops are outstanding for anyone outside of elementally equipped guild.  However, if your server is anything like mine going LFG for a hard ldon adventure is mostly likely only going to result in one thing. Killing green mobs outside the wayfarer camp for a few hours while you wait in vain and log. Obviously this isn't the best approach to doing adventures so after much failure and frustration I developed a pretty sound strategy to winning these high risk adventures using a regular old pickup group that you can start yourself from the LFG list. Would like to add I’m not in a guild and my gear is mostly bazaar bought  (3.8k hp self buffs) so what I am saying can applied to just about anyone. I will also admit you won't win every adventure and but the more you do the easier it gets. <br />
<br />
Step 1: What zone to start in.<br />
If you are just starting out doing high risk adventures the best zone to begin in is East Commonlands. Wide open spaces, low mob density, few unsnareable mobs and mobs do not enrage (excellent shaman loot too). Next in order of increasing difficulty would be Everfrost, Mistmore, Tak and Guk. For the purposes of this guide I will focus on doing east commons adventures since the are the most winnable with a wide variety of groups. *Note all mobs hit ~990 max, mitigate slow slightly. Thus you’re playing in a situation where you do want your group members being hit if they don't have to.<br />
<br />
Step 2: How to make your group.<br />
Now making a high risk group is not as simple as your regular missions where you can toss together any 6 people and win without thinking but is also not so rigid that you will never be able to get the right combo. Now this may sound crazy but you do not need classic crowd control for these adventures. You are a shaman you have the spell root and it works quite well in conjunction with a snarer/malos. Biggest thing to realize is these mobs don’t summon so you can kite or root adds without a problem. Of course you can work with an enchanter but you have to realize your giving up a valuable dps slot (yes some enc can charm but I wouldn't bet on it). I prefer non int casters because they don't die so fast.<br />
Group make up all 65:<br />
1. Shaman<br />
2. Cleric (lots of these around pick one you know is ok)<br />
3. Tank. (Believe it or not your tank doesn't have to be uber any moderately defensively aa'd knight or warrior with 7k + hp will survive on a hard mission however you will need to adjust how much you as a shaman heal per tank)<br />
4. Snarer  Ranger/Necro/SK/Druid (Ranger best for this of course)<br />
5. Feign Death  Monk/SK (If you have a good SK tank you can add any dps here as well as survive without another snarer)<br />
6. Tracker/DPS Bard (Some bards can pull well others don't stand a chance) Ranger / Bst, Rogue ect...<br />
As you can see you have a lot of options as to how to make your group and its often more dependent on the player’s skill then class. <br />
<br />
Step 3: Not all missions are created equal.<br />
Do collects but note what missions give which zones and which drop rates. It is not random. Look for missions that give you the best chance of winning. Some zones are much more challenging. Missions are identical in drop rate on map on normal and hard. Stay away from slaughters no matter how tempting.<br />
Example. Collect 21 Ocular Lenses in EC is a very EASY mission. Collect 20 Orc Studs can be challenging.<br />
<br />
Step 4: How to pull the adventure and handle adds.<br />
Biggest problem with high risk adventures is running out of time cause you have to FD split every single mob and/or your group can not handle adds. To win you have to kill consistently and keep your deaths to a minimum. FD pulling singles an entire mission will often result in the monk/SK needing a lot of res's from failed FD's(talking about average equipped players) and you running out of time. This where you Mr. Shaman come in. Since you will be starting the group you will have to take a lot of responsibility for the win. Take maps like EC/EF where you often will have long stretches of double pulls. Initially instruct your snarer to make sure he gets everything snared as a first priority. Then instruct the rest of the group if they have agro and shouldn't just run away a bit from the snared mob , don't try and tank it. <br />
Single Pulls: For single pulls just pull with malos run back let tank take agro and slow should rarely resist, easy enough. You can scout any pull with the &quot;vision&quot; line of spells.<br />
Double Pulls: Give yourself a lot of room. For doubles, call which mobs will be inc and which one you will root. Root one the other agros towards you let tank engage and slow then quickly slow the rooted one, while this is happening the snarer should get the one you parked snarered so when it breaks it will be easily re rooted. Make sure to keep aggro on the unengaged mob so it doesn’t run and gank any group mates when root breaks. You have  now successfully handled two at a time quickly and efficiently. Another note should be if slow is resisted at any point the mobs should be snared so just back off and let the tank retake aggro often not wise to stand there and take the hits since they can kill you fast. <br />
*What do I do if root is resisted initially on a double pull? Just send the dog in and it takes instant aggro and of course enrages in 0.1 second absorbing probably 20k+ in damage from the two unslowed mobs while you toss a vp on one and slow the other. What if Dog doesn't get to enrage? Let tank engage and quickly VP one. What if VP is resisted, hope the snarer can draw aggro quickly and kite and park it. Key is just making sure everyone knows what to do in each situation. <br />
Triple + pulls: FD puller time. Just wait till two mobs are left on the puller and root one as previously described. No need to try and split to a single cause often mobs are very linked. Once you get the strategies down you can easily handle 3 at a time but it is risky.<br />
<br />
Step 5: What should you as a shaman do to ensure victory. <br />
Patch heal and keep Q on your tank. Mobs hit hard can take even the best tank down quickly if numbers are unlucky. Tnargs is less mana then rebuffing a res'd tank. With the group make up I have described you should have enough dps which will allow you to focus on keeping the tank alive. Course the better the tank and cleric you have the less you have to do in this area.  <br />
<br />
Step 6: What if I loose!<br />
It might happen... But remember if you have all inexperienced high risk players they will in my experience have had a great time and be ready to try again this time 100% ready for what is in front of them. And  if you got any named loot the mission before you can be sure they will want to come back again. You will quickly meet many good players and build a good base for doing these missions without trouble.<br />
<br />
Step 7: What if I win!<br />
Congrats! Please insert 25 cents and play again.<br />
Note, for the harder zones(Tak, Guk) as I stated earlier you need to rely more on FD pulling and real crowd control thus it helps to get the basics down before trying them.<br />
<br />
Hope this might inspire some of you to give these adventures a chance because they are not as scary as they seem and can be extremely rewarding and fun.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nice post =)<br />
<br />
The key is that hard adventures really aren't that hard.  I do them with a regular group, and we don't even have absurd dps, very defense oriented group.  Our warrior 2 boxes the cleric every time, and he's 2-1 while 3 boxing me (stupid work).  Our longest win so far was 75 minutes.  Usually we finish in under an hour.  Group is warrior/cleric, enchanter/rogue (usually 2 boxed as well), shaman, and druid.<br />
<br />
The biggest key I've found is mission type.  Collect anything from 24-27 is the optimal range, you get the best drop rates on these.  I've had 30 collects that require the whole zone to be cleared, and 21's the same.  Those extremes are too risky to be worth it.  A 55 or under slaughter is just about the same # of mobs as a 24-27 collect.  Know your maps and have a good puller (doesn't need FD, our 2 boxing warrior also pulls - incite is awesome).<br />
<br />
Second biggest key is not to rush.  Sometimes in normal's you just want to push through as fast as you can.  Take your time, scout out the mobs and what is going to be incoming for the hard missions.<br />
<br />
<br />
We generally do Everfrost for now, warrior is going for anger 3 augs and I'll take some chain armor while we're at it.<br />
<br />
Best bet is to try it out with some friends you know are competent.  You don't need a perfect group (good enchanter or bard is recommended your first try).  Pretty much any group can win (though you must have a cleric or really good druid to heal), as long as the people are competent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">very very nice post.  I added to your reputation points as well.  Good job!  I learned something from your post also, which doesn't often happen!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Odinson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've just started doing hard missions and found them to also be worth the risk/reward ratio.  My usuals can finish a regular in 40-50 minutes, and have finished 4 out of 5 of our hard attemps getting close to the time limits.  <br />
<br />
One question regarding your description...how can you tell which collections are going to be easier than hard?  I definitely prefer collections, as a good collection can be finished with 30 to 40 kills, and a bad one often by kill 50 to 60, making it on par with a slaughter.  <br />
<br />
Thanks for a wonderful post................................Odinson</div></div><hr />

A lot of what you state is basic but thats the sort of stuff that most people tend to forget to do.<br />
Love the 1 about taking your time.Done my 1st hard the other day and because we as a group normally finish in pretty quick time on normal level we tried to rush hence wipeout then recovery then rush to make up lost time hence another wipeout etc till we eventually failed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Very Nice Post. I just got done with my first try at a ldon hard, a win,  and saw this after. Did an EC with about the same group makeup as you suggested and it did work pretty well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you're doing anything but Everfrost, having an enchanter there to charm can be an insane boost to your chances of winning in time. The following mobs are the charmable mobs. Note that in hard, an enchanter can only charm something that cons BLUE. The reason I say anything but everfrost is the monkeys that are charmable in EF cast spells, and generally cause more trouble than they're worth.<br />
<br />
Rujark - Wolves (Slave Slayers)<br />
Mistmoore - Mummies (Crypt Creepers, usually. Sometimes a different Name)<br />
Everfrost - Holgresh<br />
Takish - The Rock guys that look like stonegrabbers<br />
Guk - Evil Eyes. Make sure you get a non casting one :D<br />
<br />
Make sure you keep the mob malosinia'd at all times, and make sure you're ready to heal the enchanter the second charm breaks. Typically you won't be hasting this pet, because even without haste it cranks out 6-700dps. Between Tash and Malosinia, it has -115MR, which makes charm more or less reliable (at least to last 3+ minutes)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>korask shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I do hard adventures all the time.  I box a paladin cleric and shaman and will usually take 3 dps with.  With the paladin i can root adds (.75 sec cast root) and stun them as long as 12 seconds non stop to buy time for heals.  get into a good grove and go carefully and ldon hard can be a nice reward in points for 45~ mins of killing.   But dont underestimate the mobs.  Ive seen my tank drop in 4 seconds (9k max defensive) and a lot of mobs come hasted, resist a stun or a slow healer, pull agro and thinks can go south REAL fast.  it takes some practice but i'll never do regular Ldon again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hint:  If a mob can NOT be snared, it CAN be charmed.  This at least is true for Ruj, MM, and Guk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>kayen85</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Glad you all enjoyed the post. In regards Odinson's question on how can you tell which adventures will be easier or harder. The answer is experience. The adventure recruiter gives two kinds of collects, specific ones and more general ones. For example in east commonlands there is a collection mission asking for 29 Prayer Idols. It is unique and it will spawn the same exact zone with the same exact drop rate every single time (by the way DON'T do this mission). On the other hand the mission asking you to collect 20 Orc Bone studs can spawn one of three different zones each having if its own drop rate identical every time but you just don't know which of the three its going to be. As you do more and more missions you will begin to remember which give easy zones with good drop rates and which give hard zones ect. For east commonlands you will want to aviod collect 24 missions because they can often spawn the &quot;Arena of Chance&quot; zone which if you have ever tried it on hard is very difficult. However collect 21-23 will always give you a zone that is manageable with any group. As I mentioned in my initial post if you want a guarenteed easy zone start practicing hards in look for the collect 21 Ocular Lenses in EC if your group is patient. <br />
<br />
In regards to charming on Hard missions, here is what I have experienced from having enchanters charm on the missions. With exception of a few very skilled players what I see is once the enchanter gets the pet their entire focus is on keeping the pet and are no longer able to perform crowd control duties effectivly. Which is understandable because having a 990 hitting pet break on you doesnt leave you many options as to what you can do. I found as a shaman and the cleric would as well end up spending all their mana spam healing the enchanter on breaks and often we would loose a tank because we could not allocate any heals to both of them in a lot of situations. If you can work out a sound strategy(and there are a ton) for dealing with charm breaks then I fully agree its amazing tool for winning, really depends on having an experienced enchanter. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If you slow the mob as soon as charm breaks you should take agro and be ok tanking it till it's recharmed. An even safer way might be to have an alert pally that stuns it immediately. Of course if it's hasted you still need to slow it or the paladin dies. Then the chanter should be safe enough to do cc also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>TPFKAFaern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Great post.<br />
<br />
Wanted to add my 3 cents on the Enchanter Charming situation. As one who charms and CC's in NORMAL LDON, if you're expecting your Enchanter to do all of that and keep track of their pet - you're setting yourself up for failure.<br />
<br />
To properly utilize a charming Enchanter you need a snarer and a mind-set change from normal dungeon crawls. The charmed pet IS your DPS and your groups focus must be on the pet and the Enchanter. This is a difficult concept for people to wrap their hands around, but if they can - they will be successful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">don't overlook a bard as your puller for LDON hards.  They can bring both pulling and CC as well as DPS to your group.<br />
<br />
My typical group is bard, shaman, cleric, warrior and any other 2.<br />
<br />
I would second the vote for doing collects.  In typical SOE fashion, if something is broken, you should fix it double good.  We finished a hard collect 30 in 32 minutes the other day (non-EP/VT guild group).  I also agree that doing RUJ is a good place to start.  Generally fairly easy to pull, but beware the super fast runners.   There is one trick RUJ dungeon though, triple the mob density and increased agro radius.  Sucks.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hint:  If a mob can NOT be snared, it CAN be charmed.  This at least is true for Ruj, MM, and Guk.<br />
<br />
Not entirely correct. All pet &quot;models&quot; are immune to changes in their moevement speed(unsnareable and unrootable). Unfortunately not all of the same model share the same level. Some are Level 65 and thus uncharmable. <br />
Only Blue conning pet &quot;models&quot;(See Grizlor's post) can be charmed.<br />
<br />
That said and Enchanter and a Cleric can &quot;duo&quot;(You still need 3 to start one) a hard LDoN due to the heavy DPS and HPs of the charmed pets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">don't overlook a bard as your puller for LDON hards.  They can bring both pulling and CC as well as DPS to your group.<br />
<br />
(<br />
<br />
Honestly, I never pick a Bard(let alone over an Enchanter that's worth 900 DPS). I actually do the pulling since I am expendable. I usually root 2 off before they are at the group. <br />
An Enchanter pet is just insane for those situations when you get a train of 6-8 mobs(only happens on **** ups or if you pull the wrong one though).<br />
Stick the Enchanter pet on the 8 mobs and it will tank mezz them all(As long as there's less than 4 people on the mob's hate lists, you can't pull aggro from it). This will buy you enough time to mezz/root/whatever.<br />
<br />
The most important role of the Shaman in hard LDoNs is getting the pet under control when it breaks. Paladins fill this role even better, though(If they aren't tanking).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Vladigar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Personally, I've have better success rates in hard missions when having a really good bard in the group instead of an enchanter. Int casters just go down too fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Nice post. I would like to echo Henora's post regarding group composition.<br />
<br />
I am closing on 90 High Risk wins with a 90%+ win percentage, and ALL of my high risk groups have had a bard puller. My groups are nearly always built:<br />
<br />
Warrior, Cleric, Shaman, Bard, and two more. The two more should be DPS classes - with snare, damage shield, and evac as desire abilities (although I have done without all of these many times).</div></div><hr />

bard or monk would be the safest. keep in mind pacify doesn't work worth a darn in hard mode so you need someone to split the pulls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The group makeup I won with last night (was first hard attempt for all of us) was:<br />
<br />
Me<br />
Wizard<br />
SK<br />
Druid<br />
Ranger<br />
Cleric<br />
<br />
all 65.<br />
<br />
The wizard/sk and druid/ranger were both being two-boxed. <br />
<br />
We did EC and it was a collect 22 (Small War Banners or something like that)<br />
<br />
We ended up with three rares in the adventure. We got all three rares and all the collects with 12 minutes to spare on the clock. I was getting nervous towards the end. Since it was a first hard run for all of us we were pretty cautious and went in with it being a learning experience for us and not expecting to win. So we took it pretty slow and easy to get the hang of it. We discovered we could handle two at a time, even if one of the two was a rare and in a pinch could take three normal mobs.<br />
<br />
I was using malos on all the mobs then slowing. I did try to use slow without the malos and it seemed to land without a problem on the blue con mobs, however the casters said that they were having an easier time with resists if I did the malos so I continued to malos then slow. <br />
<br />
The sk was the puller. He only did a FD split a few times. Other times he would hit one with snare and run the other one back fast. Would give us time to get the unsnared on under control before the add showed up, we usually root parked the add.<br />
<br />
If you have a group of friends/guildies whatever that you do ldon with a lot and you find that the normal adventures are getting pretty easy for you then go ahead and try a hard. The only bad thing that can happen is you lose. My group of friends I usual go with has been hesitant to try a hard but I am glad we went ahead and tried it. It was a lot more fun than a normal adventure, was challenging, loot was good and the points were more. We will probably continue to do the hard ones even knowing there is a chance we may not win as often as we do on normal (I am about 200 wins/3 losses with my normal group in normal).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">First let me congratulate on an awesome post, I printed it and read it on my way home from work and logged on late and started a Hard adv immediately, using it as a guide.<br />
<br />
bard or monk would be the safest. keep in mind pacify doesn't work worth a darn in hard mode so you need someone to split the pulls.<br />
<br />
How true this quote is, this is the lesson we learned last night, had a dungeon (26 Diggin Shovel Collect in EC) with tightly packed mobs on break, we had a chanter and discovered the hard way Pacify is useless on Hard adv,s ...after the third semi wipe/zone we called it quits and threw the monk in there with a bio orb and blind pulled. Worked a treat to break thru the tight bunches.<br />
<br />
Once we got thru those the rest of the zone was single pullable, we failed with 2-3 items to loot because of the pacify errors (ate up about 30 mins) but we learned so much I am 100% confident next time we do one (tonight?) we will rip thru it in less than an hour.<br />
<br />
Forget pacify, once we did we were killing a mob roughly every 3-4 mins (without a charmed pet), just a shame it took us too long to break in.<br />
<br />
Group makeup was WAR MNK SHM (me) ENC RNG CLR<br />
<br />
BTW The loot...my god...I dont care if I never win a Hard I'll keep doing them simply to farm the named and equip my 1/2 EP flagged guild. We whapped a named in the post failure 30 mins and I won the item http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=43433 replaced my Medal of Deep Thought....wow<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">We've been doing them with:<br />
Sham<br />
SK<br />
Monk<br />
Druid<br />
Rogue<br />
Wiz<br />
<br />
Loving them, finished 3 last night so it's just like busting through 6 normals.  But it's also where I got my Cloak and Neck... hoping for the belt next ;)<br />
<br />
Biggest thing for us is when we pull we do a whole lot of Monk FD and let the SK pet pull (typically kills the pet :/ ) or have the Rogue pull with an arrow when he can see they have split well enough.  As the mob is incoming the first thing cast every time is Malos while the SK snares.  The Druid waits two seconds and starts casting his heal.  Ever notice how the first round a mob gets when it gets to you it deals it's maximum attacks? Taking off 6k damage in one round is just sick... So anyway as the Druid is healing the Sk I'll cast slow and then take over healing so the Druid can deal damage.  A lot of times the agro is so screwy it's more trouble than good getting the Monk back to the group w/o agro, so he just stays out there and let's us finish the mob.<br />
<br />
We have been winning them ... but not by much :) I dont get it either to be honest.  Our monk isnt Godly but he plays well and is more limited by his gear.  <br />
<br />
The biggest thing with Hard missions is that the mobs arent THAT hard after they've been slowed.  They get some good rounds off every now and again but we pray for a caster since they deal damn near no damage over the whole fight (one Q keeps the tank at full health typically)  It's the darned melees that get 6k rounds off that really hurt.  <br />
<br />
Sort of off topic but, just last night we had a bad pull that was pulled to a cross intersection and we were camped in the East wing while the Monk pulled from the West wing.  Monk comes and FD.... mobs start pathing back to the East.  The wrong friggin direction!  So the monk stands up and runs a ways down farther to the West so we figured the mobs would now path back the way they came to the West... well they didnt.  Unfortunately the Wiz wasnt paying attention (still sitting) mobs got too close the second time and WHAM insta ganked the Wiz.  Then the druid tried rooting and WHAM insta ganked him.  So now we have two very pissed off mobs unslowed as of yet and chomping on people.  Pretty short order we were all down to 50%, kiting in a tunnel!  Anyway the rest of us did end up living but there was a lot of kiting and requiring the SK to snare them both.  We were all impressed one more time how I was able to keep people alive given the ARSE heals we get (/prays for GoD to come out with good heals).<br />
<br />
Has anyone else had pathing bugs like that? Where they go the wrong direction from where they were pulled?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Just noticed a few things. You state that in EC hard that the mobs 1. do not enrage and 2. do not summon.<br />
<br />
In the EC adventure I did last night my pet died from enrage and at one time I did get summoned on a root parked mob that had taken some damage.<br />
<br />
I can't swear that the mob that enraged was not a rare ( i can't remember) but I know the one that summoned was not a rare but a normal mob. We root parked a few times but I only remember getting summoned once so perhaps only very few of the mobs will summon?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>kayen85</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I am 100% certain that the only mobs in east commons that enrage are the named mobs. Though if you can provide the name of a normal mob that does enrage in the EC theme I would be quite interested. As for summoning mobs, only the named will do it throughout all LDON themes. So you were probably right in assuming you were fighting a named.<br />

Wanted to add something about bard pullers. The hardfull of bards I've grouped with that can pull hard missions do an exceptional job and beat FD or any other form hands down. For the life of my I am not sure how they seem to get pac to stick but they do. Unforunatly there are just as many that really can't pull if off and just end up dieing a lot. So when picking a puller make sure your bard is confident they can do it. If your lucky enough to know a good bard your in quite good shape and I'd invite him every oppurtunity you can.<br />
<br />
Forgot to add in my initial post what the number one cause of death is on hard missions which I always find quite funny and maybe you all have similar experieces. Players getting too close to the FD puller. I can't even count the amount of unnecessary deaths from the group/person running up behind the FD puller then getting aggro when the monk FD's. It's common sense but it just happens all the time. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Bard pullers are definitely good news on these things.  Good ones that is.  I'm not all that confident that the average bard is all that hot though.  Tough class to play well -- too many decisions to make at once for some people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Zorash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">My normal (and one of my favorites, so far) group for High risk LDoN is :<br />
<br />
Bard<br />
Cleric<br />
Enchanter<br />
Paladin<br />
Ranger<br />
Shaman (me)<br />
<br />
This group looks to be low dps, and it's certainly not a zerg group, but there's plenty of DPS to get the job done (To date we've only lost 1 mission, and that was due to HORRIBLE drop rates...cleared almost the entire zone on a collect 22 /rude SoE). <br />
<br />
People will look at the bard + ench and say you're wasting dps and doubling up on CC.  My comment to that : Yep.  These mobs tripple for 998, mitigate slow, have moderately high resist, and several run.  If you can't lock down the mobs fast, you're going to die...period.<br />
<br />
With this group setup, we had a bad pull (bard always pulls, his lull was resisted and he didn't have room to FM) of 5 mobs.  2 more aggroed and added almost instantly from a nearby hall (one roamer aggroed and brought a friend).  With the dual CC (plus 4 people rooting, and the pally stunning as well as rooting) the mobs all got parked, then mezed and debuffed.  We burned through all 7 without a single death.  That, to me, was pretty amazing.<br />
<br />
With a higher DPS group, if everything goes perfectly, you would finish a little faster (we generally finish in under 50 minutes with this setup, though), but with a group like this, we're darn near impossible to kill.<br />
<br />
There are many, many setups that will work for almost any situation, I just wanted to share the one that works for us. :)<br />
<br />
Oh, and yes, the enchie charms every once in a while ;)<br />
<br />
-Z<br />
<br />
*edit* Oh yeah, and we use the same people almost every time.  It's amazing how much smoother things run when you're with familiar players.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Just a question for experienced LDoNers:<br />
<br />
I consistently run LDoNs with another guy and I 2-box.<br />
<br />
Shammy (Me)<br />
Cleric (Me)<br />
SK<br />
<br />
We do normal collects and slaughters will little difficulty, but obvious we lack some DPS.  We are Pling a Drood for him to 2-box, so we will now have a tracker and a little more DPS.  With just the 3 of us, we usually finish with about 15 minutes left.<br />
<br />
Question:  Does the difficulty of LDoNs increase considerably above 60, and do you think we could do High Risk with any success?<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that the 3 of us with 2 Necros can do High Risk now with ease (Well, the named mobs sometimes cause us a death if it charms our tank).<br />
<br />
Thanks for any input<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Serranex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Bard pullers are best hands down...The way they do it is by mezzing one (so the other comes) then fading to lose aggro on the first. It's crazy how well some bards can split tough rooms with this pulling strategy.<br />
<br />
The key to a hard LDoN group is always going to be the puller. If you have an awesome puller, as long as your group is semi competent, you'll win.<br />
<br />
My favorite LDoN group so far:<br />
<br />
Bard (Puller)<br />
Warrior<br />
Shaman (Me)<br />
Cleric<br />
Enchanter<br />
DPS (I think it was a wiz)<br />
<br />
Anyways, chanter would charm...and when pet breaks, bard would mez. The bard/chanter worked together so well, it was absolutely amazing. Basically the chanter was acting as DPS hehe =)<br />
<br />
But a general make up of:<br />
<br />
Bard<br />
Tank<br />
Slower<br />
Cleric<br />
DPS<br />
DPS<br />
<br />
would win EVERY time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">If you want to improve your chance ,do MM instead of EC.Most of mob in ec are hasted and sowed ,drop rate on collect is pretty poor and some map are very hard (like arena of the chance) .Contrary to MM which is always easy / moderate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Collects are very random, my group had half the orc studs for collect 20 in 10 mins (about 75% od mobs dropped it at first) then we had a dry spell but finished with 40 mins left or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>temuchintehkhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">make friends with a good bard and group with them exclusively in hard missions.  they're the one class that can literally make hard missions play like a normal one.<br />
<br />
as long as they're decently AA'd and can get to the charisma plateau, they'll be able to consistently pull singles if they want... but usually pull 2 nonstop and always have one being put down by the group at any time<br />
<br />
boxing my bard a normal takes 30 min give or take... hard only takes nominally longer just due to dps/hp of mobs 45 min or so.  a good group without a bard is a crapshoot... sometimes it's smooth sometimes it takes almost the entire time to finish<br />
<br />
sounds like a smartass reply but honestly if you're gonna put in the time to do LDON missions to collect points, there's zero reason not to find a bard you can regularly group</div></div><hr />

<br />
Could we get more editorial comments on specific collect mission/zone  difficulty levels?<br />
<br />
I've been through a few high risk that were cakewalks where we got our collects in 40-50 minutes, and others where we were doomed to failure because of the initial entry point having 6 mobs w/ no FD puller &amp; no enchanter (I *think* that was Arena of Chance).<br />
<br />
Collecting this kind of data would be a real asset.  <br />
Example:<br />
24 thingamajigs in suchandsuch beginning in Oasis - easy.<br />
20 orc bone studs  in suchandsuch dungeon beginning in S. Ro - hard.<br />
<br />
If we could spend a week or two collecting this kind of data (&amp; there will be opinion differences I'm sure) would really be beneficial.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Nice post.  I would add my voice to those saying that a good bard turns hard adventures into easy ones.  A good enchanter and a group who knows how to act around a charmed mob makes them completely trivial.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Khang Runningwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I have set up several pick-up Hard missions. My key is class priority.<br />
First off, everyone has to be 65, no question.<br />
I pick a plate class to tank, very much preferred if they have over 7k hps (or else the cleric heals overtime if slow gets resisted or you have multiple pulls).<br />
Bard or Enc (Bard very much preferred for pulling and CC, plus they can do some fair dps).<br />
Cleric, for group and complete heals, druid just can't keep up with the healing efficiency of a Cleric.<br />
And any DPS after that.<br />
This doesn't take into acount Time-equipped characters. I've had a time equipped ranger tank for me in hard easily.<br />
It may take time, and your group mates may get impatient while you set up the group but it very much pays off.<br />
In sticking with these rules, we very rarely have deaths, the pulls are kept to a minimum and things move swiftly.<br />
Some things to note. Mages can mez most mobs in Tak, and necs can do similar things in MM/EF.<br />
And an enc can work wonders with a charmed mob, your DPS goes through the roof with the cost of the charm breaking at bad times.</div></div><hr />
