<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thurvok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Howdy all.. ( I play on Povar btw)<br />
<br />
I have been playing EQ since October of last year. My main character is my dwarf paladin level 58.. Our guild is short of cleric and shamans.. So I started a cleric as my second character now level 20 and rising.. <br />
<br />
My shaman is my 3rd character. He is a barbarian ( what can I say I like kilts ).. hehe.. He is named MacTavish ( Thurvok is my pallies name, but did not want to have too many ID's/passwords to remeber). He is all of level 2 and will be played slowy because a shaman is very different from a paladin or a cleric, and I want to get the pally up to 65 and the cleric to 56 ( for 96% rezz) before I concentrate on the shaman. So the shaman will be played when I want something different..<br />
<br />
1) Do you have a newbie board??<br />
<br />
2) Damn! We get a lot of spells!!!  How do you decide which 8 to mem up as you advance?  How many different spell lists do you keep?..<br />
<br />
All I can gather so far is 1 slot will be for best heal, 1 for best slow spell.. after that I am just not sure.. I would suspect that eventually I would make the following spell lists:  Buff Me List, Buff MT list, Buff other list, Group combat list, Solo combat list ( just in case), Special LDON Combat list...<br />
<br />
3) During fights are you usually doing the &quot;cleric dance&quot;?  I.E. Stand up cast a few spells, sit back down and med.. repeat... Once ya get above level 10 how often and under what cirumstance do you melee?<br />
<br />
4) What level should ya get to before ya start playing around with alchemy??<br />
<br />
 Please keep in mind.. I do not plan to solo ( Once I get to ~ level 6-7).. that is sooo boring to me..  So any wonderful advice you give will be for me in a group setting.. <br />
<br />
My hunting plans for now is up until level 5 just hunt around Halas, at level 6 go to blackburrow until level 15 than Paludin Caverns until ~ level 25.. Then not to sure  maybe HHK..<br />
<br />
Thanks.. Ya got a great board</div></div><hr />

Check out the hunting ground section it's pretty much based every 10 levels or so.<br />
<br />
2) Damn! We get a lot of spells!!!  How do you decide which 8 to mem up as you advance?  How many different spell lists do you keep?.. <br />
<br />
Personally I always keep up heal, slow, and root up on all lists. After that I Have lists set as follows: <br />
Solo Buff- heal,root,slow,sta,agi,focus,haste,pet spell<br />
Solo Battle-heal,root,slow,BoS,Bane,VeliumStrike,Q,Canni<br />
Group Buff- heal,root.slow,FoT7,Group Sta,Group AGi, Group Haste,Bih'Li<br />
Group Battle-heal,root,slow,malo,Bane,Q,Canni,VeliumStrike<br />
<br />
Q is Quinessence a level 65 heal over time. the first one is level 44 and requires LoY.<br />
<br />
3) During fights are you usually doing the &quot;cleric dance&quot;?  I.E. Stand up cast a few spells, sit back down and med.. repeat... Once ya get above level 10 how often and under what cirumstance do you melee? <br />
<br />
Not exactly. In a group, If i am outdoor, I use my mount. Indoor, I usually malo, slow, then either cast bane or nuke. when I hit about 65%, I Q myself and then hit Canni V. Only time I ever melee is when I solo because I can take more damage than my pet usually.<br />
<br />
4) What level should ya get to before ya start playing around with alchemy?? <br />
<br />
You can't even start til 25. I basically do it when I get bored or one of my alts or guildies needs potions. <br />
<br />
 Please keep in mind.. I do not plan to solo ( Once I get to ~ level 6-7).. that is sooo boring to me..  So any wonderful advice you give will be for me in a group setting..  <br />
<br />
Definately get a mount when you get the money it helps alot outdoors. Most zones you will group in at low levels are considered outdoor (HHK,DL,KC) Personally I enjoy soloing as well as grouping especially when I don't have a lot of time to play. Sometimes you'll find yourself sick of leveling in the same places in groups cause people only want to go to certain zones cause of the exp. Alot of the zones they ignore are good exp either solo or in a group (CoM, SoLA, Befallen). When you hit about 10 look at taking groups to befallen til about 20 or so then head to Sol A. It's much nicer that way cause you don't have to deal with all the idiots in Paudal and DSP.</div></div><hr />
