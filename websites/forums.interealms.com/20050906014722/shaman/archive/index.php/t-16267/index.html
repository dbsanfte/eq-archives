First: Always Google (www.google.com) such requests, yield good results.<br />
<br />
Second:  Try BuildPC.net (www.buildpc.net) for starters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Blaand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">its ez, do a lil research on parts etc with a search engine and come back for  trouble shooting if you encounter any problems )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fezik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Pick up a good Motherboard (Abit is great) and the manual will walk you through the whole thing.<br />
<br />
As long as you do some research on parts you should have no problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">www.tomshardware.com has great part research and reviews.  They also have some nice articles for first timers if you dig.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rangolar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Two VERY important things to remember, too.  <br />
When you get ready to assemble your new machine, make sure that you have discharged all static electricity from your body by touching something metallic that is grounded.  If you touch that motherboard and haven't done that, you WILL fry that critter in a second.<br />
Secondly, be sure to install the small plastic &quot;feet&quot; on the motherboard.  They keep the board from touching the case and frying itself.<br />
BELIEVE ME, I found out the hard (and expensive) way.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">One more advise from the &quot;$100 to find&quot; out department - under no circumstances do a &quot;boot check&quot; on your new machine without the heatsink correctly installed.  A modern CPU takes all of 3 sec to let the magic smoke out without a heatsink.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gruog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Building a computer really isn't hard.  Doing it right the first time takes experience and product knowledge.  I do this for a living and I probably build 10+ systems a week, all custom (only kind we do).  I keep up on products and issues by going over websites daily - it does take daily updates to keep up.<br />
<br />
There are alot of websites with information on the basics of building a computer. They are outdated by the time you read them, though.  That, and they ususally are pretty general and really dont help you avoid common mistakes which are dependant on what you buy.<br />
<br />
Now that being said, what do I suggest?<br />
<br />
The hardest part by far is deciding what to buy!  You will do research on the net and be totally overwealmed by the myriad of types, sizes, brands, chipsets, cpu's etc you can buy.  You will also run into 100's of TLA's (three letter acronyms) of tech terms.  How do you sort it all out? Two ways, 1. a trusted friend who, like me, has ALOT of experience and keeps up on everything.  2. Local computer shop. Most small local shops only sell what they can make money on, and when parts fail they lose money.  So most will not sell bad hardware and will give you their opinion on what to get based on your needs and price range (well at least my shop does).  If you buy there you will pay more than online but swapping out parts localy is sooo much faster its not funny. Do you really wanna wait 4 weeks for a new video card to show up? I dont...<br />
<br />
OK so now you have everything ready to go. Now what??  Oh please Gruog, tech god, give us some hints !!<br />
<br />
1. For pete's sake do a POST test of the board, cpu, ram and video before mounting it in the case.  If something isn't right it will be easier to fix and save you time mounting and unmounting parts.<br />
<br />
2. RTFM!!!!!!  (read the f**king manual).  Most good manuals will give you pictures on how to properly install heat sinks, ram, etc.  to avoid the &quot;magic smoke&quot; LOLOLOL. <br />
<br />
3. if something does not seem right, STOP!!  You could end up making scrap out of that $150 part if you do something wrong.  A good example is when a board I fired up make a slight squealing noise. Ya it seemed to work ok, installed windows and all but locked after a couple hours. I knew I should not have mounted the board and ended up swapping it out later anyway...oh well.<br />
<br />
4. Standoffs!  Little spacers, both metal and plastic, between the motherboard and case. Often overlooked, they can short out the board and cause un-healthy bending when connecting parts if not enough are there or in the wrong place. <br />
Well that should be good enough to get ya started. If you do build your own it will be alot of fun and very rewarding !</div></div><hr />

You probably DON'T want to look here for good advice on building your first computer. And most people won't bother. I can recommend you  www.anandtech.com and also www.tomshardware.com. They are must haves for online advice on a wide range of topics having to do with computers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
very sound advice. invest the time, at toms, and learn how all the hardware lines up to other manufacturers. Also get hold of pc building guides from overclocking websites. normally you'll find people there are trying to build computers of higher quality themselves, and have lots of tips that a normally bulk integrator wouldnt know about.<br />
<br />
regardless of what you do, make sure you go slowly, remembering that one bent pin on a connector, on slip of a tool, and your fun is done with.</div></div><hr />
