<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Krol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Simply put, the shaman class is too weak in high-end raiding.<br />
<br />
After reading that first line i'm sure there are people screaming at their computer screen, &quot;You're an idiot!&quot;. That remains to be seen, but the statement is in fact true. Before i explain myself, let me state something. I do not want Shaman healing or damage dealing abilities buffed. I also do not want any of our current skills or spells buffed. After i explain my reasoning, i'll list a few ways to improve Shamans.<br />
<br />
<br />
Turgur's Insects is not an excuse to keep us weak:<br />
<br />
1. For a long time players have considered this spell to be overpowered. In some cases they may have been right, but only if you overlooked the fact that mobs would have been different if the spell never existed. Fights are tuned with this spell in mind.<br />
<br />
2. We aren't the only class that can slow. If you can win a fight with a 75% slow then i'm willing to bet you could also win it with a 70% (enchanter) and a 65% (beastlord). Turgur is obviously better and easier to obtain, but are lack of spells really an issue for endgame guilds and exceptional players? Absolutely not. The addition of Slow Mitigation only amplifies this issue.<br />
<br />
3. Beastlord's are better 'raid plowing' slowers. Most trash mobs a guild kills to reach bosses don't have long lifespans. A 65% slow in these situations is just as beneficial as a 75% slow. Considering the damage capabilities of PoP mobs, a Beastlord is better suited to handle the slows. Their higher hps, defensive skills, and the discipline 'Protective Spirit' (reduces melee damage taken to 1/10th for 12 seconds) give them the clear advantage. This narrows the Almighty Turgur's superiority to named and boss mobs.<br />
<br />
<br />
Our debuffs aren't so needed:<br />
<br />
1. Malo/Malos are only a factor on mobs with extremely high MR. In these cases they would lend a Marginal advantage over the spell 'Mala' (magician) concerning casters ability to land spells (primarily nukes).<br />
<br />
2. On many mobs malos/malo/mala isn't even needed. On occasion i've noticed mages landing malosinia straight up or with the help of Tash only.<br />
<br />
Consider it. If a shaman decided to not debuff a boss, could you still win? Unless you are winning all your fights by the skin of your teeth and have zero skill, then yes. Mala + Tash is enough to get malosinia and 70%/65% slow on a boss (if they aren't immune obviously). Cripple isn't a factor since enchanters have the exact same spell.<br />
<br />
<br />
Buffs don't make up for our shortcomings:<br />
<br />
1. Focus is nice. It's extra health that helps keep ppl alive. Useful? yes. A huge contribution? no.<br />
<br />
2. Stamina is the only stat worth buffing. As we get more and more gear with high stamina values, this spell becomes even less important. Especially when considering the reduced benefits of stamina over 255.<br />
<br />
3. Ferine Avatar. Ah yes, melee love it. However, it's still limited to a handful of players and requires constant rebuffing over short periods of time. Not acceptable. If a buff is going to be limited in use and duration, it needs to be more powerful.<br />
<br />
<br />
Healing and Damage:<br />
<br />
1. Our heals are pathetic. With lucky crits and healing focus our spotheals might save our friends, but we know who is more important in this field. Druids and Clerics put us to shame.<br />
<br />
2. We can deal reasonable damage. Assuming a mob isn't immune to poison and disease, we can lend respectable dps but are extremely limited by the high aggro. I don't think i have to explain our nuking.<br />
<br />
The bottom line is that when shamans are reduced to healing or trying to do damage, we are just taking up space. The raid would be better off with another cleric, wizard, druid, rogue...the list goes on and on.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Shamans are useful, but are we as important and vital as some make us out to be? <br />
<br />
I would like to propose some changes to improve our class concerning high-end gameplay (and maybe even lower levels). 2 new spell lines and 2 new AA skills.<br />
<br />
<br />
Self Buff:<br />
<br />
The addition of bearform was interesting, but it's just too wussy. Given the situations shamans are constantly put in, through raiding and grouping, something better is needed. If this was to be available to lower levels as well, then apparently the benefits could be scaled back or adjusted for balance.<br />
<br />
(Insert cool name here) semi-long lasting, self only buff-<br />
<br />
1. 30 pt hps regen/tick (wouldn't stack with regeneration line)<br />
<br />
2. 10% melee damage received is burdened by mana pool (you get hit for 1000, but lose 900 hps and 100 mana instead. Bosses/named could be exempt)<br />
<br />
3. +30 pr/dr (stacks with tribunal)<br />
<br />
<br />
Curses:<br />
<br />
This has been mentioned numerous times. It could be a great way to balance us and even makes sense concerning roleplay. The actual amount of help these spells would give doesn't need to be massive. I would like to suggest they be unresistable, but not extreme in effect. Also they don't need to last forever. A 1 or 2 minute duration would be balanced enough.<br />
<br />
Curse spells that could...<br />
<br />
1. Cause affliction type spells (dots, debuffs, etc...) to have slightly longer durations on the mob that's cursed<br />
<br />
2. Give a Small chance for the mob to damage itself instead of its' target (with limitations. reduced dmg, capped number of occurences etc...)<br />
<br />
3. Slightly increase re-use time on skills and area effect spells (with limitations. doesn't need to be hours, just a handful of seconds)<br />
<br />
There's much more that could go under this category.<br />
<br />
<br />
Defense oriented AA buff:<br />
<br />
(Insert cool name here) single target buff; lvl 1-3 (5aa, 15aa, 25aa)<br />
<br />
1. Add proc - (lvl 1-3) 100pt/150pt/200pt spell/melee rune; Frequency of proc increases with AA skill lvl<br />
<br />
2. Poison/disease/curse counters removed each tick - (lvl 1-3) 2/4/6 counters<br />
<br />
3. Reduced duration of harmful effects - (lvl 1-3) 10%/25%/50% reduction<br />
<br />
4. Decrease melee damage received - (lvl 1-3) 2%/4%/6% reduction<br />
<br />
5. lvls 2-3 are immune to dispel<br />
<br />
6. 30 min duration; (lvl 1-3) re-use of 30/25/15 mins<br />
<br />
<br />
Offense oriented AA buff:<br />
<br />
(Insert cool name here) single target buff; lvl 1-3 (5aa, 15aa, 25aa)<br />
<br />
1. Add proc - (lvl 1-3) 75pt/100pt/125pt unresistable dd; Frequency of proc increases with AA skill lvl<br />
<br />
2. Add proc - (lvl 1-3) 100pt/150pt/200pt aggro reduction; Frequency of proc increases with AA skill lvl<br />
<br />
3. Add proc - (lvl 1-3) 20pt/35pt/50pt atk tap (3 tick duration); Frequency of proc increases with AA skill lvl<br />
<br />
4. Increase melee damage - (lvl 1-3) 5%/7%/10% increase<br />
<br />
5. lvls 2-3 are immune to dispel<br />
<br />
6. 30 min duration; (lvl 1-3) re-use of 30/25/15 mins<br />
<br />
<br />
These probably aren't perfectly balanced, but i think you get the idea.<br />
<br />
<br />
All of this may prove me crazy, but i believe Shamans are due for some improvements.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
<br />
How many level 65 Beastlords do you have in your guid?  We have 1 and about 8 Shaman.  Enchanters can slow almost as good as us, but every decrease in a mobs DPS saves your guild's cleric's mana.  Additionally, I don't know if you've ever done the emporer in Ssra, but the only way I have ever seen him being slowed is with Shaman's disease slow.  Imagine also a Vex Thal pull, I know one in particular which involves 8 Mezzable mobs and 2 &quot;must-be-tanked&quot; mobs, all of which must be pulled at once, Can you imagine that pull with the 1 Beastlord we have running around slowing mobs, magicians mala'ing, and Enchanters mezzing?  People have a lot of other responsibilities on a raid, slowing is a shaman's.<br />

Have you ever seen a Magician cast Mala on a pull?  They tend to die.  Plus, do you have any idea how often slow is resisted in Vex Thal or Planes of Power Tier 3+ zones without Malo/Mala?  Pretty much everything nowadays has &quot;extremely high MR.&quot;<br />

How is Focus not a huge consideration?  Every buff could be said to be just a little &quot;extra health that helps keep people alive&quot; but it all adds up.   With no shaman buffs, people would lose nearly a thousand hit points each total.<br />

<br />
a few. and let me say i sure appreciate them slowing in situations like RZ plow. i tend to survive more often on gindan splits.<br />
<br />
Enchanters can slow almost as good as us, but every decrease in a mobs DPS saves your guild's cleric's mana.<br />
<br />
5% doesn't make any noticable difference on mobs that live 20 seconds. As for bosses, it's not that critical either. In most cheal chains (which are still used in PoP) they almost never land for full.<br />
<br />
 don't know if you've ever done the emporer in Ssra, but the only way I have ever seen him being slowed is with Shaman's disease slow<br />
<br />
yes because boss mobs that are dis slow only are just all over the place...i mean...yeah...<br />
<br />
even though, any gimp could 2box a sham for just dis slow. you don't actually need a sham main to kill emp, especially with lvl 65s.<br />
<br />
Imagine also a Vex Thal pull, I know one in particular which involves 8 Mezzable mobs and 2 &quot;must-be-tanked&quot; mobs, all of which must be pulled at once, Can you imagine that pull with the 1 Beastlord we have running around slowing mobs, magicians mala'ing, and Enchanters mezzing? People have a lot of other responsibilities on a raid, slowing is a shaman's.<br />
<br />
my point isn't that shamans aren't useful. in a situation like this it would be no problem to have your BST slow the 1-2 eom/pli/zun and let your enc/bard mez the mezzables. ours are quite good at it, actually. they could very easily slow them while mezzed. sham useful in situations like that? sure. needed? not at all.<br />
<br />
Have you ever seen a Magician cast Mala on a pull? They tend to die. Plus, do you have any idea how often slow is resisted in Vex Thal or Planes of Power Tier 3+ zones without Malo/Mala? Pretty much everything nowadays has &quot;extremely high MR.<br />
<br />
only reason mages don't use mala more often is because shamans always do it. again the point isn't that malos is useless, only that if a shaman wasn't present you could get by just fine using mala.<br />
<br />
yes i have a very good idea, since i've been in those zones for quite awhile. i've even landed slows on bosses without waiting for tash or malosinia...i'm fairly sure if i can do that then an enc/bst could slow with mala/sinia + tash.<br />
<br />
and as i said, there have been occasions where mages land sinia without me even having to malos. i think that says something about Mob MR. only certain mobs are That troublesome.<br />
<br />
How is Focus not a huge consideration? Every buff could be said to be just a little &quot;extra health that helps keep people alive&quot; but it all adds up. With no shaman buffs, people would lose nearly a thousand hit points each total. <br />
<br />
Yes, Focus is indeed useful, but not huge. It doesn't make up for our sub-par dmg/healing and non-critical debuffing (in most situations).<br />
<br />
well your math is a bit off. most of our melee and even casters have max or near max stamina without the buff. they gain very little. focus isn't 1k hps last i checked.<br />
<br />
I don't feel like spending the time to get into every point you make, because overall I think the majority of your points are not well thought out. Your idea of what needs to be improved is weak.<br />
<br />
well thought out? if you can't see the things i've posted as having some truth, then you are not a very perceptive shaman. you've bought into the false belief that we are such a necessity.<br />
<br />
as for my ideas to improve, they may not be the best. they might not be exactly what the shaman class needs. however i can't respect your opinion when you only criticize and make no attempts to improve or create new and better ideas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Redspeed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i like your ideas krok, unfortunately i doubt there's any real chance of sony changing us for the better at this point in the game.<br />
<br />
safe bet would be just to tough out these next few months and buy WoW when it comes out.  once other games hit the market people will start to realize how much of a ****ing mess this game is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Krol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">lol yeah i thought WoW was looking nice. i'll be very curious to see what kind of gameplay it has.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Now if we only had more people like Krol, who realize what's wrong with the class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tappion Zek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thought this would be an interesting place for a first post.<br />
<br />
First off i completely agree with the original poster, as a rather new shaman (but not a new player at all, been around since beta) I see it from a fresher perspective.<br />
<br />
Lets start off with the part that erks me most. I'm used to playing a mage, recently a shaman posted a link to an Imp IV pottery item. I'm like hey cool, and later he posts that with the item he was doin 726 damage per nuke with spear of torment, and I was really unimpressed by the lack of bang (which is necessary on pop bosses).<br />
<br />
Then you get into our DOT's, even at the lower levels the poison and disease DOT's pull a freakin ton of agro. I don't even waste time using them at the moment due to that agro, it's easier to just JBB things down while dogdog taunts. Otherwise I'm rooting something every 30 seconds. Add to that the fact that DOT's (especially disease) take way to long to do anything in a group you aren't using them much at all.<br />
<br />
Touching on the slow thing, yes slow is powerful, but it is far from something shamans corner the market with, the recent addition of Sha's Advantage to a vendor for beastlords attest to that.<br />
<br />
Lets see, buffs, I don't waste my time with any buffs at the moment for myself or groups except for talisman/harness, stamina and agility. Perhaps it's due to not having group versions of these spells yet but they are a huge pain in the butt to cast for the benefit. Occasionally I'll regen or haste if needed, but it's normally not necessary unless i'm canni'ing alot and with KEI thats not an issue often.<br />
<br />
Um next, Malo vs Mala, it was said magicians can't cast it due to agro concerns. Bullcrap. It gives no noticiable agro at all and never pulls mobs off whoever they are on at a given time to my mage.<br />
<br />
Lastly I'm gonna touch on the Cripple/Incapacitate line. This one really kinda irked me. I was looking forward to using it, but come to find it doesn't really do anything noticiable. This is one that could really be powerful in PoP but doesn't do anything. Kinda sad.<br />
<br />
In my opinion the heal and nuke difference between us and druids probably shouldn't be where it is unless they want to change up DOT's to work. I also think our debuff lines should be rethought out a bit, and also our buff lines should be looked at.<br />
<br />
I'm not really whining, just my perspective since I've started a shaman, it's a fun class, and the percieved power from the masses is cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I keep disempower up loads when xping, it makes a great taunt if the need arrises =(<br />
<br />
But yeah, other than on mobs with nasty procs, cripple is a waste of mana and agro.  It just doesnt have the same effect on mobs that it does on players at all =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think Hardiman's response is way off target.  Simply pointing to a few anecdotal exceptions (already acknowledged in the original post) does not make a rebuttal.  And it did not even attempt to address the suggestions Krol made.<br />
<br />
I took Krol's argument to be fairly reasonable, and I am intrigued by the recommendations.  It is pretty apparent that Sony is not interested in iproving our slowing abilities - quite the opposite.  So what else would it be reasonable to add to our skill set to make us more valuable thatn (in his example) a 65 BST with 65% slow and significantly higher DPS and survivability?<br />
<br />
Curses such as Krol describes might be something that Sony would see as feasible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">For the most part I agree with the first part of Krol's post.  Shamans are one-dimensional buffers/debuffers.  None of the things we do are essential to a group or raid.  Other classes that can do those things nearly as well as we can bring much more to a group/raid in terms of healing, dps, or both.  Shamans persist because there are lots of us who have built up reputations over the years for doing some neat stuff.<br />
<br />
Part of the problem is the one dimensional thinking that SOE generated during Kunark/Velious/Luclin.  Turgur's was highly powered in these encounters, and the only way to deal with it was slow immunity.<br />
<br />
With PoP, developers began thinking outside the slugfest box, and this has had some pretty negative results for shamans.   Slow mitigation is obvious.  But it is far more than this.  PoP encounters require massive healing over short periods of time to counteract high DPS mobs.  Furthermore, these mobs have low hp and must be killed quickly.  Damage mitigation has moved from debuffing (e.g. slowing) to individual PC AA based attributes (e.g., natural durability, combat stability, innate sta, etc.)<br />
<br />
What this means is that slowing is much less important in PoP, while healing and rapid damage dealing have increased in importance.  Str and dex are still important to max out melee damage, but the effect is probably small over short time periods.  Shamans cannot heal at the PoP level beyond Tier 2.  Shamans cannot damage rapidly.  For these reasons, PoP marginalizes shamans because we have been balanced based on the old pre-PoPslugfest model.<br />
<br />
I'm not so enthusiastic about Krol's fixes.  There are some nuggets of good ideas there, but as they stand, they are probably to radical for SOE.  Furthermore, they are poorly balanced.  And there's no way I'm going to pay 25AA for a level 3 skill.<br />
<br />
But I agree that something must be done to rebalance shamans for PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">While not covering 100% I think Krol has a lot of valid points.<br />
<br />
Our PoP spell line does not have any spectacular spell in it. Sure some are handy, some are even good but nothing game breaking.<br />
<br />
On the other hand the game was changed into a fast DPS fest and that was never our strong point, combine this with the slow mitigation and the relative healing power reduction and you get a class that is handy to have around but not a must.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">An addition to what was said by Krol, but regarding our buffs:<br />
<br />
Why are we the king of buffs, but the best hp buff we get is outshined by a cleric, who's main focus is healing/undead destruction?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">With some additions slow mitigation may be a good thing for shamans.<br />
<br />
To get some plus from slow mitigation let us assume the follow points:<br />
<br />
- slow stacks (multipile slows from different casters as long as the same slow.)<br />
  For example: shaman_01 lands torgor. Shaman_02 casted turgur. Turgur sticks and overwrites torgor. Shaman_03 casts turgur and it sticks too. Shaman_01 casts torgor again but won't hold. The mob_00 would have been slowed by 2x 75% = 150%.<br />
  <br />
- each mobs has a slow cap<br />
  Mob_00 has a slow cap of 75%. Shaman_01 slows mob_00 with turgur by 75%. 75% isn't over slow cap so slow hits full. Now shaman_02 casts turgur too. Mob_00 would have been slowed by 2x 75% = 150% but slow cap is at 75% so the resulting slow is still 75%.<br />
  Mob_01 has a slow cap of 50%. Shaman_01 slows mob_00 with torgor by 65%. 65% is over the slow cap so remaining slow is 50%. Shaman_02 casts turgur and overwrites torgor. 75% is over slow cap. Mob_01 would still only be slowed by 50%.<br />
<br />
These 2 additions and the slow mitigation could resulting into follow cases (I assume that slow mitigations is just [slow] - [xx% mitigation] to keep it simple)<br />
<br />
a) slow cap 75%, 0% mitigation = most current XP mobs. As long as turgur is used nothing new here. But 2 younger shamans can stack torgor to slow the mob by 75%. Or you could try to stack 2x attack of grummus for the same result.<br />
<br />
b) slow cap 0%, xx% mitigation = immune to slow.<br />
<br />
c) slow cap xx%, 100% mitigation = immune to slow.<br />
<br />
d) slow cap 75%, 50% mitigation = boss_mob_01 or more_challening_mob_01. After slow <br />
mitigation turgur is reduced to 25%. To recive the max slow 3 shamans have to stack turgurs or 4 chanters stack forlon deeds.<br />
<br />
e) slow cap 50%, 70% mitigation = uber_mob_01. Well only shamans with turgur can slow this mob. And you need 10 shamans to get him slowed as much as the slow cap allows.<br />
<br />
f) slow cap 50%, 0% mitigation = a_mob_hated_by_all_shamans_01. Any 50%+ slow is good enough to slow this mob. Yes, this is the case when my additions sucks for shamans then even bard slow would be good enough for this mob.<br />
<br />
Case d) and case e) would keep more shamans on a raid busy.<br />
<br />
<br />
Shouldn't be to hard to implement this idea. Focus items handle slow like DoTs and DoTs already stack. Slow is some kind of negative haste and there is a haste cap already in the game.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
To rule the field of slow shamans could get the following AA skills:<br />
<br />
understanding of the spirit: The shaman can &quot;see&quot; the weak points of the the spirit of his foes. With this passive skill the shaman can reduce the slow mitigation by 2% at level 1, 4% at level 2 and 6% at level 3. 3AA points per level.<br />
<br />
empowered slow: A shaman can focus his slow spells. This is a passive skill too. At level 1 the shaman rise the slow cap by 2%, at level 2 by 4% and at level 3 by 6% (to a maximum of <br />
75%).<br />
<br />
penetrating slow: After activating this skill the next slow will be harder to resist. The 1st level costs 2AA and gives bonus of 3% to overcome the resists but it takes 5% longer to cast <br />
and use 5% more mana. Level 2 gives a 7% bonus and the slow takes 10% longer to cast and use 10% more mana for 4AA points. At level 3 (6AA) the shaman recives a 15% bonus but with a 15% penality to casting time and mana usage. Reuse time of the skill is 5 or 10min.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I like Krul's ideas and agree on a lot of the points.  The combination of cain, Heal over time and slow was extremely powerfull luclin and before.  Still is on those mobs.  But will the double penelty in PoP of slow mitigation and mobs hitting so hard that our heals dont keep up we have fallen pretty far.  Do groups still want a shaman ... yes.  Am I still usefull to those groups.  Yes ... the problem is that a bl or chanter would work in my place in most groups and provide other abilitys or much greater dps.<br />
<br />
A curse based line of dots would be nice.  I would really like to see aa abilitiest that increase dot damage without increasing lenght of time.  Also giving dots the chance to crit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Dread</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I agree with Krol's observations on the Shaman class.<br />
I don't agree with his recommended solutions.<br />
<br />
Here is what I propose<br />
Slowing:<br />
1.  Let turgurs scale up to 80% at level 65.<br />
2.  Make more mobs magic immune and give us a slow that is at least 50% that works off another resistance.  Poison is fine.  Don't give poison slows to other classes.  Retune many of the mitigating mobs to MR mobs ( or unslowable by magic but not MR ).<br />
Other:  maybe not both, but 1 of the following 2<br />
3.  Adequate healing.  Give us a quick casting direct heal.  Something like 2k hp heal that takes 3-4 seconds.  It is rediculous that my best heal takes 10 seconds and only heals 1.5 red bubbles on a tank.<br />
4.  More DPS.  Rains have decent dps, but are too situational.  Bigger direct nukes would be much more useful in todays quick encounters.<br />
<br />
Dread<br />
<br />
I have an idea that would address points 1 and 2.  Get rid of that crappy alchemy master BS, and give us an aa that has 5 levels.  Each level cost 2 points, and you could train onces each level 61-65.  Each point would increases our slow% by 1%.  This would allow us to get turgurs to 80% and grummus to 45%.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I think some of you need to really re-think your requests. Always complaing about druids getting better heals than we do. <br />
<br />
I dislike druids as much as the next shammy, hell...probably even more. But one thing I have noticed with PoP has been the cleric in the group going afk more often. Expecting more back-up heals. More groups asking me to be main healer. <br />
<br />
Torpor a mellee and watch the fussing begin. They click it off alot, and you watch as their health drops. Tnarg's is just too expensive to use all the time, and I have plenty of healing aa stacked up. Kragg's is a pain with the casting time. Somehow, people thought it was a good idea to give shaman and druids more heal power. <br />
<br />
Ok..so...we both got it. One more than the other. <br />
<br />
If I had a dollar every time I saw a druid main heal, I could retire. Most druids I know HATE IT. They have to buff, snare, DS, and now main heal as well. They don't get to cast thier (overpowered) nukes at all, and don't see the knee-chopping crit blasts that they like. Face it, offense &gt; defense when it comes to fun. <br />
<br />
Druids got what they deserved when they whined about wanting more heal power, etc. VI gave shaman a break, keeping them WELL below the clerical healing power. Bless them for once. <br />
<br />
Yeah, a bigger heal might be nice when you are soloing, but if your guild groups you alot, or raids often, you are gonna end up healing your group all day. /yawn<br />
<br />
I don't want more heal power. <br />
I don't want more HP buff power. <br />
I don't want more powerful dots. <br />
I don't want a better pet. <br />
All these are good enough to solo to 65 with, and when you can SOLO to the maximum level cap, then you are strong enough. <br />
<br />
I think we DO need some work, though. Just a few things I would consider:<br />
<br />
Snare - No dmg asked, just a freakin snare. <br />
<br />
Stun - No dmg asked, just  freakin stun. <br />
<br />
Mellee ability - Dmg asked here. Gimme double-attack or at least a 250 skill cap on my useable weapon skills. Rabid bear is a bad joke and hastened rabidity is a slap to the face. <br />
<br />
Mana-Transferral - I am group-friendly. I am a mana-machine. Let me share with the just-rezzed cleric. I DON'T want a spell, so I can sit all night feeding wizards on raids. A nice 1-hr refresh single-targetable cannibalization that would take 1924hp from ME and give my target 1200 mana would  be a usefull talent. Like many AA abilities, it would be a life-saver in crucial situations and improve my chances of getting a group, saving a raid or just helping a fellow caster get his 0 mana status up after a rezz or long fight. To avoid PL issues, make this a 60+ ability, making sure that nobody under lvl 59 or 60 could be recieve this benefit. <br />
<br />
Anyone else?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Jarren Icewulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">A Stun dmg spell for us seems like a good idea.<br />
<br />
Snare spell? Even though I would love to have a Snare Spell, I think that would make us too powerful and more unbalanced. Maybe a snare spell thats post lvl 60 that can only be casted on mobs lower than lvl 55 and its highly resisted. *Shrug* If I could snare, I would go back to more Wis/Mana gear vs. AC/HP gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Bozarkia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I don't need another classes special abilities to  make me shine as a shaman.  No snare or stun for me thanks, that's not my job.<br />
<br />
However, we do need some fine tuning.  <br />
<br />
1) slightly better partial ch spell, go with what was proposed and do khuras, 3500 is fine, I just want to heal a support melee through rampage on raids.<br />
<br />
2) some form of aggro reduction.  Our ability to do nice dps is there, just unless the fight is long enough do to overaggroing we're not going to have it.  All of our dots stack don't forget that.  I've been able to maintain up to 5 dots at once on a mob without pulling aggro on long fights, however in short fights I can barely land one, however, if the mob dies fast enough its not needed.<br />
<br />
However, some of the best fast pulling xp groups I've been in lately have been 2 shaman groups, with no cleric or druid.  We can sustain the mana regen to not ever have downtime, while healing,slowing and doing some damage, even if its just puny nuke and pet.<br />
<br />
<br />
Don't underestimate ferrine avatar until you've had it.  I made that mistake, was rather non-plussed when I got it, but now that I have it, I love it.  That's indirect dps for you the shaman.<br />
<br />
The idea of curses is interesting, and completely within the proper roleplay abilities I feel a shaman should get, not sure how exactly I'd implement them tho.  Something unique and not just an upgrade or pawned off ability of another classes debuff.<br />
<br />
Giving melee the ability to proc is already in game, enchanters can do that.<br />
<br />
AA for slows is a great idea, and the best one I've seen yet, those that the poster listed above are reasonable and not to overpowering in my opinon.<br />
<br />
Sharing mana is also another ability I'd like to have.  a group canni would rock =0) where it takes a certain amount of hitpoints from the group in a method similar to divine arbitration and returns a bit of mana to each player in the group.  Ya it would even go the melee, but the melee with the high highhitpoints would essentially mean less actuall hitpoints taken from the casters. So I feel the waste of mana  to the melee would be balanced.  Don't make it overshadow mod rods, and keep the reuse and effectiveness on par with that.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see class balancing including some original ideas, not just to pawn off other classes abilties and call it balancing.<br />
<br />
I'm rather happy as my shaman, I don't have class envy and I dont bitch when another class gets something truley amazing, I use it to my benefit, we are part of a team, what benefits my guildmates benefits me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Bigc Talisman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">The guy with the original post has a ton of gud ideas.

I agree that our AAs sux A$$, VI put either a lotta thought into screwing shaman class over with them or hired some greenhorn to make up a few abilities to give us.  Either way they suck.  ONE single gud AA we have is CANN5.  MGB is nice but almost everyone has that.  <br />
<br />
OK who the hell was whining for the drOOd class, *they have to buff, DS and snae the mob blah blah blah, those poor bastards, snare costs next to nothing, as does DS, and usually if you have a cleric, noone has a drOOd buff, so don't whine for drOOds, i am main healer/buffer/slower/crowdcontrol/haster in MY grps all the time, i do it easy.

Curses unfortunately will run under already implemented abilities, I mean cripple basically already is a curse type ability but doesn't do anything. So what would curses do? Slow? Damage? I guess it could limit how often a mob AE's, but if i remember right paladins got that ability stripped ina  hurry with wake of karana or somethin due to gimping mobs. I dunno though, maybe im missing somethin....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I have this theory:<br />
<br />
Shaman are an enjoyable class purely by accident.<br />
<br />
I suspect we were meant to cast SoW, STR, DEX, AGI, and STA on every member of the party, then CHA as we hauled our riches out Runnyeye.  I believe our class was designed around buffing physical stats in a game that waters them into nothingness.  You can sense the developers expected stats to be huge when you look at early loot -- items with +2 AGI and potions that added 10 STA and STR, but stole 10 DEX less you become too much of a god.  It sounded great on paper, but they shipped a game where stats do almost nothing.   <br />
<br />
Why?<br />
<br />
Gnomes is why.<br />
<br />
Gnome warriors more specifically.  If strength and stamina really made the warrior, why would anyone ever roll a gnome fighter?  They had to make every race viable and weren't up to the challenge of balancing racial stats.  Small races could have been more agile thus mitigate better.  Instead, they watered it down.<br />
<br />
At level 62 we get an AC buff that adds 36.  Sixty-two levels of shaman grinding for a 36AC buff.  What's more embarrassing:  Sixty-two levels of shaman grinding to get a cheesy 36AC buff or having that cheesy buff be way more effective than adding 60 AGI to someone?<br />
<br />
So we took our cannibalization that was meant for giving STA, DEX, and CHA to bozos and we used it for DoT's instead.  We learned to dance with our fungis for a bit more.  We took our anemic puppies and taught them to be rogues.  We slowed dragons and killed them in steady-paced marathons.  That was our happy accident.<br />
<br />
You want to fix shaman?  Fix stats.  But look, the sun is setting and it's much too late in the year to start tearing up the roofing.  I'm an old shaman and I'm finding it harder to care anymore.<br />
<br />
When I join a group, I don't bring stats.  I bring that dance I learned -- my steady paced marathon and things just flow.  We're not the only class that can slow, but we're the best.  Lose a chanter, lose a healer, get an add, someone goes LD, a shaman smooths out all those bumps so quietly no one sees it.<br />
<br />
When I play my monk, I am a victim in a disjointed group.<br />
When I play my shaman, I am the remedy.<br />

If an Enchanter lands a slow.... a shaman slow will reduce that same mob not by 5%, but rather redcude the mobs remaining DPS by another 16.6%<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Cantiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Ok, i will bite and add my thoughts.<br />
<br />
First off I am very displeased with VI for pushing the Shaman more and more towards a solo only class. More often then not I find myself with out anything to do when I log on early saturday morning. Once again people tend to grab an enchanter over a shaman because mobs die so fast in PoP, all you need is good DPS and mana regen for the cleric and your cooking with gas. Horse+Tranquility=massive mana regen. <br />
They gave us more dumb ass DoTs that have stupid long duration and when considering the average lifespan of an engaged mob in PoP most poison DoTs dont even play out. All those DoTs i have in my book equal one thing, solo exps, better known as boredom. <br />
Consider this, in a exp group, some (not all) shaman use malo/malos before they slow, simply to reduce the chance of resists and resisted slow agro. I personally Malos simply because it gives the tank time to gain agro so when I do slow I don't gain agro over him. Now Malos is 5 sec cast time then 2.25 sec refresh then 3 seconds on slow. That a total of 11 seconds(factoring 1 sec extra for the whole sequence) into the fight before I can begin doing anything else to contribute to the fight. Ok I use my best mana/damage nuke Velium Strike which is 7.8 sec cast time to do 925 points of damage. Now, 20 seconds into the fight and the mob is over 50% dead and by the time I land Velium Strike again it will be under 15%. Granted I could use the pet but in the zones I like to exp in (PoFire) the pathing is SOOOO bad that I am not allowed to, per the rest of the group, for fear of adds(We do the first fort along the wall).<br />
<br />
OK, OK, enough complaining on to my thoughts...<br />
<br />
1) Level 65 single target melee buff that works sorta like a bard song. Removes haste cap, adds 250 to ATK adds a 40 point DS that stacks with ALL other DS's. Works like avatar with length and recast time.<br />
<br />
2) a NEW cripple debuff spell that significantly reduces stats on the target.<br />
<br />
3) Up Velium Strike to 1k flat damage.<br />
<br />
4) Give us the AA skill Spell casting Subtelty for agro reduction.(Im tired of dying to slow resist agro)<br />
<br />
My biggest and chief complaint is the melee buffs. I just want a highly desirable melee buff that would give me some form of usefullness outside of debuffing the target.<br />
<br />
PS: I don't have time to reread this as of yet so bare with me (my grammer sucks anyways) I'll go over it later hehehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Gikk the Unholy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Barm, if they mob is slowed one way or the other, why does the original value even matter?<br />
<br />
Anyway... Krol's arguements are all centered on one thing:  shaman aren't absolutely necessary.  News flash:  No class is.  Absolutely no single class is necessary.  Clerics could make the exact same post you did, and outline that virtue is easily replaced by Nine and paladin symbol, enough druids can hold a CH rotation just fine, and paladins can res.  Warriors are nice to have but pallys and sks can tank to, while keeping aggro better and helping to heal themselves.  The list goes on and on.  No one class cannot be replaced... period.  Saying shaman need improvement because we can be replaced doesn't make any sense.<br />
<br />
And just to comment on this....<br />
<br />
&quot;3. Beastlord's are better 'raid plowing' slowers. Most trash mobs a guild kills to reach bosses don't have long lifespans. A 65% slow in these situations is just as beneficial as a 75% slow. Considering the damage capabilities of PoP mobs, a Beastlord is better suited to handle the slows. Their higher hps, defensive skills, and the discipline 'Protective Spirit' (reduces melee damage taken to 1/10th for 12 seconds) give them the clear advantage. This narrows the Almighty Turgur's superiority to named and boss mobs.&quot;<br />
<br />
What a load of ****.  Beastlords can't malo/malos while the pull is incoming, can't torpor themselves before then mob gets there, and can't heal themselves worth a crap if they're in trouble.  Not only is their slow inferior, it also casts more slowly.  It's handy to have another class trying to slow, but to say that they're better at it than us is rediculous.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Apocrathy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I might agree however most shaman i know are missing either Malo or Torpor so we cant do that on incoming either ) <br />
<br />
To define ability of a class it is silly to count all the spells they can have when simply put most dont have them.<br />
<br />
The mini-torpor should scale with lvl if it every emerges.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So when comparing shaman to beastlords, we should assume the beastlord has his lv 65 spells, but the shaman doesn't have lv 60 spells that have been dropping 2 expansions before beastlords were even created?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Krol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">thanks for all the comments. maybe someone with influence is reading, eh? ;)<br />
<br />
I feel the best thing that can be done for shamans is to add something new, different, and useful instead of buffing our current spells. Such as some of the things others and myself have mentioned.<br />
<br />
Anyway... Krol's arguements are all centered on one thing: shaman aren't absolutely necessary. News flash: No class is.<br />
<br />
Not at all. My arguement is that Shamans aren't as useful or powerful as they are perceived. I feel like this has negatively impacted our class to the point where we are unable to contribute to high-end raiding as much as we should.<br />
<br />
Other classes could make similar claims, but this is a shaman board.<br />
<br />
However, several classes are necessary. My topic is about shamans and raiding afterall. You won't get to and through elemental planes without certain classes.<br />
<br />
What a load of ****. Beastlords can't malo/malos while the pull is incoming, can't torpor themselves before then mob gets there, and can't heal themselves worth a crap if they're in trouble. Not only is their slow inferior, it also casts more slowly. It's handy to have another class trying to slow, but to say that they're better at it than us is rediculous.<br />
<br />
This simply isn't true. Remember this is about Bst being better suited for slowing plow mobs (stuff you kill to reach bosses).<br />
<br />
The importance of this particular example is that Turgur's is used as an excuse to claim Shaman's have power. The truth is, it's not that big of a deal.<br />
<br />
1. You don't always need malos to slow trash mobs. Even if you did, you could wait a few seconds until the enc/mag debuffs.<br />
<br />
2. Torpor wouldn't save you from mobs triple/quadding 500-1k anyway. Clerics and druids can heal bst just as well as shamans if they needed.<br />
<br />
3. Their slow being inferior does not matter. 65% is just as beneficial as 75% on these mobs. Their lifespan is measured in seconds, not handful of minutes.<br />
<br />
If their slow does pull aggro, they have better defensive skills, health points, and a discipline that reduces melee damage taken to 1/10th. Shamans can't touch that.<br />
<br />
<br />
When you consider if a shaman is a strong class, slowing should not carry much weight. Our buffs shouldn't carry much weight. Our damage and healing abilities shouldn't count much at all. See where this is going..?<br />
<br />
A few things need to happen. I'd settle for just one actually:<br />
<br />
1. Our buffs need to matter. No, not extra str or dex. No, not a new charisma buff. Something that actually makes a difference. Please refer to the original post for examples.<br />

2. New lines of spells and AA skills that don't slightly improve or mimic what we or other classes already have. We need something fresh and creative. Curses would be an example of this, as explained in the orginal post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Imho VI could fix the majority of these issues with a few easy and really not game altering changes.<br />
<br />
Reinstate khuras mending, I really can't see why this spell was removed at all, its not as efficient as the druid level 58 iCH, its not even a particularly big heal, but it will mean that when we need to start throwing around heals, it won't be so stressful and plain depressing.<br />
<br />
Making raw stats more effective would take a lot of work, something I can't see VI doing full stop, so instead just make our pop stat buffs have skill modifiers, there are plenty of relvant skills that are far from capped for most classes, sta is fine as it is really, its the one truely useful stat these days, however agi would actually be worth casting if it gave a +dodge modifer no?  Replace the str/dex spells with atk/archery already so they actually live up to there names.  /le gasp, suddenly shaman buffs become desirable once again, yet they don't step on anyones toes or trivialise content, suddenly I won't feel cheated when I get one as a parchment 'reward'.<br />
<br />
And the golden one, give us a jolt/boggle style ability already, this alone will give us back our lead in the field of debuffing mobs, without rendering other classes obsolete at it again, and as a side effect, it'll actually allow us to do decent damage the way we are meant to, via dots.  Omgs excess shaman at a raid might be able to do something constructive without endangering themselves or the raid as a whole.<br />
<br />
Anything else is just fluff I don't particularly need/want or just too complex for VI to be bothered to impliment it tbh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">As for me, I like myself as a shaman, we got 1 BL so no clue if they can outshine me, but through sheer knowledge of the game, knowledge of myself, and keeping my gear a step ahead of my guild I tend to be looked toward when things need done.   If they think a raid is impossible and plan not to do it, I log in and say &quot;let's go&quot;... they do.<br />
<br />
<br />
  I just love being able to tank, I love being able to melee (sure it isn't much, but it is more than the JBB at least), and I adore being allowed to pull (rare occurance).<br />
<br />
<br />
  My big problem with the class is my guild has 6 other shamen, and they RARELY do much when I am around.    I just react faster is all, I know what to do and when, and they are learning (quite well however).   I want us to freakin STACK on raids.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
  The idea of curses is great...  but make us pay for it.   make it last 30 seconds or something, and give us a huge variety of them, max DMG debuffer, AE dmg debuffer, additional slow, reverse DS, anything really...  Make it so you have to cast it almost exclusively, enough time to torpor, heal or canni once or twice then you have to cast again.   Or make it take up half our mana pool, or spellgems refresh at the rate of Spirit of Cheetah.... Just make it so there is SOMETHING for all the other sham at a raid to do.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
  Only thing we have along this line now is Avatar.... I love avatar.  I wish I had Primal/Ferine, I wish more in my guild even had normal Avatar.    I wish we had some damn rogues on regularly enough to use it on.    Give us more 6 min duration 3 min recast buffs, at least then you can assign jobs at a raid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's all I need is MORE buffs that last 6 minutes.  Screw that.  Give me more buffs that last 2 hours.  If your Shaman are having problems finding something to do on a Raid methinks you need different Shaman.  We have an awful lot to offer besides sitting around casting 6 minute buffs...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Damage:<br />
<br />
Cut the aggro on dots by 4 fifths.<br />
Cut the mana cost of poison dots by half.<br />
Cut the mana cost of disease dots by 3 quarters.<br />
<br />
This way -  we can use dots, stack them, and it isn't near as big of a deal efficiency wise if they don't complete.<br />
<br />
Healing:<br />
Apparently the Shaman healing schtick has become Torpor - make it useful compared to Druid and Cleric power.<br />
Make Stoicism a lvl 34 spell.<br />
Make Torpor  level 55 and make it vendor sold.<br />
Make Quiessence level 60.<br />
New Quiessence-like spell at 65 with more healing power per tick and more ticks.<br />

Given Sony's timely response to our Kunark problems, I don't expect to see any time devoted to us by the developers before Solusek freezes over.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 And why should they devote developer time? That costs money and we are all going to pay our monthly addict-fee no matter what they do.</div></div><hr />
