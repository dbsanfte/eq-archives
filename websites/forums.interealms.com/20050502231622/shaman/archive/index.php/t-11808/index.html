<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>pibs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Wish there was a newbie section in the Crucible, because this is a dumb question.<br />
<br />
Bear form is driving me crazy.  Trying to kill me too.  <br />
<br />
In bear form there is no movement change for sitting/standing.  So the only way to tell if you are actually sitting and medding is to have your little Action window up and read the tiny tiny print (in my resolution) that says Sit or Stand.  Then you know you are the opposite.<br />
<br />
Too many times since lv 29 (and I'm all of lv 32) I have &quot;medded&quot; only to find I was standing all that time.  Doh. Really hard to explain that particular stupidity to a group.<br />
<br />
So some questions:<br />
<br />
Is there a UI somewhere with a nice big picture of a bear that is either standing or sitting?  LOL That would work I think  :)<br />
<br />
Is there any plan to fix the lv 29 Bear Form graphic?<br />
<br />
Is there hope down the road?  Does the honorable Great Bear actually sit?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Urnti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Bear form never sits...the way I tell is by pressing an arrow key.  If I am sitting I don't move, but if standing I do.  After awhile it becomes so common place I do it when NOT in bear form. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>L33TL355</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I used the arrow keys to determine if I was sitting or standing. I stopped using bear form due to that exact reason. Since I got Stoicism I only sit to mem spells so I started using bear form again. <br />
<br />
20% xp more and I start using FOTGB. Look out Big Black Bear coming your way. <br />
<br />
 I suppose if you edited the action windows you may be able to increase the size of the sit/stand button.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Same thing here. I also spin when I cani dance in bear form. Lets me know when I am siting. Alot of people always ask me why I spin when I cast. I have to explain that its habit from cani in bear form lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have the sit button hotkeyed in my second bank.  I also automatically sit when I cannidance, so I am usually aware if I am sitting or standing,  though with Stoicism I tend not to sit anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mimoza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">hmmm I never sit at all, except for swapping spells...<br />
<br />
canni and torpor = faster mana regen than sitting )<br />
<br />
I guess it's the same with stoicism...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Gahhh!  What do you mean FIX it?  I hope they NEVER change it, I hate the constant sit/stand animation.  It's one of the major reasons I use bearform.  (The constant small movements when you cast a spell are one of the major reasons I &quot;liquidated&quot; my horse after they removed the no-models mode.)<br />
<br />
Put a sit/stand hotkey on your hotkey bank if it bugs you, it's easier to read over there.  Or use the arrow keys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Bear form is so crappy and lame, why would you use it for the uber wis boost?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">for roleplaying reasons alone its fun. I think people these days forget that this is just that , a role playing game. People used to say &quot;m'lady&quot; and such and act the part they were playing , today its about pasring and numbers and what class has more uber stuff then the other. Just take it for what its worth , its fun and it adds a lil wis and regen. Nothing wrong with being hardcore on the number , just dont forget what this game truly is , thats all ;)</div></div><hr />

Will bearform help you with faction?  Such as... hmmm... the animals in JP?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Canni-dancing for 42 seasons and counting.<br />
<br />
Now, assuming a season is roleplay for 1 level, that would make you level 66.  We only get canni 1 at 24 unless my memory serves me poorly (and it does quite often).  I'm all for canni-dancing and encourage everyone to do it but you'll realistically only canni-dance for 34 level until you hit 58 and get canni 4. /shrug Just thought I'd bring it to your attention.  I know I'm being picky so take this post with a grain of salt.  No harm meant =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I always thought seasons meant spell level.  So at level 9 you are 1st season shaman.  /shrug</div></div><hr />

<br />
OK WHATEVER..so I was practicing before I actually GOT canni.  Thats why I can bust a move now. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Dretch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Heh, I had the same problem, but got around it by just making the ~ key my spellbook key.  Have the spell book minimized, and it will be out of your way, but still obvious enough to know when you are sitting or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>pibs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Well I think of all these responses, the one that had the greatest impact was...  &quot;Bears dont sit&quot;<br />
<br />
LOL my impression of shamans are that they are tough and independent and a bit grouchy.  And no Bear is going to sit just to sit.<br />
<br />
So with renewed attitude I carry on.  And fooey on sitting.  Bears dont sit.<br />
<br />
(But I still like the idea of a shammy UI icon with a sitting or standing bear)<br />
<br />
Until that day comes, I will hit my forward key to check, much as I always hit my turn key before casting to make sure the server knows I'm stationary and not interrupted.<br />
<br />
And in RL I'm grouchy, so the bear that doesnt deign to sit is perfect.<br />
<br />
=Pibly</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I have to admit to a bit of embarrassment here.  I was really excited when I got my bear form spell.  I used it over and over during that first level.  And to be honest, though it was cool to look like a bear, even for a cat, the sitting issue annoyed me to no end.  After playing a druid and a ranger to 51st level, I was rather used to sitting to med.  So I haven’t used bear form since then.  I just dinged 48 last night and to be honest I’d forgotten I even had the spell.  I think I’ll try using it again just to see if I can get over that particular annoyance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Guggles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I found one good thing about bearform.  You can climb almost anything.  I went to the top of the spires at the combine outpost in DL.  It was amazing out there.  You can even climb up trees like a bear.  Takes some practice but it's kinda fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Hail,<br />
<br />
Yes, it is rather handy for climbing.  Especially in Western Wastes after taking a detour through one of those chasms. :)  Can't climb out on the sides easily any other way, but bearform let's me get out every time. :)<br />
<br />
I also agree with Weissblau.  I LIKE the fact there is no animation change.  The sit/stand motion back when I did canni-dance was aggravating.  I've grown out of dancing since then, but it was one of the things I really enjoyed about bearform (besides growling), more than the wisdom bonus that's for sure.<br />
<br />
Another fringe benefit to bearform is that you can blame the aggro from a spell you cast instead of from making a newb mistake by sitting in front of the mob to swap out a spell  (especially when indoors and you are accustomed to doing so safely when on horseback outside).   &quot;Grrr, damn slow aggro.&quot;  Yeah, that's what it was.  :p Thank goodness for bearform.  ;)  Nobody is able to say &quot;Frekkels sat down for 2 seconds like an idiot &amp; drew sit-aggro.&quot;  Hehehehh  :D <br />
<br />
Oh, and the big white bear rug is really easy for the rogues to find when you need a CR drag to zoneline.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Fenora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">When I first starting using bear form, the no sitting animation bothered me only because of the wasted couple of seconds for the &quot;you cannot cast..blah blah&quot; message. Like most everyone else here, I've adapted by either hitting a direction key or glancing down at the hot key bank. <br />
<br />
I really don't care about the wis that bear form gives...it's the regen I dig. I'm a regen freak and want every lil bit I can get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">My real gripe with bear form is the loss of racial regen.  Took me forever to figure out why I always seemed to have less mana.  As I was not regening as fast and thus not able to canni as much.  Sat down one day and attually watched to see how much HP I was regening in Bear form then did the same in my normal form Troll.  Low and behold I lost that little extra regen Grrrrrr.  Though I do understand that Great Bear has just tad bit more regen then trolls/Iskar.  SO before then trolls and Lizards be warned that you would do better taking the Wis hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I think bearform should mimic the bears in PoS, when standing still you should rear up on your hind legs :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>pibs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Well older and wiser bear here.  Now lv 52 (was 32 when I posted).<br />
<br />
I thank SOE and all the spirits that bears dont sit.  Because canni would become impossible with up down up down up down.<br />
<br />
I still think a nice UI would be a box with a bear image sitting/standing, because even after all this time, I still cant read the Action box that says whether I'm sitting or standing.  Bad eyesight is NOT on the eq priority list of fixes.<br />
<br />
I'm so very addicted to my bear.  Possibly because I'm barb and bear has ultravision.  I'm blind if not in bear form.<br />
<br />
But also, well bear is me.  Hmph.<br />
<br />
I want the regen, I want the little bit extra mana, I want the vision, and I want to NOT sit/stand/sit for canni.<br />
<br />
LOL and had to laugh about the casters sitting and getting agro.  Its so true.  Bear can mem a spell and get themselves killed in a raid, and no one knows the reason.  Blush with mage have done that, but everyone, absolutely everyone, knew that the mage sat.  Doh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Spite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">For a troll in bear form, you appear to lose the racial slam.   When I click it in bear form, it doesn't appear to do anything.  :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is correct.  You lose slam.  You gain Infravision.  You lose sitting animation.  You gain 10 Wis.  You lose racial regen.  You gain 2 regen.  you gain the ability to look really cool when attacking.  You gain the ability to look DAMN CUTE when swimming.  You are now required to eat dr00d headz whenever they're around (especially @sslings!).  <br />
<br />
You missed something kinda funny.  At one point, the armor you wore showed through bearclothes.  When I wore my Froglok Scale Chestplate, it used to look like my bear was wearing a light blue sweater (I kept that crappy BP longer because of that).</div></div><hr />

Sorry, that was over two years ago, so I don't have any SS's anymore.  But it was funny as hell, from my shoulders to my belly, I was light blue, instead of white.  Some boots would make my visible paws turn black too (but not the Black Fur Boots)</div></div><hr />

Sorry but this is killing me. :)<br />
<br />
If you get canni at lvl 24..<br />
<br />
Canning at lvl 24 = 1 lvl<br />
25 = 2<br />
26 = 3<br />
...<br />
63 = 40<br />
64 = 41<br />
65 = 42<br />
<br />
That is if you still cannidance at lvl 65 LOL :)</div></div><hr />

Hmmm, never tried it this way...  I always shrink first THEN put on Bearclothes.</div></div><hr />
