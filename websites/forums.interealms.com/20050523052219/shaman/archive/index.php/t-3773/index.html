<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi, this isn't a complete player window mod, just instructions on how to see your mana more clearly... the dark blue just doesn't cut it for me.  The following changes will (1) make your mana bar lighter blue, and more importantly, (2) ***add a bubble completion line just like the blue line for your xp***<br />
<br />
For those of you who haven't modified your UI, here're the instructions from scratch.  Others who know how to do it can just alter accordingly.<br />
<br />
(1) In the C:\Program Files\EverQuest\uifiles folder, create a new folder called clearmana (or whatever other name you desire-- keep it simple.  i dunno if it needs to be one word-- make it one word to be safe)<br />
<br />
(2) In the uifiles folder, copy the contents of Default to clearmana.<br />
<br />
(3) Open up EQUI_PlayerWindow.xml ** in your clearmana folder ** with your notepad.<br />
<br />
(4) Look for the line that has: Gauge item = &quot;Player_Mana&quot;<br />
<br />
(5) About 17 lines below this, you will see a FillTint field, followed by values for colors R, B, and G.  Change those values to 90, 90, and 240 accordingly.  This gives you a brighter blue that you can actually see against the black background.<br />
<br />
(6) After that, change the R, B, and G files for the LinesFillTint field-- 240, 240, and 0 accordingly.  This will give you a yellowish minibar that will give you the percent of mana in the current mana bubble.  You can easily see when your mana ticks are with this microscopic view!<br />
<br />
(7) Below that, look for the DrawLinesFill line.  Change false to true, and that will activate your mini mana bubblebar.<br />
<br />
(8) Save and exit, and start Everquest.  Log in.<br />
<br />
(9) Type in /loadskin clearmana (or whatever you called it).<br />
<br />
(10) Loading a new skin will reset your window sizing and positioning, so readjust it the way you like it.  You shouldn't have to do this again.<br />
<br />
You're done!<br />
From this point you can tweak the colors if you like to see even better.  You just need to save the file.  No need to run another loadskin.<br />
<br />
Please let me know what you think :)</div></div><hr />
