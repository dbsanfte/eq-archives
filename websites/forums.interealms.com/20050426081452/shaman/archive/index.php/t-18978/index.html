<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Webber</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I heard necros were soloing the forest, I was just wondering if any 60+ shamans were soloing there too and what tactics they would recomend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have solo'd the entrance area (forest) - it's only worth going there to say &quot;Hey I solo'd in PoM!&quot;<br />
<br />
Bad xp, boring mobs, no loot.  <br />
<br />
I did explore up into the first large room in the castle, mobs were much tougher, a grp was killing in there, and I only poked around for a minute before gating out.<br />
<br />
Perhaps some other shaman have had better luck there, I'll be watching this thread to see if I should go check it out again. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Phatcow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I did this before I hit 60 .. just like Snap said ... not worth it.  I have killed with a group deep inside .. not to bad deep.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Getan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've seen a 65 shaman solo rascals along moat. Its quiet, boring but also has no trains.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I explored there not too long ago with a monk friend of mine.  Seems to be some interesting things here.  Alot of encounters that would be impressive to solo, but yeild little or no reward.<br />
<br />
We duo'ed some named rat in the middle of the garden, took us like 20-30mins to kill him lol.  All he droped was some rare level 55 spells.<br />
<br />
The stuff that i could find lootwise that was worth getting, needed a small raid or atleast a group.  Even then its not very impressive.  <br />
<br />
I plan on trying some of those named solo sometime, just don't have the time lately.  Like others said, it would just be for the sake of saying i did it, as theres little to no reward, that i can see.<br />
<br />
The message board at www.planeofmischief.com(sp?) has some info on the new loot.<br />
<br />
Edit:  I really liked the old one better, i was really looking foward to binding there with my shaman.  If you've been to the old one and want to compare the two, old is much better. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The halflings on the castle wall rarely drop Yaeth's 73R...  That'll get ya Remove Greater Curse which you can scribe or sell for 50k.  'Tis boring, though. ;)<br />
<br />
There are some decent drops further in, but not from anything soloable by your average shaman, I think...  They hit hard, mitigate slow, and summon, which I don't find to be very shaman friendly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Justanote</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hehe, on Karana it's nice and quiet here. Hardly anyone in there. Love to go there and gather research stuff for my ENC.<br />
<br />
The rascals aren't too hard, dogdog tanks, epic, and BoU them down. They hit for about 300+ sometimes.<br />
<br />
Loot wise, mostly research (yes, Yaeth's 73 Rights too), some gems, few pp per mob.<br />
<br />
The named bee, shroom, and skunk summon. The bee mitigates slow (partial), and hits like a crazed mofo, yet to solo her...<br />
<br />
/em hangs head in shame<br />
<br />
Try it out, it can be fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I solo'd the battlements next to the moat. It got old fairly quickly in terms of effort to reward ratio. I only went there because I hadn't been.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rehunh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I went a couple days ago with a 65 BST and 65 ENC friend. Kills were relatively easy although the stuff inside hits a bit harder. All of the yardtrash that was funny named like &quot;a Funky Skunk&quot; and I think &quot;a Invigorating Mushroom&quot; mitigated slow and had a lot more hp. The Chests inside the castle were very magic resistant so don't count on landing a slow very soon. None of the yardtrash seemed to see through invis either though I have heard that the named ones will. EXP was decent I thuoght, not as good as PoV maybe but a lot more entertaining. It is on par with a teir 1 plane though I believe for exp. And lastly and most importantly they moved the zone in to the bottom of GD. Just follow the stream all the way to the south zone wall and click on the mini castle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The only good change they made to PoM was moving it to GD so non HoT-enabled guild players could see it.  However, when they did that, they also removed any reason for anyone to want to go there, other than to say &quot;wow that's a neat looking zone, I wish I could have gone there in the old days before they made it suck.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Da Mighty Akymeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">We take a guild group to PoM regularly - its usually empty. We send a coth mage in to check named mobs and steam in. Some nice 65 mobs further in give decent xp, no rampage, easily done by a 65 group. Loot not too shabby off named, nearly all no drop. Only named see invis.<br />
<br />
Entrance mobs are wusses - easy soloable - get a group up and head in though - much more fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">In addition to 2-boxing up front, I fairly often go back into the &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; area with a group of friends.  The mobs are about lvl63-65 in level, and the exp is nice - about an aa every 90 minutes.  The named back there have some decent stuff, although it's all no drop, so we all have what we want by now.  If there are others in the zone that might use it, we usually coth them down for some free loots anyway. :)<br />
<br />
On another note, does anyone know if the zone-in from NToV still works?  I've had the greatest urge to click it lately, but don't want to annoy my raidmates. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
lol is the little castle still there?  Try clicking from a distance, does it tell you to get close?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yeah, it's still there...  Good idea about clicking from afar.  I'd try that tonight, but 2 of our clerics and our coth mage are out because their cable is down (we definitely have too many important people on one connection...), so I'll have to wait to find out.  :\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>jondolar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">When I did the wall o rascals for page 73(twice)<br />
i ended up with tons of research components and made quite a bit o cash from em that i wasnt expecting. Total farming time was about .... 25 hours and i made about 15k.</div></div><hr />
