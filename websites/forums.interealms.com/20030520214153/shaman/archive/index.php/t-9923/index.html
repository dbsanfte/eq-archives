<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shakor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello Shamans of Norrath,<br />
<br />
I plan to make a shaman when the new expansion comes out.  I have always wanted to be a froggy ever since I saw one for the first time camping my DE mask in guk.  So as you can tell I will be making a Froglok Shaman.  I plan to sell the stuff off my level 36 Rogue, who got his stuff from my level 50 Magician that I decided not to play.  Well to get to the point, I would like to know what equipment to sell/keep/buy.  I plan to keep 1k for spells through the level and hope to twink him not extremly but, rather well in all his slots.  From what I have seen here I should put my points into STA/WIS stamina before wisdom.  And also I have seen I should look for AC/STA/WIS/MANA gear through out my levels.  Also, if you don't mind could I get a few tips for playing my Shaman, I do not want to be like every other twinked charachter that flys through the levels and has no Idea how the heck to play their class.  I thank you for your time.  And I hope to get some good reponses ^_^.<br />

<br />
PS:  Anything I could solo with a 50 Mage with no equipment for some stuff to get shammy items would be a big help too.<br />
<br />
Edit: Changed all the equipment to the correct items, so now thanks for input ^_^.</div></div><hr />

don't know how the froggies will be but the conventional wisdom is Regen&gt;HP&gt;AC&gt;Wisdom.<br />
<br />
Regen is nice after 24 when you get Can 1 and Regen.  An Ikky BP (bout 5-6k on Torvon) is very good, some players use into their 50's.<br />
<br />
At low levels&lt; 24, youre a sad lil tank, with an occasional DOT.<br />
Been a while since I was there (took a year off EQ) but I'd say go for AC &amp; Wis at low, low levels (correct me if I'm wrong).<br />
<br />
The game changes at 34 when you get dogdog.  I'm only at 38 now, but my gear seems pretty good as I'm been twinked 'bout 10k by some rich, high lvl friends, and saved/traded for about 5k on my own.<br />
<br />
I've asked people who know and they say my gear is pretty good for my level see below<br />

Other than that good luck<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Uthgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Looking over your gear I would just transfer 90% over to your shaman. <br />
<br />
- Sell the BP and weapons and try to grab an Iksar breastplate for the regen. <br />
- Pickup a Sarnak battleshield or equivilent<br />
- a fast piercer to keep skill high for epic and maybe drop it into range slot when using a 2hb weapon.<br />
- a good 2hb with a proc<br />
- swap the dex ring for anouther ac6/65 ring.<br />
- Maybe swap current belt for a Chiteneous belt for a little wisdom boost.<br />
<br />
Like the previous poster mentioned regen&gt;HP&gt;AC&gt;wis<br />
<br />
1-23 you wil be melee mostly<br />
24-33 Dotter and Melee<br />
34- A pet doggy :)<br />
45-Get a JBB. <br />
51 + solo machine if you desire it...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Gear tips you have gotten so far are good.<br />
<br />
In general, you can fill slots with Ry'gorr, Totemic, Jaundice Bone (JB).  6/65 rings great.  Get a nice piercer, and 1HB (I never use 2HB because like extra AC of having a shield, but some folks love two-handers).  SBS nice shield basic shield.<br />
<br />
Best play tip can share is to MAX YOUR DEFENSE evert 2-3 levels.  A lot of shaman who either (1) level too fast or (2) group a lot do not max defense because they do not melee enough.  Defense skills=ac points that you will need when you start slowing mobs :)<br />
<br />
Also, as many others will say, Shaman really come into their own when they get their pets, in their 30's.  Be patient, tis worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shakor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the tips,<br />
<br />
Here is the updated Profile (just gonna put the link in again): http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=556871 <br />
<br />
I have moved what I am in the process of selling into the Trader's Sachel.<br />
<br />
And What I have atm in the Hand Made Backpack.  I will try to get a Iksar Breastplate with the money of stuff I am selling.  But, just give me some info on the remaining slots that are still equiped on my rogue, on what I should do with them ^_^.  Sell or to Shammy<br />
<br />
Thank you again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Iksar BP is incredible, in my opinion.  For starting a new shaman it is probably the most useful item you can get.  5-pt per tick regen makes a huge difference for a long time.  My only problem was that my casting skills were weak, because I never needed to heal myself.  :)</div></div><hr />
