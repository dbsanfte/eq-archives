<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jhaelx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Lets say for example you are in a group, you are low on dps but great for healing power, so after you slow your option will be then to do dps. Say the mob is a ldon or a typical exp mob in pop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hrm, no &quot;melee with Tash stick&quot; option in here, but I find that I do that a LOT with the advent of Bane and fear of resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I voted for chain nuking with velium strike, without using malos.  Most of the time in LDoN, mobs just die too fast and are too wimpy to begin with, to justify spending so much time and mana on malos.  I use dots whenever there are multiple targets that are rooted for CC, rather than mezzed.  Most of the time, though, its just easier to nuke.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well it all depends on how people play, but generally on a normal adventure the groups that i am in pull 2+ mobs all the time, to speed things up.  And since i have max AA on critical blast, the most efficient and most dmg spell i can use would be the rain spell.<br />
You also have to figure, any of our dots agro too much, and take too long to really be effective for us anyhow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">it's all situational.  Extremely situational.  And we can adapt to any situation.  <br />
If DPS is what's needed, I would have to know the resists on the mobs.  Are they very susceptible to poison?  If so, I'd use Tears and Torrent for fastest DPS.  If not, I'd chain Velium strike.  Are the mobs high hp or low hp?  If high, DoTs will be handy.  If low, just newk.<br />
Some form of Malo will be needed for maximum effectiveness of our DPS capacity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Scrav</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It all really depends, it varies a lot for me.  In LdoN I just throw a slow on each mob as the mobs don't live long enough to warrant a malo and slow, except for nameds which I usually malo.<br />
<br />
In PoP, I always malo before slowing and in most cases will throw my best poison/curse based DoT.<br />
<br />
If I do or don't have KEI makes a big difference as well to how much dps I will throw at a mob, as well as whether it is an outdoor zone or not (lizard).<br />
<br />
There really isn't just one typical situation for me.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">None of the above. I have to use all my mana to slow (no debuffs) and root park as I'm the only CC. Rest of mana goes to aditional healing and buffs.<br />
<br />
Yes I could do a bit more damage, but the swapping of spell gems makes it to cumbersome. <br />
<br />
My play style is dictaded by our group composition and the level of gear we are in. Unslowed mobs eat too much of our healing mana as does several mobs if they are not parked away from PCs. I expect this to change once we make a group where I'm not CC.<br />
<br />
We have very few NO DROP items in our guild. My magelo is high end equipment in our guild.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>jhaelx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I made it a situation. I said healing power in the group was good enough, to not have to heal. Also I should have specified only one mob. I just basically interested in how different people will do their dps. Also excluding ferine avatar from this as its presumed all melees are done. Also assumption is you have kei and the mobs you cast on are not too fussy over resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I tend to vary how I do my DPS depending on group make-up etc<br />
<br />
I voted the 'malos slow tears torrent' mainly because when I have my choice, I prefer layered rains,I just like playing a chaotic shaman and fury3 crits fairly often, 3 chances of crit per rain as opposed to one for a nuke.<br />
<br />
ie: in Ldon I usually just use AE slow then rains, some of the best fun I've had lately has been in guild groups of 2 shaman 4 melee/hybrids (beat normal ruj 'kill em all' in 35 mins), just pulling 2-5 mobs a go, AE slow and both shaman rain like mad, tossing the odd Q/tnargs here and there, total chaos ;) <br />
<br />
The only real time I switch to nukes is raiding and I can only spare one slot for damage if that, or If we are doing a group where we need to mez stuff for whatever reason, then I'll stick to velium strike.<br />
<br />
Dots i only really use when I solo/duo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Slow --&gt; Tears of Saryrn --&gt; Velium strike in between recasts.<br />
<br />
Malos isn't really needed for LDoN<br />
Sure it makes tears of saryrn less resistable but it takes too much mana and time to be worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ugh, voted long ago and was trying to look at the results.  Just noticed that this poll isn't put together so great :\<br />
<br />
<br />
  The listing once you vote puts them in order by votes, and as a result &quot;no malos but general choice ##&quot; means nothing to me in reflecting on what other people do :*(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>jhaelx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yeah and I can't edit it bleh</div></div><hr />
