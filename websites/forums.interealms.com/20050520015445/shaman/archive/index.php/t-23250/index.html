<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>forlaani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This might be a pretty silly question... but I'd really like to know...<br />
<br />
All the titles that characters get on their names when they hit certain levels...<br />
For instance.... I'm a 57Shaman and I'm Illuminary, Enchanters are Illusionists, so on so on...<br />
<br />
Is there a list of these titles and the progression from one title to another?<br />
Whenever looking at a /who list I see these titles and occasionally not sure what class they are.<br />
I'd appreciate any info/links :)<br />
<br />
Thank you :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thlayli of Xev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">When I didn't have them down, and wasn't sure what they were, I'd take a stab by doing /who lvl class.you.think.they.are.<br />
<br />
So if you do a who all lfg...and a 57 Illuminary comes up and you're like *** is that...<br />
<br />
Hmmm, maybe a shaman?<br />
<br />
/who all 57 shaman makes illuminaries come up! :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hehe i did the same thing Thlayli mentioned til i got them all down. Think i used to confuse the higher sk names and the higher necro names pre60.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks. Yeah, a real heartbreaker. I got Run5, and when SoW wears off in an LDoN (I normally pull), I don't even notice. :( And to think, SoW at level 9 was one of the reasons I picked a Shaman. :(</div></div><hr />

Spirit of Eagle - Self Only?<br />
<br />
My 55 druid has it and casts it on others all the time.<br />
<br />
Is that list saying that it's 60% increase only for the druid who casts it upon themselves, and everyone they cast it on is somewhat slower? Because I don't find that to be the case either, as my entire entourage keeps up with the druid just fine after she casts it on everyone.<br />
<br />
Spirit of Eagle most definitely isn't &quot;Self Only&quot;.<br />
<br />
Just FYI.</div></div><hr />
