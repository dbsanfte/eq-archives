<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>eci_shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all, I apologize for posting this here and not in the tech help area.  However, this board gets viewed so much more, and I figure I have a better chance at someone knowing the answer.<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
At the server select screen, an annoying pop-up window appears stating &quot;You do not have all the expansions downloaded, click yes to begin downloading them.&quot;  If you click yes, it brings you back to the main patcher to download GoD.<br />
<br />
However, I did just buy GoD and now have ALL the files.  (It even says &quot;You have 7 of 7 expansions enabled.&quot; on that scrolly thing.)<br />
<br />
YET, the stupid pop-up keeps coming up.  If I click yes, I go back to the patcher and, of course, nothing is downloaded because I have all the files.  I have made all those &quot;GoDlastview&quot;, &quot;GoDfirstview&quot;, &quot;OoWlastview&quot;, etc. entries in eqclient have a value of &quot;9999999999&quot;.  Additionally, I have done a complete file check just in case.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any suggestions or help in how I can remove this stupid pop-up that is irrelevant now that I have all the expansions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I believe this is a known bug.  I get the same pop up, same situation, have had all expansions loaded and registered for weeks.  Started for me about a week ago.  Just a by product of the last patch (or stealth change, who knows?).  Hopefully it will be corrected with the patch scheduled for tomorrow, June 16.  Sorry, but that's all the help I can give (for what it's worth, I feel your pain). :(<br />

Hey, any input into this matter is appreciated!  At least now I know that I'm not the only one that has this problem anymore.  (The way the GMs and other people in the general chat were talking made me feel like I was the only one to have this problem).</div></div><hr />
