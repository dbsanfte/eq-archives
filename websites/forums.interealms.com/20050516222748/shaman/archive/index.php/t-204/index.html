<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Am I the only one that has noticed no change at all in slow aggro? I've done north ToV, west ToV and several other raids since the disease counter patch, and I have noticed nothing different.<br />
<br />
Is this another &quot;SoW is slower since the patch&quot; type of rumor?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I noticed some aggro change initially but it's either been fixed or it wasn't all that bad to begin with. I finally did TOV the other day, first time since patch, and while there may have been a little more aggro, it was certainly manageable and not a big deal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I actually think it might have been fixed. For the two days following that large patch, it sure seemed that slow was generating massive amounts of aggro: it would take about half the fight for the MOB to be pulled off of me. It seems to be fairly normal now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If your normal way of slowing things have you wait 20 sec after the MT engages, then no, you probably won't notice a difference until you get a mob glued on you. However, since shamans don't really live very long with mobs glued on us, it's difficult to tell if the mob can be easily pulled off. Of course, I'm just speculating.<br />
<br />
Before the patch it's quite possible to slow many mobs in 8 sec flat after the MT engages without agro unless you get a resist, and this is no longer the case.<br />
<br />
Also, on mobs that we can tank and survive for a while, it takes longer for the MT to regain agro. I felt this most keenly in ST, since normally we do it with 10-12 people, and it's neccessary to get slow to stick quickly so we can finish the trip in 2 hours instead of wasting time ressing, medding, buffing etc.<br />
<br />
Haven't really done anything except Luclin mobs since and slow agro aren't really apparent on those. Maybe they got it fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Boogaba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I agree with boinshar.  If you are one of those people that wait until the MT builds up aggro for a good while then you probably will not notice in most situations.<br />
<br />
I am still getting summoned sometimes (not always) when the mob is half dead on raids.  This never happed to me before unless I sit from some reason right after the slow hits.  I usually had malo and slow landed before the MA asked for assist.  This is not possible now unless I want to take a couple of rounds of melee.<br />
<br />
Even our MTs has noticed the aggro change.  There is definately an increase on the higher level raiding scene.  You will not notice it too much in an exp situation. <br />
<br />
Think about spells that have disease counters and compare their aggro to slow now, was definately not like that before.  (anyone think POI and DR debuff's aggro).  Also ask a chanter to tash then slow RIGHT after them as early as he can do it without getting aggro.  Before you would not get aggro because they have pretty much build the same hate.  Now you will get frenzied and the chanter will not be close to getting hit.<br />
<br />
I miss the good ole days when I would slow right after tash was called, sometimes before depending on the chanter's timing and mob's resistance.<br />
<br />
I have also sent messages to a lot of the 60 shaman on my server, they all noticed an aggro increase.<br />
<br />
I hope they realize it is a problem soon,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sithithar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Call me suicidal, but I'm one of those shamans that likes to slow the damn thing as it's running behind the puller back to the camp.  Of course this usually means I get first aggro in the camp, and sometimes that's bad, especially if it resists.  But I like to serve 'em up nice and slow to the melee-ers if at all possible, and that means slowing early.  If there's a double pull, then I consider it all the more important to get them slowed. <br />
<br />
   This is normally not too much of a problem.  I get a bit of aggro, get a heal (often, not always), and the MT gets aggro back pretty quick, since they're hasted and whacking away on the beastie.  <br />
<br />
However, since the patch, I've had to rethink my strategy.   It's been VERY hard for my MTs to get the aggro back from me once I slow, if I slow too early.    So, I've started waiting until a bit longer to slow, which isn't a problem unless there's more than one mob.  I hate it when the second mob starts pummelling the cleric because s/he had to heal right away, or the chanter because there was a resist.  Chanters are kinda stringy, and tend to die too quick to an unslowed ugly.  <br />
  <br />
    I have definitely noticed a difference with slow/aggro.  So have the people I've grouped with.  Ask any cleric that's had to heal a shaman in this situation, and they'll agree it's no rumor.  <br />
<br />
   However, I haven't had the chance to play in the last few days, so it's very possible they've fixed it while I wasn't looking.  : )    Gods, I sure hope so.  I've had SO many rezzes in CT lately, and in most of these cases, it's been just me needing the rez.   Damn my 1005 AC!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">/shrug Hard to say.  Last night I was getting resist after resist on the General in Kithicor trying to get a lucky slow and he pretty much ignored me.  But when I would land one on a lesser DE I'd have him stuck on me for most of the fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jormal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It might have been scaled back a bit. <br />
<br />
Hunting in the graveyard in Chardok today I could slow mobs as soon as it was pulled into the camp and the MA, a 55 war, could usually pull it off me in a few seconds. If I had a resist, it would be stuck on me for quite a while, so I would root it and assuming the root didn't break after a few seconds the tanks could keep aggro off me the entire fight.<br />
<br />
With a 60 SK puller I still can't pull aggro unless I have massive resists. Haven't been back to HoT recently so I can't comment on there.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Munkee Bizness</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">one thing ive been trying the last couple days is rooting it after i get the aggro, a nice long duration root like enstill will hold it off you usually long enough for you to lose the aggro and the tanks to get it back (granted this was in a single group situation, but still it worked thats whats important)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>JenamdarAL</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The increased argo is not a rumor, it is quite real. Ever wonder why tash has insane taunt and malo has next to zero? I'll tell you why, its the poison counters on tash which makes it cure only. By adding disease counters to slow, they added that same taunt into the slow lines. I don't have a problem with this really, turgurs is effective enough that it merits some risk to the caster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It's even worse when you get resists.<br />
<br />
In a full group in Akheva Ruins, pulling in the front area (centi dators mostly).  The main assist would build agro for 15-20 seconds, then I'd cast slow.  If slow stuck, I was fine.  If I got a resist (15-20% of the time), I'd wait 10 seconds and cast again.  No matter what, guaranteed, it was on me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Answered in another thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It's real, and it can hurt. Pulling a half dead mob onto yourself with 1 cast is a big change in some situations.<br />
I can live with it if this is what they really envisioned for us, but I'd like a solid answer from VI if this is what they really meant to happen. Anyone know where the best place to bring this to their attention would be? At least get it out in the open.<br />
 <br />
On a side note, anyone really seen any MAJOR improvements from this change? Since it went live, I have cured 1 slowed person in a raid situation. (can't remember which ae).<br />
<br />
They went back and changed the only mobs this would directly affect and made them immune to speed changes, so that doesn't help either.</div></div><hr />

Aggro in CT is whacked, thats for sure.<br />
<br />
The only thing I can do to get aggro off me in CT  is to root the mob after slowing. One thing about CT is the mobs seem to shake off any form of root very quickly.<br />
<br />
Once root wears off I usually get summoned immediately.<br />
<br />
I'm curious if this exaggerated aggro in CT is intentional or a 'feature'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">In CT if you dont want slow aggro you gotta wait a while to slow it, otherwise you will be tanking most of the fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>sharden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Well its one thing to increase agro on slows, but why then nerf our channeling alt skills at the same time?   <br />
       <br />
     Lets see,  the shaman are going to be beat on more for slowing...  I know! lets remove their ability to channel thru the mob hits!<br />
    <br />
     Seems to me some poor thought was put into these changes, or perhaps its as we suspect and Verant doesn't play-test Shaman or only play level 10 ones!<br />
  <br />
  These changes have been noticed on guild high-end runs since either more tanks die because we have to delay more on slowing, or the guild wipes out because the debuffers all die trying to get the mob slowed.........</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ulthaun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">ive noticed a difference in the agro caused by slow recently....and so has another shaman in my guild i was talking to about it<br />
<br />
<br />
dunno if its just me being paranoid but when i was in the crypt in seb earlier i decided to test it out and waited until a mob was at 40% life before slowing, i got summoned straight away and the warrior never got agro back<br />
<br />
most mobs were taking until they were at abour 30% life before changing agro from me<br />
<br />
now i dunno if i was just having a bad night or something but this just seems wrong =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Contrary to what some people in this thread implied, I don't wait 20 seconds before slowing. I often pull with slow in exp groups. On raids like Ssra or the Deep I pull with slow as well. In ToV I wait for Tash to land before I slow. I still don't have a problem with getting aggro off me.<br />
<br />
Cazic has its own situation with spell taunts. Root solves it mostly. I pull with slow in Cazic. The biggest reason that I've seen for root breaking fast in Cazic is proccing DD weapons. It was particularly bad when I was there with a warrior friend using Kreizenn's Flame (12/17 with dd proc) in main hand. If your melee aren't using fast proccing weapons, root does wonders for maintaing aggro on the tank in Cazic. Another big problem with root there is wizards with Rend robe or Velk robe chain nuking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Ogrym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">It has absolutely NOT been fixed in any way.  Last night i was in kael arena with a group doing giants, and one slow would keep aggro on me throughout the ENTIRE fight.  I had to keep the mob rooted just to keep aggro off me.  If it was as summoning giant....well i got summoned ALOT.  I think i tanked most everything last night, cleric was healing me MUCH more than the main tank.  In fact the melee's got used to it in that they'd all stand behind the giant while it was banging on me.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah, this is caster balance allright.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>sharden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I have noticed a slight.... and its slight relaxing of the agro generated by slows.  This occured 2 days ago.  It makes me wonder if Verant has stealthly backed some of the agro off.   Which irritates me if they did,  why can't they be honest about these changes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gorilla Troll Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I've noticed no more aggro then before.  However, I will say that in CT, debuffs seem to generate more aggro then they do elsewhere.  I've been hunting in Seb, Chardok, FG, HoT, NToV, GD (10th ring war), etc. and noticed no increase in aggro beyond what I had expected.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Traktur Traylur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Mobs in Ssra were certainly agro'ing harder upon being slowed. Haven't tried ToV or Kael since patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Tailen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Well, this explains it!  I thought I was getting rusty.  I've been soloing and duoing the past couple months, till the other night I went and got a group in DL again.  I kept drawing agro even though I was waiting on slows.  I've never had any trouble with that before.  The really sick thing about it is I was using Walking Sleep (lvl 14 if you forget, its the best mana efficency as PH in DL)!!!  I dread to think how this could effect lower levels.  With the kind of aggro it generated for me, and the damage my group was doing, and shaman who casts this when its thier best slow is bound to keep agro the entire fight!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Murphy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">If this  increased aggro is going to remain, this will be every raiding Shaman's new dream weapon.<br />
