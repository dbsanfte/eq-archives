<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gallaena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What is a decent to good upgrade for a video card? I do not want to spend more than $100-$130.<br />
<br />
Currently, I'm using a Geforce 2 with 32 mb onboard and it's laggy. Running it on an XP system.<br />
<br />
Configuration:<br />
  1.3 GHz<br />
  256 MB RAM<br />
  WinXP<br />
<br />
TIA<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thantu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">AGP or PCI?  You could do a Radeon 8500 LE for around $90, then use the rest of the money to spring for another 256 Megs of Ram.  Upgrading both areas at once ought to help considerably.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i have a geforce 2 ti450 and its got 64m of ram on it and i have 0 problems with lag. you never mentioned how much ram you ahve but thantu is right, ram is the key here. you could use a better video card and it would improve performace, but my fiance and i ahve the same video card and his system runs faster (tho mine is no where enar laggy, even in bazaar) because he has more ram than i do and a little faster processor. i can even run other processes with no problems with EQW. i personally am not a big radeon (its possible i'm nuts but i dont think they use nvidia right?) fan myself, i've had great luck with the nvidia chipsets. nvidia also has great support, they seme to release updates very frequently. <br />

i'm running windows 2k, 1ghz p3 processor, 512M ram, btw</div></div><hr />
