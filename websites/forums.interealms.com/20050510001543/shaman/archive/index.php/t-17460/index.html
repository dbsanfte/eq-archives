<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vixy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I recently finished the Crown of Deceit quest (casts wood elf illusion) and I must say, I've been having quite a bit of fun with it.<br />
<br />
I like to buff and suspend my doggie, throw on a ds potion, lev, and run down into the arena on /role.  Hehehe.  (I use the hammer from sol ro, that procs a 302 fire based nuke).<br />
<br />
Without fail, they think I'm a druid.  In fact, I got a warrior down to 14% life by sheer DS, before he sent me a tell &quot;you're a shaman!&quot; and then, &quot;Shamans don't get ds!&quot;.  I was like, we make ds potions, suckah!  (I truly think people forget we can make these)<br />
<br />
I also had three, then four people jump me at once, and still managed to fight them all off (two died before the rest fled).  Hehehehehhe!<br />
<br />
And as to why, because I was bored.  The only time I had to run was when five jumped me at once.  I couldn't cast for interupts, or I'd have owned them too.<br />
<br />
Anyhoo.. If you have this quest, post other ideas for me to have fun with.  I'm a born prankster!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Usually much easier to make illusion potions if you're not planning on using WE full time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd get it purely to run through PoK unmolested.  You could always pull the ol parrying-dagger-in-offhand routine and get a group as a ranger.<br />
<br />
Now I've half a mind to blow through some illusion potions and play dressup - see how many classes I can convincingly look like.  (without armor dyes, of course that's cheating)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Pumyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">With some illusion potions you can do quite a few convincing ones, some you can't really pull off in groups though.<br />
<br />
Ranger and Rogue are no challenge as you can use a parrying dagger in offhand and loads of options for main. As fellow chain classes they are too easy.<br />
<br />
If you have a Vindi BP then application of some Jbone or Crystal Chitin makes convincing plate so it is easy to impersonate Warrior/SK/Paladin with many of the 2h Blunt options or shield and 1h blunt.<br />
<br />
With the right staff (waterwalker iirc), fungi and gator legs monk is simple.<br />
<br />
Casters take a little more thought and some careful model usage, but with the nightie from Shar Vahl and a Stein and book combo int caster mode is doable.</div></div><hr />

Not really has an Iksar I would use that +6 wis book in prim, Orb of the infanit void, and Shainai's nightie or Prophet's Robe. Looked just like a necro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I remember an enchanter trying to group with others posing as a bard, ranger and whatever and try to break his record in how long he could pretend being another class without anyone noticing :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've killed people just using spear of torment and blood of saryrn (both sound like necro spells) while I had skeleton illusion up (from AoN).  Usually they never catch on that I am a not a necro.  It is also nice when running through pok b/c even though I'm wielding priest only stuff, most people just see skeleton and think &quot;necro&quot; and I don't get bothered.</div></div><hr />
