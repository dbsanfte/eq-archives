<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gojirax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, it’s time to talk about buffs.<br />
<br />
With only 5 concentration slots, what buffs do you guys run at level 20?<br />
<br />
I wish I could use Auspice, but with Bull, Ursine Elder, Spiritual Seal and Badger I’m outta slots! (Well, I have one slot, but Auspice takes two slots and only covers on person!)<br />
<br />
I’ll sometimes take down Badger and put up Auspice on our Guardian if I think she needs the extra hps.<br />
<br />
How much difference has Spirit of Bull or Badger seemed to make for you guys?<br />
<br />
I’ve gotten rid of Courage altogether since it’s a low level buff, but I’m finding myself missing the hit points it provided.<br />
<br />
We group with a 17 Cleric a lot too. Are there any buffs that we have that won’t stack with theirs? She seems to have Symbol of Transal up without blocking me.<br />
<br />
Anyway.<br />
<br />
What’s your Solo and Group buff set looking like these days?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Courage is still awesome!  I haven't used Auspice in a group since I could use bear form, it's really not a good spell.  If it were one concentration point then *maybe* it would be worthwhile, or for two points make it group.<br />
<br />
I keep bear, seal, badger, bull, and courage up if I'm soloing or grouping.  If I'm doing tradeskills then I drop bull and seal (I think those are the two, whichever ones don't give power - I forget) for auspice.<br />
<br />
That's my setup at level 22 at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gojirax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The nice thing is when I'm grouping with my Scout friend and his Shaman wife. I let her keep courage and Spiritual Seal up and I do Auspice/Bull/Badger/Bear.<br />
<br />
I asked our Melee's if they noticed increased damage output with Badger, but they haven't noticed.<br />
<br />
Also, I hear Bear form offers some benefits for the group, and not just the Mystic.. is there any truth to this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm selfish and use the best combination that gives me the most HP. Currently, that's Spiritual Seal, Spirit of the Bull, Ursine Eldar, and Auspice. :)<br />
<br />
-Tok</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">In a group situation it all depends on what the group consists of.<br />
<br />
My 3 &quot;every time&quot; buffs are Spiritual Seal, Spirit of the Bull, Spirit of the Badger.<br />
<br />
Now, if there is another Priest in the group, I let them run Courage and I run Auspice the MT.  With no additional Priest, I will run Courage.<br />
<br />
I rarely use Ursine in a group situation, it's a fairly annoying thing for the other members to deal with, especially in tight dungeons.  It doesn't really bring me any great benefits either (in that situation) since I shouldn't be getting hit or doing any hitting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Courgage, Spiritual Seal, Boar, Badger, Bear.<br />
<br />
If another priest is in the group and is casting courage, I'll drop bear and go with Auspice on the main tank.<br />
<br />
I upgraded Badger to adept 3 from adept 1, and I noticed it gave 74 more ac and more sta, so it's still a fairly useful spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>serp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">At the end of beta they removed our self-only buff and made it so that courage gave us more benefits than everyone else.  I imagine this is only if you are the one that cast it.  I don't know if it's still that way or not.  I haven't thought to check until I read this thread.<br />
<br />
If you don't like the bear form or are concerned about taking up a lot of space you can cast your hawk form spell first and then bear form and you will stay in hawk form but have the benefits of bear form.<br />
<br />
I don't use auspice either.  The 2 concentration is just too much for the small benefit it gives to 1 party member.</div></div><hr />
