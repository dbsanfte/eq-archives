<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hiladin22</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know and read thousands of times to only use the 49 pet..recently ive been hearing mages saying '' bla bla bla we've done it w/ the 55-56 decoy fire pet, he has bigger dmg shield and more hps''.. im also having a hard time finding mages w/ the 49 fire pets spell...alot of mages seem to skip that 1 becasue they are lazy and dont wanna research it..so question is: can the higher lvl melee fire pet (55-56) pets do this job and if not..why? id really like to know why people choose the 49 fire pet over the higher lvl melee fire pet..any answers will be greatly appreciated</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The 56 pet can do the job. It actually takes longer than if you use the 49 fire. That is why the 49 is preferable - people get bored enough watching the 49 fire take down Rak, and it would be even worse with DDD.<br />
<br />
Also, it is easier to find mages to help you if you aren't eliminating level 49-55 mages from the available pool.</div></div><hr />
