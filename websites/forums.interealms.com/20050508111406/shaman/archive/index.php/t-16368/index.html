<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hargin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Last night, we all died with 10 minutes left in the adventure. As a result, we all quit the adventure so we wouldn't have to wait the 5 days to do it over.  It seems the corpse pops took FOREVER.  At 3 AM, this wasn't much appreciated... in between nodding out and our bodies appearing outside it was very long... so much so the cleric gave up and left.  We had to eat the exp loss.  ANy way to avoid this, yet not lost the quest for 5 days?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The 5 days only applies to raids as far as I know, not quests. You can do quest after quest after quest and not succeed on a single one of them if you want.<br />
<br />
Regarding the corpse pop time, they remain in the zone for 30 minutes after the adventure succeeds, fails or is abandoned. The zone itself is also still there so even though you quit the adventure, the zone remained. You could have just gone back in, walked to your corpses, rezzed and walked back out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Azzi makes an important point. Because of the way LDoN works, no mobs respawn. The path to your corpses would be 100% clear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yeah... but what about when there is no rezzer in your party?<br />
<br />
Happened to us tonight. Went in with some friends and one person ran ahead, got 4 mobs on her, chanter went down because of resists and ranger followed. Wizard managed to succor the rest of us.<br />
<br />
I log on my friends account since he's a clicker and run to the zone in. We waited over an hour for the corpses to pop outside. <br />
<br />
They need to make it so that corpses pop outside within a short time afte everyone leaves the adventure. This way if you wipe and have no rezzer you can all decide to quit the adventure and not have to wait long for corpses to pop outside.</div></div><hr />

the way i have understood it is, when your 90 mins for the task is up.. AND your 30 minutes free time is up, dungeon closes, corpses pop outside.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well from my experience tonight it sounds like your right. Very very bad design in the way it works. :mad:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Once we quit the adventure it didn't let us back in. I forget the message.. zone may have been there but it basically told us we weren't in an adventure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Lumor2000</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">When we had an unfortunate set of &quot;box deaths&quot; without a rezzer in the group, we just zoned back in, started where we left off and worried about getting a rez after we were done.  As far as I know there is no way to pop your corpse out prior to the 2 hours going by.  It seems a sensible change to let the instance end when everyone has quit the aventure, because it really isnt fun to sit on your butt for up to 2 hours waiting for your corpse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tiorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Log your character out of eq and log back in<br />
<br />
your bodies should be outside<br />
<br />
worked for me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Run back in and loot your corpse (minus 1 item).  Finish the dungeon, and get the rezz after your corpse pops out (after the dungeon de-pops).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fight now, rez later... how else would anyone do it?  Unless maybe you have an epic cleric in your group, and the person didnt bind at the wayfarer camp...  (oh, and I saw 1 cleric LFG at the camps the past couple days... usualy have a druid and me healing.  So far I have been lucky and had a paladin in my groups as MT, so we had rez if needed)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Fight now, rez later... <br />
<br />
There are still a few scenarios where this advice doesn't solve the problem of a loong wait for the corpses.<br />
<br />
I got in a pickup grp this morning and we failed miserably (59 shaman 62 mage 59 mage 61 ranger 59 bard and 60 wizard).  It was obvious after the first 10 mobs or so that we were never going to finish the dungeon in time.  However we all decided to keep plunging ahead for xp/loot/fun since there aren't a lot of people online in the morning hours.<br />
<br />
Ranger was at 50% health, I announce CHing but before it lands he pulls 3 mobs into camp.  I die very quickly, ranger also dies in short order.  I think rest of grp ported out, but end result was a grp with 2 corpses in the dungeon, and no desire whatsoever to go back and finish the dungeon.  No rez'er in grp, and although the other 4 peeps could go do whatever, 2 of us had to hang around and wait for the bodies to pop to get a rez. It sucked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hmm.. yeah, that sounds like a bug or design flaw.  If everyone aborts the adventure, the instance should terminate. I would  /bug  /petition /feedback that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">We did fight now rez later, I killed the cleric twice and as soon as we were ejected from the dungeon... well, like 45 seconds after, her bodies landed on her lap.  We had successfully completed a hard adventure and then wandered around for the extra 30 mins and were ejected.  So it may very well be that your bodies don't get ejected until a full 120 mins passes from the time the dungeon was first opened.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Lumor2000</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Ah, great idea Tiorr, I'll try that next time.  On my second mission we had a monk tank, as the lowest level member of a group, and it just wasnt going to work.  we had suffered a few deaths, and just waited for the instance to end.</div></div><hr />
