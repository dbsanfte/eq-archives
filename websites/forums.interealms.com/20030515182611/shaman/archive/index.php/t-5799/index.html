<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jestice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I personally love COM.  At 53 I usually start out my evening by running to Seb and making my presence known.  After 15 - 20 minutes of LFG if I don't get a group I head to COM.  Do to it's proximity to OS I find this to be ideal - has a wonderful list of bonuses in my opinion that make soloing here really easy - 1.  decent ZEM 2. No Wanderers 3.  Mobs don't run  4. Good amount of dark blue cons - though with the ZEM the light blues actually seem to affect my xp bar.  And when soloing gets boring it's a short jaunt down to Seb to LFG.<br />
<br />
I have not tried the stables, I found the area to be to confining and easy to get adds.  My favorite place to camp is on the north side of  the goo house (Arena).  The goos are dark blue 11 times out of 12 and can be single pulled with slow.  I then aggro pull the house to the east (2 spawns in each wing) which are most of the time lt blue.  The only time things get hairy is when I open the door to Lhrancs office - there are two spawns in here that have always been dark blue to me.  This gives me 3 goos, 4 mobs out of the house and two out of the office.  If the goo's still havn't popped by the time I finish these I can run out to the courtyard and find a lt blue to kill while I wait.  <br />
<br />
I plan to start looping around the area in front of the castle next, though I have found that I still can't single pull from the gazebos.  But I've gotten pretty used to two.  Overall though nice safe xp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">the rooms in the stable?  I don't think so, no single pulls.  <br />
<br />
Are you after the student's log?  then ya need to do the stables, obviously ...  If after exp, move elsewhere in CoM (see above post) or, better yet, head to HHK.<br />
<br />
If ya need the log - I have read that you can invis to pull from stable rooms - the golems do not see invis, so you should only get the spectres, phantoms. skellies...  The post I read (long time ago, sorry I cannot quote a name) said you could leave golems up and eventually you would only be pulling the spots where the courier can pop.<br />
<br />
yes, invis to pull means no doggie to help ya beat down the mobs.  no help for that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Trabayre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks Baz, yes I am after the log. Had not thought of pulling invis. I always try to bring level 45ish guildies with me, they can be my pets:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Largus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Not sure about pulling there solo but you will find others camping there for exp. I just  helped them with mobs till a log dropped. As far as exp, i agree with the others. I stayed in CoM till I was 56. the exp near the locked door is great. I think I would get about  1 1/2 to 2 blues an hour back there and always got singles if done in the right order. I sould not  single pull the gazebos over the water till 54 i think so stick with the mobs on the u-turn. I thought the goos hit hard and had a lot of HP. I could kill the skelies and golems much quicker and easier and they were dark blue at the u-turn till about lvl 55, then I moved to the gazebos. I would definitely stay in CoM for exp and while leveling up, ooc if anyone is hunting in the stable area. If they are, ask them if you can loot the log if/when it drops.</div></div><hr />
