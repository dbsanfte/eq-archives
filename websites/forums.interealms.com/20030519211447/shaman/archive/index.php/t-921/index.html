<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zozo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I just figured out I might be able to get my Monks True Spirit Faction up.  This might help other Shaman in your guild or a Shaman friend of yours.  <br />
<br />
What I did was took my monk with me to OOT to start the first step of my epic.  Killed the Capt to spawn the Lesser Spirit.  Then I took my monk used sneak and Hailed the Lesser Spirit.  Went through the normal quest dialog until my monk got the quest gem for the next step.  Hopefully I can use Sneak again and have my monk turn in the quest gem to get a True Spirit Faction hit.  <br />
<br />
Not sure if this will work or not had to log for the night it was getting late.  Figuring if I can do this about 20 to 30 times to get my True Spirit faction to at least the first step past Indifferent maybe it will work.  <br />
<br />
Anyone know what my True Spirit faction must be to turn in the Tear?  <br />
<br />
It is no problem going back and doing PoF again.  This might help others get the tear if a class that has the Sneak ability is able to do this for them.  <br />
<br />
Thx for any imput or ideas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Unfortunately, it needs to be pretty close to ally.  Ghiosk, Neh, Kirn, and Rak all have huge + faction hits, so I imagine you'll have to do the quest quite a few times.<br />
<br />
Other things to consider if you have a high level group available--if you can use sneak, perhaps turn in Ghiosk's books several times.<br />
<br />
Probably a more effective method is to kill the 2 idiots Marr and whatever his name was.  Those give a fairly sizeable hit too, I think.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Azhdarkhos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">So far I have done the epic quest in correct order - I have done up through turning in Neh's Diary to the Sentinel Spirit and have yet to get the Tear for turn in to Rak.  Up to the turn in of Neh's Diary I had not repeated any of the previous steps, so only one of each faction hit along the way.  Before turning in Neh's Diary I was Warmly to True Spirit faction.  Upon turn-in of the Diary, I was Ally with True Spirit faction.  I have since then turned in one extra set of Ghiosk's three books to the Sentinel Spirit, which returned the &quot;Your faction could not possibly get any better&quot; message.<br />
<br />
What I gather from this is that you need to be Ally with True Spirit, though not necessarily max Ally, to turn in the Tear to Rak'Ashir.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zozo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thank you for the info on the faction.  Right now I am planning on doing all of the steps myself.  If possible the only step I might skip is the PoF part just MQ with my Monk.  IF it works.  Worst case I have to do PoF myself and then turn tear in.  For now I will max my monks True Spirit faction via doing parts of the quest it allows me to.  Worst case I have to kill the capt for a couple weeks if that is the only way to get a faction hit from turning the gem in.  Going to try the two idiots tonight and possibly the MM part as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xeiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">someone said they maxed theres by killing the dire wolf in MM and handing in the pelt, for the boots reward part, 4 or 5 times and they got max ally<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zozo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Wow, going to have to try that this weekend.  :)  Thx!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">There have been accounts of people being ally but not max ally and having their tear eaten by Lord Rak.  Unfortunately, those posts are long gone now :(.  It is not worth the risk.  Make sure you have seen &quot;Your faction standing with Truespirit could not possibly get any better.&quot;</div></div><hr />
