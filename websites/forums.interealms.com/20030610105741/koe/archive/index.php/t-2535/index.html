<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Atokal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi folks,<br />
<br />
I was wondering if there was a map somewhere I could download of this huge zone.<br />
It would be helpful I am sure for other members who have SS pieces to turn in for the quest armor.<br />
As it sits right now I have only been there once and this is a HUGE zone with many places to get lost.<br />
<br />
So either a map or a walk thru to get to the dragons for turning in quest pieces would be very helpful.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Go through the door on the opposite side of the door that leads to WL by the CS entrance.  Go right, then left, then left.  This takes you downstairs.  Just keep going straight and you will reach the teleporter.  You will then follow a small path and enter the maze.<br />
<br />
Navigating the maze:<br />
<br />
I found this map helpful for the maze: http://www.eqmaps.com/m2/skyshrine_maze3.gif<br />
<br />
The quickest way through is going from the entrance to F, then G, then P, then the exit.<br />
<br />
After this it's pretty hard to get lost, just keep following the outside.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The set there has very good maps that you can use to navigate better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Venomblood Draconis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Skyshrine Set 3 maps off of eqmaps is the best set I've seen. I found a simpler path thru the maze. Use porters A, L and O and you get right to the exit.<br />
<br />
Have fun.<br />
