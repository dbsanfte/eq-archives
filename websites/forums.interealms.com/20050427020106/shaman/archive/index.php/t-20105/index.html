<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What can a party of 65's - me, warrior(7k hp), enchanter, mage, cleric, druid, bard - kill that would net decent gear (hp/mana items in the 70-80 range)?  On average, we're basically all equipped with slightly better than NToV level gear (I'm the worst equipped in the group by far) and have in the range of 50-150 aa (again, me being the exception).  We have all of our spells.  None of us are EP flagged.<br />
<br />
Have checked the board best I can for ideas, but I can't seem to find anything.  We've killed ancient guardian wurms in HoT a number of times without problems, along with similar mobs.  But we're interested in finding better loots for all involved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The only thing I can think of that you can one-group in Velious gear that would drop stats like that would be (possibly) Oreen Wavecrasher in BoT for your Scaled Avatar's Leggings. <br />
<br />
Good luck, he's never dropped them for me. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>veggi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You could try an ldon hard adventure, some nice loot drops there...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>brokenlimit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">some of the new GoD trials have pretty good drops (like elemental quality bracer for example).  look up drops from the sewers of nilia, vxed, and tipt.  while the last 2 are pretty hard unless you already have this type of equipment, you can often gimp people into the expeditions at the last minute to loot sometimes.  still eyeing the regen6 prayer ring from ikkinz haven't gotten around to grouping and getting it to drop tho &gt;&lt;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I agree that LDoN hard is probably going to give you the best drops per hour invested without PoP flags.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd recommend high diff LDoN too.  The xp is nice and the loot can be very nice.<br />
<br />
I got a new bracer on a high diff LDoN last night...I was ML and about pooped when I saw it.  Not quite 80/80 - but 75/75 in a bracer isn't bad and it has decent +sta/wis too...and resists.  I also hit enough points for a 3rd piece of incorporeal.  Twas a good night.  Now I just need tons more points to aug what I have.  :-/<br />
<br />
I've done less than 10 high diffs (they're becoming the norm for my regulars though...which is spiffy) and I've seen several very sweet items drop, including a secondary slot item with decent stats and FT1 (all  items with focus effects have been no drop so far)<br />
<br />
The loot from GoD trials looks intriguing.  I'm hoping to experience some of that in the near future.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hard LDoN or GoD Trials</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hard LDoN and GoD sewers trials and Ferubi has some named mobs that drop very nice gear, although I dunno if those will be out of reach for you at the moment or not... Only one way to find out for sure! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Any chance one of the more experienced prophets out there would be willing to make a run down on some of the easier GoD trials?  Maybe ideas on what to expect, tips to succeed, and which trial to take for a not so stellar equipped group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Drachen183</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hit Dozekar on server ups. By far the best stuff you can get and great risk ( hah! ) vs. reward.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Zlandicar farming :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If none of you have done any GoD trials, then I think all you can get is Trial 1.  The mobs hit for 1k-ish.  About the same difficulty of EP or Hard LDoN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">LDoN hard.<br />
GoD trials<br />
Ferubi<br />
Dozekar/hot named (be aware you will need to kill them 20+ times to really get much loot)<br />
Tactics named<br />
BoT named<br />
Zland/Kland both 1 groupable.<br />
Kunark dragons for cash maybe, not much useful loot off them.<br />
<br />
Most of these can also yield some cash on drops you don't need, which you can then turn around to purchase some niceties.  White dragon helm, some ornate gear, etc.<br />
<br />
If you want to do GoD trials (and get further in), I'd recommend concentrating heavily on the tanks HP and cleric mana regen.  Our 1 group tank (never been to VT or any raiding) is over 9000 now, and GoD is rough (in trial 5 now), especially the named, but we picked up 110 hp plate pants there last night.  <br />
You have to do the god trials in order, there's a nice writeup of the first 3 on graffe's somewhere.  The loot drops on those are pretty rare, we did about 10 tries total on the 4 trials and got 1 drop only.  Named in trial 5 are much more common (5 named in 4 tries so far).<br />
<br />
Don't overestimate normal LDoN's either, you can roll through some for points, and get some gear / focus effect upgrades that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">For the sixth GoD trial, dont even try it w/ a sub9k tank.  The final named on that trial will hit for 2100 on a defensive warrior.  Also, once you kill the named, no more group changes can be done.<br />
<br />
Also, why do people say Kland is 1 groupable to folks w/o elem gear.  He's a real pain in the ass to slow and people wil get feared.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Drachen183</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Also, why do people say Kland is 1 groupable to folks w/o elem gear.  He's a real pain in the ass to slow and people wil get feared.<br />
<br />
He is a pain in the ass to slow, but its doable w/o elem. The only memeber of our group that did him that had any upper PoP loot was a warrior with an Ethereal Destroyer and Armguards of the Brute... it helped having a time equiped warrior, but the rest of us were mostly velious/luclin geared.<br />
<br />
And yes, the warrior had time loot, but no elem. =P</div></div><hr />
