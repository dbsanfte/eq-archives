<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sebekiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was looking at the Omens spells on Lucy.  Currently we are getting a new spell (Ancestral Strength) that has a Slot 1 modifier of &quot;Increase Damage Modifier by 5%&quot;.  Also, our Avatar upgrade, Champion, has a slot 4 modifier of &quot;Increase Damage Modifier by 10%&quot;.<br />
<br />
If these actualy translate into direct DPS increase of about %5 and 10%, what do you think it would mean for our usefulness in the expansion?  I went through the OOW spells for the other casters, and it appears that no one else will have more than a 5% increase via their spells, so we would be the only ones able to add 15% (though admittedly through an Avatar-line spell which means we'd be back to rebuffing every 10 minutes with SCRM).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think that the 5% increase is going to be applied to every hit that connects.  So if a warrior drops a hit for 250 in a mob, the actual danage to the mob is going to be about 263.  Im not thinking that this is going to translate into &quot;5% higher DPS&quot;, but it will lead to an increase.  I could be wrong, however.<br />
<br />
In thinking about this a thought has occured to me.  Will we be stacking more buffs on those players that do not have maxed stats?  For the ranger that only has 229 STR unbuffed..will we stack Focus, Diaku and then Ancestral Strength?  If so we are going to need everyone to get the extra buff slots, as we are going to end up taking up a large portion of them.  Or, are these new 65+ buffs going to block/overwrite our 60+ spells?</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is also a &quot;Minimum damage modifier&quot; (see, innerflame discipline and the berserker time bp).<br />
<br />
I believe the &quot;damage modifier&quot; modifies the maximum hit, but leaves the minimum hit untouched. And the &quot;minimum damage modifier&quot; affects the minimum (surprise :-). So, to get a true damage increase you have to increase both the damage modifier and the minimum damage modifier (like the berserker bp, which adds 15% to both).<br />
<br />
The damage modifier does not apply to the weapon's damage bonus either. When my monk uses innerflame (100% damage modifier, 400% minimum damage modifier) his hits go from 464 normal max to 891 normal max.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The damage modifiers apply to the base damage component of weapons, not the damage bonus. There was a discussion about this some time ago when the latest iteration of these spells was released on test. Because the damage bonus is not included, the maximum increase in damage would be for a max hit, but it would be less than 10% (probably around 8.5-9%, I forget the exact number). As your hits are mitigated, the dps increase will be less since the ratio of base damage to bonus damage will decrease. A min hit will have a 0% increase for example.<br />
<br />
Basically it means that the effects on these spells will be most useful on mobs with low relative AC and least effective on mobs with high relative AC.<br />
<br />
The minimum damage modifier on some discs affects the damage bonus component of your dps, so it is not affected by these spells.</div></div><hr />
