he hits for less than yeldema, has less MR, less hp, and casts spells....all in all, not hard. fight him at the door and he won't gate.</div></div><hr />

emperor is a joke.<br />
pull with malosini or slow.<br />
<br />
he hits for max of around 160..but doesn't hit often....he mostly stands there and casts silly spells that you easily resist.<br />
<br />
low MR and PR for sure.......burn him down with JBB,  epic and bane/ebolt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Crumm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thnx Smasherr. Hehe a shm buddy told me i'd get owned cause he's tough but i'm thinking he needs to lay off the pipe alil =)~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kytra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Emporer cons even to me at 60 sometimes. Blue others. I usually do the Rare Hall circle with a Monk and Rogue. Chottal is a big joke. I haven't actually tried to solo him, but I'm pretty sure I could. I resist 99.9% of his spells and I've never seen him resist one of my spells. His pet is a pain though.<br />
