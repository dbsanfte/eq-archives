<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yesterday I dinged 54 and sat down to scribe my spells.  As I scribbed ice strike, it dawned on me that I couldn't remember the last time I used a nuke out of my spellbook.  I haven't needed to use one in the last 9 levels :\<br />
<br />
Am I missing out on some big shaman capability, here?  Whenever I go on a raid, I'm too busy slowing, buffing, and healing to worry about nukes.  And even when I do have spare mana, it's more efficient to ebolt the thing that try and nuke it.  most of my raids are kael or WW (my guild has screwy faction :D), so they will probably resist anyways.<br />
<br />
The only time I can remember when I wish I had a nuke memorized, was when a necro KS'd me in cobalt scar.  My JBB doesn't outdamage all those evil evil dots :(<br />
<br />
edit:  I have JBB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sithliss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I use my nukes alot when I solo (prolly cause I'm dumb) after pumping as many DoTs as I can in the mob, but I'm only at level 37 and not on many high level raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think the last time I used Ice Strike was in Skyfire - maybe a year ago :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I use Ice Strike from time to time to finish off awkward mobs. But I have been thinking to myself recently that I use it so little that I could probably find something better to put in that spell slot.<br />
<br />
It's certainly not a 'never forget' spell. The one spell I absolutely keep memmed at all times - Root. Has saved my life many times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dangus MacNemo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">grouped in KC yesterday, a mob was complete healing itself.  after the second complete heal, i added my nukes to the mix.<br />
<br />
it was a pick-up group and we weren't communicating well.  we had about 3 ways to stun the thing, but nobody was using them.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I tend to use my nukes when I am 4th or 5th shaman on a raid.  With Fungi/KEI I tend to regen mana pretty quick so am often sitting FM which freaks me out, so I dump some nukes on mobs to help out.  With mage focus bracelt I can get up to almost 800 hp damage which must help out a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Isazo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you get lucky and find a mob that doesn't resist Poison or cold on a raid (Say some HoT wurms), you can cast torrent of Poison (540 x 3) and about the time the last wave hits you can get off an Ice Strike (675).<br />
<br />
So... that's 2295 damage from nukes in about 12 seconds.  That's best case scenario and often you get full or partial resists.  On some mobs the nuke combo of torrent and ice strike (or blast of poison) is very effective.<br />
<br />
I often use the torrent/blast of poison combo in Kael arena where a mob will last 15-20 sec.<br />
<br />
In XP groups I'll sometimes have a nuke memmed if the groups damage output is a little gimped -- the mobs die too fast to make Bane efficient, but slow enough that I have excess mana... I'll nuke from time to time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The last time I had a direct damage spell memorized was about Level 50 and I was fighting healing MOBs, so it made sense. My groups are usually small enough that a poison DoT is better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tritan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I nuke every once in awhile, mostly on multi-group raids, and sometimes its enough damage to get my group a XP kill.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>WulfTyger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I am much like Kronenbourg. Only time I use my nukes is when there are several shamen on a raid and I need something to burn mana on.<br />
<br />
The torrent/strike combo works wonders in PoG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Epyx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Isazo summed it up pretty good. The Torrent of Poison/Icestrike combo is a nice duo punch on many mobs.<br />
<br />
Also, I am not quite sure why people arent using these but the mage items (lvl 54 ones) really help with the nukes and cast times.<br />
<br />
With Ring and Bracelet alone I get a second shaved off of the cast time of Icestrike and can hit for a max of around 820dmg. This also helps for Torpor, bringing it down to the 5second mark to cast etc.<br />
<br />
USE MAGE ITEMS!!! ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I use my DD spell when soloing vamps in ME.  Darn things resist 4 out of 5 casts of DoTs even with malo and insidious decay on :(<br />
<br />
So, slow, epic DoT, pet, blast and tank.  One of these days I WILL get an etherial earring.  :p<br />

I am in a guild with quite a lot of level 50+ characters and I am only level 49. When we raid; somewhere like Siren's Grotto or Kael Drakkel Arena for example, I often end up leeading the &quot;ghetto group&quot; - 4 or 5 sub 50 rag-tags that nobody really wants and nobody really needs....but I call us the &quot;kill-steal group&quot; - we hoard up all our mana and then we choose a mob and all blast a full mana bar into it - you can obviously only do this every 3rd or 4th mob, but it is amazing how many times you can steal the exp if you get good at it heh heh heh<br />
<br />
P.S. I know that in terms of mana efficiency it is a horrible tactic, but thats not the point. Hell, when I lead the &quot;ghetto group&quot; I actually give out small prizes for people who can actually get aggro after main tank has called the attack! <br />
<br />
P.P.S. My guild leaders love me, as I am sure you can tell!</div></div><hr />

<br />
hehehehe my favorite times on raids are when either:<br />
<br />
1) we do really awesome and it's hardcore and intense and we come out victorious because we all worked together and did our respective jobs<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
2) It's something easy we've done a billion times and you've got room to screw around and just have fun and goof off.  I applaud you for making something out of your rag-tag group of rejects :)  The only thing is, kael mobs at least seem to be extremely resistand to cold spells :(  even after malosi gets landed my JBB is fully resisted /sigh.  stupid FROST giants why do they have to have cold resistance i just don't understand /cry<br />
<br />
Chutoi brought up a good point:  using nukes on things that are dot resistant.  I tried the grey for the first time this weekend and found that shissar are immune (or extremely resistant ) to my dots, but JBB hits them fine after malosi is in.  When I go back there in a day or two I will try soloing them using nukes instead of dots in addition to JBB to speed things along.  The only thing I am worried about is my evocation skill.  I fizzled the level 44 nuke all the time, and I've gone 9 levels without using a nuke :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I still use my nukes in certain (fairly rare) situations.   Mostly when I'm in a full group with chanter and cleric and I'm near FM but the MOBs are dying too fast for DOTs.<br />
<br />
I just got JBB, will probably elect to use that instead in the future.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I have my JBB, I rarely mem a nuke.  I find it is a highly situational spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Small sidetrack - about the Shissar in the Grey.<br />
<br />
I've only spent one evening there so far, but I was testing out various spells. Most of the mobs in that zone seem to be very resistant to poison and cold, but not so resistant to magic. The Rockfiend thingies are more resistant than the others, and probably not worth killing for xp.<br />
<br />
I haven't tried disease DoTs yet, happily (for me) the epic DoT is rarely resisted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Mirabilis Dictu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">In the Grey, Shimmering Rockfiends are FR/CR, so cold nukes are out.  <br />
<br />
Shissar are PR/DR.  Epic dot hits them both, but it's pretty slow, so hit the Shissar with cold dds if you have the mana and no JBB, say, because not everyone has one :)<br />
<br />
Sometimes you'll get a nice surprise on a hunt.  For example, if you're doing Scout in WW, you'll find the General doesn't much resist Ice Strike, but he resists the poison and disease dots like a fiend.  Whoda thunk he'd left his long underwear at home, heh.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Group buff spells and item buffs like PE combined with that oh so lovely KEI on raids are making our mana demands much less than they used to be.  Further, some of these raid mobs are dying in close to the same time as it takes to cast our epic dot.  For example, if Chardok Queen lives long enough to feel the effect of your epic dot, you're likely dead soon, so nuke your heart out instead :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Raikor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I love nuking, but really only do it when there is mana to burn or am just having some fun soloing. I always have one nuke memmed, usually poison since JBB can tell me a mob's cold resistance. Getting Ice Strike tonight and really can't wait to use it, although it will be the first spell gem swap slot if something else is needed.<br />
<br />
Related comment/question: I'm actually looking forward to working on the SCFury AAXP. I know there are skills shamans need more and this skill could be thought of as useless for us, but it just sounds like FUN being able to nuke the heck out of a mob. Anyone have any numbers on how much they have nuked for with the Fury skill? Anyone want to fess up to putting points into it? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Hardly ever use use spell book nukes. However I do use the poison nukes against Vindi. Get a focus bracelet from a mage it will enhance the damage and hence mana efficiency of the spell. Works pretty well against him (after malosini). I know some guys like using torrent of poison, but the focus bracelet doesnt enhance rains and I find it resisted too much for my tastes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Wontonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Torron of Poison and Ice Stirk really IS the deadliest DD combo Shaman can get, IF your Evo skill is high enough that is.<br />
<br />
Torron of Poison is a level 55 spell and if your Evo skill is lower than 200 don't even bother to mem it.  You'll empty half of your mana bar just to get one off.  Even at max Evo I still got it fizzle from time to time.  But there're something you can do about this, Luclin expansion give enchanters a new line of fizzle reduce spells.  Just ask chanter for a shoot of these spell and your chance of fizzle will be greatly reduce. But you need to ask for them since most chanter won't consider it as a regular buff. Some don't even have the spell in their spell book. :D <br />
<br />
Also, the Torron of Poison is a low taunt spell.  I usually start cast it when mob is at 80% of health.  Almost never had mob agro on me because of this spell, unless the spell broken the mez on another mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Girashu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I always have one up, but then again sence I am only lvl 15 rooting and doting, nuke once twice debuff then mellee seems like the best way to do it.  Havn't really come up with a better idea for solowing yet, but that seems to work.  Havn't tried it with more than one mob though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Kazlaaz Bonedust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Sometimes I use them in pick up groups if I'm bored and the stuff is dying too fast to DoT. But it's not even really worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">i nuke all the time :)<br />
dots rarely useful in grps, and i cant cast them at the start anyways :)<br />
scf2 for fun :p<br />
<br />
on raids theres quite a few mobs where there is no real need for me to do much but nuke or chainheal mt to pretend i'm useful :)</div></div><hr />
