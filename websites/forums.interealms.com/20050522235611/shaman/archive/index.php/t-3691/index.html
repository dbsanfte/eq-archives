<br />
Um...why would you have a 100k horse and a low end system without luclin models.  If you pay 100k for the horse and don't use the horse models, you only run at what your current speed is, whether it be normal run speed, jboots, run 3, sow, whatever.  You would have wasted 90k of that horse on speed you can't utilize with luclin horse models off.  <br />
<br />
For those of you who just hate the horse's head, I believe you can target and invis him to clear up that problem.  I know you can definitely shrink him down.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In all seriousness the versatility of the horse just got rammed down the chute.  Don't get me wrong I'll still use mine but only when I'm not pulling (slow, root, epic, HORSE, engage I guess).</div></div><hr />

There's no longer a reason to own a horse, in my opinion. With the models forced on us, they are too buggy and awkward, horrible for all forms of combat and travel, and simply not worth keeping.<br />

As Kamidari said, if you need to get out of there, it's quick and easy enough to unclick the horse and click the epic boots.       I'm just happy I'll be able to use the JBB/horse together once I finally get connected and get this darn patch downloaded.<br />

I just got mine last week, the only way I could stand using it was by turning off the graphics for it. I could put up with the slow movement speed, the horse head in the way and the incredibly odd way you move on the horse is what gets me, but worst of all is I can't interrupt spells quickly by ducking while on horseback (at least I don't know of a way).

Anyways, the model change is a 50/50 thing.  Honestly I never used it grouped with people (as I'm generally indoors) and I don't tend to move a lot with it on anyways, except to return to my pull area.  It's pesky, but we'll get over it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
       I spent some time in Umbral this evening with a guild cleric and warrior.I was the puller (due to level).I would pull a mob with malo, root, slow and cripple then cast my horse (as warrior taunted).For the duration of the fight I remained on horseback dismounting only to pull the next mob.<br />

      The ability to med on the horse remains a solid reason for owning one.Yes some of the froth of horse ownership has been removed but the core remains.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">Not to be a stick in the mud, but what you're doing SHOULD be fixed. It's a sploit, a bug, plain and simple. You are not allowed to cast sow on your steed, therefore should not be allowed to move at sow speed while mounted. You should have to see the horse head, as after all, YOU'RE SITTING ON A HORSE. At the same time, duck should be fixed to interrupt casting, even if you don't fully duck. Maybe that makes too much sense.<br />
<br />
Anyway, expect to lose this at some point guys, and when you do, no one start a lameass whiny thread about how they &quot;didn't see this coming&quot; or that &quot;it's so unfair .. wah.&quot; You want the benefits of riding a horse without suffering the drawbacks.

<br />
The only time prices go up are for items where the drop rate is changed (eg fungi), items that are removed from the game altogether (eg manastone), or items that are retrofitted with better stats (eg all the new focus items, or crystal spider eyes).<br />
<br />
I like the bit about the trolls though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">Agreed Grippa.  With the advent of the Bazaar (which directly relates to the horse to be quite honest as they were coinciding) getting items/gear is SEVERLY cheaper.  Barbed Boots, 2500, Slime Covered Ruby Coif 1500 (ok I think he meant 15000 but that's his fault..it's worth more than 1500 IMO), gebs 2500, fbss 2500-3k, twink gear for 100 or less.. etc...<br />
<br />
<br />
Money has gone down and there is still a bazillion and one places to make money if you are willing to put in the effort.  Sol A is still there, IG/Hg's are still there, Lizzies in Ferrott, etc... it's just a matter of levels (I won't argue that at all) and willing to put in the time.<br />
<br />
On a good farming day I can make 1k in an hour without batting an eyelash and 1.2 if I really push myself and don't stop to look around.<br />
<br />
..and ya it's a xploit guys.  That's why I sold it first thing and bought my new toys.</div></div><hr />

Answer: It doesn't, so don't worry about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Unintended feature&quot;!?!?!??! LOLOLOLOL OMG GORDON, YOU'RE BACK!!! I'm sorry, I guess it's working as intended.<br />
<br />
Anyway, my point stands. I &quot;suspect&quot; it's a bug. I &quot;suspect&quot; they coded those pesky negatives to using a horse to balance the benefits. And I &quot;suspect,&quot; if they ever care enough that people are skirting the rules, they might take it away. /shrug<br />
<br />
I'm not judging you, or insulting you if you use it, I simply said don't be surprised if and when it goes away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>dirtybax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">point taken Mormegil.  I will complain and be surprised for all of the 5 minutes it takes me to get to the Bazaar and sell the horse back.  Then I will get on with life since the horse wasn't *that* great to begin with.  The value of the horse pales in comparison to some of the arguably broken items that remain unchanged in game (visit the Shadowknight boards and ask them what the first rule is sometime)<br />
<br />
Oh and I work in Quality Assurance for a software company,  Unintended Feature is what Development says each and every time we find a legitmate bug. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">I have to ask you then, Dirtybax, given you work as quality assurance for a software company....how could you possibly come up with the answer 'How dose it affect you; It doesn't, so don't worry about it&quot;?<br />
<br />
<br />
Any exploit that gives one player an advantage over another(in this somewhat dynamic world), breaks down that much more, the little balance Verant has managed to code into EQ. I hear players complain that Verant nerfed this...or shafted them on that...and thats an argument in itself.....but when a player chooses to sploit, your not affecting Verant...they are getting your 12 bucks one way or another....your affecting the player base and that small bit of balance that is there to at least try to set a fair stage amongst players.</div></div><hr />

Not to be a stick in the mud, but what you're doing SHOULD be fixed. It's a sploit, a bug, plain and simple. You are not allowed to cast sow on your steed, therefore should not be allowed to move at sow speed while mounted. You should have to see the horse head, as after all, YOU'RE SITTING ON A HORSE. At the same time, duck should be fixed to interrupt casting, even if you don't fully duck. Maybe that makes too much sense.<br />
<br />
<br />
I mostly agree with you.  Speed, yeah, that's the penalty you pay for being on a slow nag.  Duck, yeah, that should be fixed.  But<br />
I don't agree that viewing a horse's head is the penalty you pay for being on a horse.  That is a choice of the way the horse was implemented, an implementation detail.<br />
<br />
It doesn't seem to be that much of a burden to click off the horse and click on the SoW booties when I need the speed.  I'll probably still buy a horse when I get the cash - assuming I can keep myself from making speculative purchases in the bazaar, lol.  It's just too attractive for a JBB-wielding shaman not to do it.</div></div><hr />
