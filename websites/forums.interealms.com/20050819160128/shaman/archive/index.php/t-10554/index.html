<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What's up with this kind of n00b activity.  I see it all the time in groups and in raids....  people are completely surprised that they need food and drink while playing the game.  If someone asks me ONE MORE TIME!      Grrrr, how would they like it if the cleric started asking for spare peri's cause he didn't bother to bring any, or pearls.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wiggy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm definately with you on this one.<br />

I could see someone forgetting to buy once in the while, but it's no excuse with food/drink that lasts forever.<br />
<br />
Buy some food, damn yous!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bandages I can understand * IF * a Mage is in the group. A good monk will help out with post fight healing. Focus items = you bet.<br />
<br />
But how hard is it to buy a stack of food and water? You're a cleric with no DOTs?  Hey, I'm not playing your toon &amp; class - YOU'RE playing your toon &amp; class. Get with the program. Go sit in Seb at Guardian and rake em in.</div></div><hr />

First time I've ever heard this!  No offense, but it sounds a bit like an EQ urban legend.  Anyone else able to verify, because as much as horsie eats, this would be fabu if true :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">reducing food/drink consumption to 1/4th would be far too powerful.  Imagine a stack of misty thicket picnics (STR 5, STA 5,WIS 5, INT 5, HP 20, mana 30; wt 0.1, none/none, large) lasting an entire month!  How about a stack of Qeynos Afternoon Tea (DEX 5, WIS 5, INT 5, AGI 5, recommended level 1, wt 0.1, size small) lasting the same amount of time!</div></div><hr />

Thats what my horse gets anyway.  I named the horse Fishroll cause he went through a stack in about 1 play session.  Now he ges summoned black break and water.  Stupid  horse....</div></div><hr />

<br />
during that time, my bags, and bank were full of patty melts, and fish rolls...<br />
<br />
I group with the same people all the time,and covered their food for months..<br />
<br />
now I'm all out.. and have been for awhile... and they are still out of the habit of buying food :\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I got tired of summoning bread and water, so I started baking. I have ample supplies of fish rolls most of the time :) Occasionally I get caught out and if we're non-stop pulling I might &lt;shock horror&gt; ask if someone has some spare to save me having to stop and summon some. Call me lazy if you care. I must say that's a rare occurance though - if it kept happening then yes, I'd get a bit annoyed.<br />
<br />
I've also summoned bread or given fish rolls out to group members on numerous occasions. Most of the time its no big deal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Insanely fast.<br />
<br />
Once a week I make batches of them, usually about 60-70 pies and drinks, and by the end of the week, maybe a little bit later, I'm all out.<br />
<br />
Good thing I make my own, eh?<br />
<br />
On some long raids, I have been known to run out. Heck, I used a complete stack this weekend alone, camping rotting skelly/pained soul/vkr over and over. If there's a druid in the group, I sometimes beg for their forages, usually they have a stack or two they don't mind sharing. Or I summon my own. While I do make an effort to stock up before I head out, accidents do happen, especially if I'm on a horse all day.<br />
<br />
Let's just say metabolism 3 is on my wish list of aa's to get... I'm having fun improving my baking/brewing but geez, it's rediculous the amount of clicks I do once a week to feed my stomach.</div></div><hr />

The way I heard it was the full set of blackened iron gave you bonus AC points beyond what the items said they gave.  :D</div></div><hr />

This weekend I saw the worst demonstration of lazyness. A ranger had a gall to come up to my shaman and ask me for food and water.<br />
<br />
Hello mcfly thats what your damn forage button is for heck our guild ranger keeps him his alts his wifes alts all supplied with food with forage.<br />
<br />
I also once had a druid come up and ask my now sacrificed druid for food and water. I told him why should I bother if he is to lazy to either hit his forage button or cast summon food/water.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Drizan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Couple FYI.<br />
<br />
1) Plains pebble = B.S.  I've timed it and you consume at the exact same rate.  Not terribly difficult to check if you want to waste a stickey note.<br />
<br />
2) Food benefits are gained by where the item is in inventory.  However how hungry you are is on a timer related to that piece of food, however you can consume more food than that.  So.....Put the stat food in slot 1 of your inventory and summon away.  put the food that you summoned in slot 2 and click away untill you cannot eat anymore.  Hence you will not consume the stat food.  Horsey and I eat 7 summoned bread and 9 summoned water an hour (RL).  I've had the same Halas meat pie for a week, yeah its starting to stink but what the hell.<br />
Just keep summoning food every 45 minutes or so and pig out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Actually I think you can put stat bonus food/drink in a bag and get the affects as well.. as long as its the first food stuff in your inventory bag wise</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I'm lazy, I just make more ;)<br />
<br />
I tried force feeding but if you miss the timer, the 1 halas pie you eat keeps you stuffed for a long period of time.<br />
<br />
On a related note, making grobbs raised me from 165 to 172 so far in brewing, but I have yet to get a skillup on baking at 191 skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">To get the stat bonus for food, you need to consume it.  Otherwise, people would put one of each in a bag and get all the cumulative stat benefits :)  Just doesn't work that way.<br />
<br />
If you forcefeed yourself, the food only lasts for half the normal time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Heh.  I just spent 3 AAs so I don't eat so damn much with my horse.  No regrets so far...</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
You're half right. You can forcefeed to keep from eating and still get the benifit from the stat food as long as it is the top food item slot wise.  So, you need to consume it, per-se, just have the risk of it being consumed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I find myself eating my stat food all the time by accident. :P  I force feed myself to keep from eating it, but it really doesn't work well with most food besides snacks for me, because I don't run a dang timer on it all.  If you eat things like fish rolls or iron or normal rations, you'll remain full a long time, try to force feed yourself and be unable to, and then suddenly you'll need food and eat your stat food. :P So now I usually don't use it at all unless I have lots of muffins in my inventory.  You can cram those in here and there whenever you think of it and never wind up eating your stat food.  <br />
<br />
Took up baking and brewing just for diversion.  Baking 227 woohoo!  Finally trivialed halas meat pies.  At 203 skill, I went six hours without a skill-up!  Then in three combines I went to 205.  To get to the 226 trivial point, I figure I made well over 2000 pies.  Sold 560 in one day, but they only bring 3pp on my server, so it's not really worth the time.  Brewing 190 now too.  <br />
<br />
Well, I guess I can make my own stuff now, so what the hell, maybe I will start using it.  Painful doing the pre-combines for halas meat pies though.  I can do two solid hours of precombines to give myself enough components for a somewhat extended pie-making run.  Bleh</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Groxb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Personally, I think it's time they removed the requirement for food and water.  Sure, you can keep it around for fun and for the stats/advantages that certain foods offer, but in general they were it was a bad idea before it even made it to paper.  It dosen't add to any element of the game and only becomes a hassle at best - much like being forced to look at your spellbook while you meditate.<br />

Hah.  That's what I normally buy stacks of 20 of to eat.  If no one has any, I'll settle for halas meat pie, but I try for the good stuff all the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Jendain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">how would they like it if the cleric started asking for spare peri's cause he didn't bother to bring any, or pearls.....<br />
If I had a plat for every time someone on raid has asked for peris or pearls, i'd be buying a 100k horse right today. and one for my twink.<br />
<br />
And I have to put down the people begging food and drink off me, only carrying 1 stack of halas pies and grobb meat myself usually, and living quite long off the stuff.</div></div><hr />
