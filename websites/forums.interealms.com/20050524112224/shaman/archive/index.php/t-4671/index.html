<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Looks like VI finally ditched the snare on the druid epic. Druids are elated.<br />
<br />
So while VI's in the mood to remove inconvenient and unnecessary effects which produce unfavorable results, how about we push heavy to /feedback 'Please remove the DD component of poison and disease based DoTs'? <br />
<br />
Who knows?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nitsujlak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I hope they listen. :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Whats wrong with the DD component?  Does an extra ~10% on Poison dots, and helps get the mobs attn for root/parking, etc.<br />
<br />
Maybe remove it from the Disease DoTs so you can root/rot if you wanted, but really, having the chance to break root is part of the risk.  <br />
<br />
I think it's fine right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's not the root breaking that is the issue, snap.  If they resist the DD component, they resist the DoT.  It makes the resist rates on our DoTs obscenely high, especially on ubermobs.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>molgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">why is it easier to resist things with a DD component?<br />
<br />
wouldn't a DD-less dot still have the exact same resist check, assuming it were still poison/disease?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Our dots have 2 chances to resist as both the Dot AND DD components both suffer resist checks, if the mob passes either of the 2 checks, the dot is resisted totally.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ahhh that makes sense. I was under the same impression as Molgar.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Our poison/disease line had one resist check, and it either stuck or didn't.  If it stuck, the DD component allowed a resist check to the root.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Wytchone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I thought our dots work as Sebazy discribed.  I would love anyone to prove me wrong.</div></div><hr />

No offense, but shaman dots dont mean jack on a high end mob.  You get enough aggro from slow, don't think you wanna tamper with Bane.  It's not that our dots suck, but it's not our jobs on raids.  We're there to buff/debuff, that's plenty enough.<br />
<br />
Dots are the own when soloing tho, and I guess they can serve their use in a group (watch out for mezzed mobs tho, sometimes MT may have to switch targets too).  Well I have a scale actually:<br />
1) On wussy mobs with under 10k hps, I stack epic, jbb, and bane ie KC basement and shrooms in FG.  Minus JBB in places like Kedge where the fuggers are immune to ice.<br />
2) On medium-high difficulty mobs, I'll chain bane mostly.  I'll epic, but only when my mana is stable as epic gets interrupted quite easily.  <br />
3) On what I consider to be very difficult mobs, I'll just mainly use epic.  I'm talking about mobs like Stomples (15k hp double for 350ish) and Gantru Dralkenr (50k hp double for 190ish).  I cheat on those tho, have pet tank and chain torpor him, and that's why I can only afford to cast epic else I'd get aggro :D<br />
<br />
I'd be kinda pissed if they removed the dd component from dots personally.  The initial damage from bane (150) is not negligible and for the mobs I fight, they have just about as much chance of resisting bane than they do slow, and it's not like I'm complaining about the resistability of turgurs.  Sure I get pissed when I waste 425 mana on a resist, but I get pissed even more when I waste about that much on turgurs, which implies the mob resisted twice and thus giving me quite the thrashing.  <br />
<br />
In other words, if I get a resist on bane, no matter if I get 3 in a row for that matter, at least I can stall the mob by just keeping epic on him and canni/torporing till back up to like 70, but I can't really stall a mob who's resisted 3 turgurs :(<br />
<br />
Btw, call me ignorant, maybe there's something I'm missing, but why would removing the dd component affect a dot's resistability?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Enchanters have the same problem with their DD's. One resist for stun and one for damage. Stun gets resisted a lot so their DDs hardly ever hit. Well until they get that high level one that either has no stun component or both checks are independent of each other.<br />
<br />
I think they should have it where each component of our dot is cchecked independently. If DD is resisted fully or partial, it shouldnt stop the dot. If dot part is resisted then mob isnt dotted. Wish my Bane stuck as much as winged death. there would be no stopping me in pvp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hrmm...lotta conflicting info in the thread. But I see how I completely overlooked the issues of resists.<br />
<br />
I believe the biggest problem the druids have with their epic isn't resists, but the fact that since so many Mobs can't be snared (in raid zones) the entire Epic effect (snare/dot) is useless.<br />
<br />
I was under the impression that our DoTs operated the same way Shandy mentioned:  one resist check, and if it lands, the DD component gets a chance to break root.<br />
<br />
But if things are operating differently, then maybe it would be nice if they modified it...not necessarily remove the DD component, but fiddled with the resists.<br />
<br />
PS - Remember when everyone was in an uproar about the Slows starting to land Disease counters, and people were discussing how they would get extra resist checks since it was a 'multi-part' spell?</div></div><hr />

It's both. If it's resisted, Wrath of Nature is resisted, not &quot;the snare portion was resisted&quot; or &quot;the damage-over-time component was resisted.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I think what he's trying to say is that he's never seen the DD part get resisted and yet the DOT still stick showing &quot;your bane has finished&quot; once it runs it's course.<br />
<br />
I cant remember the exact wording but you get my drift.<br />
<br />
[edit Threfore if the DD gets resisted the DOT automatcally gets resisted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Torelorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">This proves that if the DD component is resisted then the DoT component is resisted as well.  <br />
<br />
If there was a double check (DD then DoT) then people would be seeing Bane either hit for 150 and never wear off or resist the DD and then wear off.<br />
<br />
It proves that if you resist the initial DD then the whole spell (both components) is resisted.  There is no double check on the spell.  The DD component IS the resist check.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Um...what about fights that last 15 minutes?  Sure you buff up BEFORE the fight, then a shaman lands malo and then the other shaman can try to hit slow, cripple, ID, whatever.  That takes...oh, 2 minutes, with refreshes every 6 minutes.<br />
<br />
If all we do on a raid is buff/debuff, what the heck do we do the other 13 minutes of a fight?  <br />
<br />
Along with my mod rod machine duties, I'm looking forward to the proposed changes.  I would love the opportuntity to stack some dots with my fellow shaman on a raid.  I can't wait to have a decent out of group heal for assist healing the main tanks or rampage bait or anyone with 4K+ hitpoints that I can't heal effectively out of group with chloro.<br />
<br />
These are good changes for a raid shaman!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, I am going to differ with you on this one...<br />
<br />
Dain for example:<br />
<br />
What can we do?<br />
<br />
Poison DOT's stick and Disease DOT's stick.<br />
<br />
I have stuck Dain with BoN 3-5 times in a fight while another Shaman sticks Pox 3-5 times. Assist healing in between, also having dogdog chewing on him (yeah, dogdog is a DOT ;) )<br />
<br />
Not alot in the long run but every little bit of damage makes the fight shorter.<br />
<br />
Of course not every high end mob can be DOT'd but use what you can. It all adds up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Hannduvdeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I don't think there is any way we could prove the number of resist checks, but after grouping alot with my necro buddy, coincidence or not, my dots get resisted alot more than his dots (we're both 60).  Granted most of his are magic based, but the ones he uses have no DD component.  To me it's either simple paranoia, most mobs have high pr/dr, or two resist checks would explain why.<br />
<br />
IF there are two resist checks, it's set up so if one component passes but the other fails, neither components land, regardless of which is checked first.  Only if both pass will the whole land, all or nothing.<br />
<br />
Saying &quot;If there was a double check (DD then DoT) then people would be seeing Bane either hit for 150 and never wear off or resist the DD and then wear off&quot; isn't true if what I said above is true, which is how I've always thought it worked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Torelorm:  your example doesn't prove your hypothesis completely.<br />
<br />
It proves that if you resist the initial DD then the whole spell (both components) is resisted. <br />
Totally agree with you on this one.<br />
<br />
There is no double check on the spell. The DD component IS the resist check.<br />
There could be 30 different resist checks on the spell, but as long as the spell is set up so that one succesful resist negates the entire spell, the end result would be the same.<br />
<br />
What if the sequence of events was something along this lines:<br />
<br />
1. Cast spell.<br />
<br />
2.  See if mob can be hit by spell (targetable, LoS issues, etc).<br />
<br />
3.  Check resist on one 'effect' of the spell.<br />
<br />
4.  If spell is resisted, then display &quot;Soandso Resists!&quot; and go to 8.<br />
<br />
5.  Go back to step 3 until no more 'effect's on the spell.<br />
<br />
6.  Apply first effect of spell.<br />
<br />
7.  Go back to step 6 for until no more 'effect's on spell.<br />
<br />
8.  Do all the housekeeping of the spell (increase on Hatelist, put up buff icon, etc, etc.)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I personally have no problems with DoT resists on exp mobs. There are some that resist us, but, hey, *** like you can expect your dots to land on everything? And im sure they dont land on slowable ubermobs because they dont want us soloing them :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Two components to a spell make the spell have to check against multiple things. The way that many of them are set up however is as an all-or-nothing type spell. Our DoT spells are all or nothing. All of them are all or nothing. If the mob makes their save against the DD or the DoT, then the spell is completely resisted. At least this is the way I have always understood it. <br />
<br />
A good comparison would be to look at some of the other spells out there that are similar in a way. Like if you look at druid DoT's, they generally have a very low resist rate on them. However, there are a couple of druid DoT's (iirc) that also do something like lower AC or debuff some resistance at the same time and druid friends always used to complain about them. It is part of the reason that the druid/ranger line of root spells used to be so worthless way back when because the combination of giving the mob two chances to resist the effect (one a chance to resist the DD and the other the chance to resist the root) made it extremely difficult to land. <br />
<br />
Anyhow, comparisons aside, I believe we need something to be looked at regarding resist rates and not only for how it affects uber mobs, but also exp groups as well. Heck, we already have the worst nukes (straight up DD) of any caster class except for possibly the enchanter since we have received no damage upgrades since Kunark and our one line of actual DD spells is completely useless in 99% of encounters in a whole expansion. But i digress hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I don't generally see that many resists.  About as many as with the Curse of the Spirits, come to think of it.<br />
<br />
Between CastersRealm and Mobhunter there is a slew of notes about how the resist system is being reworked, and how spells will stack.... and with that, I'm gonna mosey to &quot;spells&quot; forum and post something about stacking...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Verant has said for the record that if a spell has two components, (like our DOTs) then there are two checks for resists.  If either component of the spell is resisted then the whole thing is resisted.  They spoke about this a while back but I can't remember the exact source, I'm pretty sure it was on the druid board.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Guys, while it certainly isn't conclusive evidence by any means, consider the druid epic which was recently changed.  It checked both snare and the DoT before it landed.  Now, given that EQ is standarized as much as possible, and that the original code was written about 4 years ago (depending on when the actual code was written during the design phaze), I tend to think that the chances of the DoT having only a single resistance check are very small.  I would put money on it following the same resist code as the druid epic--why call multiple subroutines?  I think Snap has it right.<br />
<br />
Basically, I think we just have a DoT that only lands if (a) the DD compnent hits for full, and (b) the mob also doesn't save vs. the DoT.  Maybe we'll get lucky and Absor or someone will answer the question (not holding my breath on this one!).<br />
<br />
Of course, with our luck with VI, we'll probably get it changed to where they have a resist every tic.  Expect to see a mob taking 3 damage a tic from BoN soon.  :p<br />
<br />
On a good note, maybe in November we'll actually see our first new post-50 damage spell in 2 years.  The bad news, is that its drop rate will be 1 in 300 off the rare spawn guild-raid level mobs and 'working as intended!'<br />
<br />
I've seen more copies of Sunstrike drop than torpor and malo!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">If all we do on a raid is buff/debuff, what the heck do we do the other 13 minutes of a fight? <br />
<br />
In most cases, this is what you would call a &quot;boss&quot; fight.  Except you often spend 1-4 hours clearing all the &quot;trash&quot; to get to this boss.  Not always the case (coth works wonders), but most often is.  ToV, PoH, PoG, PoF, The Deep, Umbral, Ssra, Sebilis etc.  So for the 2 average hours I've been busting my (_|_) buffing and debuffing, is it a crime to relax a little for those 13 minutes? :)<br />
<br />
Other than that, I help on backup heals and I still maintain that shaman dots are pretty much useless on very high end encounters.  A necro has this area covered, and he does a fine job at that.   On the other hand, the MT could always use more heals, and chances are it's those heals that are more likely to affect the successful outcome of the raid.  CHloop is far from always being fullproof and even if shamans heal a minimal amount of damage vs clerics, could buy the cleric the extra 2 seconds he needs to pull ch off.<br />
<br />
And you could tell me it's the extra 10k damage from dots that will mean the difference between life and death, but if the raid leaders are counting on your dots, then there's something wrong.  They are however counting on all the healing power they can get, and that's cool, better safe than sorry, especially in high end encounters with higher lag potential.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Oh, and as it stands now, we make for much better backup healers than druids.  Why?

Lately, they've been splitting focus' on items, like the 8th Shawl.<br />
Heck, even on shields (read the FoH general forum; hopefully it's true).    So, with this &quot;new&quot; technology, couldn't they just split the resists?   What I mean is,  if it resists the DD part, the actually DoT effect could still land.  You'd get two different messages.    They could even increase the DD damage  on our DoTs.  With DoT stacking, this could be rude.</div></div><hr />

Sorry, I should have elaborated a bit.  It's not exactly a focus, but a % of Block and an agro inducer (forget name) have been added to shields (not sure if all) on Test.   I just hope it's true and becomes live.   Both will benefit us in several situations.<br />
<br />
I wish shamans on Test would post stuff here.  Maybe that's asking alot, because of the Nixx fiasco, but it's a bit bumming to have to read other sites to get certain info.  If the casting time of Summon Food was lowered, I could care less if a Test shaman didn't post something about it, but some of these things are pretty major that affect us.</div></div><hr />

You are living in a fantasy world. Bane of nife is resisted at LEAST 40 times for every resist I get on my epic dot. Most of the mobs I xp on nowadays always get malo too.

If they can now seperate effects on items, I don't see why they can't seperate checks for DD's on our DoTS.   For the longest time, it was &quot;The Code won't allow this or that.&quot;   Things are changing that tune.</div></div><hr />

Last night in HoT it was my last HoT raid with my guild and we had like 6 shaman along.  I figured I'd go for damage.  I broke out Bane, EBolt and ToP and set up a friendly competition with a fellow shaman to see who could pull aggro first and live, just to see who's cleric was better.  Well, I gotta say on the lame single pulls we went to town and one bane would net me aggro long before it expired over some wizzie who had 3 crits, one for over 1100 dam (she was in my group and we didn't even get exp .. ACK!).  If I landed epic, bane and ebolt I was the the mobs friend for the duration of the fight.  Even backing off slowly would get me summoned fro more abuse (which I enjoy).  I found resists on Bane were very low aggro in HoT, but the aggro is totally different for a resisted PR DoT in Kael.  If I get a resist in the arena I get summoned. If I land, I get summoned ... I can't win except not to cast.  To overcome this on large mobs, our shaman have a DoT rotation where we plan who casts what do in what sequence and dot expirey is announced in a special raid channel.  Sorta like a CH chain except we rotate the spells we cast so that shaman don't necessarly cast the same high aggro DoT back to back.</div></div><hr />

What Eqphreak stated several posts above is an &quot;all-or-nothing&quot; situation.   There wouldn't be a need to take out the DD if there were real seperate checks for both.   So if the DD resists, the DoT may still land.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe before we get our pet we are like snareless druids with no worthy DD spells who can canni for mana.. but certainly not after. We are shaman.. we dont care about root breaking we tank mobs we solo heh. Hell.. keep the initial damage on bane.. but fix the double resist check hehe.</div></div><hr />

No offense, but shaman dots dont mean jack on a high end mob.  You get enough aggro from slow, don't think you wanna tamper with Bane.  It's not that our dots suck, but it's not our jobs on raids.  We're there to buff/debuff, that's plenty enough.<br />
 <br />
<br />
Pfft.  I routinely stack Pox, Bane, and Epic on VT bosses.  My group gets the exp more often than not, without any wizzies.  Three shaman, one malo's/sini, one slows, you want the other one to sit there and twiddle his thumbs?  Besides, I kinda like getting exp off them :)  Throw heals on the MT in between dots if your able, and your contributing more than what your shaman would be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Normal DD spells allow for partial resists. <br />
<br />
Single component dots do not...they stick or they dont. <br />
<br />
Our multicomponent dots NEVER EVER show partial resists on the DD portion.<br />
<br />
I believe this is the problem. If the DD portion is resisted even the tiniest amount then the entire spell is resisted completely. And on high level mobs partial resists on DD spells are very common. This can only be made worse if indeed the DD and dot portion have separate checks. <br />
<br />
So<br />
<br />
chance of bane being resisted =<br />
(odds of partial/total resist on the DD component)<br />
times <br />
(odds of resist on the dot)<br />
<br />
whereas <br />
<br />
chance of epic being resisted =<br />
(odds of resist for dot)<br />
<br />
<br />
Our multicomponent dots are resisted WAY more than dots without DD components.<br />
<br />
<br />
The fix is not just to eliminate the DD component, but rather to make it a pure dot doing the same total damage over the same time...absorb the DD damage into the dot portion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">I just remembered, they have had a dot that has a DD portion and dot portion and it isnt all or nothing. It is the level 12 enchanter dot 'Choke'. When I played my chanter I would notice the DD portion getting partial resisted. I think the DD portion did 10 dam, but I would see hits from anywhere from 2 - 10. Then the dot would stick.<br />
<br />
I remember this because I was fighting really twinked out people on Rallos who had 70+ MR. Nothing I had would stick as a chanter, except that dot. So I would stick it and run around.<br />
<br />
So there has been spells with someway around the whole two resist thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Yo, I'm not saying shaman dots aren't nice as I live and literally die by bane in solo situations, but in high end raids, they're kinda useless.  <br />
<br />
You can tell me you've stuck 20 banes on THO, how about the the time you spent clearing all the mobs on the way?  You're telling me you consider shaman dots useful on high end encounters just because you get to use it on one boss during the entire raid?  People are giving me examples here, about Dain, THO, and whatever else, but how about the regular flurry drakes, moktors, wurms, shissars, etc?  That's right, you have your hands full debuffing em while the necro has the dots covered, just like he does on said boss mob.  <br />
<br />
By the end of the raid, your 20 banes will turn out rather insignificant compared to a necro's dots, lifetaps, and dd's, so  you're not really looking at the big picture.  Every bit helps, but since your total damage output is rather minimal, better stick to backup healing.  <br />
<br />
Of course, same applies to shaman healing, it comes nowhere close to a cleric's ability, but all it takes is the next cleric in line to lag for just 2 second and you can kiss your MT goodbye, significantly increasing the probability of raid failure.  If you miss a dot, it's not nearly as endangering.<br />
<br />
And THO is slowable btw, from what I heard it's a laughable fight compared to other high end encounters.  Only catch is all the crap you have to clear on the way, which only justifies what I said above.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can tell me you've stuck 20 banes on THO, how about the the time you spent clearing all the mobs on the way? <br />
- 2 ways to get to THO: <br />
AE your way and hop over the invis bridge.<br />
Fight about (IIRC) 6 tough elders from Ssra zone after being CoHd there. In both cases shamans are useless, elders are unslowable and wizards take care of the AE. But, you can DoT elders, and you should too. Their respawn is 6 minutes.<br />
<br />
 People are giving me examples here, about Dain, THO, and whatever else, <br />
- They are valid endgame mob examples. Unlike your moktors, wurms and shissar.<br />
<br />
but how about the regular flurry drakes, moktors, wurms, shissars, etc?  That's right, you have your hands full debuffing em while the necro has the dots covered, just like he does on said boss mob.  <br />
- You said: No offense, but shaman dots dont mean jack on a high end mob.  I am sorry but a regular shissar in Ssra is not endgame mob. It's called yardtrash. The only mob worth attention in the above list is the flurry drake, until slowed. But yah, I should waste a 2 minute DoT on a mob that will die in under 20 seconds. Also I didn't realize necros have Curse of the Spirits, Bane of Nife and/or Pox of Bertoxxulous. I don't even slow most snakes in Ssra because of their lifespawn being ultra short. But yeah, they are endgame mobs.<br />
<br />
By the end of the raid, your 20 banes will turn out rather insignificant compared to a necro's dots, lifetaps, and dd's, so  you're not really looking at the big picture. <br />
- Yeah, I should debuff, slow, DoT mobs that will die within seconds of their pull. But you are correct, I don't see the &quot;big&quot; picture. Oh and one question, do the enthralled outcasts drop the loot you want or the THO?<br />
<br />
 Every bit helps, but since your total damage output is rather minimal, better stick to backup healing. <br />
- ROFLMAO. Do you realize how retarded shaman backup healing sounds? Do you know that one single cast of Chlororblast is about 1/3d of the damage the Avatar of War does in ONE SINGLE HIT. By the way, AoW quads 1150 and flurries and has virtually no weapon delay. But yeah, I should waste my mana backup healing. McFly!? Hello!? Funny story though, on Vyz'dhra the Cursed, 2 MT clerics went LD, I was the Torpor Hoe of the group, snake being slowed, MT went down very fast (bad timed flurry). I was chaincasting Chloroblast with 2 clerics still in rotation but didn't see MT's HP move up, instead of down. By the time he got attention from other healers, he was dead. But yeah, we own at backup healing.<br />
<br />
significantly increasing the probability of raid failure.  <br />
- It's called druids doing spot healing or even clerics. NT/DL owns Chloroblast. Shaman increased considerably the raid's succes by making sure clerics are Torpored or mages and of course, making sure (insert boss mob here) is debuffed and kept debuffed.<br />
<br />
And THO is slowable btw, from what I heard it's a laughable fight compared to other high end encounters.  Only catch is all the crap you have to clear on the way, which only justifies what I said above. <br />
- LMAO, no it doesn't, while you go pow wow backup healing, I'll go Torpor a mage and supply the raid with endless mana. Oh and by the way, if you go from Echo Caverns zone, all you need to clear that &quot;crap&quot; are 4 wizards and 2 enchanters and a puller. Then you got about 6 (IIRC) Elders to clear on 6 min spawn, then  you are in the lair with about 6 (IIRC) Elders who are on 90min+ spawn. So all you preached about DoTs sucking and DoTs being useless resumes in about 12 tough mobs (wich you can DoT fine) and boss. /golf clap.<br />
<br />
But from another view our DoTs do suck. Not because of DPS or mana/damage ratio, but because retarded monkey coders at Verant can't realize that DD component is making it easy to resist. Have I had no DD component on BoN, I could have landed 30+ on THO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Yeah, I should debuff, slow, DoT mobs that will die within seconds of their pull.<br />
<br />
That's because our role as damage dealers on a high end raid is ineffective, and that's the very essence of what I've been arguing.  Kunark era, our dots were pretty bad@$$ (bane was the highest damage dot at the time), but mobs had 32k hps too.  If you wanna talk high end now, even the &quot;yard trash&quot; has 3 times that much.  However, we didn't get any upgrades.  Necros did tho, lifeburn (AA), funeral pyre, gangrenous touch, and conglaciation of bone.  Oh damn, that's right, I forgot, we got blast of poison!<br />
<br />
It's called druids doing spot healing or even clerics. NT/DL owns Chloroblast. <br />
<br />
Check out the Druid's Grove sometime, ask em about how efficient NT is.  But if ya wanna get into semantics, here goes.  NT heals about 1k damage for 400 mana and has a 5.5 second cast time.  Chloroblast heals about 450 damage for 175 and has a 3 second cast time.  Put 2 and 2 together, NT costs twice as much mana as chloroblast, heals twice the amount of damage, and has twice the cast time.  <br />
<br />
I won't discuss DL because I never denied a cleric's superior healing ability (duh), but if you're gunna tell me NT owns Chloroblast, you're entirely wrong.  <br />
<br />
So tell me again, why should we let druids do the spot healing instead?  Shamans and druids alike are given the same mana regen buffs, except shamans have the added advantage of cannibalize.  Which means we have at least twice the mana pool to heal the MT.  <br />
<br />
With this in mind, and applying it to your AoW example, you said:<br />
Do you realize how retarded shaman backup healing sounds? Do you know that one single cast of Chlororblast is about 1/3d of the damage the Avatar of War does in ONE SINGLE HIT. <br />
<br />
Ok, DL heals 2/3rds of the damage the Avatar of War does in ONE SINGLE HIT, but the druid also takes twice as long to cast the spell genius!  Look at the big picture, you've just proven to me you can't.<br />
<br />
And if I were to boldly proclaim that druids are often used as backup healers on raids, would you flip?  If the answer's no, then a shaman has every right to be backup healer too.<br />
<br />
People are giving me examples here, about Dain, THO, and whatever else, <br />
- They are valid endgame mob examples. Unlike your moktors, wurms and shissar. <br />
<br />
<br />
Consistency is nice, and by judging what you call &quot;yard trash&quot;, Dain is not endgame.<br />
<br />
All of this to say my view on the matter hasn't changed, dots don't mean jack on high end encounters where you could otherwise use your mana healing the MT.  Torporing the modding clerics too, but personally I haven't ever been called upon to do so.  Don't feel I need to either since we win most of our fights, so I mainly chain chloroblast, score a crit every once, and relish in a job well done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">Whether they're useful... useless... whatever. I'd still like to actually have a chance to use them. Even if it's only because I can. Have spare debuff slots... will stack dots.<br />
<br />
And I don't know about the rest of you, but I very regularly bounce VoS and EBolt from NPCs (Like 1 in 20 sticks) even though I have about 30-40 unbuffed PR in normal grind gear (yay for the non-uber!). <br />

However, I also routinely have lowbie green (VERY green) Necro's stick Heat Blood with about 120FR.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Kinda strange.   Druids I know use NT all the time, especially with critical heal.   Amazing how efficient it becomes.  They critical heal more than you think.   If 2 seconds was shaved off long ago, druids would have nothing to complain about.</div></div><hr />

- Oh you mean the golden age of Kunark where 95% of the then endgame mobs were immune to any magic but lures. I remember that. Chardok royals, Ixiblat Fer, Nexona, Innoruuk maybe and Thunder Princess and Protector of Sky were castable on by shamans. The most important targets were immune to any shaman magic so there goes your theory.<br />
<br />
If you wanna talk high end now, even the &quot;yard trash&quot; has 3 times that much. <br />
- Oh right. We still fight with Ykeshas or Bloodpoints. And we still use only Kunark spells (ironically shamans yes). Oh and in Kunark we had AA skills right?<br />

Put 2 and 2 together, NT costs twice as much mana as chloroblast, heals twice the amount of damage, and has twice the cast time.  <br />
- You owned yourself with Put 2 and 2 together AND 5.5 second THEN twice the cast time. 3 + 3 in my book is 6, not 5.5. You also seem to forget that Chloroblast is not a spell that instantly heals 420some HP and in exactly 3 seconds heals another 420some HP. Are you aware that your brain needs 0.7 seconds average to react on any situation. Are you aware that a packet can take a half a second to travel from your PC to server IF you have 0% packet loss, if not can take a lot more? Are you aware that graphics lag can cause slower transmission of messages between objects of the client? Even if those 2 spells are IDENTICAL ratio wise, in the real world they'll never be. And this alone makes NT &gt; Chloroblast. <br />
<br />
 but if you're gunna tell me NT owns Chloroblast, you're entirely wrong.  <br />
- Yeah, 3 + 3 = 5.5. <br />
<br />
Ok, DL heals 2/3rds of the damage the Avatar of War does in ONE SINGLE HIT, but the druid also takes twice as long to cast the spell genius!  <br />
- 2/3 is larger than 1/3.<br />
- 3 + 3 != 5.5.<br />
<br />
And if I were to boldly proclaim that druids are often used as backup healers on raids, would you flip?  If the answer's no, then a shaman has every right to be backup healer too.<br />
- You can also put melee to bandage instead of doing full DPS. You can also ask mages to nuke instead of supplying the raid with endless mana. You can ask many things that would work but are INEFFICIENT. Isn't that the point of your DoT ramblings?<br />
<br />
Consistency is nice, and by judging what you call &quot;yard trash&quot;, Dain is not endgame.<br />
- We can kill AoW but I still consider the Dain 425 to be quite an entertaining fight. It also takes about 30ish people. A Shissar Arch Warlock takes only 3 people though. Moktors in UP take what? One solid group. When the Dain 425 is killed with less than 3 groups, it stops being an endgame mob, in my book.<br />
<br />
All of this to say my view on the matter hasn't changed, dots don't mean jack on high end encounters <br />
- Correct. 35+k Damage on THO means nothing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Yeah, 3 + 3 = 5.5<br />
<br />
No comment.  If you wanna be real anal about it, why not tell me 450 + 450 != 1k and that 175 + 175 != 400?   But I'll play along with your little charade here, and make the exact calculations.  <br />
<br />
Nature's Touch heals exactly 978 damage and chloroblast 428.  Therefore, NT heals 2.29 times as much damage as Chloroblast.<br />
<br />
NT costs 400 mana and chloroblast 175.  Therefore, NT costs 2.29 times the amount of mana as Chloroblast.  <br />
<br />
NT takes 5.5 seconds to cast and chloroblast 3.  Therefore, the casting time on NT is 1.83 times the casting time of Chloroblast.<br />
<br />
Do you realize how retarded that sounds?  Familiar with the concept of generalization?   NT and Chloroblast have the same exact same healing/mana ratio so far as those 2 variables are concerned, NT is no better than chloroblast.  <br />
<br />
Now we're looking at the cast time, and if you're gunna diss me over a mere 0.2 discrepancy (2-1.8), I'm sorry to say, but you're hanging by a very thin thread.  <br />
<br />
Now you can continue feeding me the nitty-griddy smart-alecky remarks, but how on Earth does a discrepancy of 0.2 qualify NT as pure ownage over Chloroblast?  You're wrong, admit it.<br />
<br />
And look at this way.  Since both NT and Chloroblast have the same exact healing/mana ratio, who do you think is gunna be able to heal the most amount of damage, assuming that both have the same total amount of mana to start with?  That's right, the shaman because he can cannibalize whilst the druid is just sitting there, fanning his balls, totally dependant of kei and potg.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh you mean the golden age of Kunark where 95% of the then endgame mobs were immune to any magic but lures. I remember that. Chardok royals, Ixiblat Fer, Nexona, Innoruuk maybe and Thunder Princess and Protector of Sky were castable on by shamans. The most important targets were immune to any shaman magic so there goes your theory<br />
<br />
I can't start to tell you how incredibly wrong you are on this one.  Here's a quite a long list of slowable mobs that were considered high end during Kunark era:<br />
1) Master Yael (Hole)<br />
2) Ixiblat Fer (BW) - and just because you mentionned it doesn't magically disqualify it.<br />
3) Overking (Chardok)<br />
4) Prince (Chardok)<br />
5) Queen (Chardok)<br />
6) Sebilite Protector (Sebilis)<br />
7) Tolapumj (Sebilis)<br />
8) Guardian Wurm (SF)<br />
9) Guardian Wurm (VP)<br />
10) Nexona (VP)<br />
11) Bladestorm (PoA)<br />
14) Overseer of Air (PoA)<br />
15) Protector of Sky (PoA)<br />
16) Spiroc Guardian (PoA)<br />
17) Dracoliche (PoF)<br />
18) Dread<br />
19) Fright<br />
20) Innoruuk (PoH)<br />
21) Most second floor of PoH actually, including the nameds.<br />
22) Drusella Sathir (HS)<br />
23) Phinnigel Autropos (Kedg0r)<br />
<br />
So I'd say this 95% of yours is slightly exagerated, unless you can provide me with 400 counter-examples.  Make sure to include Mayong Mistmoore, that'd be a good laugh.<br />
<br />
Ok now what other high end mobs are unslowable?  Lets see:<br />
1) General V'Ghara<br />
2) Lord Ghiosk (joke)<br />
3) Rak'Ashiir (haha 4 mage pets, 4 clerics max, very high end)<br />
4) Neh'Ashiir<br />
5) VS<br />
6) Cazic Thule<br />
7) Enraged Golem<br />
8) Terror<br />
9) Coercer T'Vala<br />
10) Bout 2/3 of the boss mobs in PoA. <br />
11) Hoshkar<br />
12) Silverwing<br />
13) Trak<br />
14) Gore<br />
15) Sev<br />
16) Talendor<br />
17) Ragefire<br />
18) Faydedar<br />
19) Phara Dar<br />
20) Druushk (educated guess)<br />
<br />
And of those 20, I know of 4 that are vulnerable to disease and/or poison:  Ragefire, Silverwing, Terror, and Coercer T'Vala.  <br />
<br />
Oh right. We still fight with Ykeshas or Bloodpoints. And we still use only Kunark spells (ironically shamans yes). Oh and in Kunark we had AA skills right? <br />
<br />
Um, ok, but that wasn't really my point.   2K dot on 32k hp mob, 2k dot on 100k hp mob, you do the math (obviously not your forte).  Actually, I really don't know what your point is.  You're telling me melees have received significant armour and weapon upgrades, and...?  They were compensated for in the increase in hp of high end mobs, we were not in dots.<br />
<br />
Which leads to your next statement:<br />
This has nothing to do with the spell being efficient. BoN or PoX are still nice spells despite the lack of upgrades. Let's not turn this into a necro class envy post. When the shaman class is nerfed into the ground as the necro class was, then let's complain. Not before. <br />
<br />
When did I ever make reference to shaman vs necro envy?  I dare you, no I double dog dare to quote me on that one.  If I remember correctly, I said shamans had their hands full on buffing/debuffing that necros are much more efficient in this area.  Nah, I have every reason to envy them, they always gank my spot in groups, I hate their corpse summoning monopoly with a passion, and seeing them inflict 5x the amount of dmg I am just makes me wanny cry :(<br />
<br />
You can also put melee to bandage instead of doing full DPS. You can also ask mages to nuke instead of supplying the raid with endless mana. You can ask many things that would work but are INEFFICIENT. Isn't that the point of your DoT ramblings? <br />
<br />
No not really.  At least between dotting and backup healing, there's a certain tradeoff which I went at lengths to explain, but I'd like to see you come up with an ingenius explanation as to how there can be any plausible tradeoff between bandaging and meleeing.  Hey, let's face it, you're not gunna budge on your stance, and I'm not gunna budge on mine, but please don't use ludicrous examples.<br />
<br />
Moktors in UP take what? One solid group<br />
HAHA, not even, I soloed Dralkenr with no buffs but my own.  But if you'll read more attentively, and I believe you even quoted me yourself on that:<br />
but how about the regular flurry drakes, moktors, wurms, shissars, etc? <br />
<br />
/majorbogglebomb<br />
<br />
And why do you think I brought moktors up in the first place in reference to &quot;yard trash&quot;?  That's right, Doomshade, Rumblecrush, etc.  The way our guild does it is pull a massive train of them to clear the area for boss pull (especially DS), and yes they need to be slowed.</div></div><hr />

No comment.  If you wanna be real anal about it, why not tell me 450 + 450 != 1k and that 175 + 175 != 400?   But I'll play along with your little charade here, and make the exact calculations.  <br />
- 0.5 seconds is more than enough for one packet to be sent to server. 0.5 seconds per spell means after 12 NTs you gained the TIME advantage to cast another one. This of course keeping count how Chloroblast will be cast the exact same time as the one lands with absolutely no lag, 0 ms time to server and so on. Of course that's a pipe dream. <br />
<br />
NT costs 400 mana and chloroblast 175.  Therefore, NT costs 2.29 times the amount of mana as Chloroblast.  <br />
- Mana cost is irrelevant. God rods take care of it.<br />
<br />
Now we're looking at the cast time, and if you're gunna diss me over a mere 0.2 discrepancy (2-1.8), I'm sorry to say, but you're hanging by a very thin thread.  <br />
- In a 10 min intense fight a la AoW, the .2 seconds you shave off casting time means that you are gaining heal amount advantage because you can squeeze in an extra NT. 12 NT != 24 Chloroblast. 13 NT = 24 Chloroblasts. You gained ONE EXTRA NT. One thousand HP worth of extra heal in the SAME BLOODY TIME. But yeah, both spells are the same ratio.<br />
<br />
 You're wrong, admit it.<br />
- 3 + 3 = 5.5.<br />
<br />
2) Ixiblat Fer (BW) - and just because you mentionned it doesn't magically disqualify it.<br />
- I clearly said they can be affected by shaman spells. Unless you got reading and comprehension problems.<br />
<br />
5) Queen (Chardok)<br />
- Early queen fights lasted 20 seconds tops. You had no other option.<br />
<br />
6) Sebilite Protector (Sebilis)<br />
7) Tolapumj (Sebilis)<br />
- You forgot to add a drolwarg to your list, and Lord Crush. Oh and Ambassador D'Vynn too.<br />
<br />
8) Guardian Wurm (SF)<br />
- I tanked one of these before Velious. Nowhere near &quot;endgame&quot;.<br />
<br />
21) Most second floor of PoH actually, including the nameds.<br />
- You mean after Velious was released?<br />
<br />
22) Drusella Sathir (HS)<br />
23) Phinnigel Autropos (Kedg0r)<br />
- Phinigel was ubermob pre Kunark. With Kunark it was ... yes ... yardtrash.<br />
<br />
1) General V'Ghara<br />
2) Lord Ghiosk (joke)<br />
3) Rak'Ashiir (haha 4 mage pets, 4 clerics max, very high end)<br />
4) Neh'Ashiir<br />
5) VS<br />
6) Cazic Thule<br />
7) Enraged Golem<br />
8) Terror<br />
9) Coercer T'Vala<br />
10) Bout 2/3 of the boss mobs in PoA. <br />
11) Hoshkar<br />
12) Silverwing<br />
13) Trak<br />
14) Gore<br />
15) Sev<br />
16) Talendor<br />
17) Ragefire<br />
18) Faydedar<br />
19) Phara Dar<br />
20) Druushk (educated guess)<br />
- My point exactly. All the important bosses were immune to nearly all magic. Oh wait, Phinigel the one group mob isn't part of this list. Sev - Warrior epic, Gore - Paladin/bard epic, Trakanon - Emperor Sssra of Kunark and so on.<br />
<br />
And of those 20, I know of 4 that are vulnerable to disease and/or poison:  Ragefire, Silverwing, Terror, and Coercer T'Vala.  <br />
- All of the above with a lifespan of ... about ... 20 seconds tops. But yeah, our DoTs OWNED HARDCORE these mobs.<br />
<br />
Um, ok, but that wasn't really my point.   2K dot on 32k hp mob, 2k dot on 100k hp mob, you do the math (obviously not your forte).  <br />
- Yes use a 2 minute DoT on .... Queen of Chardok that will die in less then 20 seconds. Neat. The power of DoTs realy shows with mobs OVER 100k HP. Those fights last long and whatever you beleive it or not, I can do close to rogue damage on mobs like Creator or THO. And for necros, is not even a close match.<br />
<br />
Actually, I really don't know what your point is.  You're telling me melees have received significant armour and weapon upgrades, and...?  They were compensated for in the increase in hp of high end mobs, we were not in dots.<br />
- ADD? Problem comprehending basic english? You say: If you wanna talk high end now, even the &quot;yard trash&quot; has 3 times that much. Yardtrash even if it's 3 times as powerful as was yardtrash in Kunark era, with the gear upgrades and AA skill upgrades we have, it's still the same thing. They are nowhere near challenging as the boss of the zone. Thus the term &quot;yardtrash&quot;. Of course comparing yardtrash of today LIKE you did it with Kunark era yardtrash is retarded. Because of the zillions of upgrades we got.<br />
<br />
<br />
When did I ever make reference to shaman vs necro envy? <br />
- Necros have upgrades. Necros have good DoTs. Necros this, necros that.<br />
<br />
 I said shamans had their hands full on buffing/debuffing that necros are much more efficient in this area. <br />
- Nope: However, we didn't get any upgrades. Necros did tho, lifeburn (AA), funeral pyre, gangrenous touch, and conglaciation of bone. Oh damn, that's right, I forgot, we got blast of poison! . The way I see it, you are envious for necros getting tons of upgrades and us Blast of Poison.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">How about addressing the issue about total amount healed instead of delving into further technicalities such as lag and packet loss?  God, you're speaking as though druid heal is the own now and that the 0.5 delay can literally mean the difference between life and death, especially when you have 10 backup healers in the background.  <br />
<br />
And I just noticed another error in your calculations (getting used to it by now...).  It's not 0.5 seconds because you're multiplying the 3 second casting time from chloroblast by 2 which is 6.  What you're doing is 6 - 5.5 = 0.5, which is wrong.  You have to divide that 0.5 by 2 because you were multiplying the casting time of chloroblast by 2 in the first place.  So now you have you have a 0.25 discrepancy and those 12 NT's you were talking about now mysteriously turned into 24.  <br />
<br />
Come to think of it, you're really making no sense.   Assuming standard_l33t_druid has a total of 4000 mana, this means he would have to burn over 2 complete manabars to actually perform those 24 NT's, and consequently have time for one extra cast.  A druid has more downtime than a shaman, and thus the shaman, if fully committed to healing like a druid, will be able to heal more amounts of damage while the druid is medding.  So by the end of those 24 NT's, I'm sorry to say, but the shaman would have healed more.<br />
<br />
So can you drop this already? Or you wanna talk nanoseconds?<br />
<br />
Mana cost is irrelevant. God rods take care of it. <br />
<br />
Sure, in this hypothetical situation of yours, druid can regain his mana like a god, but if you look at the big picture, do you think there's an endless supply of god rods just lying there to be picked up?  Even if every caster equipped one before the fight, druid would use the charges relatively soon and maybe pick a couple off the ground during the fight.  Was always my impression that clerics had priority to rods in combat tho, but I could be wrong...<br />
<br />
On top of that, rodding costs you your health.  Somehow, druid needs to replenish that health.  Clerics are most prolly busy healing MT, and shamans can always torpor you, true, but how about the 6 seconds the shaman is wasting on torporing you when he could have been chloroblasting the MT instead?  Last I checked, a 6 second discrepancy far exceeds that of 0.25.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Ok, now why did you choose to omit most of the boss mobs that you had no problems with in my list?  2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 21 (!), 22, and 23.  Hmm, if I'm not mistaken you chose to ignore the 15 others I mentionned, but yet still label Phinnigel Autropos as the 23rd, as I did on my list.  Dunno, seems kinda misleading to me, screams out false representation of facts.<br />
<br />
BTW:<br />
- Phinnigel: wiz, mage, bard, and rogue epic<br />
- Overking: cleric epic<br />
- Queen: warrior epic<br />
- Prince: chanter epic<br />
- High Scale Kirn: shaman epic (and arguably harder than Rak/Neh because of the stuff you had to clear on the way)<br />
- Ixiblat: cleric epic<br />
<br />
These aren't important bosses?  Please explain.  I'd go so far as to say every epic mob is important, can't just walk up to epic quest dude and say &quot;YO! Here's my scale!  Gibb0r me epic I got the hardest part!&quot;<br />
<br />
Now I'm gunna quote what you said a couple posts ago:<br />
Oh you mean the golden age of Kunark where 95% of the then endgame mobs were immune to any magic but lures. I remember that. Chardok royals, Ixiblat Fer, Nexona, Innoruuk maybe and Thunder Princess and Protector of Sky were castable on by shamans<br />
<br />
I put Thunder Spirit Princess in bold there for good reason.  You included her in the list of your kunark-era endgame mobs.  Well, she has about 20k and doubles for 260, I know this first hand because I soloed her.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, you're telling me a guardian wurm was nowhere near endgame.  In case ya didn't know, a guardian wurm hits for about twice the damage of Thunder Spirit Princess.  So please make up your mind, if you're gunna set Thunder Spirit Princess as a standard for endgame mob, stick to it because now you're only contradicting yourself.  Consistency is nice, dj-vu anyone?<br />
<br />
In this respect, all the mobs listed satisfy your criteria of end game.  Except Second Floor Hate, I was wrong on that one, my bad.<br />
<br />
Finally, if you wanna go on thinking I have necro envy, it's your perogative, I don't care.  I know shamans kick ass as is, and the reason why I brought up the necro's increasing efficiency in damage dealing was to prove how inefficient we have become, and how we should stick other priorities such as buffing, debuffing, and backup healing.  <br />
<br />
Come to think of it, the very statement that instigated so many responses does nothing but prove my point:<br />
No offense, but shaman dots dont mean jack on a high end mob. You get enough aggro from slow, don't think you wanna tamper with Bane. It's not that our dots suck, but it's not our jobs on raids. We're there to buff/debuff, that's plenty enough.<br />
<br />
That's... plenty... enough<br />
Problem comprehending basic english?  <br />

I don't want to step on any toes here with the quote quote quote's but any druid still casting 5.5sec heals is not wearing any focus items. Last time I checked the local mage can cut another 10% off that. Sorry that doesn't help chloroblasts. :D<br />
<br />
As for DoT's and uber mobs. 1 shaman can easily keep BoN on a target nonstop and that alone is 35dps. Thats more then ALOT of melee's do on some encounters. Throw in some nukes and you just made yourself more damaging then most bards and warriors.<br />
Throw in some more DoT's and you will approach rogue/monk damage. <br />
Don't underestimate the power of the shaman arsenal.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">Nektar dude,<br />
<br />
0.5 (the seconds you save, for the math challenged 6 - 5.5 = 0.5) x 12 = 6. How long does it take to cast one NT? 5.5 seconds. So after 12 NTs, you have TIME to cast one extra. With focus items, it's a bit more NTs. Again MANA is irrelevant with mages spitting rods left and right. We are not talking about a pow wow XP group but RAID. And if you think lagspikes, lack of attention, graphics lag means nothing, why are in most fights clerics with uber machines and great video cards LOOKING AT A WALL? Yes, to avoid graphics lag between heals. Same thing with druids. If it's not to avoid lag than why? By using chloroblast you DOUBLE the chances for lag, packet loss, lack of attention and whatnot. Must be hard to understand for someone who thinks 3 + 3 = 5.5.<br />
<br />
On top of that, rodding costs you your health.<br />
- Super Seekrit Raid Strategy: We have one dedicated cleric bot and shaman for these purposes, depending on fight even more shamans. You rod, feel free. Some bot or a shaman will heal you np. Works awesome for us. Oh and Cannibalizing doesn't cost you health?<br />
<br />
Et puis mon ami Nektar, pourtant tu a dit pas mal plus que trois mots, tu a clairement dit que les necros ont eu pas mal de mises a jours et que nous autres on a eu rien,  part un spell merdique. Et avec ceci tu a clairement dmontr ton envie face au necros. Et tu peux m'insulter en francais si ca te tente ou en allemand aussi.<br />
<br />
Oh and  Nah, I have every reason to envy them, they always gank my spot in groups, I hate their corpse summoning monopoly with a passion, and seeing them inflict 5x the amount of dmg I am just makes me wanny cry  <br />
- You sound like a crappy shaman.<br />
<br />
Oh, I get it now, you're diverting the focus of the argument because you're running dry on ideas. It's ok, here's a cookie for your effort.<br />
- Yes, I am still waiting for the downplay of doing 35k+ damage to a current endgame mob. Wich is way more than non-rogue melee due to the nature of the AE of the mob. Countless other people have pointed out that our DoTs are nice when not resisted and account for a lot of damage. And your answer was? Nothing. You can't deny facts. You also can't deny the fact that Queen of chardok lived 20 seconds tops. Everyone went in full offensive. Thus any DoTs sucked on her, despite your DoT being 1 mana for 10000 damage over 45 seconds. <br />
<br />
Visc, my dain cloak (Spell Haste III) affects Choroblast too, so making it 2.5 sec cast time. And NT becomes 4.7 sec cast time. Again, showing how NT has faster cast time. For our math challenged buddy Nektar, 2.5 + 2.5 = 5 and NOT 4.7.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Oaks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">Nektars cluelessness is pretty funny. Let him stand around chloroblasting the main tank while the real shaman do some damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">You wanna get down to the very knitty-griddy?  I don't care how fast you think a druid can regain his mana, but at some point, he has to stop for rods.  First, you can tell me he's clever enough to hotkey his first rod, but at some point or another, he's gunna have to waste a few seconds picking them off the ground.   So in the end, the time he would have saved chaining all those NT's are wasted by the few seconds he spent searching for the rods.  <br />
<br />
And yet you had the nerve to talk to me about pipe dreams.  Keep convincing yourself that a druid will regain 400 mana every 6 seconds, just enough to keep NT flawlessly chained.  Lol, you're never going to convince me on that one no matter how hard you try.  <br />
<br />
First of all, you've failed to see the big picture again.  Why on Earth would a cleric heal a modding druid when a cleric's heals are much better to start off with?  He's wasting his healing mana so that a druid can keep up with his own heals?  Your logic totally eludes me on this one.<br />
<br />
As for the shaman and torpor, for the sake of argument, let's assume the druid had time advantage and the means for keeping his mana refreshed at the rate of 400 mana per 6 seconds (please, but ok...).  You're still completely ignoring the casting time on torpor, which is an extra 6 seconds, around 5 with focus items.  And I honestly don't wanna get into how frequently a druid would have rod and conversely how often a shaman would have to spend 5 seconds casting torpor on him.<br />
<br />
In short, what you're telling me is all theory, and even though I used the same theory to assume that 2 chloroblasts could be casted without delay, you're much wronger in assuming that mana is irrelevant.  On top of that, you're imposing more and more constraints it's not even funny.  Yeah, let's assume there's just enough mages present at every raid to keep all casters manahappy on rods.  If you don't have enough mages to keep everyone supplied with rods, you're not uber.  Yeah ok.  <br />
<br />
You wanna be realistic for once?  Afterlife's roster lists 2 mages for example, and Triton 5.  But SUUUURE Zorlac, they can keep all clerics AND druids manahappy at all times.  I'm dropping this end of the stick, I'll admit I was wrong in my calculations and dividing the 0.5 second delay by 2, but when are you gunna be man enough to step up to the plate and admit you're guilty of overly simplifying the situation?<br />
<br />
Now you can find valid grounds to dispute some of the things I said, and try to boost your ego from there, but if you're not willing to look at big picture, I don't see why I should continue bickering over slight technicalities.  In the long run, a shaman will have healed more damage than the druid in the same amount of time, period (assuming both were fully commited to healing). This is common sense.<br />
<br />
<br />
Et je m'en bats les couilles mais royalement de ton Franais.  Si j'avais su que t'allais me gerber un discour  la con,  partir d'une simple phrase sans obscnits, je m'aurais tu.  T'aimes a tapette?  Du kannst auch mein Arsch lecken :D<br />
<br />
You sound like a crappy shaman. <br />
I don't know you, you don't know me, and as much as you think I insulted you, I never insulted your character.  Really classy there Zorlac.<br />
<br />
And if there is one thing I pride myself in is my solo capabilities.  When you're soloing, you're not exactly taking a backseat and sticking to buffing/debuffing, you have to handle everything yourself.  So if there's a pristine example that demonstrates a shaman's non-crapinness, it's through his soloing capabilities.  Screenshots k?  K!<br />

<br />
<br />
So like yeah, you're right, I totally envy necros because of their more efficient dots.  Get real, they come nowhere close to our solo capabilities, and being as though I solo a lot, think I kinda know there's nothing to envy from them.  <br />
<br />
And in light of all this, if you're gunna tell me I'm a crappy shaman, how about all the others who aren't capable of taking down mobs listed above?  Never considered myself the uberest shaman out there (just look at my gear...), but I play the cards I'm dealt with, and I think I play them pretty damn well thank you very much.  <br />
<br />
I'm not gunna stoop down to your level either and insult your character's integrity, but lemme tell you this - before opening that mouth of yours, make sure you know what the F you're talking about instead of looking like a total @$$ afterwards.<br />
<br />
And your answer was? <br />
<br />
Oh, now you're playing that game too?  Let he who is without sin cast the first stone.  Who ignored 15 mobs off my slowable mobs' list?  Who took the remaining 8 and labelled the last as 23 to distort the facts?  Who's the one who shut up about my choice of high end mobs because Zorlac himself set the Thunder Spirit Princess as a standard for high end mob?  Consequently, who was being the hypocrite for laughing at me for considering guardian wurms high end when they hit twice as hard as Thunder Spirit Princess?  Shall I go on?<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, and finally, bringing up focus items and applying to both shamans and druids actually makes you look worse.  Assuming you compare chloroblast and NT with spell haste III, 2.5 + 2.5 = 5.  Now NT is 4.7 so it will take 4.7 / (5 - 4.7) = 15.66666 casts of NT to compensate for one free cast, as opposed to 12 without focus items.  Last I checked, 15.66666 &gt; 12.<br />
<br />
Dans ta face poufiasse!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">he's gunna have to waste a few seconds picking them off the ground<br />
- These seconds are saved by chaincasting NT instead of Chloroblast. Maybe not in entirely but in part. When you dealing with a quadding 1150 damage mob with nearly 0 delay and flurry once in a while, those fractions of the second COUNT. Fact. You conveniently ignore.<br />
<br />
In short, what you're telling me is all theory<br />
- No genius. I am telling you what's happening on our raids. And on a few other guild's raids I've been on. And you are right, people going LD, lagging, having graphics lag is all a theory. <br />
<br />
Afterlife's roster lists 2 mages for example, and Triton 5.<br />
- Do you realize how many rods with appropriate focus items and AA skills one mage can produce? No, or you wouldn't make that studid statement. On our last AoW fight, casters went through 89+ rods. And we had one single mage present.<br />
<br />
 I'll admit I was wrong in my calculations and dividing the 0.5 second delay by 2, but when are you gunna be man enough to step up to the plate and admit you're guilty of overly simplifying the situation? <br />
- Can you answer me why druids/clerics look at walls when chain healing for AoW, AL, HP? You can, but it will ad more weight to my argument wich you so easily forget and want to ignore.  If I oversimplify the situation because every single big fight clerics/druids look at walls, with clipping turned down max, datarate at 9 or 10. Then I am guilty as charged. <br />
<br />
You still avoid the fact that many people pointed out that our DoTs if not resisted are nice. While you go pow wow Chloroblast heal on MT wich is useless, I'll DoT the mob and work on getting mana back and Torpor casters in my group. <br />
<br />
T'aimes a tapette? Du kannst auch mein Arsch lecken  <br />
- No I won't lick your a-ss, and no I am not a f-ag. (translation reference for moderators). <br />
<br />
15.66666 &gt; 12<br />
- I see you still have basic math comprehension and also basic english. As smart people notice that 5.5 seconds was the casting time and calculation WITHOUT focus effects (wich I clearly pointed out):  With focus items, it's a bit more NTs.. Wich as you showed, 15.66 NTs (I didn't bother to do the math). But you didn't see right? Or ignored? Or ADD?<br />
<br />
Nice try Nektar. D- for effort.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">Can you answer me my druids/clerics look at walls when chain healing for AoW, AL, HP? You can, but it will ad more weight to my argument wich you so easily forget and want to ignore.<br />
<br />
The time it actually takes for you to click the rod, pick it up, put it in a general inventory slot, and actually click on it takes longer than you think.  You're also assuming that coordination is so flawlessly perfect on a borg-type level but sometimes the rod you wanna pick is gone, which delays you even more.  Sure, we're talking a couple seconds, but since you're asking me to look at the fractions of seconds themselves to prove to me how much more effective NT is, I'll ask you to look at how long the process of picking up the rods is.  And infinite supply of rods on the ground, 24/7, with maybe 3 mages, 8 clerics, 4 druids, and you can keep everyone manahappy?  Please, stop kidding yourself kid. <br />
<br />
Point is, druids are often considered backup healers on raids.  Yet a druid will heal overall less than a shaman will.  I know shamans will regen mana at a faster rate than a druid, it's common sense, does anyone else other than Zorlac care to dispute this?  With this in mind, why is it so dumb to think that shamans make for ok backup healers?  We are more efficient than druids in healing power as is, and the mana we spend healing they can be nuking and dotting themselves.  You see?  It's all a tradeoff. <br />
<br />
And I do believe you just set yourself up.  We have dots, ice blast (joke), and druids have pretty potent dd's, fire and cold based.  Not to mention dots which work with magic.  Since you're theorizing that there's an infinite supply of god rods, that means the druid can inflict much more damage than bane + pox will.  Plus, our dots don't stack with one another (yet), which means you'll only have one bane stuck on the mob for like 50 seconds (with focus item).  In that 50 seconds, druids could have scored more total damage than we could.  <br />
<br />
But now you're gunna bring up various resistances of mobs, blah blah blah, making exceptions left and right, but I always thought druids were capable of inflicting their share of damage.  Emperor Ssra, seen a signature screenshot, a shaman got killshot with JBB, so you're surely not gunna tell me ice and fire are always resisted on endgame mobs.<br />
<br />
Visc, my dain cloak (Spell Haste III) affects Choroblast too, so making it 2.5 sec cast time. And NT becomes 4.7 sec cast time<br />
<br />
You said this yourself.  Based on these numbers, if you were to re-adjust chloroblast so that it healed the same amount of damage and cost the same amount of mana as NT, it would take 5 seconds to cast, as opposed to NT taking 4.7.  Without the introduction of focus items, the discrepancy is of 6 - 5.5 = 0.5, and with the focus items it's 5 - 4.7 = 0.3.  You can already tell the delay is smaller with focus item than without, and that it will indeed take 15.66 NT's.  I'm just working with the numbers you're giving me here.<br />
<br />
It's also nice to take stuff out of context when you translate.  Kudos for screaming out moderator attention too, but I don't wanna comment on that too much as you can't handle a couple cheap shots without crying to the authorities.  <br />
<br />
First time I even brought French up was in response to trying to convince me I had necro envy.  So I reffered you to a previous quote, and put the emphasis on 3 words:  &quot;That's plenty enough&quot;.  Mind you, you had earlier on insulted my ability to understand English, so I merely returned the favour, as an extra twist, included a French remark.  Pourtant c'est seulement 3 mots = It's only 3 words however.<br />
<br />
Then you go on to say:<br />
Et tu peux m'insulter en francais si ca te tente ou en allemand aussi<br />
Translation:  You can insult me in French if you want, or German too.<br />
<br />
I fail to see how my first French remark was terribly offending, but since you told me you I could insult you in French or German, I did just that.  You gave me express permission to insult you in either language, and now you're pointing to the moderators? <br />
<br />
And even then, after those 2 cheap shots, I included a smiley.  Now I'm not the type to sprinkle smileys left and right when I'm arguing something, and in that whole post, there was one, yes one smiley, which places emphasis on the fact that it was meant a light-hearted remark.  You told me I could insult you in French or in German, and being the clever genius that you are, you probably thought to yourself you had me outsmarted because of the extra advantage (German).  Well, to prove you wrong, I kept you to your word, and insulted you in German.  If you honestly think I meant it, more power to you, although my reasoning and the infamous smiley suggest otherwise.<br />
<br />
But when you called me a crappy shaman, that's directly attacking my character without any provocation whatsoever.  Contest my ideas all you want, but you've never actually met me in game to comment on my alleged crappinness, nuff said.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />

<br />
LMAO Nektar, at least you didn't call me a F-AG this time and didn't tell me to LICK YOUR A-SS. Making progress. Keep it up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">Maybe I don't understand the EQCaster stuff right... but doesn't NT have a 5.5sec cast time and a 2.5sec recovery? Recovery being how long it greys out all your spell gems yeah?<br />
<br />
All the Rage Spells have a 30sec recovery and grey out your spells for ages... so I assumed that's how it worked.<br />
<br />
In that case... <br />
NT is 5.5 + 2.5 = 8<br />
Chloroblast is 3.0 + 2.5 = 5.5<br />
<br />
So 2xChloroblast is 11seconds compared to NT's 8. That's almost 40% faster (37.5%). 122hp/sec VS 78hp/sec.<br />
<br />
For straight mana dumping it'd take a Druid 80secs (10 casts) to run OOM (given 4k mana) and a Shaman 126.5secs (23 casts).<br />
<br />
A Druid will heal MORE and FASTER.<br />
<br />
Someone inevitably jumps in with &quot;Shaman can Canni!&quot; which lets them heal for longer. Canni4 takes 5secs to get through (2.5 cast, 2.5 recovery. Canni4 has a 3sec recast too so you can't quite chain it). That's an eternity. Healing against a raid level mob you need the heals now. Not 10 seconds later. You either use GodRods or just don't bother.<br />
<br />
You'd be making better use of your mana by Torporing Clerics/Druids than chaining Chloroblast at the MT.<br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
You could slap Bane/Pox on the mob and pull an extra 60DPS which isn't bad on those steroid pumped Luclin mobs overloaded with AC. Of course these are the only mobs it'd really be effective on because you'd have to wait til the mob was at 50% (like the nukers) to stop yourself stealing taunt and getting squished. Against a mob with 100k hp it still leaves you with 50k to work on though. Now if only those DoTs would stick with a little more frequency.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">Oh... forgot to mention that SHeal will actually out heal chloroblast. Comes in at 83hp/sec which is a tad over Chloroblasts 78hp/sec. The ratio sucks though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not really, you consider those seconds as time recovered from the delay in casting chloroblast, and to that I say you're not looking carefully enough as to how much time he's actually exceeding this margin.  That and the whole &quot;I can regain 400 mana in one tick&quot; assumption.  If not 400, maybe 300 to allow some time to pick up the rod and click.  Even 300 is not feasible, constantly, for 15 minutes, on a high end raid.  <br />
<br />
Not to mention this needs a certain number of mages which I don't believe you need to handle something high end.  Oh, and why not look at your original statement?  After all, that's how this whole end of the argument started: NT/DL owns  <br />
Last I checked, ownage didn't mean *slightly* more efficient, it means total domination.  Gunna try convincing me NT owns over chloroblast with a straight poker face now?  Didn't think so.<br />
<br />
<br />
Beeg:A Druid will heal MORE and FASTER. <br />
Yes, the druid will be able to chain NT after NT during the whole 15 minutes.  Of course he will.  At a certain point, and maybe not immediatly, he's gunna run dry on mana, which is where the shaman will start to really catch up through cannibalize.  <br />
<br />
Anyways, unless someone shows me an actual parse of a druid and shaman chain healing for say 10 minutes, there's no chance anyone will convince me otherwise.  <br />
<br />

<br />
Chronology is key here.  I believe Zorlac first said:ADD? Problem comprehending basic english? <br />
Don't know what planet you're hailing from sir, but accusing me of ADD comes back to being retarded, so if you wanna talk maturity level, look in the mirror please.<br />
<br />
Anyways, afterwards, I reply the following:That's... plenty... enough <br />
Problem comprehending basic english? <br />
Pourtant c'est seulement 3 mots :D<br />
<br />
See?  I used your own insult against you, hence why I had put it in italics.  I simply fought fire with fire, and the French remark I made, think it was really that terribly offensive?  <br />
Pourtant c'est seulement 3 mots :D<br />
Translation: It's only 3 words however.<br />
OUCH, major KO, I got ya there, shame on me!<br />
<br />
And it's only afterwards you said the following:Et tu peux m'insulter en francais si ca te tente ou en allemand aussi.<br />
Translation: You can insult me in French if you want or in German too.<br />
<br />
I don't get it, what I had first said in French wasn't particularly insulting, not by a longshot, not compared to you accusing me of having ADD.  Not that I care about the ADD remark, but I replied to you, in kind, and now you're begging for moderator attention?  <br />
<br />
Ya know, it's kinda like telling me &quot;take the insults to tells&quot; (since most people here don't speak French), and then afterwards making public what I said, where's the logic in that sir?<br />
<br />
So like, you thought you had me outsmarted because in your mind, you were probably thinking that I was assuming you didn't speak French and that I was out to confuse you.  Turns out you do speak French, and the natural reaction would thus be &quot;HAHA, he's so wrong it's not even funny, I'm a show him!&quot;  You had thought you outsmarted me even more so because of German, and the chances of me of speaking both languages were basically slim to none.  <br />
<br />
So how did I prove you wrong?<br />
You gave me express permission to insult you, and at the same time I had to demonstrate I was capable perfectly of speaking the 2 passably.  Put 2 and 2 together, I insulted you in both languages to achieve this.  Fairly logical imo.<br />
<br />
About the smileys, I've explained myself sufficiently already.  But if there's one thing I wanna add, I don't lie.  I've admitted the 3 times where I was proven wrong in this entire argument, which is more than I can say for you.<br />
<br />
And by the time I took those 2 cheapshots at you, I had already written quite a load since the dispute started.  You had ample evidence upon which to test the validity of my claim about the remark being light-hearted.  All you have to do is scan my other posts in this thread for smileys, and you'll discover that they're scarce, which means I don't spam them for no reason.  <br />
<br />
Let me also remind you this was provoked, no matter how you paint it.  The attack upon my character wasn't.<br />
<br />
Hey, but keep on narrowing your replies, it's cool.  Pride yourself in the false sense of security from ignoring points you're wrong on and elaborating on the ones which have a chance at being justified.  <br />
<br />
I've admitted to my mistakes before, god knows I'm only human, but if there's one thing I will continue to proclaim is that those cheap insults were not meant to be taken seriously.  Call me a liar again, and log onto my server one day, talk to me, talk to my friends, you'll be told otherwise.  I'd act totally chill too, I don't carry board grudges onto the game, so if ya ever wanna chill, name in game is Nektar, or Housebroken if I'm on Bazaar mule.  In that case, just leave a message, I have tells normally in another window.<br />

- I don't have too. Other people do the job very fine.<br />
<br />
So how did I prove you wrong? <br />
- As many people pointed out, DoTs still are very nice and good DPS, and NT &gt; Chloroblast. Wasn't that the whole point of this? So just where did you prove me wrong? Oh right, Thunder Princess is not an endgame mob during Kunark era, but Lord Crush is.<br />
<br />
Pride yourself in the false sense of security from ignoring points you're wrong on and elaborating on the ones which have a chance at being justified. <br />
- Pot, kettle, black? You are refusing to acknowledge FACTS, EVIDENCE, NUMBERS, and mind you, I am not the only one putting out these facts and numbers. Something you failed to bring up. But yeah, I am the one who is ignoring in points I am wrong at. But who cares, keep Chloroblasting MTs while other shamans are way more efficient Torporing and DoTing.<br />
<br />
So like, you thought you had me outsmarted because in your mind,<br />
- Isn't that the other way around? Look, I can throw in some french words, and I am sure this dumba-ss won't understand it and will be boggled by it. One can view it that way too.

It's all a matter of timing, really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">Zorlac, you entirely ignored one of my previous concerns.  Druid generally does a much better job at damage dealing than a shaman, this is true.  One mob can only have one bane, pox, and epic stuck on him at once.  Since mana is irrelevant by your standards, this means the druid will inflict much more amounts of damage than the shaman in the space of say 2 minutes.  This extra damage &gt; Their healing power.  And if you have 2, 3, 4 shamans at the raid, this means the average DPS for each shaman will become less and less significant.  Ok now drop this once and for all.  <br />
<br />
I also forgot how a mere few people nodding in agreement to what you had said constitutes dogma.  Judging by the number of your posts alone and date of registration, one can assume you're more established in the crucible community than I am.  People know you more, and thus have more grounds on which to agree with you.  That and combine this macho need for inflicting damage on mobs, making them bleed, chloroblast doesn't seem like an attractive alternative, but nonetheless it is viable.<br />
<br />
And tell me how NT totally dominates chloroblast.  You still haven't answered that one.  With focus item, if you need to cast 15.666 NT's to save time enough for one free cast, then I don't call this ownage.  Keep on relying upon what others say, but an expression comes to mind.  If everyone jumped off a bridge, would you?<br />
<br />
Tell me how having a certain number X mages is necessary to determine the outcome of the encounter as far as endgame is concerned?  Seems to me you're being situational here, and seeing as though how mages are not too abundant in proportion to other classes (ie druids), I can assure you that druids won't always have rods at their disposal 24/7.  <br />
<br />
Oh right, Thunder Princess is not an endgame mob during Kunark era, but Lord Crush is.<br />
<br />
Listen, there's nothing I can do if you yourself considered thunder spirit princess as a standard for endgame in Kunark.  People's ideas of endgame, especially looking back in retrospect, can vary immensely.  Also, what timeframe during Kunark?  Beginning? Middle?  End?  Since you were kind enough as to point out examples of what you deemed high end, I used those very examples to draft a list of tougher mobs.  Then you laugh in my face for labelling a guardian wurm ubor when he hits twice as hard.  No offense, but you're literally being a hypocrite.  It's not an insult, it's true.<br />
<br />
Isn't that the other way around? Look, I can throw in some french words, and I am sure this dumba-ss won't understand it and will be boggled by it. One can view it that way too. And you got caught with your pants down when I replied and you had to throw in F-AG and LICK MY A-SS for your own ... as you would put it ... &quot;false sense of security&quot;.<br />
<br />
Ok, originally I thought I had you outsmarted because I spoke French and I was assuming you didn't.  So you wanted to naturally diss me on that, and then you thought you had me outsmarted because you spoke German too.  And?  The fact that you thought that you had me outsmarted doesn't change.  <br />
<br />
So let's talk chronology here again.  The time I assumed you didn't speak French, I said nothing scandalous in French.  Furthermore, you first accused me of having ADD.  Like I said, that's like calling someone a mental retard, and last I checked that ain't a compliment.  If you wanna take it even further, a homo can hide who he is in society if he was afraid he'd incur too much harmful criticism.  But even now, they're becoming more and more tolerated and you call a fag a fag sometimes he'll be damn proud of it.  Someone with ADD is nothing to be proud of, period, and there's no way he can really hide it.  And the &quot;kiss my ass&quot; remark?  At least that wasn't name-calling; kiss my ass = kiss my ass, no derogatory  trait characterizations.<br />
<br />
So you call me a retard first, I don't really care, I know it's superficial, kinda like a yo momma joke.  I never flagged the moderators screaming &quot;hey, Zorlac called me a retard!&quot;, course not, I'm more mature than that.  Afterwards, you tell me I can insult you in French or German, so I put my money where my mouth is, and do so.  And now Zorlac is begging for mod attention!  You think you have diplomatic immunity or something? <br />
<br />
Also notice how I don't put the words &quot;fag&quot; and &quot;lick my ass&quot; in caps or bold each time I bring it up.  Seems you're a little too giddy when you use these words.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">And tell me how NT totally dominates chloroblast. You still haven't answered that one.<br />
- I won't repeat what many people have in this thread and what I pointed out. If you want to ignore it, fine, your loss or gain.<br />
<br />
 Keep on relying upon what others say,<br />
- I play a druid, when backup healers are needed. Level 60, 30 some AA. I never use Chloroblast on MT. But yeah I am talking out of my ass and have no clue about healing.<br />
<br />
Tell me how having a certain number X mages is necessary to determine the outcome of the encounter as far as endgame is concerned? Seems to me you're being situational here, and seeing as though how mages are not too abundant in proportion to other classes (ie druids), I can assure you that druids won't always have rods at their disposal 24/7. <br />
- Ask people in high level guilds how they can kill many mobs that take more than 10 minutes to kill. Most Sssra bosses take that much to kill (some 20+ minutes), AoW about 12 minutes, Burrower Parasite ring is about 1 hour fight, Ring of Fire (we did a 3 hour marathon), Ring of (insert something here), THO, Inner Acrylla, Grieg is also 10+ min fight. There are also guilds taking 40+ minutes to kill Aten Ha Ra. But yeah, mages are not needed for endgame. And if you wonder why mages are not abundant ... would you like to cast one single spell while you are at a raid? My guild is far from the likes of Afterlife or FoH, but our MT rotation on AL for instance is 4 clerics on 3.5 sec delay. Fight is about 12 minutes long. You do the math. And that only covers MT, there is RT also plus attrition healers, backup healers, nukers. Who needs mages eh?<br />
<br />
Do you have any clue how many rods can a raid hold? Everyone grabs one way before engaging boss. That is about 55+ rods per big fight. Plus we got 2 mages constantly making them. Each can keep up about 90+ rods. In most fight, there are even rods for paladins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">Keep going, this is very entertaining so far :D  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">I suggest you actually READ my post instead of searching for one line that says NT &gt; Cblast and jumping on it.<br />

NT heals faster than Chloroblast<br />
<br />
The math is right there if you'd actually read it. Forget everything Zorlac said (sorry Zorlac) and just look at those numbers. Forget the 5.5sec and 3sec times. It's all bollocks because you BOTH screwed up and made the same damn mistake.<br />
<br />
NT is better than Chloroblast NOT because you save 0.5 of a second (or whatever) but because you save 3 seconds.<br />
<br />
For a Shaman to eventually run OOM just on Chloroblast (given 4k mana) it would take 126.5 seconds (23 casts). A Druid would do it in 80 seconds (10 casts)... and the spells are the SAME RATIO.<br />
<br />
Nature's Touch -&gt; 10 casts -&gt; 80 seconds -&gt; 2.445 -&gt; 122hp/sec<br />
Chloroblast -&gt; 23 casts -&gt; 126.5 seconds -&gt; 2.446 -&gt; 78hp/sec<br />
<br />
That's casting as fast as humanly possibly with no lag between spells or anything. Best possible scenario. 15.666? What the hell?! Spell RECOVERY! You know that &quot;Spell recovery time not yet met&quot; message? In the same 80 seconds the Druid spent casting 10 Nature's Touch (healing 9780hp) a Shaman has cast 14 Chloroblasts (healing a gimpy 5992hp).<br />
<br />
8 second Natures Touch &gt;&gt;&gt; 11 second 2xChloroblast<br />
<br />
10 minute fights are an extremely bad example. Provided there are GodRods around the Druid can crush Chloroblast using Nature's Touch. Every GodRod the Druid gets his/her hands on is another 978hps they can heal (with 100 spare mana). The Druid also has an additional 46.5 seconds in which to find and use GodRods. He/She could spend that entire 46.5 seconds finding ONE rod and still keep up.<br />
<br />
But okay. Eventually both parties are OOM and the Shaman is using Canni while the Druid is using GodRods (when they can find them).<br />
<br />
If both parties are OOM and someone is providing outside healing. <br />
One GodRod = One Nature's Touch.<br />
2 x Canni4 = One Chloroblast <br />
(Notice I'm constantly rounding in favor of the Shaman)<br />
<br />
2 x Canni4 + Chloroblast would take 16 seconds. You have to do that twice to equal one Nature's Touch (and still be 120hp short). So that's 32 seconds. Given that Nature's Touch takes 8 seconds to cast (including the recovery time), that leaves 24 seconds to find a GodRod just to keep up. If it takes less than 24 seconds... the Druid moves further ahead. What's more! Every 4th Rod (if your Druid really sets out to eat them) they get a &quot;free&quot; NT and gain MORE ground. Technically the Druid could eat one rod every 30 seconds and still heal more, or at least as much, as a Shaman chaining Canni4 + Chloroblasts.<br />
<br />
Druids DO heal faster than Shaman. <br />
Nature's Touch IS a superior instant heal compared to Chloroblast.<br />
<br />
LOOK at the numbers. There's nothing to dispute.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">Actually, if you guys will both stop the pissing contest a moment..<br />
<br />
Nektar seems to have a point.<br />
<br />
Don't look at this as one Druid vs one Shaman per raid - look at it as multiple Druids vs multiple Shaman per raid.<br />
<br />
Zorlac's point seems to be that a Shaman can do more damage with dot's and leave the healing to the Druid.<br />
<br />
Nektar's point seems to be that Druids are better off nuking, and  Shaman are better off healing.  The thing he's saying though - out of multiple Shaman in a raid, only ONE can put Bane, Pox &amp; Epic on.  However, Druids have better nukes than us - which stack; as do our heals.<br />
<br />
And the bottom line, really.  We're Shaman - we're flexible, and can fill in on raids in a variety of ways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u79"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p79">out of multiple Shaman in a raid, only ONE can put Bane, Pox &amp; Epic on. However, Druids have better nukes than us - which stack; as do our heals.<br />
I would like to refer you to the up and coming DoT stacking. Helps stacking a little... but we still only &quot;keep up&quot; instead of plowing past.<br />
<br />
A chain cast Wildfire will put out 120DPS. Moonfire comes in at 132DPS. Winged Death sits around 23DPS. That's best possible case. Druid damage stacks a lot better because you only use one debuff/DoT slot (which you wouldn't &quot;waste&quot; on Winged Death anyway. You'd put something like BoN in there instead).<br />
<br />
A Shaman with Bane (39DPS), Pox (19DPS), Epic (~20-30?) and nukes (JBB - 32DPS, Ice Strike - 71DPS) does hurt. Uses up a TON of debuff/DoT slots, but puts out some fair numbers.<br />
<br />
What you get your Druids/Shaman to do depends on the encounter. Not making me feel good about my class knowing Druids are both better healers AND better damage dealers. :p<br />
<br />
Yes I realise all the numbers are &quot;best possible scenario&quot; but I can hardly calculate mob resist levels in my head. Would need about 1000 parses first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u80"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p80">Yes, I know.  But dot stacking is not in the game yet, and don't count.  Even then, there's still that 30 buff limit.<br />

Malxx, slow, tash, cripple, mok, various unmentioned other class debuffs - how much room is left for dots?  Don't know, and I'm sure it's going to take some tweaking, of the code and of player tactics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u81"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p81">Um, or you could divide the amount healed from chloroblast by 3 seconds and the amount healed from NT by 5.5.  I don't know why you're adding variables and stretching this over an extended axis of time, you get the answer from simply dividing total amount healed from each spell by the seconds it takes to cast it.<br />
<br />
For chloro: 428/3 = 142.666 hps/second.<br />
For NT: 978/5.5 = 177.81 hps/second.<br />
<br />
It's that simple.<br />
<br />
Nature's Touch -&gt; 10 casts -&gt; 80 seconds -&gt; 2.445 -&gt; 122hp/sec <br />
Chloroblast -&gt; 23 casts -&gt; 126.5 seconds -&gt; 2.446 -&gt; 78hp/sec <br />
<br />
<br />
So much for your brilliant mathematical deduction.  That means to catch up with one chloroblast, since 177.81 - 142.66 = 35.15, NT will have to be cast 428 / 35.15 = 12.17 times to make an incremental difference.  <br />
<br />
Now let's look at a druid's rodding ability.  Imagine they were enough mages to keep all clerics and all druids manahappy at all times (why not the necros, chanters, and wizards too while you're at it, beginning to realize how unfeasible this situation is?).  If he manages to chain those 12 NT's without the use of rods because of chorus + kei + potg, he'll be totally dry.  He'll have to rod at one point or another.  He can afford to take 4 charges (300ish dmg X 4) and have one torpor compensante for the lost health.  This means, once he's dry on mana, the shaman will spend 6 seconds casting torpor, which is exactly what he's losing on 12 casts of NT.  <br />
<br />
But once this druid is dry on mana and starts taking rods, in order to keep on compensating for his loss of health, the shaman will have to cast torpor every time he consumed 4 charges.  For these 4 charges, he will have enough for 2 more NT's, which is 11 seconds total.  Let's be generous and make it 3 NT's because of bard/druid/chanter mana regen (and I'm being very generous since chaining NT's involves standing most of the time, except in select zones like UP where you can use horse).  These 3 NT's = 16.5 seconds, so that means the shaman will have to waste 6 seconds of his casting time to torpor said druid every 16.5 seconds.  This is an average, but if you smooth things out in the long run, it boils down to that.<br />
<br />
He has an initial endowment, I'm not at all denying that, and for a while, he will have the extra edge, but having to torpor a druid every 16.5 seconds becomes inefficient because our heals will ultimately prove to be more efficient.  Again, I've been generous in every sense, assuming all druids have rods 24/7, and that the time it takes to cast 2 NT's, the druid would have regained 400 standing up with kei + potg + chorus + FT.  Also, I realize that chloroblast cannot be cast with 0 delay, so the numbers I awarded you compensate (to say the least).<br />
<br />
I didn't even mention cannibalize and I don't feel I should, but it just goes to show that after a while, the extra edge you think druids have is pretty minimal, if not negative.<br />
<br />
I can fully understand torporing the cleric because he's that much more efficient, but a druid, no.  And let me ask you this:  Who do you think will have priority to torporing shamans on high end raids?  The druids?  LOL.  Try to to fit as many shamans as you can with clerics first, then think about druids.  If the druid is not in your group, you can preach the importance of torpor all you want, but torpor means literally jack on someone out of group.  Both you and Zorlac are being very situational, assuming every druid will have access to a torporing shaman, that every druid has an endless supply of rods lying around.<br />
<br />
And realistically speaking, when there's a lack of rods, what can a shaman do?  That's right, cannibalize.  That's all nice and dandy to mention the delay in casting cannibalize, but 2 clicks and you basically have enough for one extra chloroblast while the druid is still straggling for 400 mana.  4 clicks about 2 chloroblasts.  And since we're being realistic, let's place canni 4 at 3 seconds casting time, including the lag, and excluding focus item.  Which means 4 canni's = 2 ticks.  Honestly think a druid can regen 400 mana in 2 ticks (=12 seconds)?  <br />
<br />
<br />
Ok, now let's talk tradeoff.  Like I said, only one bane, pox, and epic can be stuck on said boss mob at once.  Druids have them so totally dominated in the damage dealing department, not even worth contesting.  On top of that, his efficiency is increased in 3 ways with the right items/skill:<br />
- Improved Damage item: this increases average DPS<br />
- Spell Haste: this increases average DPS<br />
- Critical hits: this increases average DPS<br />
<br />
Let's see, for a shaman dot, you have:<br />
- Spell Haste III:  It's a dot, not meant to be chained over and over without delay and thus won't significantly contribute to the average DPS.  On top of that, you can time your dots, and cast them so that the new dot will land almost immediatly after the old one wore off.   <br />
- Extended Affliction:  Makes the dot last longer, but doesn't improve average DPS.  <br />
<br />
Oh sure, we have ice strike *chuckle*, but if you compare both ice strike and moonfire (both cold-based), ice strike does 675 damage for 250 mana in 7 seconds.  Moonfire does 1150 damage for 320 in 6.2 seconds.  Doesn't take a genius to figure how far superior Moonfire is to Ice Strike, much more than NT &gt; Chloroblast.  <br />
<br />
But yeah let's go back to dots and say shamans are the pwn at damage dealing.  And again, I ask you to keep this tradeoff in mind.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u83"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p83">Erm, I think you two are forgetting something rather important.<br />
<br />
For spot healing, timing is key. <br />
<br />
NT takes 5.5 secs to heal 978 damage.<br />
Chloro takes 6+2.5x2 (refresh time)= 11 secs to heal 858 damage.<br />
<br />
Now, this means from the 3 sec mark to the 5.5 sec mark, a 2.5 sec gap, where the tank has 429 more HPs when being healed by Choroblast compared to NT. However, from the 5.5 sec mark to the 8 sec mark, a 2.5 sec period, your target has 549 more hps when healed by NT when compared to Chloro. The gap of hps healed only increase with time and number of castings in favor of NT, and then there's the occasional lucky crit.<br />
<br />
Which one would you rather have? Personally, if I had NT I'd never cast Chloro again on a raid, ever. Statistically, NT heals more over time, and therefore is more efficient, not to mention since he DOES heal in larger chuncks, it's far more likely for it to bring someone above Low Health Agro, especially when casted in large numbers.<br />
<br />
Most guilds use druids as secondary healers before shamans because NT is far more effective at keeping someone alive than Chloroblast, and most often than not both shamans AND druids do some backup healing. The difference is, at least in my experience, there are usually far more druids on a raid than shamans, and shamans have many OTHER things to worry about than backup healing. A few of them would be buffing, malo, slows, and torporing mages, which can only be done by shamans, thus making spot healing very low on our priority list compared to druids.<br />
<br />
Druids either DoT, or DD, or Heal. I think it's safe to say that for most end game mobs, keeping a melee alive is more efficient than nuking, yes? Hence, Healing should be number one on a druid's priority list for most fights, whereas shamans have a lot more things to worry about.<br />
<br />
As for our DoTs... what ELSE are you going to do when fighting something assinine like IV or THO? I don't know about you, but dealing more damage to a mob quicker while avoiding agro = the mob will die sooner. Sure, my DoT damage is insignificant compared to the raid, or the classes who specialize in damage, but that extra 30K damage I do with DoTs alone means we finish the mob sooner and can go somewhere else quicker.<br />
<br />
Remember, the contribution of any one person can be glossed over as &quot;needless&quot; by arguing the raid can do that much damage in no time, so you are useless. It's absolutly true... but every second less you allow the mob to live, that's less time for someone to make a mistake on your side. Why not kill a mob as fast as you can using everything you've got?</div></div><hr />

Refresh time on chloro?  What? Come again?  I can guarantee you that I can cast more than 2 chloroblasts in 11 seconds, thus healing over 858 damage.  So much for the rest of your line of reasoning.<br />
<br />

<br />
I'm actually in total agreement with that, I did say the following a couple pages back:We're there to buff/debuff, that's plenty enough.<br />
<br />
But you're talking about the whole raid, the clearing of &quot;yard trash&quot; too.  If you're busy debuffing and debuffing, dotting is not even an option, ditto for backup heals.  The real issue being discussed here is what to do with your mana if you don't have to debuff?  Like boss mobs for example.  <br />
Druids can't realistically regen mana as fast as a shaman can.  And even if the shaman has to torpor mage and cleric, that means even less time for the shaman to devote to druids on compensating for their mod rod health loss.  <br />
<br />
Plus, you said it yourself, there are usually far more druids than shamans on a raid, which means not all of them will be grouped with a shaman.  Which means he'll have to sit down and actually regen his mana by medding.  The druid would have to mostly rely on kei + ft + potg + chorus to regen his mana.  He can't afford to mod rod because he has no torporer.<br />
<br />
Shaman on the other hand, if not with a druid, no problem.  He has the same mana regen buffs and he's cannidancing at the same time.  He can use can 4, can 5, and mod rods if he wanted to, he can always torpor himself, the druid cannot.  So the extra speed druid gets from casting each spell will only be negated by the extra downtime he incurs afterwards.<br />
<br />
And I have nothing wrong with torporing the cleric or the mage because keeping clerics regenned on mana after rods is a good thing, but I'm not going to go out of my way to prioritize a druid on torpor a druid who can &quot;theoretically&quot; heal a little more efficiently than I can.  The druid has to make choices too as to what he should be doing, shares the same burden.  He can pick between buffing, backup healing, and nuking.  Alternately, the shaman can buff, backup heal, or dot.  <br />
<br />
Except shaman dots won't stack up to one another, and a shaman's average DPS will contribute nowhere near to that of the average of a damage dealing class.  Druids are much more efficient in this area, and focus items + AA do nothing but improve this efficiency.  From my perspective, I'd like to maximize the overall DPS on said boss mob.  <br />
<br />
If you solely devote your mana towards torporing and dotting, the DPS is not nearly as elevated as it could be because the mana you're using on dots druids have to compensate for on heals, and thus can't nuke.  <br />
<br />
You could alternately purely stick to torporage around the clock without dotting to keep casters in your group manahappy.  You give a wizzie that much more mana to toy with, it will far outweigh the benefits of your dots.  I dunno, we're almost debating case by case basis here, and although circumstances vary, overall, I think a shaman's dots will be pretty minimal in the grand scheme of things.  They're nice and all, especially in non-raid type situations, but they're not inflicting their share of damage on a raid.  <br />
<br />
Apart from mages (who are perma-busy summoning rods), clerics, and enchanter, I really don't see any (or many) class capable of inflicting a lesser amount of average DPS than a shaman.  However, shamans are prolly the 3rd best healers if you assume druids heal better.  So you'll have plenty more classes capable of handling damage dealing while you're one of the few that can heal something worth a damn.  That's why I stick to backup healing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">Hiho,<br />
<br />
ok, nice battle that led from DoTs on end game mobs to the usual discussion if NT &gt; 2xCB ...<br />
<br />
I am too lazy to do math on this subject, but tell me this:<br />
<br />
IF NT is not any better than 2xCB, why would the druid community care if we get NT too ?<br />
<br />
But they care. Thats enough for me to prove that NT is better than CB on raids (btw: Thx to Beeg, he did some nice math further up)<br />
<br />
Mod rodding: Stop comparing two different things. You try to compare druids rodding and shamans healing this damage with shamans casting more CB. Compare both shaman and druid being OOM. If the both use GodRod the time used is the same, if shaman uses Canni he takes much longer top get back mana (but saves rods for other classes, which is why we do this).<br />
<br />
On the DoT topic:<br />
I see Zorlac's point that DoTs are quite good on those end-game mobs with 100k+ HPs. Most of the time I get problems with aggro though. But this may be the case because my guild is not so uber as all of yours and our MA still uses Epic/Willsapper for aggro. But after 4 Banes (and some Epic which does not count bvecause of very low aggro) I will get summoned by many bigger mobs (aka Dozekar, Nameds in HoT, Spirits in UP ...).<br />
If Zorlac can land so many dots on an encounter like THO it's a good thing. And if the resists are based on the 2 parts being checked for resistance (which noone confirmed yet), we would be better off without the DD component and another tick on the DoT part.<br />

I casted 8 pox, 8 epic and 8 plague on High Priest in Ssra once when I was not in a cleric group.<br />

<br />
Chloroblast: 428<br />
Cast time - 3.0 seconds<br />
Refresh - 2.50 seconds.<br />
<br />
Cast (3.0) + refresh (2.50) + Cast (3.0) +refresh (2.50)= 11.0<br />
<br />
So, how are you casting faster than the rest of us?  I don't know where they got the recast time (Casters Realm link you have), but it's wrong, unless it's being changed on Test.<br />
<br />
<br />
Nature's Touch: 978hp<br />

Spell Recovery: 2.50 seconds</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u88"><b>McLeod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p88">I'm not even gonna touch the root issue, I do agree it adds a bit of excitement and keeps you on your toes.  It seems totally appropriate on the DD hit to check against root and to be honest I would rather have the damage from that initial DD than a little bit of safety.  Let's be honest here, if you want more safety you can always go back to old-school kiting (no more nerf to DoT damage on a target in motion).<br />
  Something I haven't seen brought up here but remember from a long (year, 2 years) time ago is that the DD portion is ALL-OR-NONE.  You never see and never will see a &quot;hit by non-melee for 74 points of damage&quot; when casting Bane.  To that effect it puts it in the same classification as some of the enchanter DDs (such as the stun/DD spells) that either hit for full or get totally resisted.<br />
  In my opinion what we are seeing isn't an unusually high&quot;resist rate&quot; per say, but the fact that the entire DoT is resisted if the critter rolls even a minor partial resist.  To see how this could affect the resist rate, chain-cast the JBB against a  moderate mob for a while.  Now imagine all of the hits &lt; 263 points of damage were automatically &quot;resisted your Winter's Roar&quot;.<br />
<br />
Just my 2cp... but if the DD portion could be partially resisted and still allow the DoT to stick we would see much better rates, losing only a % of the initial DD instead of the whole spell on many occasions.<br />

Keep in mind that this sample can't display 100th of seconds so there is an average possiblity of error of 0.5 seconds. As the second heal indicates with Chloroblast being a 2 second cast time. Even in worse case, take off ONE WHOLE SECOND, it still takes 5 second per Chloroblast.<br />

If mana is not a problem because of god rods. Then why use the puny Chloroblast anyways. Use Super healing and a Heal 3 item. And I mean when you really really want to heal that badly that a percentage point matter more than fun, then you have Healing gift 3 and Healing mastery 3 also..<br />
<br />
Right?<br />
<br />
Oh wait we are shaman. We kick ass, with Spear and hammer, poisen and disease. We crush people before us like the glacier that comes down the mountain. Slow, but unstoppable.<br />
<br />
Then you have druids. What do they do again? Hump trees? Taxi people around? Farm named in Chardok because they are so disliked from quad kites gone wrong that they can never find a group? (Druids can kick ass. But Dr00ds need to all die.)<br />
<br />
Christ people. You are going into page long diatribes about our abilities as a backup healer. A back up healer for gods sake. A level 39 cleric with a mod rod fetish can heal rings aound you. Chill the hell out, turn into a bear and go club down a treent somewhere. <br />
<br />
Oh little update. I will have spell casting fury 2 soon. and last night got another fluke on torrent. 720, 720, 720, 540  Not bad for a wuss shaman.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u94"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p94">Actually, shamans are 4th for backup healing. After Clerics, Paladins, and Druids.<br />
<br />
Not that it's something worth getting worked up about--we have far more vital roles on a raid than backup healing. It's something we CAN do if there's nothing else left, but generally speaking your mana's better spent by torporing mages/wizards/clerics and in some cases DoTing and DDing since in many fights there are already enough spot healers.<br />
<br />
There's little chance for a shaman to ONLY torpor, because on raids our mana regenerate is further augmented by C3 and bards, so we end up having more mana than we know what to do with. Thus you have 3 choices, DoT, DD, or Spot heal. Chances are, Spot Healing is redundent with the non-cycle clerics, druids, and paladins around, so your only options are to DoT or DD. Since our DoTs are more mana efficient than our DD, it doesn't make much sense not to use them, eh?<br />
<br />
There are VERY few situations where Shaman spot healing is absolutely required, most of them involves all the other healers being dead. So, unless you MUST use all your mana on spot heals, spend some mana on DoTs or DDs.<br />
<br />
You can argue the damage from any one individual as insiginificant to the grand scheme of things with the exception of Wizards. However, limiting yourself by not achieving your full potential because &quot;it doesn't matter&quot; is a faulty attitude.</div></div><hr />

Of course you're quick to dismiss me, but leave his slate entirely clean.  Care to explain the the 2.5 X 2 second delay in casting time?  Anyone?  Anyone at all?<br />
<br />
Up until now, people have been assuming there was 0 lag between casting the 2, just like we've been assuming it takes the druid 0 seconds to pick up the rods.  But everything as long as it's in your favour, and everything that's against, you just ignore.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u98"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p98">You guys want knit-picking?<br />
I've logged myself chaining Chloroblast for exactly 10:54 seconds:<br />
[Mon Aug 26 18:00:39 2002] You begin casting Chloroblast.<br />
[Mon Aug 26 18:00:42 2002] You have been healed for 428 points of damage. (1)<br />
[Mon Aug 26 18:11:35 2002] You are blasted with chlorophyll.<br />
[Mon Aug 26 18:11:35 2002] Your Obulus Death Shroud flickers with a pale light.<br />
<br />
56 Chloroblasts in the space of 11 minutes.  No kei, no potg, no chorus, no SH3 item, no IH3 item, just Obulus Death Shroud, which reduces each spell mana cost by 10%.  <br />
<br />
Ok, now let's make everything status quo, meaning the druid is just as well off as me.  Meaning he has 3027 mana initial endowment, no SH3, no IH3, and just MP3.  <br />
<br />
That makes chloroblast cost 157.5 mana and NT 360.  So that means I used up 157.5 X 56 = 8820 mana the whole 11 minutes, standing up.  What's mana regen standing up with mana regen buffs?  What, like 20 each tick?  I honestly don't know, but 20 seems pretty generous.  <br />
<br />
1 tick = 6 seconds, 10 ticks = 1 min, 110 ticks = 11 mins.  So that means the druid has a total of 3027 + (110 X 20) = 5227 during those 11 minutes without mod rods.  This 5227 &lt; 8820 mana by far when the shaman doesn't even have mana regen buffs.  Wanna be fair?  Ok, the shaman has 8820 + (110 X 20) = 11020 mana.  Big WOW, I'd say the druids totally dominates on heals.<br />
<br />
Even if the shaman  only had 8820 mana, that would mean a 8820 - 5227 = 3593 mana difference between the 2 during the whole 11 minutes.  We've already taken the mana regen buffs into consideration, so all there's left to do is rod, which means he has to rod 3593 mana's worth.  So that means he has to use around 3593 / 220 = 16.33 charges of god rods to compensate.  <br />
<br />
Ok, so now torpor has to compensate for those 16 charges which is roughly 4900 damage.  That means 4 torpors.  So not only is the shaman using a total of 800 mana healing the druid, but he's also shaving 24 whole seconds off his healing time during those 11 minutes.  <br />
<br />
Ok, now say the shaman with mana regen buffs had 11020 mana the whole 11 minutes.  That would mean a 11020 - 5227 = 5793 mana difference.  Both of them have mana regen buffs this time, so the 5793 mana, the druid needs to rod.  All of a sudden, this turns into 26 charges, which is 7800 damage.  <br />
<br />
Now torpor has to compensate for that 7800 too, so thats 7800 / 1200 = 6.5 casts of torpor, on the druid.  That's 39 seconds wasted from the shaman just to keep the druid manahappy.  But yeah, I'm totally sure that the druid will have the edge.<br />
<br />
I'm also totally sure that you need to keep a druid fed 24/7 on rods, and that he's guaranteed to have a shaman in group.  Please, get real.<br />
<br />
What's the max amount of damage the average shaman can do on said mob?  3k max/min if he were the only shaman?  Grats, 3 casts and a druid surpasses that.  Not even 30 seconds, and the more shamans there are, the less average DPS each shaman will incur, but the average druid can still continue to stack their dd's.<br />
<br />
Parse me a fight where druid can realistically heal as much damage as a shaman can during one raid, and maybe I'll start believing you, but until then you have nothing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u99"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p99">Hmm, have you ever heard of a Regrowth Cycle? No?<br />
<br />
How about a Torpor Cycle or maybe CE Cycle? Doesn't ring the bell?<br />
<br />
What about a druid cycle replacing clerics for all raids on test? Nothing?<br />
<br />
It's very basic knowledge that the usefulness of a Heal spell depends on two things: efficiency and magnitude. You want to heal as quickly for as much as possible as well as watching your efficiency. It makes VERY little difference if there's a spell that heals 1 HP per second for 2 hours and only costs 1 mana. It's the most efficient heal by FAR, but it's also the most useless, because it makes zero difference when you are trying to keep someone alive.<br />
<br />
Now, simply because you can cast a lesser spell 50 more times does not mean it's as effective as a better spell. CH is godly not only because it costs 400 mana... even if it costs 800, it'll STILL be used, and MUST be used for end game encounters. It is godly because of it's MAGNITUDE as well as it's EFFICIENCY.<br />
<br />
Chloroblast casted by a shaman is more efficient than NT casted by a Druid because it's casted by a SHAMAN, not because it's a better spell than NT. Chloroblast, as a spell, is inferior to NT in both magnitude and efficiency.<br />
<br />
A druid is a BETTER healer because when the need arises, NT can deliver FAR more healing power FAR faster than Chloroblast. When someone's about to die, you don't care about spending extra mana--you just want him to survive. It matters not if you have 349 casts of Chloroblasts left in you if you let someone die because you can't heal fast enough. When was the last time you heard clerics bitching &quot;But he shouldn't have died! I had 3000 mana left, and my CH was going to land in 2 secs!&quot; and how much good did that 3000 mana do for the person that just died? How much good would 30 million mana have done?<br />
<br />
On most raids, it's not about who can heal MOST total, it's about who's more effective at healing. A bard can give an entire raid enough regen to make his healing total astranomical... but when was the last time you classified a bard as a healer? <br />
<br />
Again, effectiveness at healing is a combination of magnitude and efficiency, in both cases Chloroblast, independent from class, is inferior to NT.</div></div><hr />

~42 inside zone, ~45 outside zone. Standard raid buffs btw. &quot;Slightly&quot; bigger than your 20. Now go back to your drawingboard and add another ~3.1k mana to druid. That should spare some rods right? But you thought of that right? And before you tell me that these buffs can be added to shamans, it means jack s-hit. Shaman has already 10 times the mana regen of the druid. These buffs makes the druid a pretty damn good backup/spot healer.<br />
<br />
Oh and what forces the druid to heal itself if mob has no berserk aggro? NOTHING. His regen, RoTG and Cantana will take care of it.  But you included that in your calculations too right? Regen 3, + Regrowth + Cantana = ~30 HP a tick. Of course, conveniently ignored in your false prophecy.<br />

<br />
Not you Boinshar, since you admit that chloroblast can heal overall more, but I'm pointing fingers to people like Zorlac who blatantly proclaim mana is irrelevant.  Just look at the screenshots, the druid says that basically a druid almost never rods. <br />
<br />
With this in mind, for the sake of argument, say the druid burns his whole manabar by initially chaining like 11 NT's.  If he managed to regen at 60 mana/tick with all buffs, aa, and items, that means he would have to wait 6.6666 ticks to have enough mana for a recast.  Let's round it up to 6 to be nice.  6 ticks = 36 seconds.  <br />
<br />
So super decked out with FT and without mod rods, after the druid has depleted his mana, he has to wait 36 seconds (a little more actually) to cast another NT.  The shaman doesn't have mod rods, but once he's depleted his mana, 2 clicks and he can afford one chloroblast while the other druid is not healing at all because he's medding.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Speaking of trains, Karnors is a great place to watch trains - but KC trainers are jaded.  If you want to see truly fantastic trains, go to someplace like Blackburrow.  Man, can those gnolls make a train!<br />
<br />
Today sometime, a train hit a motorcycle in my town.  Seems someone stole the bike and left it on the tracks.  Man, talk about a real ninja.<br />
<br />
Squirrels can be ninja's too, you know.  You think those are nuts in their cheeks?  Nah, they're simply puffing up a breath, ready to whip out the blowgun and ninja-dart your tail, if you don't quit eyeballing them.  It's a good thing that my cat is inside, because man, can he eyeball squirrells!  He'd be a pincushion if not for the glass windows protecting him from the ninja squirrels.  He just sits there, eyeballing the furry little things, chittering away, as if he's daring them to try it.<br />
<br />
Of course, it was a really mild winter last year, so the squirrels really aren't that furry.  It's supposed to snow a heck of a lot more this year, and the ninja-squirrels will probably freeze.  Yessirree, there'll be stiff, black suited squirrels hanging from power lines all over town!  That is, if we don't get so much snow and ice that the power lines snap.  That might zap the frozen ninja squirrels back to life - heck, if you believe me about them, you surely beleive me about that.<br />
<br />
Of course, no one will ever find the frozen, burned, black suited ninja-squirrels, because the men in black suits will swoop down in their black helicopters, and take the bodies away before we find them.  All that will be left are meaningless tracks in the snow, downed power lines, and reports of lights in the sky.<br />
<br />
Kiddies will think the lights in the sky are from Santa Claus - after all, if he KNOWS if you've been bad or good, he's got to be spying on you.  What a peeper.  Surprised he hasn't gotten hauled up for stalking, trepassing, and sundry other charges.  But that's a good thing, because if he did get arrested, there wouldn't be any presents under your Christmas tree.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u109"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p109">Say both druid and shaman were OOM.  OOM because we wanna talk mana regen.  None of them had rods, because the rods were reserved mostly for clerics.<br />
<br />
Everquest Realms was wrong, OK, so that makes me stupid.<br />
<br />
But fitting your recast delays into the equation, let's put it this way:<br />
Druid has KEI (14), chorus (12), PotG (6), MC3, and 15FT, which means an extra 50 mana/tick max?  So how much can he actually med in one tick adding med mana?  Like 60?  Is this fair? (just a simple question)<br />
<br />
82 X 6 = 492, which is how much mana 6 cannis will give you you.<br />
Without recast time, this would mean 2.5 X 6 = 13 seconds.  <br />
Looking at the recast time alone, this would mean an extra 3 X 6 = 18 seconds.<br />
<br />
So in total, shaman would have to spend 18 + 13 = 31 seconds of gaining enough mana for 3 chloroblasts, which amounts to a 1284 heal total (1284 - 978 = 306 more than NT).<br />
<br />
Ok, but now he has to spend time casting those 3 chloros.  <br />
So without recast time, that's 3 X 3 = 9 seconds.<br />
With recast time alone it's 2.5 X 3 = 7.5 seconds.<br />
<br />
So total, that's 9 + 7.5 = 16.5 seconds.<br />
<br />
So a shaman from OOM has to spend a total of 16.5 + 31 = 47.5 seconds to be able to cast 3 chloros (=1284).<br />
<br />
Ok, now let's look at the druid.  He meds for 60/tick.  To regain 400 mana, that's 6.666 ticks.<br />
6.666 ticks = 40 seconds.<br />
<br />
At the end of those 40 seconds, he will stand up and cast NT, which is an extra 5 seconds.  Which means to heal 978 damage again from OOM, the druid will take 40 + 5 = 45 seconds total.<br />
<br />
Compare this 45 seconds vs a shaman's 47.5 seconds and you'll see the delay is not very large, and the shaman would have healed about 300 hps more.<br />
<br />
I was honestly wrong about overlooking the recast times, but it still doesn'y change the fact that I know in my heart and through experience that shamans could content with druids on heals in the long run.<br />
<br />
I'm not the cream of the crop, and I'm too tired of reading post by post to start quoting, but I do believe Zorlac mentionned even Dain being a challenge.  Well I've done RC, DS, Gozz, Telk, Dagarn, Vindi, and Tormax so far, and although there's much harder, I think I've started to taste what high end really is.<br />
<br />
And please don't just merely skim through my calculations and label this post BS.  I have an open mind, I took recast times into consideration after all, and if you can find error, point it out and explain why exactly it's wrong.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, the extra edge a druid has in the damage dealing department is incredible (vs a shaman of course).  When dots start stacking, I might change my perspective, but for now they don't, so I can't work with that I don't have.  I'm talking now.<br />
<br />
Not saying make all druids nuke, but since there are generally quite a few of them, make a couple of them do so to significantly increase DPS and a shaman sub for backup heals, he still does an ok job compared to a druid.  I think he does better, but if you wanna argue the opposite, fine, CF above, but at least we can reach a general consensus that shamans and druids are comparable at backup healing.  Never said anything about clerics either, so please leave them out, I know they're much more efficient.<br />
<br />
Anyways, the contribution of your dots generally won't make a difference, but I've seen quite a few high end guilds wipe on a high end mob.  This often means the MT wasn't being healed fast enough, and I've had my share of wipes, that's exactly what happens.  More heals on tank = little more chance he'll live, and more of a chance he'll live than the mob die because of a couple extra dots.<br />
<br />
And what about when you have 4 shamans there, and 2 of them have dots handled?  What do you propose for the other 2?  *Hint* Torpor is considered backup healing in my book.  Plus, if I'm done with torpor, one of my only options left is healing MT or tweedling my thumbs. <br />
<br />
So basically I'm gunna end this in a neutral tone.  Call me stupid, retarded, whatever makes you feel more happy, I'll stomach it, but at least I know I've been somewhat reasonable in this post and that I've justified my claims pretty comprehensively.<br />
<br />
This is my last reply, in which I endeavoured answering everyone's concerns in a civil manner.  Might have left out a couple things here and there, and I'm honestly not gunna make the calculations re-adjusting 10000 variables because of focus items; after all, this is a message board, not a term paper.  But my view hasn't changed.  Thanks for enlightening my incredibly stupid intellect, but I still maintain that backup healing is the way to go.  I like making mobs suffer, but I can do plenty of that solo.<br />
<br />
And if there's also another thing that I personally take into account during raids, it's the following:  the MT will never resist your chloro, but the mob can resist your dots, let alone the ones who are immune.  Chances are, you won't get aggro from chloro either, but dots maybe so, especially if you accumulate a few resists.  A full resist, I don't like either because of the waste of 400 mana I could have used to cast 2 chloros.  If anything, the occasional crit I score off chloroblast has the very opposite effect.<br />
<br />
Peace.<br />

EDIT:  I did say this was my last post, but wanna add one more thing.  Zorlac, you asked me to ask someone from a high end guild how useful mages were, why are you putting me down when I did just that?  Also, I never said mages were not necessary, but that druids won't necessarily have an endless supply 24/7, which is what the person in the screenshot said.<br />
<br />
It was not my intent to put druids down, he's a druid himself, but those are his words as a 60 druid in a high end guild, no more, no less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u110"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p110">If a &quot;high end&quot; guild routinely loses MTs on any mob that doesn't screw with your casting (blind, FD, mana drain, make you fizzle, etc) then they've got problems.<br />
<br />
In a &quot;high end&quot; raid, with 3-4 mages (most guilds have at LEAST 2) you'd have more rods than you know what to do with. Ideally, everybody should be OOM the second your mob drops... but that's hardly the case. Normally suppor casters end up having 30%+ mana at the END of the fight, with rods everywhere. Mana regen on a raid is extremely high, nobody goes OOM unless they want to.<br />
<br />
Now, again, Druids are better healers because they have a better spell, one that heals quicker and heals more. Hence, they are better healers. Their mana pool is irrelevent unless they actually WANT to go OOM. Spot healing is reserved for agro transfers and/or healing AE/reposte damage... you can't rely on chain Chloroblast to keep your MT up when the CH cycle breaks.<br />
<br />
Your arguement is based entirely upon shamans have faster mana regen, therefore shamans can heal more damage TOTAL compared to druids...which is hardly the case on a raid. ANY caster on a raid can cast non-stop from beginning to end while using rods, if they really wanted to. In the end, it comes down to one thing--when you are being quaded/rampaged for 600+ would you rather be healed faster, or would you rather be healed slower?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u111"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p111">Everyone makes mistakes, high end or not, however you choose to define those.  Human error, lag spike, you name it, mistakes happen.<br />
<br />
To be quite honest, any raid that &quot;relies&quot; on shaman OR druids to keep the MT alive needs to give their clerics a kick in the arse - because no matter what Chloro, Natures Touch, or Torpor can do, it doesn't hold a candle (even one held by a ninja-squirrel) to a COmplete Heal.<br />
<br />
If you talk really &quot;high end&quot; mobs, then a single messed up CH will kill the MT, unless you have a pally with LOH on the ball.</div></div><hr />
