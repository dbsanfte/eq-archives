<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Uthgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The good.<br />
-	Evenly matched PvP duels. This really tests your character and players skills.<br />
-	Hunting other players. This can be a lot of fun. I generally do this when I see someone ganking low level players. I will hunt them down and try to take them out.<br />
-	PvP raids. This is a ton of fun. Last night we had a horde of alliance trying to over run Tauren Mill and we had to defend the city.<br />
-	You learn how to travel to avoid detection. You don’t use open roads or open areas. You need to stay under cover to avoid alliance.<br />
- PvP brings people together for protection. People group up just becuase its safer in numbers.<br />
<br />
The bad<br />
-	No rewards or penalty for PvP.<br />
-	I haven’t confirmed this but I heard equipment doesn’t matter in PvP for resists or AC. I guess it’s a flat value when fighting other players.<br />
<br />
The Ugly<br />
-	A complete gankfest. There are very few evenly matched duels.<br />
-	Corpse camping does exist. Although you can take a ghost rez but it can be painful when it happens over and over.<br />
-	You cannot do quests in some zones because of the rampant ganking. Hillsbrad is horrible to quest in. <br />
-	Right now 90% of the PvP is about high levels killing low levels. Hopefully this will die down some when people start reaching 60 or they tweak the PvP ruleset.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Bout what I anticipated.  I'm really looking forward to the battlegrounds.  I'd made a character on a PvP server, but the ganking just doesn't sound any more fun in wow than it did in EQ.  Particularly high levels slaughtering low levles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I never thought I'd be into PvP either, but honestly, I don't think I could go back to carebear now.  <br />
<br />
Is there ganking?  Sure, of course.  But it's not rampant, and you just have to use your head, be observant, and not use a hilltop as your pull spot.  I don't think ganking is the awful problem people are making it out to be.  Also, if you're grouped, PVP will be either discouraged (most gankers won't go for a group, even if they have 5+ lvls on the gankees) or it'll turn into group PvP, which is a blast like at the stormgarde castle in arathi.  <br />
<br />
I've had ?? alliance pass me by while I was questing, and I've had some slaughter me mercilessly.  I've even had a combination of the two.  I was at the mountain yetis in alterac and a 40ish hunter (I was 32 at the time) was having his way with me, but each time I'd run back, charge, fear, and do my damndest to kill him and take my spot back.  He killed me every time, but on my fourth run, he saluted me, cleaned out the cave I needed to quest in, and /cheered as I went my way.<br />
<br />
Overall, big thumbs up for PvP.  I don't know where all these horror stories are coming from.</div></div><hr />
