<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wazbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Some strange new golem looking thing on the patcher, looks kind of cool, blue with light blue glowing stripes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Looks like an orc from Lord of the rings</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Murphy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Very impressive.<br />
Smells of new engine to me. Bump mapping and shadows on the steps ?<br />
<br />
Edit: bah. Looking at the screenshots on http://everquest.station.sony.com/gatesofdiscord/<br />
shows that it is the same old graphics engine. Guess that pic on the log in screen isnt from the game.<br />
<br />
No mention of the expansion having a new engine either, nor an increase in lvl cap ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Stareff2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">the new berzerker race maybe???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Da Mighty Akymeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Aye agreed they look the like the Uri Kai (sp) that Saruman sends out in the Two Towers.<br />

Sad I know but im off to see LOTR ROTK at midnight tonight<br />

I also notice at the bottom of the pre-order page that the price is $29.99. And that's the pre-order price.<br />
<br />
A bit high I think considering that you can buy Evolution with everything except for LDoN for $24.50. <br />
<br />
I will NOT be just handing more money over to SOE for this! (Now where's my credit card?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeah, I hear you, &quot;Damn this thing is expensive&quot;, as I type in my credit card numbers.  Oh well, I'm hooked, might as well admit it.  But, I'm actually spending less by playing EQ and just buying the expansions a couple times a year vs. buying 1-2 games a month at $50 a pop, which is what I used to do.<br />
<br />
OK, now the important stuff, any info on the new spells or aa's?  I am really curious to see if they are addressing any of the Shaman issues.  I hope they are making improvements to slow (Shaman only of course) and canni (needs to be updated), that's all I want for Christmas.  :)<br />
<br />
Please post any info that anyone may uncover.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">wow... a whopping 30 bucks. Almost the price of 4 movies. Wonder if I can squeeze 8 hours of enjoyment out of the new expansion! :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I hadnt been to the site before.  Was interesting to read.  100 new AA's.  So every class might get 5 or 6.<br />
<br />
Quite handy how the Wayfarers just 'happened' to find the Gromzek stone, neatly tying up the lore left raggedly handing by the end of the LoY expansion. <br />
<br />
Sounds interesting.  I'll probably buy it, if for nothign else than to see new zones.  Im sick of PoP and getting tired of the same LDoN themes lately.</div></div><hr />

You need to get working on your gear too.  Looking ugly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">What the heck is going on here?  Orcs weren't in Tron!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">At least there's no mention of a level cap bump.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Over on Monkly-Business somebody called it a &quot;poor tron rip-off.&quot;<br />
<br />
Personally I thought it sorta looked like one of the Monsters from AD &amp; D's &quot;SpellJammer&quot; series.<br />
<br />
New models, new skins. Can't complain. It could be &quot;craftizons&quot; with a whopping 20 or so MOB models.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Zugarbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">great.<br />

<br />
Finally! Ive been waiting since luclin for EQ to breathe at least a little bit of life into the old world cities, LDoN at least populates some old world zones, heres hoping this brings some interest to Halas and maybe a bit of RP into the game again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">New Tribute System enhances gameplay by allowing players to choose beneficial attributes, skills, or effects through offerings at their home cities.<br />

Seems like a potential money sink...and/or a way for extreme farmers and those that buy plats online to get some (more) easy goodies.  I'd like to see them tie this into the adventure merchants...let people pay tons of plats for adventure points...that way people at least have to do enough LDoN to unlock stuff to buy rather than just easily obtaining great stuff for zero effort.<br />
<br />
I'm saddened by lack of mention of a new graphics engine...which has been rumored for a while.  The only thing I really wanted in an expansion was new enginre and more instanced content.<br />
<br />
More AAs and the fact that the expansion zones are all 50+ sounds good.  New (melee) class sounds like a silly idea to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">So what do trolls do?<br />
<br />
Go to their home city?  You know... Neriak? :)<br />
<br />
I might try a berserker just for scheits and grins.  Who knows, could be fun with the new Opening system which will likely be in place at that point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>wyrdrune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">&quot;the new berzerker race maybe???&quot;<br />
<br />
Berserkers are new class, not new race.<br />
Unnecessary new class, but new class nonetheless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">My first impression was that it looked like the troll race from Dark Ages of Camelot.</div></div><hr />

A giff? I kinda thought the same thing minus the glowing stripes.</div></div><hr />
