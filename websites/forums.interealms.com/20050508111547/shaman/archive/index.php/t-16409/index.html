<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Alright so for the most part normal mode adventures are lookin' pretty easy for a full group, but has anyone tried out the HARD setting yet?  Everyone one of my groups seems too scared to ruin their precious record so I havent gotten a chance to try it for myself.<br />
<br />
So for anyone that has played a hard adventure:<br />
How does it compare to normal mode? What do the mobs hit for etc.<br />
Did you complete the adventure?  How many points is it worth?  What kind of group is needed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Juff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">*This is second hand info - I can't personally verify it*<br />
<br />
Mobs quad for ~900.  All mitigate slow.  Group needs to be well balanced.  71 points for a successful completion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nuggruk RN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">First one I tried was a hard setting assasinate in guk.<br />
<br />
Mobs do indeed hit for 900ish and mitigate slow to the &quot;mostly&quot; setting, so not to much.<br />
<br />
The main problem we had was the huge number of hitpoints the mobs had, warrior, rogue, monk and a wizzy and they were still taking a fair old time to go down.<br />
<br />
We had a couple of deaths, no big deal, ressed and went on, we were only about half way through when the time limit expired. We tried having the rogue tag the boss mob and pull it back to us but he kept getting variously rooted or HT'd.<br />
<br />
Was a blast though.<br />
<br />
<br />
Have Fun<br />

<br />
Normal vs Hard is a good bit of difference. Mobs are alot tougher in High risk. More HP and hit alot harder and faster.<br />
<br />
First two we did on high risk setting in Rijarkian(sp?) we won, but it took alot of time. The next two in Guk on High risk... not even close to winning.<br />
<br />
Completing High Risk is 76 points compared to 51 for Normal.<br />
<br />
High risk groups? DPS DPS DPS... oh, and more DPS.<br />
<br />
Guk is a nightmare on High Risk... would avoid High Risk Guk unless you have one heck of a powerhouse group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">did highrisk in guk and assasinated 56 mobs or so.. Sure, they hitted for 900ish and so.. But wasnt to hard with me, chanter, war, war, mage, clr. We had 1 warrior pull and offtank and most were easily messed and slowed. Wiped once tho due to a bad pull with 8 mobs :p<br />
But anyway.. had a blast in that and 76 points more..</div></div><hr />

Yeah, but look at your damn gear! Hard mode is NOT for average players. Normal mode is about right for average people, some you can win with time to spare, and some are real close or lost with a normal pickup group. If you have a regular group that knows how to play together, normal may seem a bit easier, but if it was any harder, the average pickup group would never win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">ack, yes that is true.. It is way to hard for the average dungeoncrawler if thats what you mean I guess.. I think the hard ones are designed to be a challenge for time-equiped players too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">We beat a high risk collection mission last night.  Was hella fun.<br />
<br />
Monk as tank (~4300 hp unbuffed), ranger, bard, shaman (me), and two clerics (to fill the last slot, we took the first person who logged on, who was another cleric  :p ).<br />
<br />
Main problem we had was that clerics were getting heal agro fairly often.  That and the bard kept opening all the traps, got 4 of us drunk at one point.   :D   If we had had a plate tank, I'm pretty sure it would have been near trivial.<br />
<br />
Please note the non-elementalness of my gear.  All the people along were similarly equipped, as we're all guildmates.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Soulcraver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I too have found that Guk is tough.  I hear the Everfrost adventure can be tough as well but haven't done one.  But tons of casters/healers in Guk and their HPs seem higher than a couple of other themes like Takish'Hiz that I've done.  Those eyeball guys can be a pain in the ass.  I crited two times in a row for a total of 8k damage and it equated to about 30% damage, having to cut through 25k hp mobs in a timed adventure where you have to kill 60% of the mobs in the dungeon to spawn the mob you have to assasinate and he's in the very depths of the dungeon is not trivial for your average to middle of the road 65 group.<br />
<br />
Doing a mass killing mission in there would be much easier but the assasination mission seemed tough to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Biggest thing that matters, if you have at least decent gear, seems to be your practice together. That is why I avoid unfamiliar groups, people that play together just learn each other's actions and can flow real well.<br />
<br />
Mill, drunk for 20 of the last 21 days</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rakji</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Mill, drunk for 20 of the last 21 days<br />
<br />
You should think about getting some help Mill, it really isn't cool being an alchoholic, even though most of them seem to think so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Maybe we just had bad luck or something. We are equipped well. First one we kept getting overpulls like the mobs were perma linked. Second one we just flat out ran out of time and not even halfway through the dungeon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">His liver will remind him of that later on Rakji.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Cremkorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Will you guys quit preaching.   If the guy enjoys drinking and doesnt hurt anyone (ie drink and drive) then your holier then thou garbage is just that: garbage.<br />
<br />
On a LDoN note one thing that I have noticed is that chain pulling is a must.  Had a group with the tank pulling and literally the buzzer went off as we were looting the last fang we needed.  I started pulling about halfway through and that was the only reason it was close.<br />
<br />
Thank god canni &gt;&gt; medding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">We did reasonably well in a hard mission with the following group makeup in Miraguls:<br />
<br />
Cleric (I was playing cleric)<br />
Warrior<br />
Enchanter<br />
Rogue<br />
Beastlord<br />
Wizard<br />
<br />
<br />
a. The cleric was hard pressed to keep up with healing, and I kept a pretty close eye on mana, the warrior was beserk on around 50% of the complete heals. I was starting cheals at around 70%.  The warrior had around 8k hps.<br />
<br />
b. A backup healer would have been nice, not sure what to do about that, although a my shaman may be viable when he gets his new curse dot (we didn't get mobs dead fast enough as it was).<br />
<br />
c. Enchanter was pretty useful. In general all of the pulls were double pulls and pacify was resisted often enough to make it interesting. And we had a few 4 pulls (only one of which we had to evac from). FD pulling might negate this, the problem with FD pulling is that it takes time, something we have precious little of in hard dungeons.<br />
Although not wiping to a 4 pull could certainly be considered time saving.<br />
<br />
d. The beastlord handled slowing no problem. The enchanter threw a few slows, but the beastlord was able to handle it without breaking a sweat. Not sure if my shaman's AE slow would help significantly on some of the larger pulls or not.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I've tried hard missions twice now.  First was a collection and we won with like 15 minutes to spare.  The second was assassination and we lost, mainly due to having no good puller.  Having a good FD puller seems key to a hard mission.  We had a bard but she could only do so much, and I dont think she had Fading Dreams AA.  <br />
The thing with Hard missions is you're going to want rather advanced characters along for the ride.  You can fudge with some classes, but most of the chars had better be good quality raiders, or it's going to be quite tough to pull off a win.  Hard is hard, truth in advertising.  You also need a more balanced group on average.  <br />
<br />
Normal is really easy tho.  I main heal for Normal missions of all sorts without any trouble whatsoever.  I also help with CC, I slow, and I often pull too.  It's not really any trouble most of the time.  I did 5 successful normal missions today with a necro for CC, him being able to mez undead mobs only, which was a help in situations where there were undead adds.  Other than that tho, it was quite easy to keep the group moving and killing fast, even with people who weren't raiders.  One of the missions, we lost a person at the start who never logged back on, so we did it with 5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">We tried hard mode today, as we are winning most easy missions in 30-50mins average (I was on played 9 won 9 on easy mode before trying hard)<br />
<br />
Was a 'hard' orc collection dungeon, we could handle the pullls/multiples up to 3 ok, just simply could not put out enough DPS - I was hammering c4/5 and raining/nuking to the point of skimming aggro with MA all the time (using EB/TB combo), couldnt really do much more heh. <br />
<br />
Will probably try again soon, go for an 'kill 50ish' mission, as we managed to kill 45mobs or so in 75 mins quite easy (gave up and went to bed with 15 left)<br />
<br />
Also drop rate seemed much streakier than normal mode, we'd often kill 10-12 mobs with no item, and we needed 30 bits ho hum ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Denn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I did hard today in MM. We failed, I think due to no FD puller. We were doing great until we pulled 5. Enchanter was getting alot of resists on mez.<br />
After the first wipe it went all downhill.<br />
<br />
We found a named and dropped +7str +7wis +7 something 100hp 90mana ring all/all no drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Trueborn Elite Ring (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=23414) is probably the ring you're talking about?<br />

There is no easy mode. There is normal and hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Doing normal is considered easy from some aspects. I do normal all the time to get the points needed as fast as possible and try to get slaughter adventures where I pull. Killing 57 mobs in Rujarkian is a fast way to get to bane and 40hp all/all augments etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">on test they doubled the points for hard, no point in doing them till then<br />

can do 3 normals in the time it takes to do 1 hard</div></div><hr />

This sounds like a guy who orders &quot;regular&quot; size drinks at a fast food place because they have &quot;small - regular - large&quot; instead of &quot;small - medium - large&quot;.<br />
<br />
But you know, if I order a medium, they give me the same thing.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
The problem is, a lot of the people calling &quot;normal&quot; mode easy seem to have 5k+hp and 6k+mana, along with resists and ac, etc. It's kind of like a 65 calling a 60 a newb. It bothers me too, but since it seems it will be the norm here, I won't bother commenting on it any more.<br />
<br />
Normal mode isn't easy for some of us, but it is semi challenging, and fun most of all.<br />
<br />
Edit: Before people start yelling about only having 3500hp and its still easy, notice I said a lot of the people, not all of the people. With the normal bazaar equipped people like myself and the people I group with most of the time, normal mode is perfect, not easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Normal mode is just about right for me, too.  I have failed twice and succeeded twice so far.  (Both failures were on collections, seems to me that those are tighter than the others).<br />
<br />
My point was that if there are two levels of difficulty, they are going to end up being called &quot;easy&quot; and &quot;hard&quot; regardless of how easy or hard the person talking about them thinks they are.  I wouldn't try to read anything more into it than that.  It's possible the person you quoted said more and you were REALLY responding to that, you didn't use /quote and I didn't bother to backtrack to see who you quoted, but it looked like your probelm was solely with the word &quot;easy&quot; to describe the easier mode.</div></div><hr />

Lol, your right Weiss, I was kind of getting bugged by a few comments on a few different threads, and combined all my comments into a reply with you quoted. Sorry bout that.</div></div><hr />
