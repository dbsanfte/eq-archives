<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>slitherr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">so when its Researched is it tradable</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Irmm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">to my knowledge all spells are tradeable either them being droped off an NPC or researched.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>howie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would think that any of the combined spells would have to be tradable/droppable, becuase a second party has to do the combines for us.  I know I'll be checking the bazaar for those rare spells.  However chances are they'll be way over priced just like the mob dropped ones, at least until the market is floodded with them.  :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kraegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would expect that the researched primal avatar will be no drop.  There is only one entry for primal avatar in lucy - no drop.  Research is just another way to get the spell - but it will yeild the same scroll with the exact same properties unless VI decides to change the coding manually.  So - either int casters research a no drop spell, or SOE will remove the spell or change the tag to make it droppable.  Here's hoping it becomes droppable :)  (i doubt it though because that will make regular avatar useless)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm guessing they'll make it droppable considering they made it researchable.  Many things including primal weapons have already made regular avatar useless so I don't think that will have anything to do with it.  If anything they'll just be too lazy to remove the no drop tag.  I didn't think the regular primal was no drop so what do I know though  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>KaisonIcebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i was in st  tonight (3/13/03) the droped version is still no drop...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lorrial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm guessing they'll make it droppable considering they made it researchable.<br />
<br />
Since an INT caster has to research it for you, it would really suck if it were not tradeable :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well, I always thought of Primal Avatar as being like the Ancient spells... nodrop, and meant to be that way.<br />
<br />
If that's so, it's silly that it's researchable at all. So, either way there's a bug, and either way the researched version is useless to shamans right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I agree, seems silly to have this spell tradable. Why not just remove the regent from avatar if they were going to do that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I certainly don't care if it's tradable.<br />
It SUCKS ASS compared to Ferine Avatar which isn't that expensive to buy in the bazaar, adds 50 more attack/str/dex/agil, and has a recast time of ONE minute as opposed to THREE minutes on PA.  <br />
<br />
I also have Ancient: Feral Avatar.<br />
That's at the back of my book too.<br />
<br />
But at least shamans have one ancient spell that wasn't rendered obsolete by PoP spells like druid ancients were (ancient DS, ancient moonfire, PoP versions are much better).  Ancient: Scourge of Nife has a very nice ratio and stacks with our other DoTs to add some very hefty DPS.</div></div><hr />

Very true on the DPS but well do you meet many mobs face to face after using those DoT's Land?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Whats wrong with being IN ETH FACE!! or how ever it goes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Megara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">LOL We were doing the arena in Tactics the other day.  We got an add and I slowed and attacked to get aggro while the group finished off the first mob... while they were trying (in vain) to get the add off me, I started hollering, &quot;IN TEH FACE BABY!!!!&quot;  They all thought I was nuts :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>eq_newb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">just curious....where did &quot;in teh face&quot; come from? apparently some quick typing shammy or someone who failed a few english courses lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">it came from some dip**** on another forum complaining about how overpowered shaman were , that we have all these abilities and &quot; Tank things in the Face&quot;.  Sprinkle on a lil Jeffk ala http://www.somethingawful.com/ and you get what was once a common joke for all shaman to enjoy. Its a lil played out now , but still funny sometimes.</div></div><hr />
