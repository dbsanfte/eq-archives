Just can't seem to bring myself to log into EQ.  I left a Time/God raiding guild and I have not looked back.  I do miss my friends  from EQ but I have made more and some are starting to join me in CoH.<br />
<br />
CoH is just plan fun.  With the new content scheduled to go love on 5/28 it will be that much better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Actually, after getting a character to level 10, I'm finding it pretty boring.<br />
<br />
No gear, same fights over and over. <br />
<br />
I just wanted a fun game to play with John, but we are quickly becoming bored. Oooh, office mission. Oooh, kill stuff in a neighborhood. <br />
<br />
Plus, I'm surprised at some dumb stuff the game does. Giving a low level character a contact in a neighborhood of very high level mobs, for example. Also, last night, we got a mission, zoned in, the first monster was a bright red mind controller and killed us both quickly.<br />
<br />
I don't feel like a super hero, at all. It's miss miss miss. I'll probably stick it out until level 14, I really want to try Fly but I can see this game quickly losing its appeal. You kill one mob on the street, you've basically killed them all.<br />
<br />
I also hate the lack of a true rez, experience debt blows.<br />

<br />
I have done 3 chars but will focus on my blaster for a bit.  Some of the higher zones are amazing.  level 10 to 14 may be boring for you but trust me the 20+ level zones are a hoot.   It hard at that level 20 + so tatics are a must.  <br />
<br />
Undead looking soldiers, the Mech warror gang, freakshow, etc.  Mobs change from zone to zone.  Some stay the same but get MORE powerful and different minons.  Circle of Thorns come to mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dullsville</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm still having fun.  Granted, I've rerolled my main about five times and I'm still only level 12.  Even though the missions can sometimes seem repetitive, there are still enough little twists and turns to keep it interesting for me.  <br />
<br />
For instance, a friend and I have been working through the Vahzilok (sp?) story arc, and after finishing one of the missions last night the game sent out a hit squad of sorts after us.  We were fighting just some 5th Column in Steel Canyon and out of the blue a group of about four Embalmed Abominations, four regular Abominations, two Reapers, and two Mortificators rounded the corner and slaughtered my friend.  The ones we weren't able to kill in the first attack showed up out of the blue again about five minutes later and attacked us while we were fighting some more 5th Column on the other side of the city.  A similar thing has happened to us after running a 5th Column mission.  I don't know if this is just a normal, random thing, but it was pretty damn fun.<br />
<br />
It's little things like that which keep this game interesting and fun for me. Plus, I've heard from plenty of other people that it gets more entertaining once you get to the higher level zones.  I'm also curious to see what this next update will be like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Oh yeah, random death, that sounds like GREAT fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dullsville</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I didn't die so it was fun for me, and even though he died, it didn't bother him.  My point was that this game actually does unexpected things at times to keep it lively.  Honestly though, I'll take a random death to something the game threw at me out of the blue over spending my time online camping the same spawns anyday. /shrug<br />
<br />
Now don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to imply the game is perfect or that everyone will like it.  All I'm saying is that for being live less than a month, and prior to any major update, it's dynamic enough to keep me interested and having fun.  I agree that if they don't continue to mix things up often enough it can get old and tired, and I will eventually lose interest, but that's pretty much the same story for any MMOG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>aphex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i'm kind of in the same boat as Gloriana as far as how basic the gameplay is. the &quot;quests&quot; are basically talk to a contact, he/she instructs you to kill X amount of mobs. over and over and over. i have found myself able to complete every quest solo (empathy/pshycic), some being much harder than others. i've rerolled two toons up to 13. i'm hoping it gets a little more interesting as i'm sure it will. <br />
<br />
i am still finding the game a nice alternative to EQ, it's just way more repetative (is that possible?!) EQ at least has a lot of creativity/annoying crap involved in their quests. i understand that this game is still in it's early stages and i will stick it out for a while. i have a habit of comparing new releases to a 5yr developed EQ and that's not fair to me or these potentially great games.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah - just keep in mind when trying to compare this game to EQ that you're comparing a 2-ish week old game to one that's been out for 5+ years.<br />
<br />
I did log onto EQ the other night to give all my SK's gear away to random PoK folks before my subscription timer ran out, and darned if I didn't get stuck on a rock within the first second or two of trying to move and have to wait a few minutes before I could even /rewind to unstick myself from the geometry :( <br />
<br />
I'm having fun so far in CoH - lots of it, and with a lot of my old friends that had left for DAoC a while back, or on other games.  It's nice to get the old guild back together and play again.  Whatever game you play, an MMORPG is basically about meeting people and killing things to get stronger at it's heart.  I'd just rather do it in CoH with friends.<br />
<br />
As the game gets more mature, it will fill out some.  Code takes time, and money, to write ... and now that the game's gone post-release, they can finally start recouping some of their initial development costs and funding more programmers for updates.  I have a lot of faith in it from what I've seen, and from the storyline/backstory.  That's crucial to make your world seem &quot;real&quot; in my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">So far I have mixed feelings on CoH.   Have not quit EQ - but on down time or when I only have a hour or so - jump on CoH.   <br />
<br />
As Gloriana has mentioned, so far its a bit boring other than making new charactors and costumes.   <br />
<br />
Plus the whole non-kill steal concept is driving me crazy.  Since you share exp on kills somewhat based on your damage output, everyone appears to shoot first/ask questions (hardly) later.   When teams filled with lvl 10/11 folks wander through zones wasting lvl 6/7 mobs even if said mob (s) are in current battles ... its a problem.   <br />
<br />
What's funny is last night, broadcasts were going all night about quit 'helping me - without asking' ... with responsing answers &quot;old EQ habits die hard, don't they&quot;.   Sad in either respect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I've found that by asking folks politely to &quot;DON'T KS PLEASE&quot; - it tends to help.<br />
<br />
I've even set up the following bind on my keyboard for it.<br />
<br />
/bind k &quot;l DON'T KS PLEASE!&quot;<br />
<br />
works like a champ.  Now I just have to whack the &quot;k&quot; key whenever someone starts to do it.<br />
<br />
On protector though, folks are getting better about it.  I've seen less over the last few days, and this morning someone jumped a group of mobs I had just cast on from around the corner, and he dis-engaged immediately, ran over to me and apologized, saying &quot;Sorry, I didn't see you here already.&quot; then ran off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Whenever I have to solo or join a pickup group, this game gets pretty boring.  However, I usually get to play with my EQ friends, and that is always a lot of fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">All MMORPGs are the same.  And IMO, you're kidding yourself if you think otherwise ... <br />
<br />
Kill stuff, get stronger to kill different stuff (and maybe items) to kill different stuff and get stronger ... repeat for infinity.<br />
<br />
Where the difference comes in is the folks you meet and enjoy hanging out with.  Then, it doesn't matter what server or game world it is - it's in the people.  That's one of the only reasons EQ's been able to hang on as long as it has - is because folks won't leave without each other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'm having more fun now than when I started. Now that I'm finally working on my character instead of stressing myself about how to order the build and such.<br />
<br />
I've finished 5 story arcs, and am almost done with a 6th. Doing missions and raiding hazard zones is just as repetitive as any EQ raid or BoT grind, but the combat itself is more fun.<br />
<br />
Was in a random pick up group in Faultline the other day, the composition of the group shifting every 15-20 minutes (and no problem getting new people, there's always someone with TP friend to bring people to the group from the zoneline), and we never took a break. Pure unbridled carnage for close to 6 hours. Only problem was that it felt like about ONE hour, just because the time passed so quickly.<br />
<br />
There's a fair amount of sameness in the early levels...not much difference between hellions and skulls. Once you get into the mid-teens, stuff starts to pick up. You start running into things like CoT spectrals, Tsoo (and their @#$@#(*$@# sorcerers), Outcast LTs, and other stuff where they don't just run up and try to hit you, but you have to actually use tactics or you don't have a chance in hell of beating them. The higher you go, the more player powers the villians start to employ, the smarter they employ them (yes, mobs actually do smart things), and the more they employ them.<br />
<br />
EQ was done for me anyway, it's just nice to have something else. The lead designer of CoH has been dropping hints on the official boards about how what is currently in the game is just the tip of the iceberg for what they have planned, and there will be lots of stuff to do.<br />
<br />
***EDIT***<br />
<br />
As for the random death thing, it isn't really random at all. The villians in this game are not content to wait for you to come mess up their plans...when you have missions against them, they will send minions to take you out first. They also do it in a consistant fashion. Trolls, being hyped up nutjobs don't do it. The 5th Column, being a subversive special operations military organization, does it all the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Anyone going into CoH with an EQ-mindset is sure to be disappointed.  I hear it from ex-EQ-clerics a lot &quot;the exp penalty is too harsh!&quot;  Which, honestly, I think is patently absurd.  50% of your exp goes toward your penalty from death until it's worked off.  You NEVER have a more severe effect from dying than that.  No de-leveling.  No corpse runs.  Hell, you should always have a rez &quot;potion&quot; on you so you shouldn't even have to miss the fight (if you don't, even random pickup group members will be happy to hand you one, which they can do as you lie bleeding on the ground).<br />
<br />
I would say the death system in CoH is TOO forgiving, were I stuck in that EQ-mentality.  As it is, it's FUN this way -- because no matter how many times I die, I'm always making progress with every kill.  Not like EQ, where I can travel the same ground exp-wise over and over and OVER again.<br />
<br />
Really, this game is ideal for my man and I - who play primarily with each other, and whatever friends happen to be on at the time.  <br />
<br />
The only complaint I really have is the tremendous amount of time we spend running back and forth between contacts in different zones.  This should improve with Fly - and honestly if it bugs me so much, I should've taken some of the running speed skills.  My best advice for the starting player is honestly to take the skills that appeal most to you, and message boards &amp; power builds be damned.<br />
<br />
I'm definitely still having fun.  But I think that's due, in large part, to not trying to make CoH into EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Gloriana...  You will change your mind once you get one of the travel power in a few levels.<br />
<br />
My advice to the debt system complain:  Put a duct tape over the xp bar.  And forget it's even there.<br />
<br />
I have spent most of my time in city of heroes gathering souvenir instead of staring at the xp bar.<br />
Look at the clues before picking a new mission, contents are there to be found.<br />
<br />
XP debt doesn't impact you in anyway.  I have gotten 20K debt in one night (lvl 24) and I paid it out in the next day, and I leveled up while paying it too.<br />
<br />
Be patient, lvl 10-14 is where most people have a hard time with.  If you're playing this game just for the sake of getting to level 40 (or 50), you'll be disappointed.  <br />
<br />
Put the duct tape over the xp bar, seriously.<br />
<br />
PS: Once you get to 15+, you're facing much more challenges.  Zerging doesn't work that well any more.  More types of challenging mobs opened up (Tsoo, Family, 5th column robos, sky raiders, etc.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Meglo Maeneac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I have to say I find it boring as well.<br />
<br />
I find myself pining for some of the things people often complain about in EQ.  For example, I find myself wishing for equipment.  Call it weird, but equipment is what gives, for many people, a sense of advancement.  CoH has zero sense of advancement.  Let me explain.<br />
<br />
Now, a character recieves a total of 9 possible 'Primary Skills' and 9 possible 'Secondary Skills.'  These skills are not unlike EQ spells.  The only big difference is that CoH is designed in such a manner that you continually use the same skills/spells over and over again.<br />
<br />
For example, a Super Strength tanker gets Jab at level one.  At level 40 (the max ATM), that tanker will still be using Jab.  It would be akin to a wizard in EQ only having the level 1 spell.  <br />
<br />
Now, for different classes, the skills upgrade at a different rate.  For my blaster, for example, it's typically +2 damage per level.  For my tanker, it's virtually negligable.  Jab started out doing 7 points of damage and 11 level later it does 11.  Yippie.<br />
<br />
Also, since there is no equipment, there is no change in how you look.  Hope you are happy with how your guy looks at level 1.<br />
<br />
Lastly, looking at what level you are.  It's a PITA to say the least.  While looking at your level, you are unable to do *anything* else.  It's akin to looking at your spell book back before Kunark.  Ditto for enhancement's.<br />
<br />
All this shows for a decided lack of feeling that you are improving.<br />
<br />
Also, lets look at Enhacements, if we may.  :)  Enhancements are about the only form of equipment the game has.  To be honest, I highly doubt the enhancments do much of anything.  Let me explain.  :)<br />
<br />
I recieved a nifty power called Flurry.  This basically makes me hit 9-11 times (I lose track) for minimal damage.  Typically it's 3 damage per hit on normal guys, 1 on bosses, and 4 if the guy is 5 levels below me.  <br />
<br />
Now, when I got this power, it had 0 Enhancement Damage.  I quickly put in two 10++ enhancements for a total of +24 Enhanced Damage.  It did zero, zip, nada more damage.  Same for the other various skills.  It appears, to me anyway, that these things are for looks only, since they do virtually nothing.<br />
<br />
Now, in testing this, I put 6 enhancment slots on my healer.  With six +10 healing, for a total of +60 healing, my character healed for +2hp each time.  Yay.  :P<br />
<br />
I dunno.. the guy seems to be interesting for alot of people, but I see alot of disinterest as well.  when the game came out, I wasn't a big fan and was virtually crucified for it.  Now, about a month into the game, I am meeting alot of people who are not as happy with it.  I'd be interested in seeing what they say 6 months from now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I quickly put in two 10++ enhancements for a total of +24 Enhanced Damage.

<br />
Your comprehension of how enhancements work is...well, let's be kind and say TOTALLY NONEXISTANT.<br />
<br />
They do do something, it just isn't very evident on a power like Flurry, because of the way that power works. You are better off putting in Disorient enhancements to increase the chance of a successful disorient. 2 10++ is not 24. You are taking a base damage 3 hit, and increasing it by 16.6%. 16.6% of 3 is not a whole number, so no, your damage is not going to go up.<br />
<br />
It isn't the game's fault that you don't know how it works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Jenavyra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I've been having a blast in the game.  I've remade my main 5 or 6 times, and almost all my character slots on my server (Liberty) are full with ~level 5 characters (highest is 7).  While the game can get a little repetitive at times, I've come to the conclusion that any MMO is going to be.  At least you can get instanced missions where you don't have to randomly run around looking for free mobs.  The amount of costume customization means that my character actually looks the way she should, not just something I settled on because it was the best of a few choices.  Once they add in the NPC tailors in a couple weeks, you'll even be able to change it if you get tired of it later on.<br />
<br />
I've also had instances of a faction (5th column) sending out a hit team to take out me and my partner on the way to a mission.  That was just too cool for words.  That sort of little things gives me real hope that there will eventually be use for battle tactics, that the AI is actually good.  One thing I get frustrated with sometimes is the way Skulls/Hellions (low level, mind you) run away all the time, but really, it makes a ton of sense.  If I was a street thug, and I had a half-demon looking chick punching the crap out of me, I'd run away too!  And they almost always seem to run towards another group of thugs.  Again, that makes sense.  I've had a 5th column rifleman hide behind a potted plant behind a door in a mission that took me forever to find; he kept sniping me when I'd run into the room looking for him.  They're little things, but when I think back on them, I realize how cool they really are.<br />
<br />
I *love* that you can accomplish a lot in an hour.  I work, my husband works a lot, we just moved into a much bigger townhouse and have tons to do, but we can still advance in the game without having to play 10 hours a day.  I like that you don't have to camp equipment for this same reason.  Most of the lower level enhancements seem readily available if you put a little effort into earning influence; this may change later, I don't know, but right now, it works pretty well.  <br />
<br />
So far, I've really enjoyed the game a lot, though I do have to admit that I find much more enjoyment when playing with friends.  Soloing, while possible, just isn't as much fun.  It also tends to require more &quot;grinding&quot; to keep up with the mission level curves.  When leveling up with my husband, we do twice as many missions and get higher level than the same character would solo in the same time.  We also never run out of missions to do.  Will I still be having fun a month from now?  Well, who knows?  I'm guessing I will.  I played Diablo II for many months before finally getting sick of it, and still occassionaly pick it up again for kicks.  I'm thinking CoH will be good for at least that much, as it lacks most of the problems that tend to drive me away from other MMOs.  Just my opinion, as always, YMMV. :)<br />

Okay, that IS very cool!  I laughed my butt off when I saw a citizen cowering behind a potted plant, face to the wall, with her hands over her ears.  The fact that they bothered to put plant-code in just makes me giggle.<br />
<br />
It sounds like a lot of the things that I (and Jenavyra and others) really like about this game are what is going to drive others away.  Which is fine and dandy, honestly.  Some people need to get equipment to feel like they're progressing - I'll accept that as a perfectly valid way to enjoy the game, while realizing that ph4t l3wts and the drama that they cause really DID take a lot of the fun out of EQ for me.  Little as I cared for the drops, hearing people griping about loot always made me want to log out.<br />
<br />
One man's trash is another man's treasure.<br />
<br />
Of course, my sister has a full-time job and is a full-time student - obviously my priority is to be able to play with her regardless of how little time she has, or how much time *I* might have....  Everyone has different priorities.<br />
<br />
I ADORE the elegance of having one power that scales up as I level.  The alternative in EQ was having some levels where your spells were nearly useless, because you're waiting for your next batch of spells.  <br />
<br />
I've got no problems conceding that CoH is angling to hook the casual gamers out there.  Those who want to play for an hour at a stretch, those who don't really want to commit to 4-6 hours a night on a game (not that I don't often play that long anyway, but I don't HAVE to  *grin*)<br />
<br />
Avalach hit it on the head - duct tape on the exp bar.  I'm sure CoH will get boring and repetitive eventually.  Point for me just now is that ALL of EQ is now boring and repetitive - whereas CoH surprises me on a fairly regular basis.  It's about paying attention to what's going on around me and catching the little things.  Again, it's gonna take different things to satisfy different people.</div></div><hr />

I really respect that Cryptic/NCSoft seem to have accepted this.  They aren't trying to make a game that caters to absolutely everyone.  CoH shows a distinctive slant towards the casual gamer on the spectrum of players.  There are plenty of other MMOs out there for the more hardcore players, so (for me, at least!) seeing a game like this one is exciting.  And flight is just too darn cool!<br />
<br />
The one thing that I wish for the game:  playing as a super strength tanker, I just *need* to have little **POW!** and **KABAAM!** messages popping up in bright colors all around me.  Now *that* would be hilarious, and oh-so-fitting for the genre.  ;)  <br />

I was up till 3am and contemplating an all nighter because I could not put it down. Rational thought overcame that because I knew today would be a friday and I could play all weekend! <br />
<br />
The call outs are just too cool. The cartoonish text clouds are awesome too. <br />
<br />
Its hard to tell damage sometimes to tell just how much the enhancements help...but at this low level it is a moot point since as an energy blaster the good blast does like 60% dmg to a blue mob and a good 25%-30% dmg to an even or yellow.<br />
<br />
The misses in a way seem like HOW CAN YOU MISS???? But then I imagine it like if stuff is comming out of your hands and the guy knocks your hands off course....  you will miss. If he dodges you will miss... This is not a gripe at all. I just wish I could see a bit more detail as to why I miss, or a reason like- so and so's attack unbalances you so your attack goes astray.. or etc.<br />

<br />
Jenavyra, you can EASILY do this with /bind commands.<br />
<br />
Take whatever the name of your power is and bind it to a keyboard, or hotkey macro.<br />
<br />
e.g.<br />
<br />
/bind 1 &quot;powexec_name Jab$$local BAM!!&quot;<br />
<br />
/bind 2 &quot;powexec_name Slash$$local **KAPLOWIE!!**&quot;<br />
<br />
/bind 1 &quot;powexec_slot 1$$local **POW!!**&quot;<br />
<br />
/bind 2 &quot;powexec_slot 2$$local **KABAAM!**&quot;<br />
<br />
and the interface supports a lot more than that.<br />
<br />
I have a lot of neat things like that in my setup.<br />
<br />
<br />
/bind f &quot;powexec_name Sprint$$powexec_name Hover&quot;<br />
-- this sets my keyboard so that hitting the &quot;F&quot; key will switch me between hover and sprint and ensure only one is running at a time... when sprint comes on, it switches hover off, and vice versa - to help me save endurance, and I can do it with one key.<br />
<br />
I have my mez and heal buttons set up similarly.<br />
<br />
2 is my mez hotkey.<br />
/bind 2 &quot;powexec_name Mesmerize$$team MEZZING --[ $target ]-- HANDS OFF&quot;<br />
<br />
/bind 0 &quot;powexec_name Healing Aura$$team INCOMING HEAL, GET CLOSE&quot;<br />
<br />
macros work roughly the same, except you have to name the macro instead of binding it to a key on the keyboard.<br />
<br />
/macro Taunt &quot;powexec_name Taunt$$team TAUNTING [ $target ]&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">You can also use /bind and macro in your hotkeys or keybinds to change your text size, color, text bubble colors, etc.<br />
<br />
Some folks have some super-complex binds... where they actually have a key bound to use accuracy or healing inspirations if they have any - just by the keyboard key.  That's very useful for considering them as potions and setting up a key to use that specific type of potion if you happen to have one.  They have them set up to use whichever potion is highest strength first until exhausted, then look for the next tier of heal potion, or whatever...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Meglo Maeneac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Your comprehension of how enhancements work is...well, let's be kind and say TOTALLY NONEXISTANT.<br />
<br />
They do do something, it just isn't very evident on a power like Flurry, because of the way that power works. You are better off putting in Disorient enhancements to increase the chance of a successful disorient. 2 10++ is not 24. You are taking a base damage 3 hit, and increasing it by 16.6%. 16.6% of 3 is not a whole number, so no, your damage is not going to go up.<br />
<br />
It isn't the game's fault that you don't know how it works.<br />
<br />
<br />
You're right that I don't know how it works.  <br />
<br />
Explain to me how 10++ x2 translates into 16.6% <br />
<br />
O.o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Shrewd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I have to say I find it boring as well.<br />
<br />
I find myself pining for some of the things people often complain about in EQ.  For example, I find myself wishing for equipment.  Call it weird, but equipment is what gives, for many people, a sense of advancement.  CoH has zero sense of advancement.  Let me explain.<br />
<br />
Now, a character recieves a total of 9 possible 'Primary Skills' and 9 possible 'Secondary Skills.'  These skills are not unlike EQ spells.  The only big difference is that CoH is designed in such a manner that you continually use the same skills/spells over and over again.<br />
<br />
For example, a Super Strength tanker gets Jab at level one.  At level 40 (the max ATM), that tanker will still be using Jab.  It would be akin to a wizard in EQ only having the level 1 spell.  <br />
<br />
Now, for different classes, the skills upgrade at a different rate.  For my blaster, for example, it's typically +2 damage per level.  For my tanker, it's virtually negligable.  Jab started out doing 7 points of damage and 11 level later it does 11.  Yippie.<br />
<br />
Also, since there is no equipment, there is no change in how you look.  Hope you are happy with how your guy looks at level 1.<br />
<br />
Lastly, looking at what level you are.  It's a PITA to say the least.  While looking at your level, you are unable to do *anything* else.  It's akin to looking at your spell book back before Kunark.  Ditto for enhancement's.<br />
<br />
All this shows for a decided lack of feeling that you are improving.<br />
<br />
Also, lets look at Enhacements, if we may.  :)  Enhancements are about the only form of equipment the game has.  To be honest, I highly doubt the enhancments do much of anything.  Let me explain.  :)<br />
<br />
I recieved a nifty power called Flurry.  This basically makes me hit 9-11 times (I lose track) for minimal damage.  Typically it's 3 damage per hit on normal guys, 1 on bosses, and 4 if the guy is 5 levels below me.  <br />
<br />
Now, when I got this power, it had 0 Enhancement Damage.  I quickly put in two 10++ enhancements for a total of +24 Enhanced Damage.  It did zero, zip, nada more damage.  Same for the other various skills.  It appears, to me anyway, that these things are for looks only, since they do virtually nothing.<br />
<br />
Now, in testing this, I put 6 enhancment slots on my healer.  With six +10 healing, for a total of +60 healing, my character healed for +2hp each time.  Yay.  :P<br />
<br />
I dunno.. the guy seems to be interesting for alot of people, but I see alot of disinterest as well.  when the game came out, I wasn't a big fan and was virtually crucified for it.  Now, about a month into the game, I am meeting alot of people who are not as happy with it.  I'd be interested in seeing what they say 6 months from now.<br />
<br />
Phat LEWT!!! Give me a break. I could care less about the loot. its about the fights. Are they satisfying? are you getting into tough battle fighting crime and criminals, or is it always a cake walk? <br />
<br />
EQ killed so much imagination in the people that play it, and the people that design for it. USE your imagination again... there are bad guys hurting innocent citizens and you can help! Thats the point... thats the role of a superhero. They are not in it for the cash, or the armor drops. Get into the role of super hero and this game is fantastic. Stay in the mindset of EQ and you will be disappointed forever.</div></div><hr />

A same-level training enhancement gives an 8.3% bonus. Two of them would give 16.6%. That assumes that you are level 12 using those 10++ enhancements. The math works out somewhat diffierently if you aren't level 12, but in no case is 2 training enhancements going to give you the 33% boost you need in order to see a whole-number per-hit increase in an attack like Flurry.</div></div><hr />

Those random deaths, as Gloriana put it, aren't random deaths. They're ambushes ;) You can't expect the enemy to just stand there until they see you charging in. They must know you're doing something to their factions, so they make sure they can try and get you.<br />
<br />
Just last night, doing a 5th Column storyline, my group and I were in the warehouse, clearing them out, looking for their leader and the hostages, when all of a sudden a large group of them popped out from behind us, an area we had already cleared, while we were in the middle of clearing out a bunch right there. It was the most intense seven minute fight, ever. <br />
<br />
We're just wiping out this party, trying to stay alive when WHAM! our blaster gets smoked in a heartbeat. We turn around to see the nazis behind us, and all of a sudden one of our tankers screams, 'Ambush!' I slap a Fortitude on him (Think Ferine Avatar, for the Empathy class) and he starts taunting off the blasters and controllers, who were behind the melee. I'm letting loose AE heals, single-target heals on the controllers, running out of endurance and thinking, dear God, let me regen enough back to save the Tanker or we're boned, and pulling them out of the red, time after time after time, gaining an endurance inspiration mid-battle and sucking it down right away, just in time to save two people with it, then draw aggro, hit hover, and get away from the fray, still healing who I can while they're whittling down the numbers, overwhelming us, and then a call of, 'Fall back!' Shut hover off, drop to the ground in front of a nazi with a flame thrower, tap sprint and run for it while they blast me. round the corner, duck behind a box after slapping a heal on the tank to top them off, while the nazis are chasing us down, hit rest, crouch down and start AE healing while I regen life and endurance, get back to full, jump out from the corner, lay down an AE slow (Psychic Scream) after clicking damage and accuracy inspirations and finishing off two of the eleven still there, chaingunning, grenading, flamethrowering. One of our controllers summons friend for our blaster's corpse, I resurrect him, full life and full endurance, hit him with my second Fortitude (I have it slotted with three DO timer reductions, so I can keep it on more than one person at a time) so he hits more, harder, and gets hit less. He lays down the AE fire while the controllers start locking them down more more. But they're still coming, more from behind the boxes, straggling behind the ones there. 'Fall back,' someone shouts again, and we do, closer and closer to the zone in, enemy fire all around us, chasing us down, hit points getting low and trying to figure out who will die if they don't get a heal now, and, by god, guessing right, the other person's heal coming just in time from having a second person die, nobody at full hit points, everyone's endurance dangerously low, targets dropping left and right, and then, in an instant, realize that we're winning! They're growing fewer and fewer, things are stabilizing, I let loose another AE slow and slap a heal on our tanker, since their Fortitude wore off, and picking off the last few and ... finally realize I'm not holding my breath anymore, because that was just intense.<br />
<br />
I can't wait to do it again tonight!<br />
<br />
So no, I'm not bored with the game at all :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Bufr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">On the issue of enhancements here is how they work.<br />
<br />
Enhancement come in three types  Training, Dual Origins, and Single Origins. <br />
<br />
Training are useable by all 5 origins. (Magic, Tech, Science, Mutant, or Natural.)<br />
<br />
Dual Origins are shared by 2 of the above types and Single Origins are specific to one type.<br />
<br />
Training Enhancement give 12% to 15% bump in a powers effectiveness. Dual origins give ~25% and single origins give ~ 33%. (These percents may vary a great deal based on the focus of the enhancement. Cone area increase might have a different bonus progression than healing enhancements.)<br />
<br />
Each enhancement has a level value. This determine whether a character can benefit from that enhancement and to what degree. Enhancements can by upgraded by combining them with an identical enhancement. This is reflect by placing a '+' symbol after the level indicator for an enhancement. Only 2 upgrades can be made to an enhancement so at best a level 10 enhancement can become a 10++.<br />
<br />
A 10++ enhancement is identical to a 12th level enhancement. A 14th level enhancement is identical to a 13+ of the same type.<br />
<br />
To gain the benefit of an enhancement you must be within 4 levels of it below you and 3 level if it is higher than you. So a 12th level character can use 8 to 15 level enhancement.<br />
<br />
I have a SO damage enhancement and a DO damage enhancement on my Frost Sword power. Without enhancements it hits in the low 30 range bit with these enhancements it strikes in the low 50 range.<br />
<br />
The right enhancement makes all the difference in the owrld on your powers.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>aphex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">good info Bufr. just to clarify, the enhancement percentage increases are as follows, according to CoH Warcry:<br />
<br />
Training: 5% - 8%<br />
DO: 16.7% - 20%<br />
SO: 33.3%</div></div><hr />

<br />

DO: 16.7% - 20%<br />
SO: 33.3%<br />
<br />
Warcry is wrong then. According to the Dev in charge of how powers and enhancements work, the progression is:<br />
Training: 5 or 8.3%<br />
DO: 10 or 16.7%<br />
SO: 20 or 33.3%<br />
<br />
It depends on Type. Out of the 28 kinds of enhancements, only Range, Cone Range, Damage Resistance, and Defense Buff use the lower progression.<br />
<br />
Now, the way that some enhancements work, those percentages are not as obvious, especially when you multi-slot the same kind of enhancement. Reductions (recycle time, endurance use) are on a diminishing returns scale...ie: You cannot put 3 SO endurance reductions into something and use that power for free.</div></div><hr />

i hit 20 yesterday and have been fighting the Tsoo a lot. they are not fun... well fun, but a pain in the ass. once i hit 18 and got Recovery Aura (Empathy) it really changed things for me. the game to me is still the same at higher levels as far as kill, kill and kill some more. with nothing other than killing to bide your time it can get extremely repetative. i am enjoying the game more and more with levels though. the mobs are getting more creative. <br />
<br />
little story here:<br />
i was on a &quot;kill x amount of Tsoo's&quot; in Sky. me being lvl 19 at the time i started blasting off some of the 15's just to get the stinking mission over with. as i'm casually whiping the pavement with lvl 15 Tsoo's, i notice my health bar drop to red! i immediately hit fly/space bar and shot directly up into the sky thinking ***!?! i look back down and there are 5 lvl 19 Tsoo's waiting for me to drop down. now there are no lvl 19 Tsoo's in Sky, at least none that i know of. so i realize i was jumped. i then proceed to Steel to drop off an artifact from that mission. as i'm at the contact i get ambushed by 2 lvl 20 sorcs and 4 of the other Tsoo lieutenants. luckily i had a controller friend there &quot;control&quot; the situation.<br />
<br />
stuff like that is making it very interesting. still the same as far as missions/kill, kill, but a little more suprise and excitement are starting to pop up randomly. plus fly is teh win.<br />
<br />
i did find lvls 11-15 to be painful though. try and make it through them and things might change for you...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Wait until you kill a 5th Colum boss mob and think its dead only to have it turn into a Werewolf instead and scare the living hell out of you. Or when you kill off a member of the Freakshow and just when you take a sigh of relief thinking the fight is over it proceeds to ressurect itself and come back to fight you at full health all over again. Those little things  make it interesting and you find yourself waiting around a few seconds after the fight is over to make sure the thing is really dead.<br />
<br />
Dark Astoria.. spooks me. Very dark and misty. It took me a few to notice that all the pedestrians that are normal in all the other zones.. aren't normal there. They are ghosts. They are a bit faded out and grey and when you try to get near them they vanish. Gives me the creeps.<br />
<br />
Its not EQ or EQ like really.,. its a different style of game. But I am still enjoying it. I quit EQ before I picked up CoH but I am not missing it. This is a nice change of pace for me. WIll it entertain me for the 3+ years EQ did? Don't know and I am not worried about it. I am having fun with it NOW and thats all that matters for me. I don't feel addicted to this game like I did EQ. I don't feel compleed to play or feel guilty when I don't. I don't have to worry about missing out on flags or loot when I don't play. The only thing that may happen is some of your friends may level faster than you. With the sidekicking system though thats not really an issue.<br />

Having the game randomly train you is fun?  Bet you enjoyed Runnyeye then...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">I enjoy the ambushes. Keeps you on your toes. It only happens if you take a mission that is against their faction.. like kill so many of them etc. And if you read what the conact tells you when you take the mission .. they pretty much tell you to expect an ambush. <br />
<br />
So say you take a mission to kill 20 5th Colum. Chances are that at some point you will see a handful of 5th colum coming for you which you either need to avioid or kill. After you complete the mission the ambushes stop.</div></div><hr />

The point here is that it is far from randomly. This is actully completely in line with ongoing mission. It scared the **** out off me the first time it happend to me 8-)</div></div><hr />

<br />
You miss a lot gloriana? Whats your build and power slotting? Some powers have an inherent accuracy bonus and penalty. Confusion (the equivalent of charm) has a 20% bonus... I can routinely land this power on Lieutenants if I want, while Total DOmination has a miss chance. I know I'll need to spend a slot or 2 on accuracy for TD... but its worth it (ae paralysis, so sweet).<br />
<br />
Some builds dont work at all for soling. I can barely solo an even as my controller, but I have an Ice/Device blaster for when the urge strikes me to maim for about an hour. Its not quite metal gear solid, but its cool with all the tricks and traps you can lay out for enemies.<br />
<br />
I like how your characters abilities not only improve, but change over your career. Its a little rough in the early stages, where you dont have as many abilities to rely on. Avoid bad Perez Park groups (the equivalent of Ill omen/karnors hehe), and find some fun people to hang out with. Lots of casual gamers enjoy this game, 2 of my rl friends who would never play a mmog love it, and I have 2 more waiting to buy a new comp so they can play as well. I think the exp may be a little slow in the mid teens, mine seems to be picking up as I near 20 and begin to take on more challenging enemies.<br />
<br />
People complain about ks'ing... I think I have been ksd less than a handful of times, and I'm a mind controller, which is a REALLY slow kill build. Perhaps its the server (Infinity), ir my play times (after 10pm central), but pretty much everyone I met has been coureous and friendly. Lots of people routinely hand out enhancements, most pickup groups I have been in had people offering the drops they get to help each other out. Really good atmosphere once loot isnt a major focus. <br />
<br />
I get a kick out of the concepts people come up with for their characters. Theres a supergroup of all smurfs (at least 5 of em), groups of robots, The Justice League of Latin America, plenty of really cool designs and builds, and funny names. The games a lil silly and stupid in some ways. My all time favorite game for the Nintendo was River City Ransom... it was also kind of silly and mindless, but incredibly fun.  CoH's depth is going to grow over time, they have outlined some fun twists to add in missions. Temp powers are pretty cool (I got 4 in one mission by recovering various magic items), the sidekick system is nice for keeping friends together, etc. Theres a lot thats good about the game, the foundation is solid to have fun imo. Its only a month old, and I have definately got my moneys worth.</div></div><hr />

The flags and the limitations, and the exclusionary CRAP in EQ didn't make me feel high and mighty - it made me feel guilty, obligated, and pissed off that my stinking sister couldn't play with me because she has a full time job while being a full time student.<br />
<br />
Each to their own, I suppose, but IMO EQ was ruined by a barfilicious philosophy of exclusionary garbage designed to fill 12 year olds with some manufactured sense of accomplishment (not slamming on those still sticking it out in EQ, but very much annoyed at the devs and designers who continue churning that crap out).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Shrewd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">First time in Boomtown last night. Oh that zone moves the plot along from the momment you walk in. Total devistation you can see how badly some areas of the city were hammered by the Ritiki. It is also cool how the fifth column and hellions have huge training camps there... I was like so this is where we are getting so many 5th column from. Standing on a building looking down at like 5 squads of 10 fifth column all doing drill instructor training..... I was like they are preparing for war, I need to tell someone about this.... <br />
<br />
My character is a Former UN Security attache &amp; CIA agent now working for the GSA. He was assigned to Paragon city after the invasion to get to the bottom of some reports about very high level ritiki Technology Falling into the hands of Crey industries. He disguises himself as a super hero to appear incognito to the locals, but he is actually on assignment from the Global Security Adminstration. One thing I am hoping to get my hands on is one of those Ritiki self teleport devices. I know the agency has some, but they are only for top agents.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Vhera</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Still having a blast.  Playing with a group of EQ'ers from Prexus (I am from Rodcet, then Stromm) called &quot;Knights in Tights&quot; on Virtue.  I have a lvl 20 emp defender named Lhyra.<br />
<br />
I play primarily with my gaming parnter of a year and a half (blaster).  Since EQ we have played several games.  Either I got bored (D2) or he did (Toontown).  A week ago I worried this would not hold his interest long enough for a &quot;new and exciting&quot; game to come out in October.  We were lvl 15 ish, and he commented on it being &quot;easy&quot;.  That was before..dum da da dum ...Dr. Vahzilok, our first Arch Villian.  What a blast!<br />
<br />
I asked him last night if he would level to 40 (current max level).  He said he would be. (WOOT)<br />
<br />
For those of you that worry about there being no loot?  Just hand over your single origin enhancements, and no one will get hurt.  As has been stated numerous times previously in this thread...enhancements dramatically improve your character.  Think : Boots of Flowing Slime ...Think : Power of Grey Magic Single Origin (magic) Enhancement -33.30% Endurance Reduction <br />
<br />
The difference is YOU pick your armor looks and then add the enhancements to your character.<br />
<br />
P.S. - Ambushes are exctiting.  It's also exciting when a group member miss fires when they target a mob in the next group over...which are 2 levels higher then you planned on fighting.<br />
<br />
We have side kicked with mid twenties, so we got a peek at the mid level missions.  There are new instanced zones in case you are tired of the same office buildings (if ONLY they were the same I might be able to find my way around!), sewers, storage buildings, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Pjrell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Oh yeah, random death, that sounds like GREAT fun.<br />
<br />
Well its not exactly random...you are warned by your contact at some point before this happens that the enemy are &quot;on to you&quot; and that you should be on the lookout for an ambush.  When it happens isnt really random.  It usually happens a little bit after you emerge from a mission.  You can definately flee from them if you wish or you can fight them.  <br />
<br />
Whats nice about CoH are the storylines and missions hich involve you in the game to an extent that EQ has tried and missed.<br />
<br />
Was kinda tired of it at first but get past 16 and things pick up for you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Shrewd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Oh just got Super Speed at 16 last night. Wow that is a fun ability. With a little control you can be on a different side of  mob for every single attack. Its like you are your own ambush the dude is fighting you one second.. the very next you are beating on his back. Oh this is a sweet abilitiy I was so afraid I wouldn't be impressed when I got it because alot of people call SS sort of gimp. I went to fault line and can see some of the problems I will have there, but to be honest that zone is like 100% Valziok and I HATE them so I won't be speding any more than absolutely neccessary there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Wytchone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Having the game randomly train you is fun?  Bet you enjoyed Runnyeye then...<br />
<br />
Ill say this slowly.<br />
<br />
IT'S NOT A TRAIN<br />
<br />
The Tsoo send a hit squad after you.  It part of the story line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">I hit level 15 and got my title, the Incomparable Andromeda. That was pretty fun.<br />
<br />
I should probably re-roll though, I'm just not having much fun with a grav/rad controller. Damage is sucky, heal is sucky (and the recast is awful), any of the cool rad debuffs take WAY too much endurance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">I play a 26 grav/rad controller as my main. I struggle with her soloing but in a group she really shines. Accelerate metabolism is great and being able to lock down a mass amount of baddies with gravity distortion field is really nice. My little supergroup doesn't have a defender that plays so she also handles the heals for the groups I do. Can keep the group alive ok when the holds don't go as plan etc. I play her when I group with my friends and I play a illusion/kinetics controller alt when I want to solo. I like playing a controller and the illusion controller can solo at lot easier then the grav.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Mamutoi, I would love it if you would share your build with me. I was just kind of making up stuff as I went along!<br />
<br />
I just made a FF/Psy defender named Bubbalicious which has been VERY fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">I pretty much just made it up as I went along as well. There are a few things I took that I now wish I had taken something else.<br />
<br />
Here is what I have on her:<br />
<br />
Gravity:<br />
<br />
Crush<br />
Lift<br />
Gravity Distortion<br />
Propel<br />
Crushing Field<br />
Gravity Distortion Field<br />
<br />
Radiation:<br />
<br />
Radiation Emission<br />
Radiation Infection<br />
Accelerate Metabolism<br />
Enervating Field<br />
<br />
<br />
Power Pool:<br />
<br />
Recall Friend<br />
Teleportation<br />
Hover<br />
Swift<br />
Health<br />
<br />
Regrets:<br />
<br />
Teleportation.. I wish I had taken Fly instead. Teleportation is fast but it takes a lot of clicking (even with the keybind) to get to point A to point B. You also don't have as much control as Fly does, I actually caved in and got Hover just to deal with some of the problems Teleportation has. When respec comes out I will be dumping it for Fly.<br />
<br />
I also regret starting on the Stamina line so late. I won't get it until the 28th level now and I could of used it starting a couple levels ago.<br />
<br />
I put too many enhancement slots into Crushing Field. Before I got gravity distortion field that was my only type of aoe hold and I put a lot of slots into it. Now that I have GDF I hardly ever use it and find I could really use those slots in other things.<br />
<br />
I am not certain what I will get after Stamina at 28. Probably the pet at 32, maybe hasten and some Leadership power pools.<br />
<br />
The grav/rad controller is not a damage dealer, its one of the worst damage dealers of all the archtypes. The heal is actually one of the better ones outside the empathy line but we do better preventing damage then healing it. This build is meant to lock down and gimp the mobs. The grav controller's Gravity Distortion field is one of, if not the best, holds in the game. It allows you to hold the mobs from a distance and then do damage to the held mobs without breaking the hold. I love coming across a group of 10+ mobs, toss out Radiation Infection then GDF to lock down most (if not all), a Crushing Field to hold the few that resisted in place, then GF and then proceed to keep them locked down while the group destroys them.<br />
<br />
Soloing is possible but slow and you have to pick your targets. I can handle 2-3 of the same level mobs, 1 or 2 of a level higher and a same level boss if I am very careful and use a lot of inspirations. I keep up AM for the end regen, accuracy and damage boost, I toss out a RI then GDF. Once the hold hits I usually click of RI and put EF in its place for more damage. I then use lift and propel on the mobs and reapply GF when needed until dead. Using a Damage inspiration really helps speed it up with the extra damage. I have two SO damage enhancements and one SO accuracy in Lift and Propel. My GF and GDF I have hold time, accuracy and recharge reduction enhancements. On AM I have three SO recharge reduction and two DO endurance recoverys.<br />
<br />
GF, GDF, RI and AM are really the backbone to this build.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Megara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">I love CoH, but I like it for very different reasons than I enjoy EQ.  I get plenty of variety from task force missions, regular missions, and just street hunting.  My scrapper is level 21, and I too hated the 10-15 levels, but 16+ has been too fun again.<br />
<br />
I still play EQ, and due to RL haven't played EQ or CoH in about 3 weeks, so, I'm not getting a lot of fun out of either atm :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">Frankly, I'm in love with my little robot Assault Rifle / Device blaster.  I'm only level ten thus far, but I have a blast hopping around and taking out a gang of white and yellow cons single-handedly.<br />
<br />
Missions are great, though some of the set ups are getting a bit old.  My personal favorite was an office building full of people screaming and running away from Clockworks.  I spent half the mission just laughing at the silliness of it.<br />
<br />
One of my few beefs with the game is the tendency for so many things to run away at low levels, which is why I switched from a katana / reflexes scrapper to the blaster.  But I don't have that problem nearly as much with my newest alt, a spine / regen scrapper, which comes not only with a PBAE damage attack, it also slows everything!  <br />
<br />
Though some of the missions do seem to be lacking in creativity, you have to appreciate it for what it is.  I can log in and battle nazis with my samurai cowboy.  Or I can hunt zombies in the sewers as an escaped military prototype war machine.  Or hit the streets and deal out vigilante justice with my spiky, gamma irradiated lab assistant.<br />
<br />
As for the 5th Columnist bosses turning into werewolves, the other night on a mission we had three do that in one fight, one right after the other!  Very scary!</div></div><hr />
