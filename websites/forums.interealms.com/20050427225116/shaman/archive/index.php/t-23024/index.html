<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ElSancho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am finding it hard to locate things to hunt being new to the game, I have read over some of the low lvl hunting ground guids here but nothing for iksars..no love for the lizzards?<br />
<br />
please any advice will help :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There are 4 zones out from cabilis, I believe, into different newbie areas.  They're all pretty good.  One of the big bonuses of being an iksar is newbie grounds far superior to anything trolls or ogres had to start with, and newbie quests to make the rest of us drool about our painful starting days.  <br />
<br />
If I remember right, the curscale hides can be turned in in town (free bag) for armor.  The scorpion pincers and bone chips for exp and money.  I think level 10 or so is high enough to head into kurn's tower (from Field of Bone) which is tied for my favorite newbie dungeon with the Warrens (which you can visit easily via PoK book if you want to beat on doggies instead of skellies).</div></div><hr />
