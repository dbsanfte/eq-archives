<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">These are lyrics from my &quot;concert&quot; on Battle Com last night. With apologies to Freddie Mercury (may the angels be treating him right), Brian May, John Deacon and Roger Taylor - Collectively known as Queen. Also apologies for my voice (I sound better i the shower, I KNOW I do  :p ). This was set to &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;<br />
<br />
Vhela<br />
I just killed a dorf*<br />
Took my hammer to his head<br />
Just one swing and now he's dead<br />
Vhela,<br />
My faction was amiable<br />
And now I've gone <br />
and thrown it all away<br />
ooooo-ooooo-oooooo<br />
Didn't mean for him to die<br />
Cuz I don't want to be<br />
Kill on sight<br />
Carry on, carry on<br />
cuz it doesn't really matter<br />
<br />
Its too late<br />
The deed is done<br />
He's laying on the ground,<br />
Ninjas hovering all 'round<br />
Goodbye everybody<br />
I've got to go<br />
Before the guards steal some more xp<br />
Vhela-oooo-oooo<br />
I've really go to run<br />
I think that I can make it to the zone<br />
<br />
&lt;insert guitar solo here&gt;<br />
<br />
* the race can be any single sylallable race. The first time I sang elf (thinking of the times I killed Rizz, dueling him out). The second time, after I &quot;composed&quot; the second verse, I sang dorf, in honor of Drolgin, was on BC at the time. Trool and gnome would work as well gnome, and if a TRULY depraved person was corrupting my parody, they could sing barb as well...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Note: shouldn't it be &quot;Ninja's hovering all around&quot;?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I edited that line as per Sori's advice, except with my &quot;internal cadence&quot; I needed to slur off a syllable (ye gods!!! WTH am i talking about??? :p )<br />
Come on guys, add in the next bits... all I remember was the &quot;easy come, easy go, will you loot&quot; and Drolgin's &quot;BISMILLAH!&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is my real life <br />
It ain't just fantasy <br />
I'm not going back to <br />
That place called Reality <br />
Open my eyes, look up to my screen and see... <br />
I'm just a newbie <br />
Please give me your money... <br />
Because I'm not too good, level low <br />
Please can you spare some dough? <br />
Anywhere this char goes doesn't really matter to me... <br />
To me... <br />
  <br />
Hey all, just killed a bat <br />
Smacked it with my club upside its head <br />
Cast my Strike spell, now it's dead <br />
Hey all, life had just begun <br />
So who told me to target a guard and press A? <br />
Hey all, la la la la! <br />
Didn't mean to make you /cry <br />
If my corpse isn't found by tomorrow <br />
Carry on, carry on, 'cause nothing really matters <br />
  <br />
Too late, my corpse is gone <br />
It's hard to find my way <br />
In this place called Greater Fay <br />
Good-bye, everybody, I've got to go <br />
Gonna leave this place behind and visit the next zone <br />
Hey all, la la la la! (Where this char goes!) <br />
I don't want to die <br />
But we all know that it's going to happen... <br />
(During the guitar solo you can hear sounds of monsters killing the newbie) <br />
<br />
I found the corpse of a high-elf paladin! <br />
Big deal! Who cares! <br />
Where the heck is my own corpse?! <br />
Thunderbolt and lightning <br />
Makes it very hard to see! <br />
What's the /loc of, (what's the /loc of), what's the /loc of, (what's the /loc of) <br />
What's the /loc of the next zone? <br />
I want to know! <br />
I'm just a newbie, somebody help me! <br />
He's just a newbie, he doesn't know anything <br />
Spare him some gold so he stops spamming me! <br />
Easy come, easy go, will you give me SoW? <br />
Bismillah! No! We will not give you SoW! <br />
Give me SoW! Bismillah! We will not give you SoW! <br />
Give me SoW! Bismillah! We will not give you SoW! <br />
Give me SoW! Will not give you SoW! Give me SoW! Will not give you SoW! <br />
Oh gimme SoW! No, no, no, no, no, NO, NO!!! <br />
O kind shaman! O kind druid! Will you please give me SoW? <br />
I need a SoW for my corpse recovery...so please...help me! <br />
<br />
So you think you can /ignore me in front of my eyes? <br />
I'm going to train something to you and watch you die! <br />
Yeah, duel me, I don't care if you duel me <br />
I'm just gonna zone out, just gonna zone right out of here! <br />
<br />
Nothing really matters, <br />
I don't lose exp <br />
Nothing really matters, <br />
Nothing really matters... <br />
To newbies... <br />
  <br />
Anywhere this char goes...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Is this the real life?<br />
Is this just fantasy?<br />
Caught in a landslide<br />
No escape from reality<br />
Open your eyes<br />
Look up to the skies and see<br />
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy<br />
Because I'm easy come, easy go<br />
little high, little low<br />
Anyway the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me, to me<br />
<br />
(Piano)<br />
<br />
Mama, just killed a man<br />
Put a gun against his head<br />
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead<br />
Mama, life had just begun<br />
But now I've gone and thrown it all away<br />
Mama, ooo<br />
Didn't mean to make you cry<br />
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow<br />
Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters<br />
<br />
(Piano)<br />
<br />
Too late, my time has come<br />
Sends shivers down my spine<br />
Body's aching all the time<br />
Goodbye, everybody - I've got to go<br />
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth<br />
Mama, ooo - (anyway the wind blows)<br />
I don't want to die<br />
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all...<br />
<br />
(Guitar Solo)<br />
<br />
I see a little silhouetto of a man<br />

Thunderbolt and lightning - very very frightening me<br />
<br />
Gallileo, Gallileo,<br />
Gallileo, Gallileo,<br />
Gallileo Figaro - magnifico, oooo<br />
<br />
But I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me<br />
He's just a poor boy from a poor family<br />
Spare him his life from this monstrosity<br />
<br />
Easy come easy go - will you let me go<br />
Bismillah! No - we will not let you go - let him go<br />
Bismillah! We will not let you go - let him go<br />

Will not let you go - let me go (never)<br />
Never let you go - let me go<br />
Never let me go - ooo<br />
No, no, no, no, no, no, no -<br />
Oh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia let me go<br />
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me<br />

for me<br />
<br />
(Guitar solo, and massive headbanging)<br />
<br />
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye<br />
So you think you can love me and leave me to die<br />
Oh baby - can't do this to me baby<br />
Just gotta get out - just gotta get right outta here<br />
<br />
(Guitar solo, and more massive headbanging)<br />
<br />
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah<br />
Nothing really matters<br />
Anyone can see<br />
Nothing really matters - nothing really matters to me<br />
Anyway the wind blows...</div></div><hr />
