<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hyperd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was training my defense (solo) on one of the Haven officers in NL when I couldnt stop eyeing his sword. But since I wouldnt want to take the faction hit I figured I would root him and then lay all my dots on him next to the zone entrance. As thought as done. But when I zone in again, this time of course aggro has been wiped, I notice something peculiar: his Hps bounces. It falls by the excact amount of the dot (as I had witnessed before I zoned) and then jumps right back up again to 100%.<br />
<br />
Remember I am pretty new to this game so this might just be a feature I havent discovered yet. But is it supposed to work like this ? And what if my friends would be back in the zone and beating on him, would my DOTS still be negated because I zoned out ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">All mobs have insanely high regen when they have zero agro on them.<br />
<br />
You zoned out so you dropped agro and then your dots kept chewing on him... if you had a lvl 1 attack him and run he'd have died from the dots. Because the agro makes his huge regen stop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If he would have died unagro'd due to a dot, he would have poofed and not left a corpse (unless level 55 or over).  So you wouldn't have gotten the sword anyway.  Only mobs level 55+ will leave a corpse if they die unagro to a dot, this was done because big raid target mobs would poof at times and leave no corpse.</div></div><hr />
