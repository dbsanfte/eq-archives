I've had a problem since last Thursday, that I can't seem to stay on-line for more than 15min or so before going linkdead. :(<br />
Checked w/ my isp, and they see no problems.  After the LD, I usually crash to the server screen, sometimes only to the char select screen, and occasionally coming back bugged, requiring a complete EQ exit before coming back IG.<br />
<br />
I am using 2 machines on a router through a Speedstream modem on ADSL through SNET.  One machine runs WinXP and exceeds all SoL requirements.  The other is a gimpy e-machine that is slightly under recommended performance levels, but ran okay normally before this week.<br />
<br />
Any tweaks or recommendations?  Commiseration?  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  This has severely limited my gameplay as of late.  Had to gate out of a raid because I was slowing everyone down. :(<br />
<br />
Now I can't even solo safely, and I hate to impose my iffy connectivity on any group.  So looks like it is time to work alchemy some more, or play alts I don't care about until I can get this fixed. <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shamolite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Check to see if there is an upgrade for yourrouter. I used to work for an ISP that when customers machines would start flaking out usually was due to Router issues. And Please god dont tell me you have a firewall on your machine as well as the router that just is plain silly.  May also want to check to see if any new software installed besides patches that maybe causing problem or trying runing thoroough patch process.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>whitesknight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">one thing you might also wish to check out is your connectivity to your isp it could be the fact of using a router. you can also try using a hub where you have seperate ip addresses and get rid of any firewalls. EQ has problems working with zonealarm and blackICE as well as with norton firewall.</div></div><hr />
