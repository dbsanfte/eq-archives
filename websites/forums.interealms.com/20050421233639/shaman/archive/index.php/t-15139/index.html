<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ok I know the only place to go for real xp is PoP pretty much. But, my server is so empty anymore when I get to log in, I can't find a group. PoJ is crap xp, PoN is crap xp, PoI is crap xp, too young for tier 2, and everytime I go to PoD, where I know the xp is pretty good, there's like 5 people in there (and not interested in adding me).<br />
<br />
Is there anywhere for me to solo in PoP, or anywhere for that matter, where I can make some noticeable xp, like maybe a yellow in 2 hours? I'm getting sick of farming hill giants and blowing the money on tradeskills lol.<br />
<br />
I have been 55 forever. I stopped to get run3 and regen3 once I turned 55...really only wanted run3, but since the only groups I seemed to find were PoN or PoI, and the xp sucked, I decided to turn on aa instead. I don't know, maybe I just got to suck it up and deal with the slow xp lol. Any suggestions would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
By the way, I did look around, but just about all the suggestions were for LoY zones, which I don't have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can try skyfire, I was there last night for the first time as a 56 shaman soloing. The wurms, mature wurms, drakes, etc. are dark blue and drop spells and not bad plat. Watch out for the chromasacs (or whatever they are called). They debuff like crazy.<br />
<br />
Just a thought, not a bad zone, just tiresome if you lose all buffs every mob. :)<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Noxin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">1.  Nathyn guards in Katta (first building on your left as you enter Katta from TM).  Positive hits to various Katta factions and Coterie.  Subpar loot (weapons, shields, coin), good xp.  Merchant in large building in courtyard that you can sell back weapons and shields.  Outdoor zone so horse can be summoned.<br />
<br />
2.  Archers and scounds behind secret rock wall in Echo.  Good loot, good xp.  Archers summon, but are cake once slowed, and with pet.  First take out the two scounds in front of entrance.  Then, from ground level, cast slow on one of the archers atop the wall.  They will summon you up top to the castle, and your pet will follow up the stairs without aggroing all the nasty red mobs behind the castle facade.  After polishing off one archer, walk along beam and rinse/repeat with other archer.  Each archer drops 2 bows that sell to merchants for about 45pp each with good faction/CHA.<br />
<br />
3.  Chardok zone in.  Chance of random drops (SBS, chokidai hide shoulders, etc.)<br />
<br />
4.  Sebilis.  Shaman and wizards dispell.<br />
<br />
A good tip is to buy or make an Everfrost spirit stone.  This allows you to bind close to zone where you are hunting (for CR or in case you have to gate out).  You can use spirit stone (30 second cast) to port to EF.  Just remember to re-bind if you go hunt in another zone.  Nothing like dying in Akheva or PoP, and being bound just outside of Seb in TT.<br />

Awsome exp and with the exception of runners totally safe Exp.  Set up on the right side of boat deck, between the anchor and the Catapults. Pull to there with slow, between pet and JBB I never lost any mana.<br />
Loots gemstones, quest pieces, some greaves and an Axe off ship capt.</div></div><hr />

This sounds like a great spot, but I never heard of it. Where is this secret rock wall? You mean on way to Fungus Grove? I been through that way before, a while ago, cant say I remember those mobs though. Can you please give a general loc, or maybe the spot on eq atlas map of Echo? Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Noxin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Scounds and archers are in room 3 http://www.eqatlas.com/luclin/echocavernsmap.html<br />
<br />
Stay to the left as you enter the cavern room.  Set up on the sloped ledge near the boulder.  Be careful of the mobs beyond the front entrance.  They won't aggro if you pull the front scounds (front 2 have names) away from the front.  No one will aggro you along the top of the castle wall other than the archers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are the two front scounds single pullable at 55? And do you know what the spawn time on the scounds and archers are? This may be the solution to my &quot;Can't get out of level 55 and am poor-as-hell&quot; woes.  :p<br />
<br />
Edit: Just read this again, and just wanted to be clear about something.<br />
<br />

<br />
Did you mean there are 2 bows per archer, or was that a typing error? Because if they do drop two bows each worth 45p per bow, GOODBYE hill giants! 180p per spawn of archers in bows alone. Sounds too good to be true so it was probably just a typing error on your part. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Nah, each bow is 23pp each so 46pp per archer and 92pp per two of them. 20min spawn i think and they hit like little sissy girls. 30-90 tops. Lots of HP's though, me dogdog plus three Ebolts to kill.<br />
<br />
The scounds below arent single pullable. You have to kill them at the same time and with c3 its possible (root rot one while tank in teh face with pet other). Then again if you just want archer set up on the left sloping wall facing the fort and slow one of the archers then Ebolt and sit. He'll summon you so no scounds come along and your pet will come without gaining aggro.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Using 49 dog as i can't afford 55 dog :(.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Noxin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Tel was correct.  The bows dropped by each archer sell back for around 23pp.  Therefore, the two archers will drop 4 bows that will net you around 92pp.  My apologies for the misinformation.   <br />
<br />
Each archer is on a 20-25 minute timer, so, while the loot is nice, this is not a get-rich-quick camp given the spawn rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">tried this the other night...<br />
<br />
The scounds are not single pullable at 55, what I did was slow the first (low resistance cant remember anything getting resisted), then root him. Sick alpha dog on other one and slow it too. It's a pain fighting 2, they don't hit hard but got a ton of hp. I'd recommend an hp buff, at least temp to be safe, and kei as it is a big mana drain. Plague actually went to full duration....and about 7-8 ebolts. Once you kill one, try and wait a while to split the next spawn. When your done with both, do the archers, you can single fight those. Archers are real wimps, I slowed and ebolt, dog went on him, killed the archer and was never less than 90% health (I buff dog with HoS). Archers are on 25 minute spawn time so when you kill them go back down and wait for scounds, now single pulls and easy as can be. Don't worry about being low on mana, as you always have plenty of time to canni/med.<br />
<br />
Works out to about 300pp and hour, but seemed to me xp was not good. Now, I was only there for an hour or so, so I could be wrong.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: Went back last night for a bit, got little less than half a yellow in about hour and 15 minutes....I guess not too bad for solo xp outside the planes,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Neyl Dew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">What sort of faction hits are on the archer camp discribed? I dont really want to be hated in Shadowhaven if I can avoid it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are about 5 faction messages you get, I rememeber these 3 (and I'm not 100% sure):<br />
<br />
House of Recondite Bandits got worse<br />
House of Stoudt got better<br />
House of Mordel got better<br />
<br />
If I remember to write them down next time, I'll let you know for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">was just on dandolak last night.  with 4100hp, kei, horse, jbb, dogdog (muzzle, belt, alpha'd) i still couldn't make more than 9% xp per hour after 4 hours.  was pretty easy, but i just couldn't seem to kill them fast enough.<br />
<br />
basically, just pulled with slow, plague, ebolt, jbb till he died, pulled immediately after.  tossed a stoic on me every second or third mob (with that agro, i was tanking not the mob - also made sure that dogdog was never slowed b/c of stoic).  eventually headed over to oceancrasher and finished up solo'ing there for the night.  a bit harder, so i didn't kill as many, so i earned roughly same xp as on dandolak.  did it just to spite everybody in zone who said i couldn't solo the bottom half of the boat before repop.<br />
<br />
last time i was in katta, i remember them going down much much quicker, not to mention they don't hit as hard.  heading there tonight to see if i can make more than 10% per hour.<br />
<br />
grouped in poi, i think i made 10%, but that was after 2 hours of killing yard trash.  roughly the same in pon, pulling from zone out in NE corner.</div></div><hr />
