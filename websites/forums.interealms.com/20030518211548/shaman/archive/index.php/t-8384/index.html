<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Wish I was better with links, but I know the Safehouse has all the info on alternate HoH access posted.  <br />
<br />
There is one major sticking point on alternate access for HoH and CoD.  Apparently, you will not be able to proceed farther into PoP with just the quest keys.  You still need be there to hail the planar projections after AD and Grummus die in order to go past CoD/HoH.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Quest giver is is Grenic Dere in PoV. He sends you to a smith in PoK. The smith wants a spider brain, drops off named spider or crawler in PoV. Pretty common. He also wants an agony mephit heart from mephits in PoN. And a block of perilium from PoI, which i hear can drop off any mob, but is very rare.<br />
<br />
Combine these in a container you get from the smith. This makes a box of souls. Now go to PoJ and find a named wraith. Kill these until a soldier of marr or something similar pops. Give the soldier your box. You need to do this 3 times with different named soldiers.<br />
<br />
Take the box back to Grenic. Flags you for HoH.<br />
<br />
The other quest using the hearts is to get the key to the castle in PoV to visit the glass dragon:<br />
