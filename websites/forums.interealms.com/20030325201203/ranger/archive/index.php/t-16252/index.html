<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tekari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've recently started the Veracity Earing quests, and am currently working on getting the last couple reports for the 3rd earing.<br />
<br />
I've done a lot of reading on the quest but I havnt been able to find a lot of specific mob info about the 4th earing.<br />
<br />
I was wondering if anyone had any information about the Praesertum leaders? I've read that they are level 63, and I know where they spawn, but aside from that information I havnt found much else.<br />
<br />
One post I read said they were rooted and could not be pulled to a different location, is that true?<br />
<br />
I was also looking for information on how fast and hard they hit for. <br />
<br />
I'm basically just preparing for how many people I will need to bring with me to take these guys on. <br />
<br />
Thanks for any responses,</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dalgonar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I only played with one of them for a while but he was yellow to 65, hit for 500 fast and flurried rarely. Immune to slow. Was trying to do it with ench, mage and cleric and we got it to 30% on best try. Could have done it propably if the cleric/ench both hadn't been played by me.<br />
<br />
If you do with a regular way I think 3 groups would be enough.<br />
<br />
I was able to warp one of them once outside the building (only tried few times) so you could propably pull them out. The banishment is a cast spell, 2.5sec cast and it's cast quite often. Just have some plan to get banished people back up and you should be fine.</div></div><hr />
