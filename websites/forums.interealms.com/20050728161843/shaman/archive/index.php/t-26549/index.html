Oh, and yes, we are getting screwed right up the @ss.<br />
<br />
No one likes to get nerfed.  And 25-30% dps decrease in the course of 2 patches over 3 weeks is really unacceptable, to any class/player.  I'd take that position for any class, not just hunters.<br />
<br />
P.S.  Check out my new kitty cat (in sig).  I like him a lot.  He's getting nerfed 20% also, so will be retired with the hunter once the patch goes live.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The other part of our ranged DPS nerf, I'm still very concerned with. Unless they adjust DPS of ranged weapons to accommodate the changes with chance to hit (vs defense/dodge skill instead of lvl vs lvl, not to mention the +atk only applying to MELEE?!?!?), yup...we're pretty screwed.<br />
<br />
Jury is still out on how/if it will affect me personally (and I won't jump to any conclusions until I play under the new mechanics for myself), but if it does, and if it becomes &quot;un-fun&quot; I'll just do what I've always done and move on to another chapter in my life doing other things.<br />

It's amazing how quick people forget.  While I find most of your post sensible and moderate, it's this last part that gets me.  I AM disapointed in blizz's customer service, GMs are still damned hard to get a hold of, although I find personally there is less need to get a hold of one.  I would not however compare SoE and Bliz.  SoE not only ignored classes, they never owned up to screw ups.  I am disapointed that hunters feel they have been ignored, that sucks, but Bliz ponied up and said they screwed up and are working on it.  SoE would never do that, they'd work on a fix, impliment it as a stealth fix in a distant future patch that somehow would hose bards even if the fix didn't seem on the surface to have anything to do with bards.  Anyway, the point is that I don't think Bliz has bottomed out to SoE status.<br />
<br />
I'm impressed by WoW, disapointed by the constant server failures (which seem to have improved dramatically in the last two weeks).  Hopefully, they will fix the DPS issue soon.  I love grouping with hunters and the class has recieved some love, but the bugs do need to be fixxed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
OK Mill, I'll spell it out for everyone, Val already hit the biggies:<br />
<br />
1. Ranged dps now checks against defense instead of mob level.  So, high defense targets, like plate wearing warriors, paladins, or mobs, are much harder to hit.  Reduction in dps of around 5-10% against these mobs, and up to 20% on boss mobs.  This change makes some logical sense, however, our dps was originally balanced with the old rule, seems to be unbalanced with the change.  A better option would be to mitigate some of the damage, as in real life, not force a miss.  How does armor make you miss?  It does not, it may make the damage less, but you will still hit the target.  This is WoW physics at it's worst.<br />
<br />
2. Ranged dps is now dodged, parried, blocked, in addition to deflected.  Again, against high agi targets, rogues, etc. means about an added +20% miss rate.  Rogue with evade, means about an 80% miss rate.  Again, our dps was balanced before, this nerfs it quite a bit.  And again, we have entered the Matrix, where you can dodge and parry arrows and bullets.  Makes no sense and ranged weps have been long ago balanced to compensate for their high hit rate.  No ranged weapon in the game comes close to the damage of a good 2 hand weapon readily avialble to any melee class.  I can't make an Arcanite Reaver Bow or gun.  This is an unnecessary change.<br />
<br />
3. Pet dps decrease of around 20%.  Yes, they have said this was unintentional, and they are looking at it.  Well, they have been looking at hunter bugs (pet runspeed for one) since beta, no fixes.  This will go live an we will be screwed for months before they correct it, if ever.<br />
<br />
4. +attack weapons and items no longer add to ranged attack.  Their rationale is that +attack items are melee only.  Problem is, we have leather working armor for hunters, bows and guns, that have +attack on them.  Why would this be if it was not designed to work with ranged attack?<br />
<br />
Black Dragonscale armor, one of the 3 leatherworking paths and the only mail option (obviously supposed to support hunters), gives +attack power.<br />
<br />
Striker's Mark - The hunter epic bow from MC - gives +20 attack power<br />
<br />
And there are many, many other examples.  If it was not intended for +attack power to work with ranged attack, why in the world would you put it on the epic bow?  To improve hunter melee dps?  Be real.  The explanation provided is typical Blizzard Bull Sh1t.  They have surpassed SoE in this regard.<br />
<br />
5. Current bugs have not been addressed, to include; pet runspeed bug, where pet is perma snared, added delay to arcane shot if you have the improvement talent (so instead of lowering the cooldown, it actuall extends it), etc.  Too many to list.<br />
<br />
Anyway, taken one at a time, each of these is substantial.  Especially in light of the quiver haste &quot;fix&quot; from last patch which reduced all hunter attack haste by 13% (not small decrease by any means, what would rogues do if they got a 13% melee dps reduction?), these new nerfs will really cripple our dps against most targets.  True, they may not impact our effectiveness against casters, which is already high, but they will make us much less able to damage high end mobs and plate classes.<br />
<br />
They need to make hunters better in end game instances, not worse.  Once you hit 60, what is there for a hunter to do?<br />
<br />
You may or may not agree, but those are the facts.<br />
<br />
Mill, I'm sure your brother enjoys his hunter, they are a lot of fun to play.  However, he must have noticed his decrease in dps with the last patch.  Let him copy his toon over and log into the test server today and have him report back to you what he thinks.  Let him fight a high ac mob and see how he does.  Duel him on the test server and evade, and watch his arrows fly by you with 0 damage.  Hell, team up with him on stuff you guys killed before, and see how much longer it takes.  Then come back and report to all of us what you see.<br />
<br />
I bet it won't be pretty.<br />
<br />
And Tarthug, yes, Blizzard is quickly surpassing SoE in overall lack of customer service and arrogance.  They have stealth nerfed just about every class in the last few patches.  Funny how things as obvious as +attack no longer applying to ranged damage, and ranged attacks being dodged and parried, did not make it into the patch release notes.  But they do note that golfclap was added and you can now make leather balls.  Woot.<br />
<br />
Blizzard has done a horrible job of communicating with the player base.  At this point, SoE is far ahead of them on this aspect in EQ and EQ2.  Rytan just posted on the on-going Shaman changes in EQ.  Which Blizzard developer has posted on the recent rash of hunter nerfs?  None.  And the board moderator, Caydiem, is either being fed a load, stupid, incompetant, or a liar.  Not sure which is worse, but I'd bet money it is all of the above.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It's just my frustration Tarthug. Pretty tired of being promised one thing in one conversation, only to have them come back with a complete reversal later (see the pet attack approach run speed for an example where one day they posted &quot;working as intended&quot; only to come back a week or two later and say &quot;we're not sure now&quot;).<br />
<br />
Their communication skills are absolutely the worst of any game I have ever played. Even the Euro site gets updated with more information and on a more regular basis than the US site.<br />
<br />
I haven't quit yet, but I'm also not willing to 'turn the other cheek' as often as I did with EQ. There are too many other things I'd rather be doing (if not playing WoW), and honestly, none of them are computer games. Blizzard will continue getting my money, and WoW will continue getting my attention as long as it's fun. I've never said anything different. <br />
<br />
And when it stops being fun, I'll simply fade out of sight, without guns-a-blazing, and without any fanfaire. I'll simply move on.</div></div><hr />

Would you rather it display as zero damage or a miss? Yes, armor can cause zero damage, you're assumption that it can't is mistaken.<br />

Stop assuming ranged weapons were balanced. That's not an argument you get to make.<br />

<br />
Hunters argue right and left they should get to roll on great melee weapons, this seems to bolster their argument. Just because it's not your playstyle, you don't get to rule it out for everyone. <br />
<br />
<br />
5. Current bugs have not been addressed, to include; pet runspeed bug, where pet is perma snared, added delay to arcane shot if you have the improvement talent (so instead of lowering the cooldown, it actuall extends it), etc.  Too many to list.<br />

<br />
You are a buffoon.  You did not make one valid statement.  These are the facts, not my opinion, you fool.<br />
<br />
1. It makes far more sense to mitigate not miss.  My skill with a bow determines if I hit a target, not it's armor.  If I hit it and it has armor, it should take less damange.  Just simple common sense.<br />
<br />
2. During beta ranged weapons were balanced by having their dps lowered, across the board.  Don't state on something you are ignorant about, you're just showing your arse.<br />
<br />
3. Bad form my arse.  Here is bad form, S.T.F.U. @sshole.  There are bugs that have not been fixed since beta.  Many of these are &quot;still being looked at&quot;, four months after retail release.  They have not been timely about any fixes, so don't tell me this will be miraculously the exception.  Dick.<br />
<br />
4. Hunters suck at melee, this is a given.  You are truly a tool to even infer otherwise.  It's not a matter of &quot;style&quot; it's a matter of not having any melee skills or talents worth a darn.  You now claim hunters roll on melee weapons for melee dps, wrong idiot.  Hunters need melee weapons with +agi, and up to now +attack, to improve ranged dps, not melee dps.  Please learn the game.<br />
<br />
5. Ok, now I see the real statement you are making.  Paladins got a dps nerf, so hunter should not cry.  How lame, you are a sorry excuse for a human being.<br />
<br />
News flash, Paladins are not a dps class.  You had a bug, it got fixed, you can still perform you primary role of off-tank and healer.  This is not the case with the hunter nerfs.<br />
<br />
Try again.<br />
<br />
6. My statements were facts, validated by test server videos and screen shots.  Your opinions are worthless.  Go troll somewhere else, scumbag.</div></div><hr />

agreed Snap, the Pather nerf is a huge mess.  However, Rytan did post is rationale and did request input from the Shaman community on the SoE boards.  The change has not gone live, and will probably be modified before then.<br />
<br />
Has Blizzard done any of this?  No.  Once the patch goes on test, according to our board moderator, the content is final.  The only thing that may be changed are bugs.  No blizzard developer or designer has ever posted on the boards.  All we have are powerless moderators, no real voice at all.</div></div><hr />

Caydiem reminds me of the &quot;sock puppet&quot; Abashi use to be. The worst thing that ever happened to the Hunter community is when she picked up the torch to 'represent' us with the devs. She's continually caught in lies, or at least half truth's, and more often than not appears to be just letting the 'big brown eye' do the talking (read: speaking out of her a$$).</div></div><hr />

agreed Val, Caydiem has been worse than useless, she has been an impediment to getting anything accomplished.  We have not seen ANY results from our efforts with her. <br />
<br />
Gee, she started a &quot;list&quot; of issues for the devs.  Man, if that doesn't remind me of the worthless player lists created by SoE.  It took her 3 weeks to compile the list, and another 3 weeks to schedule a meeting with the developers.  Gee, she could have just had the developers read the boards (which she claims in another thread that they do, therefore indicating that a list is not even required) and meet to discuss the issues.<br />
<br />
Her list will have the same results, stall players into hanging on until the next expansion, then they can say &quot;Here, for just another $30 you can fix some of your bugs.&quot;  It's an old stall tactic she got from Brenlo.<br />

Gart, don't know who you play with, but I assure you, I am well spec'd, geared, and a solid player.  I am the last person the healer needs to heal and I can FD and be the only person to survive a wipe, while doing very nice, consistent damage.  My pet is well behaved, always on passive, and has saved the healer or mage on many occassions by pulling the aggro of him and off-tanking until a real tank can take over.<br />
<br />
However, if my dps gets any lower, then I would agree with you, I'd take a mage or rogue that knows how to manage aggro any day vs. an equally skilled and capable hunter.  That's my gripe, I'm as good at playing my hunter as the mages and rogues in my guild are at playing their toons.  But with this patch, I will not be as valuable, regardless of my skill, because my base abilities will be inferior to theirs, and there is nothing I can do about it.</div></div><hr />

And the board moderator, Caydiem, is either being fed a load, stupid, incompetant, or a liar.  Not sure which is worse, but I'd bet money it is all of the above.<br />
When I left EQ shaman were STILL being promised that we'd be looked at, there were grandouse statements about a complete restructuring of all classes and a top 10 list was compiled by each community.  We were promised feedback on the list and we were so hungry, even hopefull for change that we would have even welcomed a new updated edit date  for the posted list on SoE boards.  No feedback and over a year later they are still spewing promises and delivering squat.  Granted, witrh the different content type of the more recent expansions in EQ shaman became more balanced, but there is no way in hell you can compare SoE and Bliz.  No offense, but your statement is purely grass is greener jargon for the short term memory people.  Shaman had to wait over a year to have SoE confirm that alchemy was indeed broken.  I agree there are problems, there are setbacks and there are glaring issues with WoW and I'm not satisfied with Bliz's CS, but I would not be so hasty to compare it to SoE.<br />
<br />
I heard Caydiem was pretty lame, I can't comment as I don't lurk there.  I agree, it's pretty bad when a dev or class board mod not only doesn't help, but actually makes a situation worse.  I recall the &quot;what is a shaman?&quot; comment/joke, staple that onto my list of reasons NEVER to buy an SoE product again.<br />
It's just my frustration Tarthug. Pretty tired of being promised one thing in one conversation, only to have them come back with a complete reversal later (see the pet attack approach run speed for an example where one day they posted &quot;working as intended&quot; only to come back a week or two later and say &quot;we're not sure now&quot;). <br />

I understand the frustration, I played an EQ shaman 5 years (as did you).  How long did SoE take to pony up to errors and oversights ... some they still have not.  A year on owning up to alchemy, almost 2 years with no admission and little fix for several expansions (namely GoD and PoP) on overusing slow mitigation on exp content with no balancing ability offered in turn.<br />
<br />
The Euro team isn't likely as stretched out as the north american team which is likely why the Euro site is so much better at communicating.  Many of the release issues faced here were fixxed by the time the Euro servers went live.<br />
<br />
Here are a couple things that make me happy about WoW, even in it's current state.  1) BG are not released and I assume they are withholding it till classes get fixxed.  SoE never held back content just because stuff was broken.  2) No new expansion yet, again, SoE only held back content once because something was broken. 3) You can see them doing stuff, they make mistakes, they screw up some things, but they are working on gameplay issues and not spelling in NPC script.  4) They now have a test server which will hopefully catch some crap before it goes live and hopefully they will listen to the playerbase there. 5) They banned farmer accounts and made things more difficult/expensive for Yantis, or whatever the hell his names was that hose the server economies.<br />
<br />
I don't know, call me a fanboi, I don't care, but I think Bliz is doing a better job than SOE.  Yeah, there are some problems and I agree that hunters are taking up the short side, but it will get fixxed and they have ponied up on their responsibility.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The dev's have announced that most of the hunter nerf's in the next patch are being removed.  The only thing that will remain is the hit/miss calculations based on defense skill instead of level.  This will sting in PVP some, but PvE will theoretically be mostly unaffected.  The dodge/parry/block addition was causing most of the dps loss on test.  Score one for the good guys, and good show to the folks raising hell on the Blizzard boards.  The high end PvE game is tedious and unrewarding enough without having to worry about how much you will suck after the next patch.  <br />
<br />
I concur on the itemization.  Dire Maul added some nice armor goodies, but the ranged weapon selection is still pitiful.  95% of level 60 hunters use the same Blightcaller quest bow.  Only one weapon outside Molten Core is better really, and that is the near non-existant world-drop epic Dwarven Hand Cannon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Try finding a high level dagger or one handed mace, hell I would love it is rogue weapons(besides swords) were as plentiful as bows. See hurricanes for sale all the time heh.<br />
<br />
Almost none of the dungeon loot you have to really earn is any better than random world drops, I had to wait months before finding a decent mace, where sword rogues had similar weapons by the hundreds. Itemization sucks for more than just hunters.<br />
<br />
And please people don't tell me hunters aren't the king of solo classes, a rogue may kill a mob faster, but with alot more risk, hunters just keep going, and going, and going.<br />
<br />
Hunters far from useless either, anyone saying it doesn't know the class, I hear the same crap about rogues in MC, in dungeon xx, etc. A well played class is valuable anywhere. Hunters = free solid ranged damage without getting hit and needing to be healed. We had a hunter pulling in MC, btw.<br />
<br />
besides, you will no longer be subjected to the same rules as everyone else, you get your free never miss damage back,<br />

After further DPS tests we have determined that fixing this bug and making ranged attacks able to be dodged and parried caused a substantial loss in DPS for the Hunter. <br />
<br />
As a result, this fix is going to be backed out of patch 1.4.0. Ranged attacks will no longer be able to dodged or parried. <br />
<br />
Thanks a lot for everyone's testing and perseverance in asking us look at this change closer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are truly a dichotomy, sometimes spot on, sometimes out to lunch, but always interesting.  :)<br />
<br />
Yes, the good guys did win one, this time.  Truth be told, they just could not implement the ranged dodge/block/parry without hosing up too many other things, so they scrapped it.<br />
<br />
And, yes, solo PvE is my domain.  Don't ever think any other class does it as well as I do, they don't, period.  A rogue may sneak into a cave, past 40 mobs, and kill the end boss and sneak back out with his reward, but I'll kill the 40 mobs on the way in, kill the boss, and never get hit.<br />
<br />
Finally, since I'm in such a good mood, I'll correct just one statement made.  Hunters will be subject to the same rules after the patch as we are now.  The difference is that we won't have this further limitation to our ranged attack imposed.  Hell, if they want to allow mobs and players to dodge/parry/block my arrows, then go ahead, just make sure you increase my damage per hit to compensate for the loss in accuracy.  Arrows and bullets are not dodged or parried, that only happens in the Matrix.  Our base miss rate is around 5%, that is why the best bow in the game does 36.8 dps.  The new epic bow will do 44 dps.  The highest dps 1h mace in game right now does 47.2 dps, and you can dual wield two of them at hasted speeds.  Cry me a river.<br />
<br />
Oh, and it costs me money everytime I take a shot, I can't make arrows.  Do you pay every time you swing your mace?<br />
<br />
Happy Hunting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Problem is, I always wondered why evade didn't seem to help any.<br />
<br />
As for dps, you do it at range, 30 yards for almost equal dps, with a pet, snares, etc, and impossible to avoid? No wonder so many people play hunters, almost impossible to not hit for 500 a pop from 30 yards out, wow, skillful that. Oh ya you can equal my evis with an aimed shot too, wowser.<br />
<br />
Reason they backed this out? The largest chunk of their player base is hunters, and god forbid they be subjected to the same rules that a melee class has to.<br />
<br />
and you dual wield them at hasted speeds.<br />
<br />
oh really? My off hand mace is 32 dps, hits for 75% damage, and what is this hasted speed you are talking about? Instant attacks, oh, like your instant arrows? Can I hit you from 30 yards away, safely behind my friends? no I have to close.<br />
<br />
hunters are the easiest class to play, and one of the most powerful, because of that it is the most played class, and Blizzard knows, that subjecting them to the same rules as everyone else will make them whine too much, it is easier just to let it go.<br />
<br />
Do you pay for armor repairs? Only if you die, and a hunter almost never, ever should.<br />
<br />
By the way, I miss about 17% of the time, and that is not counting all the blocks/parry/dodges as well, and I do it in a mob/player's face, completely vunerable with almost no armor. Hunter and rogue armor should be reversed, a ranged class with heavy armor and a melee with light, makes alot of sense, not.<br />
<br />
So you cry me a river. Also, from now on, every hunter I see will be killed, don't care if they are level 25 or level 60, I will kill them, not caring if the other 6 million hunters shadowmelded in the brush will get me either.<br />
<br />
By the way, you hunters will absolutely rule in the BG and in gank groups, see how rogues do. solo rogue = dead rogue.<br />
<br />
<br />
I cannot even imagine a hunter with 50% increased damage with their epic, wouldn't even be worth it to be on the same playing field. 750 + autoshots, ya, that's fair. Course it still would not be enough, hunters would demand instant aimed shots from 60 yards out with infared goggles and heat seeking arrows, pets upgraded to level + 10 elites, and powered plate armor.<br />
<br />
And how much you wanna friggin bet, that the rogue epic, if it ever comes out, will be a goddamn dagger or sword? Rogue epic not even out yet anyway is it? Oh ya that's right, rogues ignored, and nerfed several times in patch coming out. detect hidden, perception, lose combo points on vanish, etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thunder, my class keeps getting weaker, others more powerful, and actually geard specifically to kill me, and devs do not listen, hunters get angry and get a change right away. Kind of smacks a guy right in the face. I love grouping with hunters, I just am sick of fighting them, they are everywhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I have seen tons of daggers to be honest. Lorespinner from DM quest. Dagger from Baron in Stratholme. Dagger from boss of live side Stratholme whatever his name is. Dagger from hmmm...trying to remember..might be sunken temple quest. One from Princess in Mauradon. I will admit there are more swords but there are attainable daggers in the 40dps range. As far as one hand maces go I haven't seen a lot yet. I am still using one from Mauradon situationally. The Hand of Edward the Odd is my dream mace up there with Ironfoe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Daggers need to be high damage/low delay though(for rogues), dps is not important, is only two readly available and still tough to get, barman shanker and heartseeker. Heartseeker has really expensive ingredients, shanker is BOP I believe. Felstriker is very rare as well and non-rogues want them too.<br />
<br />
One hand maces are silly too, I used a bonesnapper for months, level 48, finally found a mass of mcgowan in AH for 400 gold, 149 damage, unless I get a dragon drop, that is it, top weapon ever.<br />
<br />
No decent off hand maces either, cruel hand of timmy prolly best, don't think it even has stats? Ironfoe drops off a very hard to get to boss in a pretty worthless zone so no one wants to even try.<br />
<br />
biggest problem I have is that no world drop epic high end weapon for me, whereas seen plenty of axes, lots of hurricanes, etc. etc. Mass is incredibly rare and cannot be farmed so to speak. I have not seen anyone else with one as of yet.<br />
<br />
Do this, you horde? do a level 50-60 search on daggers, swords, and one hand maces, you will very rarely see any daggers, rarely any maces(usually the level 50 green ones swiftwind hammer of the xxx etc.), but plenty of swords.<br />
<br />
Bows are still rare, but they are not in demand that much as only one class cares about the dps, I only have a bow for + 5 agility and stam.<br />
<br />
Smithing recipes are bsolutel garbage for hammers too, and I want to be a hammersmith :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Mill, you crack me up.  However, I share your passion for the game so I can understand your position.<br />
<br />
Couple of points:<br />
<br />
1.  My max range is 41 yards (+6 with talents)<br />
<br />
2. As you know, 500 autoshots and 1800 aimed shots only occur when we crit.  Right now my crit %, with my two Dawn's Edge axes (+1% to crit each) is around 15% (I think, not sure of the exact number, will have to look).  So, your magical hunter doing 500+ autoshots is only doing it with talents (that not all hunters take, such as Beast Mastery spec'd hunters) and only on a crit, say 20% of the time.<br />
<br />
So 1 out of 5 shots hits for 500, the other 4 hit for 200.  Does your eviserate hit for 1800 1 out of 5 times?  I know it's not quite that simple, but hunters certainly do not do 500+ each shot and 1800+ with every aimed shot.<br />
<br />
3. Since I'm not in your shoes, I can't comment on the plight of the Rogue.  However, I've read several posts from you that state that you win the vast majority, if not overwhelming majority of your PvP encounters.  Granted, I'll assume that you are a very good player and have done everything possible to make sure you are as prepared as possible for any attack and situation.  However, consider that there are equally skilled and prepared players playing other classes.  Why is it that you consistently beat these folks?  You can't tell me that you've only fought noobs.  I'm sure many of them were very skilled, higher level, with better gear, etc.<br />
<br />
The only answer must be that a well played Rogue has a huge advantage on any other class.  That is the element of surprise.  True, they are making some tweaks that may make your ability to sneak up on a hunter, or hunter protected group more difficult.  IMHO that is sorely needed to maintain game balance.  There should be an effective way of countering every strength in the game.  <br />
<br />
Rock-Paper-Scissor.  Where is the stealth scissor?  Even with improved hidden detection, most hunters will be tracking mobs unless they believe a Rogue is near by.  Rogues will still have a huge advantage, any way you slice it.  And only 1 class in the game can detect you, 1.  How many classes can root/snare/daze me get into my dead zone, and kill me with impunity.  I'll answer, several.<br />
<br />
Sorry, I just don't see it.  As you have said many times, Rogues are very powerful in all aspects of the game, solo PvE, group PvE, solo PvP and group PvP.  Although I believe Hunters are good in all of these areas, some more than others, I don't see a huge difference between our classes, even after the tweaks made in the patch.<br />
<br />
Rogues are and will remain near the top of the food chain.  Hunters certainly are not, except if you are talking about ease of play for a noob 13 yr old.  Then you have to deal with the class perceptions caused by these 13 yr old retards that don't play their class properly, ninja-loot epic drops, and melee with their pets set on aggressive in an instance.<br />
<br />
And in Battlegrounds, I will also kill every Rogue I see, on sight, from 41 yds out, before he ever sees me.  But I will see him with flare, track hidden, and eagle eye.  He can hope I miss, but he won't be dodging my arrow of doom.  (OK, I went over the top, but it was fun).  <br />
<br />
I will call this &quot;Kill Rogues on Sight&quot; doctrine the Millman Rule, in your honor.<br />
<br />
BTW, check out my new Felhide Cap.  The Rogue in the group cried like a baby when I won the roll.  Then he threatened to roll on the Satyr's bow when it dropped, until I biatch slapped him.<br />
<br />
Peace.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">/heh, ok I guess I've egged Mill on enough.  Truth is most classes are pretty well balanced in this game, they all have their strenghts and weaknesses.  Hunters, with their crappy melee and dead zone probably have it worse than most, but hey, I'm done debating this issue.  Not sure why Mill has such a hard one for hunters, but you can't expect any class to automatically be able to win every fight, without even the chance of being detected.  If I want to do that, I'll play Doom in God mode.<br />

I beat him 2 times and he beat me once, it was close every time. &lt;insert the &quot;you are a ****ty warrior&quot; comments here&gt;  I'm not an expert but but basically he was aggro kiting me around while his pet chewed on me.  Yes I feared it but there is a 3 minute cooldown on that.  Scatter shot got me a few times, plus the dots and whatever that he put on me.<br />
<br />
When I watched the famous &quot;miss rate&quot; video, my first thought was &quot;yep, that looks about right&quot;.<br />

[EDIT: just adding my opinion on this, not saying it's good or bad.  As mentioned before I have a hunter alt... I wasn't concerned either way with the proposed changes and now the retraction of them :)  I'd probably be more concerned if the hunter was my main.  Since hunters had exceptional ranged dps PLUS a pet, my opinion was that toning down the dps was an acceptable move... the pet dps reduction was obviously a bug.]</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I'm not trying to make a point that Hunters suck. My only point is that as a rogue, they present very little challenge. That isn't necessarily a bad thing. I for one can't beat ice mages or priests (shadow or otherwise) where as hunters I'd imagine have a much easier time. I accept this as part of the game design. <br />
<br />
Since I don't play a hunter I have zero insight into what is wrong and what is right. With your current dps do you lose to every other class, or just rogues? If they fixed your dps would it have a huge effect on your ability to solo, or bring it more in line with what everyone else has to do?<br />
<br />
Those are the kinds of questions I'd want the answers to before I would complain about any upgrades/nerfs coming down the road.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Actually, the primary complaint about the introduction of ranged attack dodge/block/parry was not that we lose or win against certain classes.  It was that we got hit with a 13% decrease in dps in the last patch thanks to the quiver haste bug fix, and this would have been another 20% or so.  It was uncalled for and excessive, which they finally admitted and therefore retracted the change.  At the same time  some very annoying bugs, which were first identified in beta, are still in the game.<br />
<br />
Also, I don't think anyone is arguing that hunter dps is overpowered.  If anything, compared to other dps classes, mages and rogues, we are definitely third (even with the pet dps, which of course is 0 when he dies from 3 hits in a high level instance).<br />
<br />
People like to bring up some of our utility as a counter to why we should have lower dps, however, that does not hold water when you consider the utility of those classes as well.  Polymorph and sap are the two best cc techniques in the game.  Blink and Vanish are very handy.  Compare them to freezing trap and FD.  Yes, I'd rather have FD, but freezing trap is not as effective as the other methods of cc.<br />
<br />
Bottom line is that we just want them to leave our class, hell all classes, alone and allow people to play the game the way they have been doing for the last 5 months.  There is no need for some of the changes they have made or have proposed. <br />
<br />
Fix the bugs, keep the servers stable, and work on new content.  Stop the nerfing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">People like to bring up some of our utility as a counter to why we should have lower dps, however, that does not hold water when you consider the utility of those classes as well.<br />
Your argument is all pointed at high end PvE utility and you make a solid case for hunters, but in all levels of group/mass PvP (for which most of this game is balanced on) hunters are almost an icon.  Their ability to negate rogue ambush and contribute some AoE to boot, not to mention taking out casters while OOR casting range makes them invaluable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Sorry Tarthug, <br />
<br />
But the range argument is not accurate.  With talents, my max range is 41 yds, 8-35 yds base range (note the dead zone between 5 yds (melee) and 8 yds (ranged)) and +6 yds due to talents (Hawkeye).  A mage has a base range of 35 yds for fire attacks such as fireball and also has a talent line (flame throwing) that provides +6 yds, for a total of 41 yds of range for Fireball and Pyroblast, two of their most powerful spells.  <br />
<br />
So actually, hunters do not have a range advantage against mages.<br />
<br />
Also, in the last patch, this little gem was one of the &quot;PvP changes&quot;:<br />
<br />
Spells in PvP now have a slight increase in range and area of effect when targets are moving. This should improve the overall usability of spells and ranged attacks.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure how much they increased the range, a caster could probably tell us, but it sure sounds like they are mitigating any range advantage that a non-caster (has to be hunters because we are the only non-caster ranged class) may have.<br />
<br />
But I do agree with you in general, group PvP is one of the aspects of the game that do favor the abilities of the hunter class.  Just like 1 v 1 dueling (which is my other alternative being on a PvE server) does not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Funny how hunters whine that they are underpowered, but when you agree with them they get offended.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In fact, I agreed that we have several weaknesses.  But as a whole, the classes are pretty well balanced right now.  Also, just to clarify, most of my posts in this thread were concerning our displeasure with the changes that had been made that decreased our dps in the upcoming patch.<br />
<br />
I never said we suck, I currently do just fine in game, thank you.  But I did say we would suck if the proposed changes went live.  So, please, get your facts straight.<br />
<br />
And yes, I did egg Mill on a bit by stating how I'd kill rogues with impunity.  If you can't tell that I was exaggerating just to irk him (since he was ranting and making anti-hunter statements), then there is no point in continuing to address your post.</div></div><hr />

A couple points here.<br />
<br />
1) mages are not the only casting class in town.  Hunters outrange shamans, priests, driuds and locks.<br />
2) I can't imagine most mages picking up the flame throwing talent.  In PvE I imagine it might have some use in raids, but it's limited use in PvP seems to make it a poor choice of talents.  Mages, correct me if I'm wrong here, but I just don't see it as a factor.  Most PvP mages I've had the dubious honour of fighting don't nuke from range, the exception here being in massed fights where they try to flank from range or hide out in the caster cluster in the back.  Flame throwing isn't a pre req for any higher talents, and it's only 2 pts (5 being required to move up).<br />
3) not all mages are fire specced (this may change after this upcoming patch).<br />
4) as to the little gem, most of your shots are instant cast, there is no issue with OOR after pulling the trigger and you can shoot on the run, while mages have a cast time on most spells and must stand still to cast.  Due to the way the client/server works out range (although an instant cast, there is a slight delay between the cast and the effect, I assume this delay causes a recalc in range, I might be misreading it, hopefully not), most times when I'm chasing down some ganktard, I have to use a swiftness pot to get a FS off to snare the retreating bastage even thought the client says I'm in range, the server says no.  I assume this little gem will finally address this crap.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tell you what, I'll happily trade my dead zone, from 5-8 yds, for the extra 5 yds of range.  Deal?<br />
<br />
And, on your response, a mage may not pick up that talent, just like a hunter may not pick it up.  It is optional and a Beast Master or Survival spec'd hunter would not have the extended range.  A hunter has the same choice to make that the mage does.  So don't make it sound like we have an advantage, because we don't, a Marksmanship spec'd max range is 41 yds with the Hawk Eye talent, same as a Fire Mage with the Fire throwing talent.</div></div><hr />

<br />
on zepplin from UC to orig, no poisons on, was just chilling, never even thought a rogue would be there. He sapped me, chased a lowbie off the zep, lined up and went to work, had me to half before could do anything and he was jumping around like crazy, stunned him a few times, came down to last hit, I had 3 combo points, but before I could hit him he hit me with a 5 point cold blood evis. If I would have landed even two instant poisons he would have died.<br />
<br />
Totally my fault, I didn't expect to be attacked, dumb.<br />
<br />
Last good fight I was jumped by a NMI rogue(top guild on server) outside MC, he CS, hit, got a gouge off, I came out of stun and I beat his ass badly, blinded him before I killed him, bandaged almost to full, whack. I looked at my combat logs and only did about 3500 points of damage on him. Wuss hps = dead. No idea why he didn't blind either, either cooldown or he expected me to be killed quick.<br />
<br />
I do not fear rogues at all, yet. Big jump in dagger damage is bad though because alot of uber guilded alliance have felstriker. I like being burly and strong, so daggers just isn't my style.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">wow...for a second there I thought I'd accidentally read a thread on the Blizzard boards instead of the Crucible...I think some people need to chill out a bit and give Blizzard a chance - and also consider that there are a lot of game mechanic issues that you don't see unless you play every class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Range classes, casters, hunters, are by far the most viable pvp classes, btw, with the honor system, way, way better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Well, not sure how this will play out in the long run, but last night I tried a little PvP with my guild.  I'm not really into it much, but wanted to check it out.<br />
<br />
I'll probably regret this later, but I have to admit that Mill has a point. The Hunters in my guild were chalking up big numbers, while the melees were complaining that they could not even get to melee range with the lag.  One of our 60 hunters, who decided to just PvP last night, had over 200 kills with no deaths when I logged in early evening.  By the end of the night I think he had over 400, and only died a couple of times.  Hell, with my aoe and multi-shoot I could hit multiple mobs, regardless of the lag.  <br />
<br />
I'm sure things will work themselves out, but for now, I'll enjoy the very little advangtage I have in mass lag fests like last night.  It was fun, but with the lag and chaos, not something I'd want to do every night.  I rather be calculating and selective in my killing, than just shooting arrows like a gatling gun, feels more like an xbox game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">I actually am thinking about switching to a PVE server, I have no problems fighting, but the lag is horrible, and it won't get much better, there is too much reward involved.<br />
<br />
Also, ya I have a level 60 character, but, I will never be able to get another one now, the contested zones are just ungodly brutal, literally, you cannot fight for more then 2-5 minutes before being crushed by a group of pvp'rs.<br />
<br />
They really needed a dishonor penalty system as well, I mean, TM, for instance, is officially off limits for questing, as are other places.<br />
<br />
What would have been so hard about making effective, tough guards in towns, and near windriders?<br />
<br />
A priest in our guild had over 500 honorable kills last night, by the way, from shielding, sending out a dot, retreating, repeat. The only kills I got were full kills, mostly solo, far, far away from the lag fests.</div></div><hr />

Same here Mill.  I'm lvl 51, old enough to grant &quot;honour&quot;, too young to really give a good fight against raid equipped 60's.  My buds are mostly raiding MC these days as they were all 60 in the first month or two.  I basically duo with a hunter friend of mine, or do the odd group into instances.  Soloing is no longer a viable option.  I'm going to give this a week or two, but then I'm going to ask my friends to relocate to PvE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Wanted to finish my wizard, shaman, druid, but I can no longer twink them by myself, the dungeons are getting too hard.<br />
<br />
I mean, I can see a couple groups or something, but we are talking 100's of people at a time, you just cannot fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">I hear you Mill.  Even on my PvE server, Hellscream, TM was just a lag fest.  About a dozen horde against 50+ alliance.  I can't imagine the chaos on a PvP server.  Makes you wonder what will happen with the 50% of the servers that are PvP now.  I can see a lot of folks trying to get off of them, but not having anywhere to go unless they bring more PvE servers online.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Ivloney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">What does the honor points give ya?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Not to be a toad, but guess what the prime stat on almost every item and set is?<br />
<br />
Stamina, go figure hehe. Rogue set pretty good, mucho stamina.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Noticed that. Sad really. Some of us don't subscribe to the &quot;STA &gt; all&quot; way of thinking. I prefer +AGI, +INT, and +% crit gear myself. It's served me very well so far.<br />
<br />
Congrats to those who prefer STA though. Some really nice rewards are waiting for ya. :)<br />
<br />
Oh, and Mill....yer always a toad. Some days you just have less warts than other other days.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">Yeah, dissapointing amount of + crit% on that stuff, nice stats otherwise, especially the purple set.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">have you guys even tried stamina heavy? And no, I am not saying stamina ONLY, but jeez.<br />
<br />
<br />
And remember, pvp you need stamina, and the honor system really should benefit pvp servers more, they earn it, believe me.</div></div><hr />
