<br />
Servers up and working.<br />
<br />
Lag is gone.<br />
<br />
Instead of fixing a problem with a quick fix to get everyone barely back on, blizzard has decided to speak to its users and tell them that they will add servers and certain realms will be down for a 1-2 days so that a permanent fix is implimented.  Communation is made and 95% of the playerbase accepts it and agree its best and realizes it needs to be done.<br />
<br />
Game is fun as hell and im hearing of no more bugs and seeing no bugs.<br />
<br />
All is good in WoW in my book and its only 2 day and this issue happened on thanksgiving and they kept their staff active through it to keep the player base happy.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Over all, a great launch. im sorry, but you just cant convince me as a PC tech and a network tech that 250,000 people all franticly logging on isnt going to cause issue that will be to be adjusted. You can say they had betas to fix this all day and all night, but they launched with relitivly low problems, the only issue was lag which they have corrected. I hear from friends in EQ2 that whole servers are still coming up and down and zones are unavailable and clients crash. I dont say that to point at eq2 and say it sucks. I point at WoW and say, it was a pretty good launch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Play for me was fine early today.  I'm running roughly 200ms cross coast to play with my guild on our server - I don't notice any issues with that in my game play.  Althought it does concern me that it *might* impact play for PVP.<br />
<br />
I haven't seen server side &quot;loot&quot; lag since day 1.  However I am also playing early in the day well before peak hours due to my screwy work schedule.  So I'll be a lot more curious to see what it is like when I play mid/late Sunday afternoon.</div></div><hr />
