<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shamolite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering how to get myself posted on one of those sites that shows all the armor and stuff you currently have .. As i would like to get some recommendations on upgrades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>DarkPhase</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Register at:<br />
http://www.magelo.com/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kieran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just go to www.magelo.com and create an account, then enter all your stuff. It's that easy!<br />
<br />
But for equipment upgrades, really I think if you read the existing equipment threads you'll see the same advice posted over and over and over.... asking for personal advice on upgrades is really not going to net you anything more than you can get by reading what is already here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Padraic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There is also a thread on the board, somewhere, where alot of magelo profiles are listed.  Might give you a general idea of what other shaman near your level are wearing.</div></div><hr />
