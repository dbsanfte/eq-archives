<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kolnie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">besides my Shammie y currently have a beastlord with which I use fleeting fury all the time as a macro. I've noticed that the melee skills go up much faster due to the extra 20 DEX and wanted to try the trick with my Shaman so that FF would be up all the time. The macro with my beast lord is basically<br />
/attack off<br />
/Target Sannia<br />
/cast 2 (FF gem)<br />
/pause 28<br />
/assist pet<br />
this way with one click I cast on myself and jump back into battle. My question is, how do I do this without a pet? is there a comand to target the mob you are fighting that can be used here? a variation can be used with the main tank if fighting iin a group, but my hours playing are not regular so I mostly solo. Any help will be appreciated</div></div><hr />
