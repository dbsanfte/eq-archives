I come to the glade for advice once again.  Recently my guild tried killing innoruk, and got our heads handed to us.  Now I think part of our problem was that we had no expierence doing it, so we learned a lot.  We attempted to pull him to a rather small house... and we wiped out because he couldn't fit through the door.  We learned from that... going to try to fight him outside next tme.  We were told that he should be fought in a small area because he knocks back, and sometimes that causes adds... can anyone confirm this?  Basically I need whatever you can give me on fighting inny, from resists needed (someone said PR/DR)... can he be slowed... where to fight him (rush or pull?)... ANYTHING you can think of would be a great help.  I eagerly await replies, and thank you all for your time!</div></div><hr />

You can cast harmony on him and single his guards.  Then buff up and get ready.  Remember that his aoe thing is line of sight.  Have your tank go in first and have him turn inny so that he faces the wall.   A few minutes later you have a dead wuss God.  <br />

Is his spawn point fixed?  He wasn't where my map said he was gonna be, was a few buildings over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beronhelm</div><div class="date">05-05-2002, 03:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let me point you to a good map.  Here<br />

<br />
You dont need to clear the second floor. just hug right and make a b line for inny.<br />
<br />
PoH is one of those outdoor zones where you dont need line of sight to cast spells.  Just to be safe I'd cast bind sight on one of the guards, then from there cast harmony.</div></div><hr />

We had a 60 shaman with us but he didn't have malo.  Slow was resisted 8 times.  Shaman died, tanks died, game over.<br />
<br />
If you dont have a level 60 mage or shaman for debuff then   Inny is pretty much next to unkillable for a 5-6 group raid.  Stick a slow on him and you win, its not complicated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arkus</div><div class="date">05-05-2002, 12:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Right click items are very handy for a fight as long as this.  He doesn't hit all that hard and is slowable (by Earthcall witout being debuffed even).  So like Beronhelm said just use Harmony and keep your distance.  If it makes you feel better once you have him and his guards Harmonied just stay on him and the the other guards while your raid kills the single pulls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">agent0014</div><div class="date">05-05-2002, 01:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats the map I have been using.  He wasn't in building 51 like it indicates.  He was in fact on the second floor of building 41.  His guards really didn't seem to be a problem (diffrent spawns in 41 I guess) and we had a monk pulling.  We pulled to building 45, which was a bad idea... since he wouldn't fit through the door.  Instead he took out our party without us being able to see him, so we didn't even get a fair chance.  Good to know he is slowable, sadly we don't have an earthcaller ranger (that would be me... if he would drop the damned stone).  I know a few, maybe I will invite them as guests.  Is it true that he does knockback?  How much do we have to clear around him to make sure this doesn't become an issue?  Also, you mentioned a LOS AE?  Is it a DD, DoT... what resists avoid it?  Thanks for all the help so far, hopefully people can keep the info coming!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ikerian</div><div class="date">05-05-2002, 05:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Inny is a wuss=). Damage output once slowed is not too bad, and he does a grav flux/dispell a lot, but not too bad. What we did was clear to his building, and clear all the guards in there. We tryed to pull him but he wouldn't come, so instead we just had our force rush him and kill him. He has a lot of hp's, but otherwise is not as hard as Cazic.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vanidar</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 05:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I strongly suggest pulling him into a house. His knockback will fling you all over the zone. Whether you have cleared the zone or not if he flings you far enough your basically out of the fight. Try not to pick a small house though :P<br />
<br />
On  the second floor fairly close to him is a 2 storry building with a very large entry. It has no middle florr and is basically open floor to ceiling. Very suitable place to fight him.</div></div><hr />
