<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Moxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heyas, just wondering if anyone can answer a question for me.<br />
I was under the impression that you could transfer your character (with a fee) to any server with items and pp intact...I thought that was a change they had made recently.<br />
Also, I thought you could transfer to FV server.<br />
<br />
However, the site you go to at www.everqust.com states that you cannot transfer to FV and that items and pp are deleted upon transfer.<br />
Is the site I am looking at like super outdated? Or is this service no longer offered?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance )<br />

<br />
<br />
Just couldn't resist.<br />
<br />
<br />
no to or from<br />
<br />
FV, sullon, and /cough test  :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
theoretically anyhow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I know of several people that have transfered to FV.  I think it depends on who answers the transfer request.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">As far as with gear theres a seperate selection for that. Think its called item transfer service or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm not 100% sure, but I believe the transfer-with-items/plat service excludes transferring to the FV server and the Zek servers. I can't remember where I read that though, so I could be wrong. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just curious, why are you looking to transfer to FV?<br />
And it the answer you get from SOE seems to differ from time to time. There are several people I know of who've transfered from other servers to FV. Then someone just got turned down to transfer in, even though they were willing to go naked.<br />
I opened a Stormhammer account a while back and transfered a character from Tunare with no problem. They told me I could'nt transfer a character from Kane Bayle however. This was after being told I could. Just like when you petition in game, depends on who you are dealing with at the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grixx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">From the EQLive web site:<br />
<br />
Characters will be moved from one of your accounts to one of your other accounts on the following servers: The Test Server and Firiona Vie. Movement to or from these servers will not be allowed.<br />
<br />
and again on the new transfer page (the one involving items):<br />
<br />
No moves are allowed to or from the Test server, Sullon Zek or Firiona Vie; no moves are allowed to the Stromm server.<br />
<br />
Whether &quot;underground&quot; or &quot;random&quot; moves to and or from FV have been allowed is pretty irrelevant.  I've sent three attempts in to transfer to FV and have been refused every time.  Some &quot;claim&quot; to have been moved to FV, and I'm sure a few probably have - but most have probably been a result of a lazy Customer Service Rep or special favors from a friend of a Sony employee, etc.  <br />
<br />
As a general rule, transfers to FV, Test, SZek will be refused I'm afraid.</div></div><hr />
