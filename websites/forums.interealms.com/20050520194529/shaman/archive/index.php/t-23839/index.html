<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kabuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It seems on most servers that WoS is overly camped.  If I wanted to make a group for the express purpose of hunting named for spell drops, perhaps a slighlty lower level zone even just for spell farming, does anyone have suggestions on where would be good?<br />
<br />
I did some grouping in Bloodfields and the mobs were very easy but there weren't many named and none dropped runes. <br />
<br />
I'd greatly appreciate any input folks who've explored more have.</div></div><hr />

Muramite rune farming- yep it's a graind, like you knew it would be. Here's how I've had some success.<br />
Go to Dranik's and walk the North wall to Grand Historian Whatshisname. Get an expidition: Murkgliders Hive. Take this one because it has two Named's (with phs, of course) and farm the heck out of it.<br />
One ph is a Hideous Rat, and his Named is &quot;Who cares, just kill it&quot;. A bit further down the maze is another ph, Tatterwinged Bat, and his Named is a Frenetic Cavebat, or something.  Kill the place holders, and bounce back and forth between the two spawn points. If you clear the maze between, the exp is reasonable.<br />
<br />
You can just ITU down to the spawns, and spend a day hoping for Nameds. At least it's not a silly race with other groups, since its an instanced zone.<br />
<br />
Bring along a six pack of coke, the phone number of your favorite pizza delivery, and unplug the phone, because you're going to be there a while. But the drops are frequent and the pace is pleasurable. A friendly group makes for a pleasant afternoon.<br />
<br />
Happy Hunting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Is that for Muramite Runes also, or only 67 and under? I looked on Alla and the guy posted it on lesser I think.</div></div><hr />

Can you just keep saying &quot;what caves&quot; until you get the Murkglider Hive expedition?  Just curious, because the ones we got were a little low for my friends ( the mobs were blue to me at 57, and with good luck on resists I could solo them)  My friends were 65 Paladin, 65 Enchanter, 65 Druid, 61 Druid, 59 Bard...to give you an idea of the average level.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think this is going to generate minor runes only, and its an instance, so I think you must have a group of 3 (if the info on other instances being 3 player required applies to this one). I am going to check it out tomorrow, and will report back.<br />
<br />
But this is just an example. I am sure there are other, higher instances available where a small group of friends could sit, unmolested, and farm XP and items and runes for a few hours. This whole expansion seems fairly &quot;get your spells&quot; friendly, for the most part. Of course, PoP was similar, Ehteral Parches dropped off random, regular mobs. Even Specs were dropping in places like HoH off random, soloable mobs. We will see how difficult the 69 and 70 spells are though.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grobbles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My experiences of OoW have been pretty positive . I would add though , I had about 2 days worth of farming runes (one success i may add ) in Nobles Causeway , before the Uber guild players who spent that time lvling to 70 started to invade and take all named camps on a perma basis , stopping anyone else progressing . fair enough i s'pose..<br />
This i can deal with , but unfortunately the zone has become a sess pit of peeps training either zone out and other peeps trying to KS your named . Happened to me , had to speak to their guild leader about it , but others in his guild kept on KSing peeps claiming that it was their named even though peeps been camping spots for hours . What usually happens is they wait till u clear out the mobs surrounding named then when u getting mana back and prepping  for attempt they steam in and kill said named . As they have time gear and proly better dps thro equipment they inevitably get kill .. then proceed to /ooc on how YOU tried to KS them and they engage first on mob making it theirs . Anyway this is just my experiences along with  numerous of other folk on an over crowded server ( Ant Bayle) .<br />
Hopefully these inconsiderate , foul mouthed , ignorant , arrogant , immature retards will soon be leaving for greener pastures and leave others alone . The sooner the better .. <br />
Also like to add that perhaps Sony should have thought about that and made runes droppable in more locations than what they have i.e off random mobs albeit rarely like the decent loot from this zone<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gumurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i have too noticed that walls of slaughter has been way overcamped, very common for at least 100 people to be in the zone at peak hours. I have found on the other hand for the ruined city of dranik to be much less populated and it generates almost as many named spawns as walls of slaughter, not only do these mobs drop some kick ass loot but they also most of the time drop runes.  I suggest checking that out, try to get a group going at the statue camp and grind some exp while killing nameds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Lorianna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hope this clarifies some ....  blatantly pulled off another thread and we followed this when we went in.<br />

/quoted <br />
<br />
High Priest someone-or-other gives you the expedition on the east wall of Dranik's Scar.  You enter through a cave that is right there.<br />
<br />
Details: <br />
<br />
- 2 named, one bat and one rat. <br />
- The bat and rat have standard place holders, &quot;a hideous rat&quot; and a &quot;tattered bat&quot;. They appear to always spawn in the same place. <br />
- They spawn in rooms close to each other at the end of a rather long dungeon. <br />
- The hideous rat is in a bricked room not yet marked on the map, but is on the way to the Bat Cave noted on the map anyway and since the PH is a different name you can't miss him. <br />
- The tattered bat is in the Bat Cave shown on map. <br />
- The expedition itself seemed to just be a standard exp zone (no &quot;mission&quot; style thing you can win) with the named as the sweetener. <br />
- The experience was decent enough, I had leadership on and got about 11% of 66 in a little bit over 2 hours, other group members reported 12-13%. Our group was not particularly dps heavy though. <br />
- Better still, the mobs were challenging for us but not overwhelming. Pulls were 2-3 at most generally, mobs hitting for to about 6-700? This placed it just under high diff LDoN in terms of mobs' power, but the easier pulls made it significantly easier. <br />
- We discovered late in the expedition that the bats are indifferent! This makes skipping that content easy, and you can also invis past lots of stuff - Some murkies can see invi, not sure about rats, didn't see any who cuold. <br />
- Tracking seems very limited in here. Could be the open nature of the dungeon or intentinoal. <br />
- Not sure if the named is always in the same place, but we got a hint about the rat from a friend outside the expedition who had got it before and the room was described to us perfectly. <br />
<br />
As there is no eqtoobox map yet for these expeditions I mapped out a route to the static named spawn with a simple line map and you can download it here: <br />
<br />
http://www.comcen.com.au/~teebeez/maps.zip <br />
<br />
Now the loot is NOT WoS quality, more like Nobles' level from what we saw, but it was stil reasonable (ranged item with 50ish (bit more?) hp / mana and a buncho stats dropped with a Lesser Muramite Rune from the named we got). <br />
<br />
There are also a fair number of sellable / gem drops and mobs drop coin too. Overrall I thought the exp and loot (especially given the existence of rune drops!) was good reward for the difficulty of the dungeon. The named was dark blue and easily doable by our group, our tank had a bit under 8k hp buffed. <br />
<br />
/end quote <br />
<br />
For our group, this was completely enjoyable, we ended up with a couple of armor drops that were decent,  The two named always dropped the same armor for us.  And either one or the other would have a rune.<br />
<br />
Runes were only level 66/67, but terrific way to farm.  <br />
<br />
Now the new rumor is that you have to kill 100 mobs before the nameds spawn.  Cuold be wrong.  I will tell you that once we found the ph's and started a rotation between the two, we had plenty of nameds to keep us entertained.<br />
<br />
Good luck guys.  When WoS and Causeway get you down, grab a group and head over. <br />

Oh, from the sound of it I thought he was talking about Dranik's Scar.  <br />
<br />
High Priest someone-or-other gives you the expedition on the east wall of Dranik's Scar. You enter through a cave that is right there.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, is it still possible to get runes in the expeditions in Dranik's Scar?  Or am I still misunderstanding :)</div></div><hr />

This instanced is the same one everyone has been talking about.  It starts in Dranik's Scar.  Just pop over and see the historian.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">OK, heres my report on this instanced dungeon.<br />
<br />
Got a Paladin(68) who 2-boxes a Cleric(66), his RL Wife who plays a Warrior(67), and me(67 shaman), and off we go. Got the Murk instance first try, so I am not sure if there are other choices you have to &quot;pass&quot; on, and in we went. <br />
<br />
First of all, rats and bats are non-aggro. Only the murkgliders are aggro, but the rats and bats assist them. The murks are undead, so IVU works jsut fine. We fought from the ZI, but in retrospect, this was a mistake. The dungeon is MASSIVE. After about 6 rooms of no hideous or tatterwing, the Pally invised and went off to look. He found the hideous rat a few more rooms along, and we all invised and went. <br />
<br />
After killing the ph's each once (they are close, only about 10 mobs total between them) the warrior had to log out. We got an Enchanter friend to come join us, and he found us no problem. The warrior tried to run out, but said there was nothing to click to get out of the dungeon, so it would appear the only way out is to gate, port, or leave exd (which will boot you).<br />
<br />
The enchanter was able to mez all the mobs easily and charm a Murk easily. He indicated it was hitting for 250+ charmed (half its normal DPS output) but he had brought pet toys for me and him and I kept it FAed and it was a nice chunk of DPS on top of the Pallys Slay Undead hits.<br />
<br />
Respawn timer here appears to be between 15 and 18 minutes. There are a number of short hallways with JUST a rat or a bat in em, so they are safe to stand in, but pulling into there will aggro the bat/rat. Also, ALL mobs run, so get a snare. Some of these rooms are PACKED with mobs. <br />
<br />
After killing the ph's 5 times each, we were about to give up when the named Bat popped. We killed it, and it dropped a 50 hp/mana mask (not great, LDoN quality tops, if that) and . . . . ready . . . . a 68 Spell rune! Thats right, a Murmite Rune (not lesser, or minor). We killed a couple more ph's and left. The enchanter was going to hijack the expedition with some of his guildies (all of us were once in the same guild together, but we went our seperate ways. We still hang out a LOT daytimes, and did dozens of LDoNs together). <br />
<br />
So in conclusion: Get some decent Undead DPS, a snarer, and other regular stuff and your good to go. IVU down til you get to the hiderous rat. Kill it, kill the next room, and get to the next hall, where you will see the room with the tatterwing bat. Pull it. We staged in that hall by the Bat Cave, so the boxed cleric didnt have to run around too much, but you could easily just work back to the rat spawn and start again. We were fustrated, thinking we had spent 2+ hours for nothing, a minor rune tops, but when the 68 rune dropped, we all decided it was a worthwhile camp. Nice and easy, fair XP (not WoS or KT quality, but fair), some cash loots, oh and a tradeskill aug dropped in there, random, +1 spell shielding (not seen this one before). But all in all, I am going back.</div></div><hr />

<br />
TO add on to what Blazz said. The murkgliders are spaced out pretty well but ive had the once in a blue moon one see through ivu and more see through invis. So dont do like me and forget the ranger is invised and not ivu'ed from the pally and run right through. Even the once in awhile that saw me if i was by a passage i could get around it. <br />
<br />
There is a zone out. Is a stone same as ones you click to come in if i remember right just not as big. Ive only two so far but was off to the side wheren i zoned in at. One Murkglider and the one with Water in the name. <br />
<br />
The Murkgliders dont mitigate slow. The rats and bats Mitigate to mostly. The named Mitigate also i want to say to mostly. The bat named summoned ive yet to get the rat named to pop. Need 3 to start the instance. Ive had to camp out my 3rd (just 3 boxing to explore for now) account from time to time and didnt boot me out but I wasnt running with two for long so dont know if there is any sort of timer. <br />
<br />
The rat ph is easy single pull just watch for the rat pathing on either side. IF they get too close they will assist. 3 rats total in the passage. PH is in the very middle. One rat paths on one side to passage end and back and one same on other side. Does anyone know if this will change? dont want to give out bad info.<br />
<br />
The bat ph was to the /front left of the batcave. No pun intended but was a room full of bats. Passage in front of it had a bat and rat i had to clear. Than i had to pull two bats that came together to get to he ph. I'm thinking it i wasnt wanting to clear and just clear PH i could shrink down and fight it right in its spot and probably not gotten aggro but was chicken so far. Well thats it for now. (again someone let me know if they have had different each instance with the murkglider hive name)<br />
<br />
I'm a bit behind on OOW my video card went out and the one i was using couldnt run oow just replaced it yesterday. So back to exploring good luck all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Forgot to add. Like the gates sewer instances after you say /what caves? it will give you one. If you dont want it everyone quits and can just say the phrase and get another one right away. There isnt a repick timer like LDON.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>spiritsofding</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">What about bloodfields?<br />
<br />
whos tried this one?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Bloodfields seem weak.  BoT-hitting mobs that his just a bit faster.  No real challenge, I solo'd two of the zone in mobs simultaneously, then two more immediately.  NBD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>spiritsofding</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">amnot interested in challenge atmo just in fast exp!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Please note.<br />
<br />
Bloodfields is kinda two tiered. <br />
<br />
The normal area around the ruins is Scaled kinda like Riwwi in diffaculty. Maybe a little easier. But there is an area off to the left that is raised up. There is a Ikkav War caller there and alot of the &quot;Little fat bastard demons&quot; that are going into level 66+ And looks like at least 2 event mobs there. <br />
<br />
The normal mobs can spawn Named in some places. That have okay Level 60 gear. / Twink loot. Dunno about the larger mobs cause I went exploring and promptly died. And Filed that under another day. <br />
<br />
I did drop one of the normal named there. A heavly burdened golem But got no rune for my troubles just some okay belt. <br />
<br />
More info as I get it but right now it is a leasurly killing for faction and some quest related drops when I have a few minutes to kill Hot boxing there. <br />
<br />
I also spent alot of deaths last night in The ruined city of dranik,<br />
<br />
Hard hard place for the non raider. Bring a puller Who is good. Or a Mezzer who is really good. They hit hard fast and often. Took a group through and had a ball for an hour or so a few night ago. But last night it was just death death death.<br />
<br />
Some of the loot is top notch from what I have read. But I want first hand knowledge darnit. There was a Named on the bridge last night but we wiped trying to get to him.. Grr.<br />
<br />
Also has anyone gotten enough faction with the dragorn yet? I am getting a Fed ex quest for murkglider blood from the dragorn near The WoS Zone in Nobles. Small faction hit and no other reward for the one blood I found. (Shrug) So far been having fun again. <br />
<br />
So Good Job SoE. You made a quality expansion so far. And yes shaman are useful in the longer range fights. But we still need some small tweaks in the older game areas. So think about it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>tewdogs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Didn't read all of the above so apologies if I'm repeating but the level of the mobs in these instances is based on the level of the person who asks for it. We made the mistake early on where a lvl 68 person got the instance (in City of Dranik) and the rest of us were 66. Mobs were yellow and we wiped a couple times before resetting with a lvl 66 person getting the instance.<br />
Unfortunately we didnt get any named, so werent able to compare the drops of the 2 different levels of difficulty.<br />
So , if you wanna take it easy and farm in peace,have the lowest level person ask for the instance. If you wanna go all out for xp as well and you got a great group with some cc then get the highest level to ask.<br />
<br />
p.s. If you decide to do xp in main zone of City of Dranik, do not go near the Bridgekeeper if he is up. This is a Raid level mob. You will have to go the long way round to reach many camp spots.</div></div><hr />

Dropped off some Deathglider named - red to 66 but easy kill for a group 66-68, and we had an early EP geared ranger as tank :p<br />
<br />
Xp isn't bad at all, better than WoS I would say - at least 50% of mobs were white to lvl 66.<br />

And it levels down the lower you are too :)  Not sure how low it goes though.  Just adding me into a group of 60-66's brought the mobs down to level 56 or lower.  I would have thought it would go by the average level of the group, but perhaps it goes by the lowest level person in the group?  Someone needs to try this with some level 30's :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Fallonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">It must level up if you're 70 when you get the expedition...<br />
<br />
Did this last night 3-boxing 66 shammy, 66 druid, 61 pally (shammy was the one that got expedition).  Mobs were mainly level 61 (white to pally).  Got a named on the rat after killing two placeholders, was red to the pally but blue to my 66 druid.  Dropped a 68 rune so not too bad.<br />
<br />
As an aside, did they nerf evac recently?  When my druid first got it, I though that leaving someone behind during an evac was a myth because I did not see it for a couple of months of evacs.  But recently, seems someone is being left behind in one out of every three evacs or so :-(</div></div><hr />
