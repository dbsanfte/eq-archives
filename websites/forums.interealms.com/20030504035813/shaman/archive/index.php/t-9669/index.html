<br />
Any one found the vendor selling Pure Blood yet?<br />
<br />
And more importantly, anyone have reports or know where Stoicism drops yet?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>gummox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Edited to remove smart-ass comment.<br />
<br />
Edited again to re-instate smart-ass comment after I noticed the &quot;April Fool's&quot; part of the other thread.<br />
<br />
I'm sure these 2 spells were on test long enough for someone to figure out where they come from.  Hopefully? Please? Pretty please?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I thought the people from test said that GMs had given them copies of Stoicism?  I imagine they didn't want to &quot;ruin&quot; our fun in letting test players give away spell drop locations.<br />
<br />
*edit* grammar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">In order to actually &quot;test&quot; spells on the test server, they usually (afaik) put them on Vendors, so an adequate number of people have access to use them.  Wouldn't make sense to have them tested, but only 2 or 3 people find them.<br />
<br />
Stupidly rare spells have been working in game fine for years, they don't need to test that anymore =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mootski</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">So what is the latest info on this new mini torpor spell?  Is it out there?  Has anyone got it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Nobody has it yet.  More importantly, no-one has found any of the spells that went live Thursday yet.  That most likely means that SOE either forgot to add them, or made them live too soon.  Either way, they aren't in the game yet.  It is also possible that they could be the result of a quest/quests that haven't been solved, or even discovered, yet.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Not in Halas, Cabilis, Everfrost, Shar Vahl.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kiegh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Not on the vendor in EC tunnel that sells chloroblast and summon companion :(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Duurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">According to new Lucy Test server info, as of 14Jan03, appears Pure Blood is now vendor sold. Stoicism doesn't show any changes to it as of now.<br />
<br />
Also, as part of the 872 changes to spells now on Test, the majority have been &quot;From recast time 0.0 to recast time 2.2&quot;. Any logic to that?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Farina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It could possibly be on the vendors in FV but just haven't had the time to go and check.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">not in FV, i checked<br />
