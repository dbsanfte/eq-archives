<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Taylia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I’ve played several classes, but I have to say that the Ranger class is my favourite.<br />
<br />
What I would like to see implemented into the game is a Ranger only forage table; meaning that only Rangers can forage and use the items.<br />
Since Rangers are supposed to be roaming the wilderness, depending on no one but thier instincts and knowledge of all things feral, wild and free, I think it would be appropriate.<br />
If we could forage items like leaves that we could use as bandages that can be used to heal above 50%.<br />
Certain herbs that can be used to temporarily increase certain stats when ingested.<br />
Roots that we can use to temporarily give us a HP regen than can be stacked with our own spells.<br />
A weed that temporarily sends us into a frenzy, making us hit for maximum damage and double attack.<br />
Cure poison and disease, although it may be redundant with our spells, but, as with all of the other items, it would be clickable.<br />
<br />
These foragable items would not be common like roots, but would require a forage skill of 200 – 250 (I know that means that they would have to raise the forage cap :) ).<br />
<br />
Some may say that this would make Shamans upset as it follows the thier Alchemy skill, but as stated already, it would be Ranger only. The items could not be foraged by other classes, as well; it would be no drop.<br />
<br />
It may not make a huge difference on a raid, but on a day to day basis, I think  it would help.<br />
