<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Maekong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I noticed my slam button on my trollie shaman wasn't staying depressed anymore and wasn't giving me a slam message, so I deleted it and right-clicked on an attack button to re-set it and it wasn't in the list anymore!  Tried both Gauntlet and crossed swords tabs, not in either.  Did we lose this the last patch?  Anyone else having this problem?<br />
<br />
I know it isn't much since it's maxed at 1 but was nice to have every once in awhile anyway.<br />

Are you sure you were in troll form?  No enchanter ninja illusioned you, or you didn't have the crown of deceit or a potion or something?  You probably know, but slam only works if you're in your large race form.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Maekong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That was probably it, though I don't know why it was gone from the lists, you should be able to still make the button in bear form shouldn't you?  Ah well, mebbe not, thanks for info figured it must be me since I hadn't seen any posts on it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>frynque</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">actually, since slam is a racial ability and not a class ability, it would make sense for it to &quot;disappear&quot; from the list when &quot;not a biggie&quot;.  though, i think it's sloppy programming, since it should check your &quot;native race&quot; and not your current race, when creating buttons.<br />
<br />
and yes, slam has never worked in bear form ( /grumble /grumble /grumble ).  anyone ever see how big a bear is.  bear form losing slam is just craptascular laziness on SoE.  in fact, though i always play a biggie race shaman, all races should get slam in bear form.. hell, you're a freekin bear.. you're big, bad, and lets face it, you have the body mass to do it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hmm wonder if other classes can map a slam key when in illusion form?<br />
A chanter in troll would get regen and slam. That could seriously come in handy at times. :) Never looked it up, does anyone know if chanters get frontal stun imunity in Ogre form or other players with Ogre potions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>frynque</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">from my experience, in ogre-form, i was more &quot;resistant&quot; to stunning, but i did occasionally suffer a stun [playing my DE ench].  as for the regen, in troll form, its very modest, i think amounts to an extra 1-2hp / tick.  i do know, from experience, that biggie-forming (ogre/troll) does improve interrupts, since i think what little physics model there is in the game incorporates size [aka mass] into how far you get pushed during melee.  i know my troll often managed to avoid interrupts while meleeing whereas my DE ench would get interrupted out the wazoo.  this is going by the amount just being battered around and successfully casting the spell with no channeling msg, as opposed to  &quot;managed to continue casting&quot; msgs which are successful channelings.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The slam button becomes available for the rest of us when using a large race illusion, so you can expect the button to disappear for large races when they have a smaller illusion on.</div></div><hr />

Yup, my human friend loves barbarian potions, and he noticed that slam was available in barbarian form :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
No, for along time there was a rumor of that and you would see enchanters running around as halflings.  So the enchanters ended up doing a fair amount of testing on that one.<br />
<br />
On the plus side of illusions, you can get hide/sneak/ and some other abilities with certian illusions.  Can be fun.  Forgot if there was one that gave forage or not though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heh.<br />
<br />
Think about it: the fact that this was even worthy of extensive testing suggests a lot about the quality of SOE's programming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">So they get a good percentage of the benefits fairly easily (illusion potions, enchanters with project illusion, etc.) without the disadvantages  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have you seen the price of compnents for illusion potions - that seems like a fairly compelling disadvantage to me!</div></div><hr />

not exactly true, unless they nerfed it in the last few monthes.<br />
<br />
Imp form (Illusion: Imp) i found, in &quot;some&quot; zones gave indifferent faction.  some places i recall this happening:<br />
<br />
Emerald Jungle:  i found the animals and mosquitos were indifferent to imp form and scowling otherwise.<br />
<br />
Trakanon's Teeth: same as EJ<br />
<br />
High Keep: some factions were &quot;unaffected&quot;, some became indifferent.  cant remember which.<br />
<br />
again, this is as of january before i stopped playing my ench, so they might have nerfed it since then.<br />

Troll illusion regen is a piddly 1 hp/tick, says Lucy.<br />
Illusions do grant racial sight ability (ultravision/infravision/none).</div></div><hr />
