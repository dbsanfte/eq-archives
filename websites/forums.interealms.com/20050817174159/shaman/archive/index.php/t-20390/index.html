<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>EQShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The new EQShaman.com (http://www.eqshaman.com) has gone up, its very much lacking in content though.<br />
<br />
I managed to get use of some scripts used in another EQ Site so the site has nice functionality...<br />
<br />
Just needs content now, if anyone would be so good as to either make a guide (http://www.eqshaman.com/index2.php?page=submit) or let us use one you've already written that would be great.<br />
<br />
Also, any comments, feedback etc would be fantastic.<br />
<br />
<br />
I know some people don't like the fact that it carries a MSS banner, but that banner pays for the hosting and stops the site ever needing to ask for donations. It would be nice if we could keep this thread about the actual site. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
What do people think, and what would be a good addition?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Is it just me, or does eveyone see medium grey links on light grey background?<br />

Feel free to create a frameset to present<br />

<br />
and/or<br />

<br />
pm me if you want them tweaked to match the site better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just a suggestion - but perhaps keep the site relevant to shaman only.<br />
<br />
Finding Druid hunting guides on the front page in the past was a pretty big turn off for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>EQShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It is shaman only, I don't think there are any druid guides still there. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The link to the Crucible forums is presented as if it belongs to the eqshaman site. Fix this immediately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Asthore McTavish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It is shaman only, I don't think there are any druid guides still there. :)<br />
<br />
Charming Disease: Flies this is a druid guide.  <br />
<br />
Now that I think about it, are all those links on the right really needed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The link to the Crucible forums is presented as if it belongs to the eqshaman site. Fix this immediately.<br />
<br />
I'm with Glori on this one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Simple yet nice, i like it.<br />
<br />
But i have to agree. Atfirst i was going to hit reply and post about how Glori was over reacting, but upon second look, it does look that way and only will take away from this site.<br />
<br />
I would suggest making a link like...<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Shaman's Crucible Forums&quot;  or something like that.<br />
<br />
And instead of having it link to the forum, link it to the main page here. http://www.interealms.com/shaman/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I find the grey on Dark grey a bit hard to read personaly. Also, I can't stress this enough to web designers, your site may look ok in IE, Netscape, and mozillia, but just because it looks ok is no excuse to not try and be w3 validated. I strongly urge you to go here http://validator.w3.org/ and fix any errors it finds. Other then that, good luck to ya, I wish you success.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>EQShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Isn't it the same company, just choice of banner? lol.<br />
<br />
<br />
Will change the link shortly, sorry if it was misleading, unintentional. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
The links on the right are RPGExpert feeds, just a way of getting some extra content really, plus I think they might be required anyway. :(#<br />
<br />
<br />
The links not showing up is an oversight not a choice, will change all the pages to have main text links like the ones on frontpage when im making changes too.</div></div><hr />

I took a look at both sites and noticed something that startled me a few weeks ago and then looked again just before I posted this.  IGE and MySuperSales have exactly the same inventory down to the same characters for sale.  They aren't seperate operations at all.  The server I compared was Brell if you want to take a look for yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Draconis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">what exactly is new about it? It looks like the same info that has been there since I started my shaman about a year ago. Maybe I missed some new guide or something but it all looks the same to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It's hard for me to take a stand on here considering we now have an advertiser, but this site has not been a springboard for advertising sites in the past and I'm not going to let it start now.<br />
<br />
I'm sure I'll catch some flak for this, but really, do we need two fragmented sites right now? I just had to go through it with EQHunter.com and all t did was isolate a few good members on another board and just fragmented the community.<br />
<br />
Locking this and preventing further advertising of this. As always, feel free to contact me regarding this decision. I take all feedback, bad or good into current and future considerations and this one is no different.</div></div><hr />
