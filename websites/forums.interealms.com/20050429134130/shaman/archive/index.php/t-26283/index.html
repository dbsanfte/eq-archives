<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ditched mining with Mill, got engineering to 260 in one day, and did the discombobulator quest in Gnomeran. Made a bunch, tried them in pvp and pve, they are an absolute godsend. instant cast, 3 minute cooldown, they fixed the bug where it had to be used from inventory too. I am pretty much invincible in pvp 1 on one at this point, hahahahahhaa. 30% snare, 50% attack speed reduction for 12 seconds, dismounts people, and they turn ugly to boot.<br />
<br />
Non-engineers can use and they are tradable, that is scary, whole guild is going to be outfitted, I expect a change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They are awesome.  I don't see why people won't buy the ones I make.  I clearly advertise them as being usable by non engineers, snare for 12 seconds!!, and reduce attack speed to boot.  Still no takers when I sell them for 50s.  I'm pretty sure they dismount people too.  Im guessing they sell better to paladins.</div></div><hr />
