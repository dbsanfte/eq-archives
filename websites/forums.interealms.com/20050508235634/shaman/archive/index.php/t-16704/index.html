<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heyas,<br />
     I just went on my first adventure (LDoN) last night, and we lost.  It was a collection assignment, and we only got 23 out of 27.  Admittedly our group wasnt optimal (56 Shaman, 56 Druid, 53 Cleric, 55 Ranger, 57 BST, and 60 Wizzy), but I thought we had pretty good DSP.  We only broke down once, and that was near when the timer was running out, and we needed to pick up the pace (we got a little sloppy).  We also wiped a second time after the 90 min wore of, but thats a different story alltogether :-).  Anyhow, I was nuking, and I wondered if it was/is better to dot for the more damage.  I know the rule of thumb is that if the mob lasts over 42 sec, DOT!! (the durration of our Poisoned Based DoTS)  I'm just wondering what the &quot;experianced&quot; adventurer's have to say (as well as anyone else of course).  Just on a side note, even though we lost, the crawl was a blast, we got good exp (half a yellow in 2 hrs.), good coin 300 pp each, and a good shoulder item as a roller.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sancha Delnocha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hmm I never had the mana to Dot or nuke on my shaman, shes got 244 wis too.  But with slows, cures and buffs and root parking, i'm always too LOM to dot.  <br />
  I think the collection ones are the hardest.  I've won one of those easily but the other 2 I tried we missed by a long shot.<br />
  Lately I've been going with the kill 55+ mobs in 90 minutes one, and won it each time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Emmhim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hello<br />
<br />
I have only been on 4 adventures so far, but from them my experience is: Nuke!<br />
The mobs die too fast for my DoTs to wear off, especially because the DoT's are not my first concern. First I have to use time on slowing the mob, and at that time it is often already down to 80%.<br />
<br />
If there are more mobs, and I have slowed them all, I start considering to drop a DoT. If one or the mobs has hardly been hurt yet, I use a DoT (if I am not too busy sitting or canni-dancing).<br />
<br />
<br />
Greetings Gukak Kluelezz</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vulgarr Disruptor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've been in some pretty wacky group compositions lately, sometimes up to 3 clerics for undead adventures, but we're 35-0. If you have a healer you trust, decent AA's, gear, and hps, etc... DoT like mad! <br />
<br />
I'll pull 2 or 3 mobs ahead of the group's %Target, stack 'em with DoT's and CC with damage shields till the group gets around to killing them. They're usually half dead before the melee even get around to targeting them. I might soak up a few more heals than standard, but we blow thru adventures in impressive times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Svarten</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">To be honest I don't think I loaded my 64 DD once since I got it...<br />

I try not to go uder 50% mana ever just in case, and hit canni5 as soon as it is up.<br />
<br />
Personaly I think Shaman DDs are to be placed on the last page in the book and never looked at, unless you are soloing some green camp and want to just rake off the PHs in a hurry.<br />
<br />
The DoTs on the other hand are good tool... Just drop a Bane or Blood of Saryrn on each mob as long as you have the mana.<br />
<br />
IMHO, LDoN adventures are about one thing only, Kill as many mobs as fast as possible, i.e. DPS, and the best way you can help with DPS in LDoN is FA on the melees and DoTs on the mobs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>kilokeo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">In most of my LDoN groups, the mob dies before Ana can even wear off.  So what I usually do after slowing and sending in pet is nuke once and cann a few times.  By then the mob is usually within a percent or two of death.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">depends on the DPS. If it's truly rockin', I just nuke.

<br />
In EQ, the first thing you should learn is that everything is situational.  There is no right answer for what you should do in every case.  Heck, I switch tactics with each mob sometimes.  Some people who haven't been playing for that long may find it hard to follow what I'm doing this time, but they get used to it after a while.  There IS a method to my madness, and a pattern, if rather erratic.  <br />
<br />
So, yah, I will do everything during the course of a group.  The one thing I don't do is lose.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I agree with Landragoran, whether to nuke, DoT or do neither is extremely situational.  It depends on your spells and equipment a great deal as well as the makeup of your group and the mobs your facing.  If you don&#8217;t have canni 5 and torpor, for example, you won&#8217;t have as much manna readily available as someone who has access to those.  And those with better gear will also have more manna available to them than those with lower end gear.  If your group is slicing through mobs like a hot knife through warm butter, as some of mine have done, then you don&#8217;t need to damage the mobs at all.  If your group&#8217;s progress is a bit slower you can toss in the occasional DD spell as manna permits.  Every bit of damage can help.  And if the mobs are really tough and your group just doesn&#8217;t have the DPS to take them down quickly then DoTing as much as manna permits can help speed things up.  <br />
<br />
From the sounds of it what you really need is more experience in the new adventures.  My guild group lost our fist two adventures because our old play style just didn&#8217;t work and we had to learn to adapt to the faster pace of the adventures.  The only time I&#8217;ve lost since then was when we got a couple of idiot melees in our group and they kept training the group.  Once you&#8217;ve gone on a few adventures you&#8217;ll get a feel for it and be able to adjust your play style accordingly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Collections can be rough (unlucky) and groups Im with now primarily wont take a collection adventure unless its around 20 pieces.<br />
<br />
I typically send in pet and nuke since there isnt much time because of my groups dps for dots to finish.  Dont have any problems at 65 nuking 1-2 times and doing the rest of my duties, although I have never had to be the main healer for an LDoN group yet.</div></div><hr />

Agree 100%.  Just tossing in that with a high-dps group, multi-mob pull, and no chanter, I'll dot the adds then go right back to nuking the current target.</div></div><hr />

Hi there,<br />
<br />
Well I feel for you if you are in gimped groups that are killin that slow. I have not memed a dot since LDON came out and I even did what I didn't think I would and bought the ornate gloves to help the poison nuke.  So, I have both spear and torrent loaded and with Improved Damage4 item and max aa I put out pretty good smack, fast casting and no wasted ticks. I would be amazed if I didn't do significantly more damage than the dots (my guess is 2x) and faster casting=safety.  And, I have to admit I like the eye candy of the crits, lol, this is a game.  NOTE: be careful with the rains,lol.<br />
<br />
Also, when I am only healer in a group I still am able every once in a while to blast out a spear when I have fm.  Don't discount fast casting spells, especially when you the healer.<br />
<br />
Oh, I agree 100% with FA on melee even though it is a pain.<br />
<br />

What kind of croud control do you have?  An enchanter?  Working pacify the entire way?  Or do you get 2 or 3 on your party and go to town? <br />
<br />
I've been in both situations.  I actually prefer the last.  Puller will end up with a couple, hit them with the AE slow, use DoTs and rains.  We had a druid who would snare everything and root it as it rotted, or else we would just let it beat on people.<br />

Donno if I would call my groups gimped we usualy finnish advantures in 25-30 minutes, the thing is...<br />
<br />
Bane - 490 Mana - 420 damage/6seconds (max 2100 in 30seconds)<br />
Spear of Torment - 275mana - 675 Damage<br />
<br />
You need 12 seconds to do 840 Damage with the DoT, during this time you can do other things like canni, if the you want to check damage per mana we can do that also... SoT=2.45 DpM, 3 hits with Bane is 2.57 DpM, if you mobs always die faster than 18seconds I would like to congratulate you on a job well done...<br />
<br />
Usualy our pulls are 3 mobs or so.. I slow the one tanks are on, turn to next slow it and then the thired, then dot bouth that the tanks are not on, and just tank them while I wait on the tanks to finish the mobs. This gives me plenty of time to Canni and such...<br />
<br />
But then again I am in a gimpy group that needs 25-30 mins to complete adventures ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The groups I put together tend to kill too fast to make DoTting worthwhile.  Since I can't stand waiting, as soon as we get EITHER a cleric, necro OR enchanter, I grab a bunch of DPS and we run in.<br />
<br />
This means that I might have time to throw out 4 nukes in the course of the dungeon (unless we landed a chanter - I don't buy KEI).  Usually, I'm keeping a steady stream of Q going - putting FA on everyone (including pets, if we have a mage for proc'ing toys - since it lasts almost 10 minutes with SCRM), and canni'ing.  If I can get in a nuke before the critter falls over, I consider myself lucky.  In most cases.<br />
<br />
I still want to try the AE slow method, but it's been so long since we had a cleric for a dungeon - I haven't been able to give it a go.</div></div><hr />

I really appreciate all the advice given, unfortunately I am only 56, so when I hear the term &quot;Q&quot; thrown out, I know it isn't going to help.  The only &quot;CC&quot; we had was Pacify, and Root Park.  I had KEI, so my tactic was to send puppy and slow,  sometimes the resists made that a full time job!:-(  I honestly hadn't thought of using the rain spell, when we have a pull of 2 or 3. (still a bit of a newb at some things I guess)</div></div><hr />

I typicaly have both Blood of Saryn and Vellium Strike memmed.  My groups normaly offtank adds (even my pet can offtank fine once a mob is slowed) so I DoT the adds.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">For my LDoN groups (lvl 64 shaman here, no ancient spells) I keep 2 slows up and chain them till all 4 mobs are slowed.  By then the first mob is 2/3 dead, one add is on me (the one I pull off of the cleric with slow and BoN) This is every quad pull (we pull 4 at a time fairly commonly).  I try to back off the pet and have it attack a caster mob, torpor myself, then usually toss a tnargs on the ranger/cleric/rogue (the necro can handle himself), then AE DD with ToS on the MA (usually hits 2 mobs that have solid aggro on the SK), refresh BoN on the mob beating on me and then cann4/5 like a good little shaman while the party mops up.  Usually from fom on quad pulls I'm only down 10-20% which I make up on the following single pulls.<br />
<br />
On single pulls it's slow, pet, ToS, and cann4/torpor till fom.<br />
<br />
My regular group doesn't pull LDoN very well (even with pacify), but we're pretty good at handling adds and mowing them down.  I enjoy off tanking LDoN mobs when slowed as they don't hurt me as fast as my 6 tick torpor heals me.</div></div><hr />

Maybe under the perfect situation with no crowd control and a slow killing group Bane might outdamage well placed nukes, maybe, not likely.  Anyway, with the slow recast of bane and with doted mob #1 on you its iffy that you can get off bane #2 in an efficient amount of time.<br />
<br />
Dont forget +13% crits, +1-20%from Enhanced damage4, +20% mana savings on spear. 4x hits from rains when mobs are packed together.<br />
All this with fast cast and virtually no agro.  <br />
<br />
Now when you throw crowd control into the equation enchanter/bard/mage(for summoned)/necro (undead) nukes rule.  I have about 100 adventures under my belt and I try to do the total zerg as much as I can, but I would say that well over half of the adventures have some sort of mezzer - thats just the way it is.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">At level 56 your options are a bit different than they are at 65.<br />
<br />
First, use your pet.  If you can afford it, pick up some proccing weapons for him in the bazaar or from your local mage.  If not, give him some of the &quot;fine steel&quot; weapons from the dungeon you are in.  Giving him weapons helps him out quite a bit.<br />
<br />
In terms of spells, you have a few choices.<br />
Bane of Nife - 1300ish dmg, 42 seconds, 425 mana, breaks root.<br />
Anathema - 1400ish dmg, 30 seconds, 440 mana, recast time.<br />
Torrent of Poison - 1620 dmg total on 3 waves, 380 mana, resist check each wave.<br />
Blast of Venom - 680 dmg, 340 mana, high mana cost, quick cast.<br />
Ice Strike - 650 dmg, 250 mana, long cast time.<br />
<br />
This is a very similar spell line up that we have at 65 as well.  The spell you want to use is going to depend on the agro management of your group, how long the mobs are living and personal preference.<br />
<br />
If mobs are living a long time and agro is not an issue, use one of your dots at your level.  Get the coldain military wristguard thing for Burning Affliction and use Bane of Nife!  If mobs are living a very short time and mana is not an issue consider using Blast of Venom, it's very quick casting.  If mobs have low poison resists and your evocation skill is good, using Torrent of Poison is an attractive option as well.  3 waves landing fully will give you more damage for less mana than any of your other options.<br />
<br />
At level 65, I choose to use nukes.  I use them for agro control and because my groups kill fast and chain pull.  I also use them because I have nuke AA, mana pres, improved damage and a bard thats playing rizlonas all the time.  In my groups I have 2 spell slots for damage.  Generally, I use those 2 slots for Velium Strike/Tears of Saryrn and Ferine Avatar.<br />
<br />
I almost exclusively do hard adventures.  Usually a monk tanking, otherwise it is a non-enraging blow equipped warrior. The monk and warriors do pretty well, but it is no where near the &quot;agro lock&quot; of knights.  We do not have the uber gear that can compensate for poor play so I have to be careful with my agro.  The mobs in hard adventures can and have taken half my life routinely in a single round (6000hp, 1275ac, LR5).  I cannot afford to waste my clerics mana healing me and a fast heal on me will likely have the mob turn on them...and deaths are the quickest way to lose an adventure.  <br />
<br />
The most mana efficient DPS I have is my pet.  Don't underestimate his contributions, especially the 61 pet.  Just give him a couple weapons and some haste and he will work hard for you.  :)<br />
<br />
and most importantly - NEVER DO COLLECTION MISSIONS!<br />
Poor drop rates can screw you out of a win, through no fault of your own.  I have not actually failed an adventure, but guild groups of mine who have lost adventures have lost almost all of them on collection.  One group estimated they would have to kill 140 mobs to collect the requested number of drops at the drop rate they were experiencing in their dungeon.  Consider the toughest slaughter mission we have received is 60 mobs.</div></div><hr />

That all seems like great advice, and I truly appreciate your taking my level into account. Just 2 questions..<br />
1) Is torrent of Poison a rain that can hit multiple targets, and if yes, will it hit my tank who is in melee?<br />
2) What is Amathema? Where do we get it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Skarxw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Im a beast but can help answer this ? for the shamans.. I dont think you guys should dot to much.. reason being i like to parse my fights. Over the past couple days ive been Mt in the group also. We are mostly guild groups whom have vt/ele gear. At least ornate if not.  Anyways back to point I parsed my fights and out of 8mission in ldon the avg fight time was 41sec... So at most the new curse dot or  a fast posion dot. <br />
Many many fights where well under 30sec.. I think myavg came out so high from haveing like 5+pulls and mobs mezzed. They would just set ther makeing my timer on them go up up and forceing my avg time per mob to jump a bit.</div></div><hr />

The new LDON dots seem like they are well suited for this type of killfest though, since they are short duration dots.<br />

<br />
Why are you handicapping yourself like that? You're hurting your group when you refuse to get such an easy mana regen tool...it's not like there are no enchanters laying around the camps.<br />
<br />
As for your rule of thumb Shandrillar, &quot;if the mob lasts over 42 sec, DOT!!&quot;, I have a new one for you: If you are in a normal(ie not kite or all caster etc) group, and have a dot memmed, you are wrong. This is especially true with LDoN. <br />
<br />
There is no dot that you could ever convince me to mem outside of soloing or when i want aggro with a nonconventional group. Nukes are more damaging, and more importantly low aggro and fast.</div></div><hr />

Help me out here, per cast: DoT's do more damage for the manna, than a poison or cold nuke (am I correct?)  Now I understand the idea that I can get 3 or 4 nukes off in the time that it takes my DoT to run its course, and that I will have delt out more DPS that way, but assuming that I am also slowing, and side healing, when am I supposed to canni-up my manna for the next MoB if I chain nuke?<br />
Please bear in mind that I am talking about the type of group where we are pretty much racing through the dungeon and don&quot;t have much time in-between MoBs.</div></div><hr />

For LDoN you want to do a few things Get a KEI..(oops yes I said the K word) reason being is at our level Canni3 and stoicsm aint the best dance in the world and in the fast paced LDoN adventures mana = all. Also get the highest HP buff HoV or PoT9 and Symbol of K. Buy Infusion of Spirit and Tali Kragg if you haven't already these will stack with you dex str and sta buffs for max stats and HP &lt; mana during buff time. Buff time : you have 30mins to get to the adventure USE IT buff the party starting with MT and then HoS and Sta on casters. This will allow them to take a few more punches if the draw aggro. <br />
     Now once inside make sure you have Slow canni Stoicsm chloro root and dots (and/or haste if no chanter bard) . Pull...slow everything 1st if it resists recast once then move to second target, reason being is that after 90%health or so slow will land on primary, especailly if you have other casters/tash/bards. if you pull 3 or 4 at a time slow all, then root park one, then pick an add and get in it's face and DoT, You have HP and AC for a reason, sic scooby on it too. Bane of Nife and Ebolt seem to be resisted less at our level than the Disease based DoTs. This method allows for MT and casters to kill one, maybe 2 if ther other is off-tanked as well. You, puppy and DoT's will easilly hold agro from anyone but MT and do a considerable amount of Dmg at the same time. I've even gone as far as managing to get amob to 3% b4 the other 3 were killed and my Primary melee weapon is a Club of the Ice Ocean ( hehe 255 dex w/ rage and buff means 3 procs min during a fight and 149dmg is 149dmg).<br />
    So Tank adds, Dots adds, sic scooby on adds canni wihle they pull and if singles slow then canni, cause when you need to deal with the adds and believe me in LDoN you will even with pacify it happens, you'll have the mana and the HP to solo one and still be able to do what you need to to slow and haste and whatever else you can think of. Nukes may sound good at 65 but for those of us below 60 our nukes get resisted or just aren't mana efficient enuff to be worth the trouble in a timed event. BTW I have no JBB, no Epic, but I do have HP and Slow and that's all ya really need. Hope this helps and My apoligies if it's a tad long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Help me out here, per cast: DoT's do more damage for the manna, than a poison or cold nuke (am I correct?) <br />
<br />
<br />
Instead of looking at it per cast look at it in terms of damage/mana where mana=Mana spent on nuke and or mana spent healing you. That's where the benefit to nukes become clear. Toss on a mage bracer and earring and even the overaggro requiring heals isn't needed to get better mana/damage ratio off of nuking. If you're arguing the heals don't matter because of mana regen then you'd be able to cast another dd instead of that heal and kill faster yet.<br />
<br />
Dots are useful, just very situational, and normal exp groups are not the situation for them.</div></div><hr />

Hmm... It seems that a lot of your argument is based on the idea that casting a dot will draw agro off of the tank and onto yourself thus requiring a self heal... correct?  If so I disagree.  With some tanks agro may be an issue, but not with all -at least once we get to know each others styles.<br />
<br />
If this is not the basis of your assertion... then I am still inclined to disagree.  If a mob lives long enough for my dot to run, then I can dot the mob swap targets to the tank heal him, recast haste/etc, and still do full damage from the dot.  If I were nuking, iIwould nuke, heal tank, recast haste/etc, and only have done the one nukes worth of damage.<br />
<br />
In general tho, most mobs (in a group situation) dont live long enough to dot.  I believe that was the reason for the Bane line of DoTs -shorter duration DoTs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Kumble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I have a bigass mana pool. So it helps me a lot on doing dps. I cant remember the last time i ran out of mana. I have FT9, MC3, SCM3, and Canni5. I have mana pres IV item and I have a cloak of Combustion from PoFire its 35% bonus to ice nukes. I can nuke for over 1200 w/o scf. I usually keep my nuke memmed and spam it on whatever we are fighting. If we get several adds I click my ornate legs. then i sit and mem my dots while my group is fighting. I have them saved in a spell set. Bust out Blood, Scourge, Bane of Nife and Ebolt. I put these on all the adds. Once they are all rooted and dotted I hit mass canni and just spam canni 4 until the dots start breaking.  Theyve usually killed one by the time the first set of dots wear off. The mob they move to i leave alone and redot the others as they wear off and repeat this. I can usually solo several mobs before my group kills 2 or 3. I dot adds, i nuke when we have no adds. DoTs are very mana efficient, yes, but if they kill the mob before the dot wears off it ruins the mana/dmg efficiency ratio. If you wanna avoid this crap of doing dmg entirely. Make a group: Shaman, rogue, rogue, ranger, ranger, beastlord(to tank, if you dont know a beastlord who can tank, get a war/pal/sk). The group is sick, healing is easy, I can do assasinations or X slaughter in under 30mins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">If you're waiting long enough to let the tank keep aggro there is no way your dot will do full damage.<br />

<br />
<br />
Bane line are the worst dots out of them all. What point is there in memming a dot you can only keep on one mob at a time, and if you get a resist you have a 30 second recast? Even the argument for rotting adds falls apart with it. Waste of a spell slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">1) Is torrent of Poison a rain that can hit multiple targets, and if yes, will it hit my tank who is in melee?<br />
Yes, it is a rain and can hit multiple targets.  General rule of thumb is that it gives up to 3 waves on a single target and up to 4 total waves on multiple targets.  At least that is my experience.  If you have 4 mobs, it will hit each of them once.  If you have 2 mobs, it will hit each of them twice.  If you have one mob, it will hit it 3 times.  I am sure someone else has an experience that is different but thats how it usually happens for me.  <br />
<br />
On non-pvp servers rain spells do not hit other player characters except yourself, so stand back!  :)  <br />
<br />
<br />
2) What is Amathema? Where do we get it?<br />
Anathema (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=4094&amp;source=Live) is one of the new dots in our new line from LDON.  Rather than a disease or poison dot, it is a magic based dot that adds curse counters, making it require remove curse to cure.  It is slightly shorter in duration than our poison dots and has a 24 second recast time.  You can buy it at LDON adventure merchants with adventure points.  See this thread for details: LDON Spell List (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=16362).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Seichan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Tears of Saryrn..in my opinion, this is your best bet for efficient DPS in LDoN.  Of course, if you're mezzing mobs fairly close together, just worry about slowing and then maybe toss a nuke of your choice on your MT's target.  In a group that you're pulling multiple or mass amounts, you as a Shaman should not be more than passingly concerened about your DPS output, stick to what your main role mostly ;&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Donno if I would call my groups gimped we usualy finnish advantures in 25-30 minutes, the thing is...<br />
<br />
Bane - 490 Mana - 420 damage/6seconds (max 2100 in 30seconds)<br />
Spear of Torment - 275mana - 675 Damage<br />
<br />
You need 12 seconds to do 840 Damage with the DoT, during this time you can do other things like canni, if the you want to check damage per mana we can do that also... SoT=2.45 DpM, 3 hits with Bane is 2.57 DpM, if you mobs always die faster than 18seconds I would like to congratulate you on a job well done...<br />
<br />
Usualy our pulls are 3 mobs or so.. I slow the one tanks are on, turn to next slow it and then the thired, then dot bouth that the tanks are not on, and just tank them while I wait on the tanks to finish the mobs. This gives me plenty of time to Canni and such...<br />
<br />
But then again I am in a gimpy group that needs 25-30 mins to complete adventures ;)<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
<br />
<br />
But who uses spear over strike?   :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Padraic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Collections can be rough (unlucky) and groups Im with now primarily wont take a collection adventure unless its around 20 pieces.<br />
<br />
I typically send in pet and nuke since there isnt much time because of my groups dps for dots to finish.  Dont have any problems at 65 nuking 1-2 times and doing the rest of my duties, although I have never had to be the main healer for an LDoN group yet.<br />
<br />
<br />
I would like to point out.  There seems to be problems with the drop rates on collections.  We never ever fail with 25 plus collections.  We usually finish up with 30 minutes to spare.  But, we have won a 23 or less collection yet.  You almost have to wipe out the entire zone for those.  And dont usually have the mana for that.<br />
<br />
Stay away from the low collections, and stay with the high, and you should be fine</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Galamann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">When i setup my adventure groups, i try and not get mezzers. I usually take care of mobs by ATing them with blood of saryn so when we finnally kil it, the mob is at 75-80.  I usually add in dds here and there and mobs die wicked fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">It all depends on the kind of group you have.  If you have a lower lvl group that kills slow, dots would work well.  <br />
But if you have a group that kills fast with multiple mobs, Dots would be totally useless.  This is when you use AE slow and rain.<br />
 With multiple mobs, rain is alot more efficient then our dots will ever be, assuming that you have the AA in critical blast.<br />
<br />
 Blood of saryrn<br />
 You have hit a target, for 650 POINTS of damage.<br />
 You have hit a target, for 650 POINTS of damage.<br />
 You have hit a target, for 1300 POINTS of damage.<br />
 You have perfomed a critical blast (1300)<br />
 You have hit a target, for 650 POINTS of damage.<br />
  <br />
mana 450 / dmg 3150<br />

And doesnt agro nearly as much as dots will.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You may have a point there.  I dont have bane yet, although I did use it in the beta. The recast delay bugged me a lot on a resist, but I didnt really run into a lot of situations where I wanted to dot several mobs at once.  In LDON adventures I typicaly see one or two adds.  I dot the adds, after slowing them and Qing the tanks.  If there are enough mobs that I wanted to dot more than one, I would probably be too busy to dot them :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Oh btw I use spear over strike in LDON normal.  I have ornate gloves so that evens up the damage ratios.  The casting speed of spear allows me to more efficiently use the rains (the real damage spell) since I can time the casting of tears of Saryrn better.  Also, fast cast allows me to finish a nuke when I need to do a quick heal where I would have to abort the strike cast.  Additionally I am able do a bonus canny every once in a while near the end of a fight or waiting for tears refresh that would not be possible with strike.<br />
<br />
Don't discount the fast cast, it will make you a better (quicker reacting)shaman.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Ragathor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I personally LOVE to DOT the hell out of mobs in LDoN.  F Chanters!!!  I am usually the puller in most groups I am in and I pull with slow.  I get really excited when 4 mobs come in and the chanter starts to mez.  I tell them only mez if there are 5 or more mobs because they will all be dotted.  I have Elem pants so that helps a lot. :)  After I have slowed them all I pick one and etll group to grab him last and drop Bane,Blood Odium Anathem(sp) on it.  I have already clicked pants on all the others and I start to put Blood on the rest of them.  I blow through mana fast but most adventures I have been in only last about 30 minutes or so.  Slaughter is still my favorite.  <br />
<br />
I put all my FT gear on and sit at FT15.  If you dont have mad mana regen you cant really go nuts like this.  We are a Time capable guild so DPS is not an issue nor is HP on our casters.  Nothing beats having 5 in camp or so and by the time they get to the last mob (im pulling again btw), it only has 20% life left or less.  In addition its an easy way to get people to follow you when the mob takes off after you as well.  If its a pickup group I dont go so crazy and I seem to nuke more.<br />
<br />
Also, I drink the Poison Awareness IV potion as well as the Magic Awareness IV one.  I seem to be able to keep mana up a lot better with these potions.</div></div><hr />
