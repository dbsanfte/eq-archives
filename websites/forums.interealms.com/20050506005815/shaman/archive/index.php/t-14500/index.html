<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kashale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, level 59 was horrible with, what I presume was an experience penalty of some kind.  Then I dinged 60 and the experience flowed.  Now I am 61 and it is as if I am back at level 59.  This is all very frustrating but it was expected.<br />
<br />
My question is, does level 62 go faster (all things being equal) or are all the levels from here on out going to be worse than the previous one?  I am at the point where I am trying to decide when I should grind my AA's.  I have read all the posts about doing it at 60, 61 or waiting till 65.  If there is some sort of experience penalty at 61 (where I am now) if I ding 62 and then do some AA-ing will it go faster?  I have 20 more AA's to get for Canni 5 and don't want to grind those out in a level that has some sort of penalty.<br />
<br />
Any info is appreciated :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There's no penaly for those levels it's just a left over from the old hell levels.   The amount of exp for level 60 is approx 1/2 the total of exp for level 59 so it just seemed to fly by.  When they evened out the hell levels they spread it out over 52 - 59 and then evened it out again, this time adding some of it to 60 but the exp for 60 is still far less than the other levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lesiter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Depends on where you hunt I guess..<br />
<br />
61 and 62 go at about the same rate if you kill in PoN/PoD.  63 takes longer in PoN/PoD because the mobs don't fall within the &quot;mobs within 5 levels of you give better exp&quot; category.  62/63 in PoV goes pretty fast because the mobs are level 62 or 63.  64 slows down on the desert mobs in PoV, but the inner and outer caves are even -&gt; dark blue cons.<br />
<br />
This is from a warrior's point of view though, so I never did zones that I couldn't tank effectively in, ie. taunt doesn't work on red cons.  I'd imagine a 61/62 shaman would get wonderful exp in BoT or Tactics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">61+ each level takes more xp than the previous.  Where you hunt and how good your group is will determine how fast 61-65 goes.  Stay in Tier 1 zones and you can make it all the way to 65, but it'll be a longer crawl than if you moved up to harder zones/mobs to keep your xp targets within the 5 level sweet spot.  No brainer that a better group will get you better xp heh.  The old mentality of killing as many of the easiest dark blue cons doesn't work post 60.  You need to take on the harder mobs that are near your level.  The difference is quite noticeable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gummey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just wait til you hit level 64.<br />
<br />
It will give a whole new meaning to the word hell level for you!! :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Heh I just did 64 with my cleric. It sucked ass as my shaman when I was stuck to pos/pov mostly and my friends weren't as high level either, but I got my cleric through 64 in two days in BoT with high dps groups. <br />
<br />
As far as AA goes my bro is doing his at 60, my wife is doing her mages at 61, I kept my cleric at 62 for a long time to do some, and all of my shaman's aa has been done at 65.<br />
<br />
In Plane of Storms anyone 60-63 gets AA at about the same rate (lvl 58 mobs) which is very very good, but it sucks badly for anyone thats 64-65. <br />
<br />
Plane of Valor most of the mobs are 62+ and are good all the way to 65. Problem is its small and theres not enough to go around. Still some of the better AA for all concerned.<br />
<br />
BoT mobs are 62+ and are very good AA, however people 60-63 will actually get better AA someplace like Plane of Storms because the mobs die twice as fast. <br />
<br />
Tactics pit is good exp all around (lvl 60-63 mobs), however like BoT 60-63's may get better exp in PoS if you can keep a steady stream of kills going.</div></div><hr />

Hey, thanks for this good info.  As someone who is not entirely familiar with the various PoP zones this is a good guide to go by.  I Finished up level 60 in PoV doing regular exp and it was, hands down, the best experience I have ever encountered.  I can only imaging how fast AA's would rack up in that zone.<br />
<br />
So if I am to understand the responses above, there are no specific level related   experience penalties only those incurred by fighting mobs that are more than 5 levels below yours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">PoP zems are so insane that 61+ levels are cake.  You can do 61 to 65 in a 4 day weekend if you had the desire.  Exp-number wise, they're probably quite a bit higher than previous levels, but since you're gaining 4x more exp per mob (especially with the group bonuses in effect now), it's cake.  1 good day in pov / bot / potactics should get you through 64.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hell levels my ass! HAH, folks think leveling 60-65 is tough, christ. Noobs! The lot of ya! <br />
<br />
Back in my day........ ;)<br />
<br />
No really, the upper levels are cake compared to what 59 used to be. Good exp in 59 used to be ONE blue per 1 1/2 - 2 hours in chardok. It took me over a month to level from 59-60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">My sha at lvl 60 in a group with 5 65's got 3% per kill in bastion at full AA. The rest of us got 2% a kill in full AA. Now considering I don't have primal avatar for her we decided to scoot to 65 then work can5, as the aa gain diff didn't justifiy the resist spread of being 60 with 65's.. and I want ferine asap ;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">As a shaman if you have access to the 65 spells theres no reason not to level, if you don't then you can take your time. The 65 spells are just that good imo. <br />
<br />
Most people should at least have minimal access now that anyone can get into BoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Hamenu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">This is an article that explains how the old hell levels work. Essentially, there is a modifier that changes periodically. As of late, EQ has made that modifier &quot;less abrupt&quot; than it used to be to smooth out the levels.<br />
<br />
http://www.archofchaos.com/article.asp?item=7<br />
<br />
(Please note, there's a lot of stuff in this article that is no longer true, but many of the principles remain the same).<br />
<br />
As an FYI, when they first attempted to smooth out the hell levels in the 50's, they actually hid some of the xp that used to be required for level 60, IN level 60. This caused people's xp bars to move slower than what they were used to (this was just before PoP came out). There was lots of complaining about this, so they stuck that xp back into the 50's, and level 60 remains 25% of a &quot;standard&quot; level.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Correct.<br />
<br />
Fighting in PoP zones post 60 levels fly by so fast its insane.  I am one of those people who levels slowly.  I go do quests, or hang out with lower level friends, I dont just get online and immediately get in a good group... I blew thru 60-65 in less time than I spent at level 59.</div></div><hr />
