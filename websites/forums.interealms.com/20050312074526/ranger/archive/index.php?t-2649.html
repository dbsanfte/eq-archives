<br />
I mean what would it really take? Adding another 12 or so AC to WP?<br />
<br />
If VI can find the time to upgrade almost every high end SoL Piercer in the game why cant they.. hmmmm don't answer that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's code not voodoo magic, they can change anything they want. Make it so nothing overwrites it, pretty simple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Loga</div><div class="date">05-08-2002, 10:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I franly don't have a problem with stacking being an issue.  If a high level buff should overwrite it then make ti so it can, even WP.  But I think it is crazy that a low level DS or an equal level, less powerful, buff can undo ours.  The penalty taken is too great.<br />
<br />
I also firmly believe that a buff of this nature needs to be handled as they hold other buffs at this level of play.<br />
<br />
As it stands, what, I have to worry about my own buffs overwriting it, the paladin buff overwriting it, any druid ds overwriting it, any magi ds overwriting it, shadowknight (and necro?) buff overwriting it, and finally mobs atk debuffs removing it.  What other class has this same level of problem?<br />
<br />
I can see verant making a mob overwrite cop from a mob debuff but to take off my whole slew of increases in one buff?  I don't think so.<br />
<br />
If they insist on keeping it this way then there should be equal treatment of the other classes.  I'm not saying nerf I'm just pointing out how angrily people would react if the notion were to even remotely be brought up.</div></div><hr />

Now *that's* a good line. :-D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seriously, how do you recommend they fix it? Throw a special code into the spell stacking check function that does:<br />
If WP then<br />
   Spell wont take hold on target<br />
?</div></div><hr />

<br />
oh, and it should be targetable and nothing should override it.  stuff should stack, or not, but nothing should override our &quot;ultimate&quot; buff spell.</div></div><hr />
