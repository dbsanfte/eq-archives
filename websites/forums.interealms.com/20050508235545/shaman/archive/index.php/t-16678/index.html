<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jorgan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Our guild has been comfortably clearing NToV for the past few weeks, working on ST keys, talking about starting the camps for the emp key in SRAA, and eventually making its way into VT.  The end goal is to make it into the elemental plains and I'm sure most have visions of eventually entering PoTime.<br />
<br />
Even before LDoN there was a lot of discussion about whether it was a better or worse idea to follow that line of progression or skip VT (and possibly Sraa) altogether and just try to gear up through PoP to get to and through the elemental planes.  Some of the considerations leading guilds in this direction was the massive competition for Sraa mobs and even VT.  <br />
<br />
Assuming that the goal is to get to the elemental planes and time, and with the kinds of equipment that you could gear your guild with from LDoN merchants, would you still want your guild to go the Sraa and VT route to get to elementals and time?  Or would it you rather gear up through LDoN missions.<br />
<br />
I know that LDoN equipment, even fully augmented, is NOT at the level of VT loot, but it's pretty damn close.  (See http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=16660 for a sample of what's possible for shamans.)  The advantages to bypassing Sraa and VT that I see are: (1) People will actually get a lot of xp going through LDoN, and get a lot of really useful AAs.  (2) The adventures are actually fun, and even after the 100th adventure, they will probably still be more fun than camping shards.  (3) Avoids the timesinks of camping shards, pieces for bane weapons, emp key.  (4) Avoids the sometimes nasty inter-guild competition for mobs in Sraa and VT.  (5) For individual members, the certainty that you can pick the equipment most needed and most useful for you.  (6) Avoids the uncertainty of spawn times, contested mobs--LDoN adventures are always available, Sraa and VT mobs aren't--particularly for an EST guild that has a four-six hour raid window each night.<br />
<br />
The disadvantages of gearing up through LDoN:  (1) No raid experience and refinement of encounter strategies that you get by actually raiding.  (2) Possible loss of cohesion as a guild if everyone is either doing their own thing in LDoN or even just grouping.  (3) Never getting to experience what Sraa and VT are like.  (Or is this an advantage?)  (4)  Not being able to get some really exceptional equipment.  (5)  Will not get any status or reputation points from prospective applicants who value going through Sraa and VT.  <br />
<br />
I'm sure there are other advantages and disadvantages that I'm not seeing at the moment.  Those are the ones that I see right now.  I also realize that it would take a significant amount of time to gear up through LDoN.  I'm not sure if it would take a longer or shorter amount of time.<br />
<br />
So, again, assuming the &quot;end&quot; goal is getting to Time, and if you had it all over to do, or even if your guild is in a similar situation as ours, which would you do, and why?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would take a look at the situation on your particular server to make that decision. If VT is uncontested, then go VT. I think it will be less time to gear up. If VT is contested, you could spend a month or two keying up then not seeing any loot for 3 months.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Phatcow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">thumbs down to VT =)  Kill the Seru dude much easier and suppliment with LDoN .. BUT Make sure you try to get SSRA mobs which is great stuff and good learing for a post NToV guild(maybe thats why peopledo VT).  I think VT is a huge distraction and time sink.  The Emp can be zerged and with my last guild we were jumped like 10 times in a row by lessor guilds who had people on at the time.  I dont know why people have VT as a stopping point to Time.  One of the top 3 guilds in my server who is time enabled never went to VT.  Sure its a route and any raid training on uber mobs is good .. just not sure how mandatory.  Oh and BTW VT is just like NToV so its either up or not and your fighting for it like the other guilds your lvl .. depending on your server that is.  On Bristlebane everything is a challenged because there so many high lvl guilds =)  You might be better off in tier 2+ PoP mobs and save 3 months of your guilds life for a few days a month in the highly contested zone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It depends entirely on your competition for the zone.  My guild decided to go the VT route, and it bit us in the ass because by the time we finally go keyed, there were three euro guilds that farmed it constantly.  All nameds died on patch day before we even woke up, and over the months we have only gotten a handful of kills.  We're in EPs now, and so are those 3 euros guilds, but the spawn timer isn't so horribly biased towards euros in EPs, and we are getting our fair of kills.  So, for us, VT was pretty much a waste of time.<br />
<br />
However, now that those three euro guilds are out of VT (except for the occasional AHR kill), it is pretty much empty and nameds actually stay up until north american raid times.  There is an american guild on my server that recently killed emp, and they are having a ball in VT and getting plenty of kills and loot.<br />
<br />
So basically, don't bother with VT if there are euros guilds on your server than look like they are going to be farming it for a while.  If you can farm it, do so.  There is lots of really awesome gear that does rival stuff in the EP's.  Especially important is an abundance of flowing thought gear in VT, whereas FT is kind of lacking in the EP's.  My FT has dropped from 15 to 11 because I am upgrading my &quot;bad stats but has FT&quot; gear with really awesome stats gear, but there is just no FT gear dropping (at least for priests.  We had 3 FT items for hybrids drop yesterday /sigh).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It depends on the competition, like everyone has said.  If VT is mostly empty, or if you are a European or early-EST guild (high school/college guilds primarily), then go for it.  You cannot beat the upgrades per time spent that Ssra/VT gives you.  If you aren't, those timesinks are probably not worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My guild is a step or two behind yours.  Our server has rotations so we're in the process of qualifying to join the NToV rotation.  So it remains to be seen whether we can &quot;comfortably clear&quot; it, although I know we'll at least make a good showing while we get the hang of it.<br />
<br />
That said, we're also informally working on VT too.  Some of us have started hanging out in Ssra, collecting the various key drops, and inviting others to come join when there are openings.  We have a fair number of casual players, so these things tend to take time, but we'll get there eventually.  But I know that our more goal oriented folks definitely want to include VT in our progress.  That may be just that it never occurred to them, but I think it is mainly simply wanting to see it for the experience and the accomplishment.  I would oppose any movement to skip VT.  As a casual player in a guild that is friendly to casual players, I am never going to &quot;catch up&quot; anyway.  The rate of expansions has seen to that.  I'm not going to let any need to keep up with the Jones stop me from experiencing that milestone.  <br />
<br />
We're also working through PoP right now, taking on bosses every now and then and sometimes winning.  Depending on how structured you guys have things, it may be possible to do both as well.  We very rarely have the numbers to zerg anything, so I know that we'll be able to put VT gear to good use when the time comes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>wyrdrune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Since on our server VT was basically empty, one guild focused heavily on VT and it worked very well for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My guild just took the plunge and keyed a large raid force for VT.  I would say it was definately worth it for us, and not just for the gear.<br />
<br />
*) Shard farming was a PITA, but it pulled people together.  If you want to learn who you can count on, take a look at who's still helping after they have their 10 shards.<br />
<br />
*) We learned a lot on the Ssra mobs that helped us defeat the Emperor.  And in turn I'm sure that experience will help us when we turn to POP.<br />
<br />
*) The gear really is outstanding.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying you MUST go this route, but I feel like we have improved ourselves as players and as a guild enough that the trip was worthwhile.<br />
<br />
FYI it took us from April to July to get 70+ people keyed for Emp Ssra, and another month to get all of them (plus a few stragglers) VT keyed.  We probably could have tackled Emp with fewer, but we agreed on a cutoff date and stuck to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">absolutely.  VT &gt; anything else.  on the other hand, dont ignore the other options.<br />
<br />
With a month of raiding, most guilds will have their fill of NTOV gear, you will find it rotting more often than not.  If you have sleepers keys, at least kill the first 2 nameds for a few easy primals whenever they spawn.<br />
<br />
Set up guild events to farm emperor keys.  They are nice rings even ignoring the key value.  One or two groups in each area and just kill kill kill... rotate people around as they get pieces.  Its not as bad as you hear.  Even at 65 these mobs give experience.  While you are farming key parts be aware of named spawns, and jump on them as they happen.<br />
<br />
VT shards are mostly greenie farms.  As a 65 shaman, I was able to solo every shard except the deep and ssraa.  I completed a shard per night by putting an hour or two into it after my guild raids were done.  Literaly 2 weeks from start to finish.  The only real bottleneck was the Maidens Eye shard... the drop rate is low.  Find a way to encourage or reward members as they progress on their keys and it will go fast -if you are a dkp guild, consider giving dkp for shard farms.<br />
<br />
Here is the key to surviving this project: do other stuff too.  Go ahead and kill the PoP mobs.  Plan on making progress there at the same time.  You should be able to reach elemental planes without VT gear, but its hard.  Getting thru elemental planes without VT level gear is the really rough part.  But hopefully by the time you reach elemental you will also be into VT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If you are not going to get kicked out or blocked by guilds with advantageous timezones then go for it.  I would actually get keyed anyway because one odd patch or server down can set things right for you.<br />
<br />
The focus effects and resists on VT items are pretty much going to rival anything you will get until you hit the Elemental planes/Time and will not be quickly replaced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Gearing up on Luclin bosses alone (seru, shei, xtc, high priest, etc) would be faster than LDoN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>corlathist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Absolutely work toward VT.<br />
<br />
First, you need to dominate SSRA both for spawns to learn CC like High Priest, etc.  And also for the upgrades.  FT6 Shields will not be replaced for a long long time.  Cursed BPs wont be replaced outside Vex Thall or Time either.<br />
<br />
Now the bonus to working on Emp Key camps, is that you have your whole guild in SSRA dominating all the camps.  Boss spawns.  You all gather quick and take it out.  Its very easy when you have 30 to 60 already in zone working on keys and insiginas to get every boss there.<br />
<br />
Then comes Emp.  Emp loot is irreplacable till time.  Caens is not beatable for monks to Time.  Priest Shoulders/Int Robes are not beatable outside time.  Other loot is good.<br />
<br />
Then VT.  VT is done for simple gearing up purposes.  1 Raid a week will net you 25 to 30 loots.  You will not find comparable loot per time anywhere outside NTOV.  Its basically NTOV2.<br />
<br />
I honestly wish our guild stayed in VT longer than it did.  We moved to EP soon as we took out RZ.  After maybe 7 or so VT clearings.  Not enough for my tastes.  But it depends on guild.   One of the hardest decisions to make is when to leave an area like NTOV, or VT.<br />
<br />
Truth is you need SSRA more than VT I think.  Taking Emp is bonus to gear up while you are already dominating SSRA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Why the heck would you work to content thats high end 3 expansions ago when you can advance in newer expansions?<br />
<br />
Sounds pretty dumb to me... if you are just starting out, you should be taking the route of gearing up on droppable gear and zerging down POP targets...after 2-3 months of this (as the lower 1-3 tier targets are probably pretty uncontested atm) then you are well enough equipped to try harder targets and with the gear after 2 months on that you can get to elemental planes.<br />
<br />
<br />
After elemental planes, you would be getting loot in high quantity which even the ****tiest is superior to most VT loots. <br />
<br />
<br />
LDON is an even worse idea as it takes a hell of a long time to get points, and you are doing nothing as a guild together like raiding. If your end goal is time, learning raid encounters would be important and therefore my above mentioned method would be good as alot of lower tier fights are in a sense repeated higher.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ebonfang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">PoP made vt completely optional.  Our guild skipped vt because of reason i dont care to get into atm.  We chose to concentrate 100 percent on PoP and after months of hard work, we are farming ele planes.  You dont HAVE to go through VT to get to uber land.  But it will make the transition to ele/time easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>lordkaldron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If it were my choice I'd skip VT entirely. The time sink is just far too great. From camping for Emp keys, to VT shard camping, to the fact that even once you can go to VT raids are going to take upwards of 10-12 hours -- insanity!<br />
<br />
Seems much more fun to farm pop targets and (given the option now)enjoy LDoN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">VT is worth it.  It's a loot candy land.  It's worth the hassle of shard pharming.  Do cursed cycle every time it's up and you'll get plenty of orbs.  Shard pharming isn't really that bad.  If you are determined, it should only take you a week at most to go from zero shards to 10 shards.  As for me, I usually got 3 or 4 shards a day when camping it because I used non-traditional methods.  As a result, I was done with my key quite fast and was looting nice stuff in VT fast as well.  Every patch brings VT down and resets it.  Every patch means 15 more loot dropping bossmobs dropping an avg of 3 loots a piece, so 45 loots per guild per clearing.  Where else can you get that kind of return on your day of raiding?  Nowhere.  People say that Elemental gear and beyond is much better.  This is true, however a bunch of less good items from VT (many of which have neat effects) beat only one really good item from PoP.  If you guild wants to get uber fast, VT is the best source of loot.  Elemental loot is not plentiful, and requires much much much more talent to achieve than VT loot.  Not to mention it's highly competed for among the guilds in the eles.  VT is a lot easier to get a hold of than randomly popping bossmobs in the planes.  <br />
<br />
That said, if I were leading a guild we'd get our VT keys asap, leave NToV alone, and get ST keys/primals pounded out.  Ntov gear mostly doesn't have good hps, but VT gear does, so does ssra gear for the most part.  We'd live in Ssra until Emp died, and then kill Emp and other boss mobs in there until we got tired of it.  Good loot to be had in Ssra.  Kael mobs too, AoW, KT, Statue all good to kill. <br />
<br />
Yep, leave NToV alone, and head to Ssra.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Before writing off VT entirely for PoP there is one more thing that you really need to understand:<br />
<br />
THE ELEMENTAL PLANES ARE GETTING CROWDED AND THERE ARE NO LONGER A GLUT OF SPAWNS TO HIT!!!<br />
<br />
By the time your guild fights it's way into the mentals, it is very probable that you will have a very limited number of targets to hit UNLESS you live in an advantageous timezone.  Most of PoF and PoW can be locked down by a single guild with minimal effort and Air/Earth rings are not going to yield up a named everytime either with other guilds popping away at them.  Granted, this all depends on your server makeup, but I am guessing that if you are just now eyeballing the Elemental planes from NToV, there will likely be little room for you once there.<br />
<br />
Once VT is done, it is done and it gives you an option when there is little else available.  Look at the loot/focus effects and decide for yourself if it really is worth skipping.  After a few turns there, with some well-placed CoH mages, you can waltz through VT in 6 hours and come out with a nice haul of upgrades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I would still absolutely go the VT route.<br />
Here are my reasons why:<br />
1.  Focus effects.  There are soooo many focus effects that you can get in VT.  If you try going straight for Elemental Planes, or if you gear up in LDON, you flat out will not get nearly as many focus effects on your armor as if you stop in VT first.  You can get all sorts of improved damage, burning affliction, spell haste, extended range, and mana preservation types of effects in VT (but have different names for whatever reason).<br />
2.  Flowing Thought.  VT is packed with flowing thought items.  There's the ft4 belt, 2 different ft4 cloaks, ft2 floating rune, all sorts of ft items from AHR including the awesome neck, ft1 mark of judgement, and whatever else I haven't remembered.<br />
3.  Ancient spells.  For some classes, if you have your level 65 spells, the ancient spells are unnecessary.  For other classes, you will use your ancient spells anyway.  I know that when I'm trying to go for fast damage, I use both the 65 poison dot and the ancient 60 poison dot.  I know some other classes still get a good amount of use out of their 60 spells too.<br />
4.  Relative ease of acquiring loot.  Once you know your way around VT fairly well, getting loot there is sooooo easy.  The named mobs hit from 600-about 1400?  You have simple cheal rotations for many of the named mobs.  You can slow the mobs that don't allow for cheal rotations.  When you compare this to the difficulty of say killing Bertox or Mith Marr for comparable loot, it's a breeze.  AE rampage is a nightmare to learn to deal with.  Mobs that hit for 2000 a pop and have AEs that really HURT are rough.  If I was wanting to settle into &quot;loot farm mode&quot;, I'd want the easy fights and not the hard ones.<br />
5.  Time investment vs reward.<br />
-When you raid stuff in POP before ele planes like Bertox or Mith Marr or Saryrn or Carpin, you are looking at doing about 2-4 hours worth of fighting (plus travel time) for about 3 pieces of loot on average.  Those are hard fights.  You need at least 60 people on each of those raids if you don't have VT gear in the first place and are gearing up off them.  60 people * 3 hours on average = 180 man hours for 3 pieces of loot which equates to about 60 man hours of work for a piece of loot.<br />
-When you go to VT with those 60 people, you come back with about 30 new pieces of gear off the named, not to mention ancient spells + random drops.  In total it will take youa bout 9 hours to clear VT including travel time to VT and getting coh's.  60 people * 9 hours = 540 man hours for 30+ pieces of loot which equates to about 18 man hours of work for a piece of loot.<br />
-Hunting in LDON can be done by just XP groups to gear up.  It takes an average of about 90 minutes with travel time to do an adventure for 51 points.  To get a piece of gear that's VT quality or better, you end up spending about 5000 points for the gear + augments, which works out to about 100 adventures.  100 adventures * 1.5 hours per adventure = 150 hours of xping (work) for a piece of gear.  You have 6 people in the group all adding manhours, but everyone is getting a piece of gear out of the work as well, so it doesn't change the numbers much.<br />
-raiding Luclin targets for loot is going to be a similar time investment as doing POP targets.<br />
-VT is the fastest way to gear up a guild with gear.  Raiding other targets is slower, but still faster than gearing up in LDON.  Gearing up in LDON is the slowest by far, but on the plus side you also get XP for doing so.<br />
6.  The key quest for VT really isn't hard when you look at the difficulties in keeping a guild flagged for the planes.  Backflagging is a perpetual nightmare.  Every few weeks or months, when you get new recruits, you have to go back and flag every one of them again.  You need to drag the entire guild out of the elemental planes or wherever you happen to be raiding, in order to kill targets that will find it difficult to kill more than about 5 people during the course of the entire fight.  In comparison, a shaman can obtain solo 9 out of the 10 shards (just needing a bit of help obtaining ssra shard).  Shards can be obtained on your own time in xp groups (albeit crappy xp, but it's still xp).  Camps for key parts for emp's chamber is another xp camp.  The only real raid you need is for the insignias, but luckily the drop rate for insignias is very very high.  You can expect to get an insignia approximately every 20 or 30 minutes.<br />
7.  Right clickies!  There's a bunch of really good right click items in VT that you really don't want to pass up if possible.  Right click human illusion, skeleton illusion, fire elemental illusion is there.  Shrink items for everyone else, and the one for shaman is there.  Right click invis is there for the melees and cleric classes.  Right click invis undead is there on an all all earring.  There's also necklace of malosi which is one of my most prized possessions.  And there's also the call of sky proc orb thingy.  I know there's some druid arms that right click (a debuff I think).  There's right click c3 sticks for enchanters that are wonderful for getting mana to mass c5 after a wipe.  Also, there's summon mass food and water items with good stats on them (though you'll hate them after a while).<br />
8.  Vengence items.  VT has lots of vengence items for your tanks.  Nuff said.<br />
9.  You don't have to do the whole clearing in 1 day.  7 hours of raiding straight is rough.  Our guild used to do the first 3 or 4 hours of it, then camp out at a safe spot or just leave a coh mage there, and continue the raid again the next day.  It's not really so bad.<br />
<br />
When you factor the whole risk vs reward vs time investment, I don't think you can go wrong heading to VT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I hear all about the competition for Ssra and VT, but I guess I consider my guild lucky.  Currently on my server there are no Guilds who are in VT but not in Elementals.  There are other guilds on the server who refuse to step foot in Ssra and do PoP only.  That leaves us with situations where High Priest and XTC are up for almost 24hour before we kill them.  Some of the Elemental guilds still do Emp/Cursed, and Rhags/AL is done by them to outfit twinks also (anyone know of AL being done by less then 17?).  But this removes some of the headache of being overrun in ssra.  When we get 5-10 more keys done, we'll do emp.<br />
<br />
As to VT, only 2-3 guilds actually farm it (1 being the euro guild who gets 3 out of every 4 spawns it seems).  By the time we have keys finished, it should be even more open.<br />
<br />
Sort of off topic here, but what is the minimum number needed for Emp raids?  I'm thinking total people and baned equiped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Um.  The CC group itself used to be 12 people, but you could get by with 9 or 10 now.<br />
As for killing Emp, you could probably do it very very slowly with main + rampage tank and about 12 healers.<br />
It would take freaking forever to do though.<br />
At minimum, I think our guild would need about 36 people online for us to consider doing Emp.<br />
Our guild is Elemental Plane flagged, but not Time flagged yet.<br />
When you are used to fighting stuff that hits for 2-3k a pop with rampage and 1-3k ae/procs, going back and looking at Emp who hits for a mere 900 or so with whatever his proc is, it doesn't look so tough anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">If it's your first time you're probably going to want 60-70 people on.  That's how many we used to kill him the first time, but that was right after pop came out and we didn't have a lot of 65's or good spells.  He's a lot easier once you get better gear and more AA/levels/spells, but still very boring.  At least the fight only takes 12 minutes now, instead of 40.  A crew consisting of some of my guildies tried him with around 30 and they got him to 45%, then their shaman went LD, emp came unslowed, tank died, and they wiped.  Serves them right for not inviting me :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Pumyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">VT was DEEPLY tedious before PoP, with level 60 cap and less hp/mana/spells.<br />
<br />
However as pointed out by posters above so long as you can get reasonably uncontested access it is very worth doing prior to elemental targets.</div></div><hr />

heh that is true i rember greed raiding emp on a off night  with 25 or so people it was just retardedly easy even greeding seru isnt hard now with 40% dr slow   :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kujoh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">My main is a necro and my current guild is in the elemental planes atm.  We finally got enough people keyed and on to try VT about 2 months ago.  Now at first we were thrilled with the loot.  About a month ago we got our first RZ kill and a week later got Sol Ro.  After a few raids on mini's in the elementals we went back to VT and there is a good amount of things that rot or go to recruits.  <br />
<br />
Now VT has some really good loot, especially for caster/priest types who rely on FT gear.  A typical clearing of all the named in VT will yield about 25ish pieces of really good loot.  This is great if you can get into there when it pops.  On my server, there is a Euro guild that gets it every patch and usually has an edge on the US guilds timewise since there isn't any other VT capable guild on at that time to compete with them.  <br />
<br />
My point is if you don't have a lot of competition for VT on your server, it's totally worth the time.  If there is competition you may consider skipping VT and going to elementals instead.  The zones are much more enjoyable and clearing VT is a boring task.  The downside to skipping VT is there are some rare items in there that you can't find in other zones, but you can say the same about NToV in that regard.  Take a look at the server, your guild and make a decision that suits you best!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Emp requires you to pharm ore in the mines of ssra.  He can't be hit by normal weapons.  For rangers, they should get a Steel Hilt flinted dagger (Karnors) to use in one hand, since it procs a 600 fire dd which is quite useful against emp.  Other melee classes should look into similar dmg-proccing weapons.  You will want your MA geared up with two ssra-bane weapons, or maybe one 2-hander.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">My guild is attempting to make it to Elementals, skipping Ssra and VT.  A few months ago we went to NToV and it was a joke (some still used the drops, but by joke I mean there was virtually no challenge), so we only went 3 times total I think, maybe 4.  We also gathered ST keys for a bit and have enough for 3 groups and it was also pretty easy.<br />
<br />
Just because of our casualness it would be difficult and take a long time for us to get the keys for emperor and VT and the bane weapons, that and we dont require people to do things they might not want to.<br />
<br />
After NToV seemed so easy we decided to start focusing on PoP.  We are fairly casual and concentrate raiding in PoP 1/week and usually have a couple other raids elsewhere (usually not Luclin).  After a couple of failed attempts, we downed Grummus, Behemoth, Aerin`Dar, Caprin Cycle, and on our first attempts ever we beat Agnarr, Terris Thule, Rydaa`Dar and Tallon Zek.<br />
<br />
Also to answer your question, I dont see LDoN as being any kind of force to helping us gear up for Elementals, I think we will be there before we get any significant amount of upgrades from LDoN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Burzlaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">VT is a great place to get a ton of gear per trip (something like 25+random eom stuff).  My guild had the luxury of having it solo for about 2months.  It's good to have a balance in it all.  Crap we were still doing it every other week or so and still got to Elementals fairly fast since we never saw vt till PoP came out and emperor was now magically up ;).<br />
<br />
Do it again?  Bet your ass I would.  Emp keys are extremely easy to get.  Had my guild do an all day camp, together.  Got about 20-25 keys in 1 raid slot of a day.  Shards are fairly easy if everyone assists in helping.  All at the same time its good to swap it in and out with raiding other things (like PoP progression and Seru key is great to get).  There's many focus effects and items with a boat load of Vengance, from vt.  And since you are a shaman...get blob legs cause you wont see an fx of that kind as good until you get a fennin belt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>corlathist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">To the poster who is skipping VT/Ssra a couple posts ago.<br />
<br />
your kill list of lower planes bosses is nice....<br />
But how much FT and focus are your casters at.    Many of the high bosses MM/Bert/RZ require fairly hefty mana output.  if you can't sustain your CH chains, or dps casters are going OOM to soon into the fight, you don't win the bigger fights.<br />
<br />
I can understand skipping VT and even emp.  But skipping SSRA and even the Deep is going to leave you flowing thought challenged.<br />
<br />
Though more I think about it, you could skip and make the planes now a days without even SSRA/large amounts of FT because of 1 spell/aa combo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I'd say if competition looks reasonable on your server I'd definitely go for VT. The quanity of loot can't be matched and the quality is still quite good. There are even some items that are better that anything you can get in elemental planes. Crown of ambi is a popular one for shaman and there isn't another focus item in the game that compleately replaces it. There are some elemental god/time drops that replace either detrimental or benificial side but no other focus effect in the game that covers both. Boots of the wind is another interesting example. 20% detirmental mana pres. Can't match that type of mana pres until you get into time. <br />
<br />
Also learning how to deal with fights like HP (crowd control) AL/creator (rampage)  or cursed cycle and interesting ae's are all things your going to need to know in dealing with tougher mobs.<br />
<br />
You definitely can get into the elemental planes with out doing vt. My Alliance finally killed emp and got keyed shortly before pop came out. At the time however there 2 other guilds hitting it pretty hard and a euro guild doing it. Net result was we didn't really get much in the way of vt done. We did end up getting in the elemental planes and being able to kill stuff with minimal VT gear.<br />
<br />
Getting there with out vt gear is hard tho and expect to need larger numbers to do thing than the vt geared people. The FT, focus effect, vengance and hps really does make a differnence.<br />
<br />
Later on we where able to get into VT and did several clearings and the large amount of gear definitely did help out.<br />
<br />
LDoN is gonna be good for filling in weak slots and upgrading your good items with good augments but it would just take way to long to upgrade all your gear that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Vhalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">About a year ago we were in NToV, after that same question came about... about 1/2 the people did want to do VT the others didnt... guild went through some rough time (people leaving ect) but than we decited to just pull our shiznit together and go for VT. <br />
<br />
Today we are in Elementals (http://www.legendofmarr.com); and I tell you, VT and everything involved with it was a great experiance in my opinion. <br />
<br />
Not only the loot from VT will help you with PoP but you will spend a lot of time killing Luclin boss-mobs which are a geat upgrade from NToV. Once you get to VT, one or 2 visits there and you wont believe how easly you cut through PoP mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Jorgan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Thanks.  I appreciate all the responses.<br />
<br />
Currently there are four other guilds working on Ssra.  I'm not sure how many are in VT at the moment and I'm not sure how many of those four in Ssra plan on going on to VT.  But it looks like we're going to start farming Ssra for emp keys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Kujoh, figuring your on Saryrn, I assume your in ToN.  I know what you mean in regards to the euro-guild on our server, but they are finishing up reflagging (from what I've been told) before doin more elemental.  I would assume that they are done with VT then (how many clearings have they had?).  BTW, we were going to take a crack at Emp on monday but you guys beat us to him, so we had to settle on Cursed.<br />
<br />
I have yet to find a guild who has gone to elementals in the past few months with out doing any ssra.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">stop worry about other guild and go VT, VT is good goal to make a guild stay together and work toward it<br />
<br />
back to half year ago, my guild argue same thing, VT or PoP; but end up guild breaking and reform since most people vote PoP but can't kill anythig there<br />
<br />
just stop worry about it, go raid SSra and you will get key slowly, by the time you reach VT, the rotation may change, expect at lease 2-3 months before you can go VT, and at same time you should close to Sol Ro flag, that mean you can gear up at lease few VT clearing before hit element, which help lots</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">VT is the anti SOE zone, meaning there is a LOT of reward for little time invested.<br />
<br />
There are many things lacking in elementals, or some are not lacking but much harder to obtain compared to VT:<br />
- Rings: they are either very rare drop or you have to do insanely long and tough ring events: Air Avatars, Xegony, Coirnav, etc ... VT has many very high quality rings: Ring of Judgement, Ring of Crimson Bull, Ring of Flamewarding. Also since Emperor kill is a prerequisite to VT, you get Azazili's Ring of Analogies too. All this is far easier to obtain than killing Xegony for instance.<br />
- Earrings: same boat as rings. Yes there are a few very nice ones in elementals but they are either insanely rare (Fang of Flame) or again, hard to get like Coirnav event.<br />
- BPs/Robes: No elemental plane item comes remotely close to Aten Robe or something even better: Emperor's robe. BP of speed or Great Shadow Platemail is just superior to anything, no I won't count Rathe BP because frankly it's an event a guild does 3-4 times to flag and never goes back. Sanguine robe is also very nice.<br />
- Legs: nothing in elementals prior to rare dropping elemental legs (again hard to get due to rarity and tough encounters) is as easy to get as Aten legs, Nightcaller Leggings or Leggings of Fiery Might.<br />
- The entire Aten loot table is still extremely powerful when compared to elemental plane drops. <br />
- There also some other different very powerful trinkets: Shawl of Awakenings (Emperor), Staff of Lost Rituals (DoT damage booster focii), Twilight Shroud (Emperor Shawl Light(c)(tm)), Orb of Sky (ranger proc buff),  Gloves of Dark Rituals (pet summon focii) and plenty of other items. <br />
<br />
VT also supplies guilds with much needed FT, Resists and Vengeance.<br />
<br />
IMHO, VT and Elemental planes complement eachother well:<br />
- Get most of caster shoulders, jewelry, BPs and Legs from VT/Emperor.<br />
- Get rest of visible armor from Elementals along with very nice weapon upgrades.<br />
<br />
If your guild can have a reasonably good shot at VT, don't hesitate a minute to do it. It's more than worth the effort.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Garet_Jax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">VT makes elemental planes alot easier when you do get to them. you could skip it, everyone loves VT gear =D. It's also good for getting better at raid if you can slap VT around then your ready for planes but dont listen to me most times im wrong =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">also, I think PoP flaging is worse than VT/Emp key time sick, especial if your guild are casual(that is reason you want skip VT/emp key), expect 10x worse and officer will want guild remove casual/inactive members and only recruite active member<br />
<br />
PoP flaging is endless timesink untill you stop recruite and hope old people don't leave/quit</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>corlathist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Nice Post Zorlac.<br />
<br />
On top of Zorlac's point.  Cloaks.  VT is a very good spot for massive numbers of cloaks too.<br />
<br />
One of the interesting things, is that once you get to elementals and even upper Planes like HOHB....   a lot of focus effect items become all/all.  Heck also a lot of Melee slanted items caster go after as well for stats.  Earring from POE stands out as an example to me.<br />
<br />
This creates an interesting dilemma for guilds.  Take a cloak of combustion.  It's one of the top 5 melee cloaks outside time.  Its also tied (with 1 thing) for the top cold nuke outside time.   So who gets it?<br />
So getting focus handled in VT is a very nice thing.  <br />
<br />
So nice thing about VT is that there is less all/all debateable loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Kujoh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Yeah, I'm in ToN, Grend.  Cujoh is my shaman hydra.  This is Xamm btw!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Emp requires you to pharm ore in the mines of ssra.  He can't be hit by normal weapons.<br />
<br />
Well, sort of.  My guild discovered that this isn't really all that necessary.<br />
<br />
The thing is that although non-bane weapons can't hit the emp, they still generate aggro as if they are hitting him.  So if your MT is worried about maintaining aggro, use your BOC/Bloodfrenzy/whatever and screw the DPS.<br />
<br />
Back in August when the patch broke bane weapons, my guild tackled the emperor for only our second kill, and were successful with NO bane weapons.  Necros and mages propped up the clerics with manafeed and mod rods, nukers and DOTters had a field day, those melee with damage-proccing weapons whacked on him, etc.  Took a good bit of time but we won.  And the MT kept aggro just fine despite having a DPS of zero.<br />
<br />
So while it does benefit you to have more bane weapons, they are not strictly necessary, and it's certainly not necessary for EVERY melee to have 1-2 of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Kujoh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">weissblau is right, you don't need the bane weapons.  After that patch where they frigged the bane weapons, a few guilds still went and killed the Emp and Seru.  I know we killed Seru and it wasnt' bad at all.  Our main tank had a BoC and a spike driver and kept aggro just fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">But how much FT and focus are your casters at.  <br />
<br />
Well, we have around 4-5 clerics at FT 11+ (items only), rest of them probably around FT4-6 and 1 druid at 15, admittedly some of the pure casters are farther behind.  Our warriors all have pretty nice agro weapons and semi-decent hp.  I think we are much more melee strong than caster strong (more or less something like, 1-2 wizards, 1-2 mages, 6-7 clerics, 1-2 druids, 5-6 rogues, 4-6 rangers, 5-6 warriors, etc).<br />
<br />
We are not a new guild (been around 4+ years), however we have never been a raiding guild.  I just think taking PoP slowly has allowed us to gear up where we need to as well as giving us time to rake in the AAs (and levels) in our off time (thanks to the easy PoP experience), enough to where so far we have had little problems with most boss mobs (I believe most of our losses were mostly due to lack of our guild raiding experience, not gear).  For whatever reasons, PoP has seen us grow in numbers as well.  Only about 1/3 of us are geared/aa'd like I am.<br />
<br />
I think we can do it, but only time will tell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Sherah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Have you checked out the gear stats in VT?  All the mana/hp/resists  not to mention the awesome focus effects...can turn a player into a monster.<br />
<br />
No way can you gear up an entire guild faster using Ldon.<br />
<br />
Talking about time sink?  Have you seen how many points it takes to get ldon equipment?<br />
<br />
I have keyed over 5 chars myself for VT.   I also put a guild effort together to getting the guild keyed.  From start to finish I can have someone keyed within a week - and that is if I take a few days off to rest from shards.  Seroiusly..the only real nasty shard is ME (all the rest drop in 1 to 2 hours...you may occassionally get bad luck and one will be a pita)..and you are going to skip awesome content that would advance you guys prolly crazily over other guilds in a matter of a few raids because of one nasty shard?  My guild (with guild effort..mass killing) was keyed in less than 2 weeks, enough to hold a raid.  We literally SHOCKED our competition that we got keyed up so fast.<br />
<br />
<br />
Work together, set goals.  I guarantee you it will be worth it.  EQ is about goals, about spending time with each other, about taking on cool content.  You will see a variety of content that you'd miss out on in ssra or vt.<br />
<br />
I kinda crack up at some of the guilds on my server that think they can skip ntov and ssra and vt and go straight to elementals by grabbing 2 or 3 other guilds and zerging.  Mind you, these are not the hard core guilds and most of their members are not 65 and do not have 150aa's+ and barely in ornate.  Only guilds I know of that get into Elementals that do not go the &quot;older&quot; route are the guilds that already get ppl who are very well geared to join up to begin with and have aa's up the arse.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sherah</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Brodda Thep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">It all depends on what content is being consumed on your server.  If you have tons of guilds actively raiding in the elementals it won't be worth it to skip VT.  <br />
<br />
The time it takes to key up for emp and VT isn't as bad as it sounds.  We keyed our entire guild for emp in one week.  That was about 50 keys.  Then we kill emp a month later, got keyed up for VT in two weeks, killed a total of four named and never returned to the zone.  <br />
<br />
But at the time only one guild was in the elementals so we made the push and killed RZ with 55 poorly equipped and poorly AAed people.  <br />
<br />
You can accomplish either route, but which would be more enjoyable for your guild?  If there are 3-5 guilds in the elementals farming it now, I don't think you will enjoy struggling to get there only to have most of the elementals perma killed.</div></div><hr />
