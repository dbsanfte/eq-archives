<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Beawolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This post is specifically for those of us who arn't yet elemental flagged but are getting bored with soloing PoTactics and BoT etc.  My guild is closing in on elementals fast but we arn't quite there yet so we also havn't done much with GoD.  However, I've found the content to be quite enjoyable personally and so I love to play around soloing in GoD etc.<br />
<br />
The other night I decided I'd check out vxed to see if it could be done solo, turns out it can!  For xp anyways, I doubt anyone could solo the zone and pass the trial.  <br />
<br />
Thus far I've found this info on mobs and am still working on compiling more:<br />
<br />
Pookas -- don't see invis, don't summon<br />
Hynids -- see invis, don't summon<br />
Stonemites -- don't see invis, do summon<br />
Cragbeast -- don't see invis, not sure on summoning yet<br />
Ukun -- see invis, not sure on summoning<br />
Nocs -- don't see invis, not sure on summoning<br />
Anueks -- don't see invis, not sure on summoning<br />
Ikaav -- don't see invis, not sure on summoning<br />
granite worker -- don't see invis, not sure on summoning<br />
Kyv -- see invis, not sure on summoning<br />
Ra'tuk -- don't see invis, not sure on summoning<br />
<br />
Mobs in here partially - mostly slow and hit for around 1k so it's definitely dangerous soloing.  The nearest bind point is nedaria so if you die it's a long run.  Despite this however, thus far I've soloed a yellow con for 8%aaxp and I'm assuming 7% from white cons.<br />
<br />
To get one of the mountain trials for those that don't know, there is an NPC in Barindu named Apprentice Udranda whom gives out the tipt and vxed expeditions.  There is a mastruq that paths in agro range of her so you need to time dropping invis and getting trial right so he doesn't agro you but it's not hard at all, just watch his pathing.  Say Vxed to her to get the trial and then zone in at the end of the mountain pass which is just NE of the pyramid where the sewer trials are.  The apprentance is standing just north east of the pyramid in some water.<br />
<br />
You DON'T need to have done any of the sewer trials to get the mountain trials.  I have not yet completed any sewer trials and the apprentice gives me the trial with no questions asked hehe.<br />
<br />
Pulls inside can be tricky so utilize the zone line.  I typically pull with malos and then root one of the 2 entrance mobs away from their spawn and zone agro.  I come back in, debuff and re-root the mob and then proceed to dot it up.  You can use a mount in here also which is always handy when soloing.<br />
<br />
Anyways, good luck to those of you that wish to solo here, maybe you'll get lucky and get the Chanting Stone Mask that can drop rarely from any trash mob.<br />
<br />

Thanks very much for posting. :)   This is EXACTLY the kind of thing I was looking for!  :cool:  Tactics is getting boring, and I can't risk dying in Sol Ro on a daily basis w/o any guild clerics flagged there.   I hate having to beg for rezzes. :mad:   Still missing RZ for EP access.<br />
<br />
I have access to 2 different epicced clerics soI could park one outside for rezzing when things go wrong in VXed. :D  They can't rez in Sol Ro, but they both have GoD installed thank goodness. :D <br />
<br />
With regards to root, does VP3 stay for the duration or were you using Petrifying Earth for long-term mob parking? :confused: <br />
<br />
Also, what's the time on corpses to pop out if you get fed up?  Can you force a more rapid body pop into Barindu by quitting the expedition?  Will your body stay inside until the expedition times out if you are still online or will it pop out on its own?  I should probably already know the answer to these questions, but I don't. :(   Can't seem to get a solid GoD trials group, and most of the uberguilds 'aren't allowed by policy' to flag outsiders so they can keep the zones free of us tiny family guild folk. :mad: <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Beawolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I havn't messed around with VP much because mobs seem to have a fairly high DR and root breaking on you can be dangerous.  I've been sticking to petrifying earth so far but am contemplating using greater immobilize for the faster cast time jic root does break but the shorter duration makes me iffy on that.<br />
<br />
As far as getting your corpse, you can leave the expedition and they pop out fairly shortly afterwords, I don't know the exact timer though as the one time I've died I just zoned back in and ate the death with no rez.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rascalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for the post.  I assume its just because of the patch you are able to do this solo.  Before the patch there is no way I see anyone being able to solo these cause pulling would have been to hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Beawolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Pulling is hard, I make extensive use of root + zoning techniques to get mobs solo.  I doubt the patch did anything to change that but I honestly hadn't even so much as zoned in prior to the patch so I don't know for sure.<br />
<br />
For see invis status I think I have the list completed, it's going to take a while for summoning status as I havn't yet found a place other then the entrance to safely get to and set up camp for soloing and the spawns at the entrance seem to only ever be pooka's, stonemites and hynids.<br />
<br />
AAXP is 8% for yellow cons and 7% for white and blue con's.<br />
<br />
Hynids have an extremely fast run speed, not as fast as sow but makes rooting them before they catch you hard using paralyzing earth.  Pookas on the other hand have a relatively slow run speed and are pretty easy to get a jump on to root them before they get to you.  Stonemites are somewhere in the middle of those 2 for run speed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Beawolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Some added info for anyone wanting to bring a group here to grind / farm named mobs.<br />
<br />
From my grouping / soloing in here, the respawn in here is about 10-14 minutes so it's pretty fast.  Nameds seem to spawn shortly after you start killing mobs and I think a lot if not all are PH'ed too so if you find the PH you can farm them.<br />
<br />
The only named I've tried so far was Chavoor the Trickster.  His spawn point is 2 rights from the zone.  At the 4-way you start at go east and eventually you will come to a section where there is a small room south of you and the path is running west to east that your on.  His PH is the middle mob on the east side of the room.  He hits for 1663 max hit and when I slowed him it was only &quot;slightly&quot; effective.  There is 1 cragbeast that paths past this room so you can kill him and then set up outside the room and med if you need to or wait for discs to pop with only the 1 roamer to deal with.<br />
<br />
Oh, and also it seems that any of the yellow con mobs are immune to lull of all sorts, the white and blue cons can be lulled though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
did you solo chavoor? if so, how, doesn't he summon? and if not, im ****ing doing this lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Beawolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">No, I attempted Chavoor with a group of friends from my guild and yeah, he summons.  He summoned me right after I slowed him and proceeded to kill me in about 0.2 seconds hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Retron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Not seen it mentioned, but there's been a change in exp in the past month or so - mobs in Vxed are now worth around 10% AA a kill (solo).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tidykat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Also, what's the time on corpses to pop out if you get fed up?  Can you force a more rapid body pop into Barindu by quitting the expedition?  Will your body stay inside until the expedition times out if you are still online or will it pop out on its own?  I should probably already know the answer to these questions, but I don't. :(<br />
<br />
If you are inside of the instanced GoD zone, and hit Alt + Z, and &quot;Quit expedition&quot; you will be ported to barindu in 60 seconds. Ported right outside of the zoneline to Tipt/Vxed that is.<br />
If you have a corpse and choose to quit the expedition, your current living body will port out in 60 seconds, and your dead body will pop about 5 minutes after you hit the quit button.  As for if you go offline and choose not to quit the expedition, there is a timer to complete the expedition, I don't however know what that timer is. But if you log with the expdition open and come back 24 hours later your corpse and you will be in barindu, as I believe Tipt/Vxed have something like 7 hour timers for the entire thing. Might be a shade off on the given time to complete the expedition, since I've always done them in 1-2 hours tops (except this one really really bad time in vxed where I spent like 6-7 hours because we kept dying, omg that sucked).<br />
<br />
Also, lastly,  Chanting Stone Mask (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=26356) has a chance to drop from ANY mob inthe zone, although i think it's a 1 in 400 chance. SLim, but I got mine n that 6-7 bad run through. GL in Vxed though, I may try to solo there sometime for kicks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Summary:<br />
<br />
3 unrezzed deaths<br />
2.5 aa exp point<br />
<br />
2 taelosian tea leaves<br />
2 taw pale nihilite<br />
2 hynid manes<br />
1 writ of quellius<br />
1 yaeth's 108 (woot!)<br />
1 words of constancy<br />
1 card of bristlebane<br />
1 words of stimulation<br />
1 chunk of taelosian rock<br />
1 rune of vortex<br />
1 polished hynid fang<br />
1 yaeth's 107 left<br />
1 yaeth's 92<br />
<br />
Greased Belt (BiC quest)<br />
Connection Rods (BiC quest)<br />
<br />
no plat<br />
<br />
When you enter the zone you are in a winding canyon. Following the canyon leads you to a paved circle with statues, then up a ramp to the first intersection. There are two spawns in the intersection, one at the back left and the other at the back right. I was never able to single pull them. The right-hand path has a single pull up the hill. The left-hand has a double, and straight ahead has a wanderer that stops just before it enters the intersection and a single further up the path. If you enter the flat area of the intersection, you will probably aggro both of them, so you have to climb the walls next to the ramp to target and cast. <br />
<br />
The mobs ranged from dark blue to yellow, with dark blue yielding 8% aa exp and the yellows 10% (I have slider set to 90/10 aa exp). I only have Blood of Saryrn and Breath of Ultor and BA4 tribute effect, so dark blues were taking 7 minutes to kill and yellows about 9 minutes. (I REALLY need to get off my butt and get the LDoN dots!)<br />
<br />
As mentioned before, the 2 mobs at the first intersection are a mix of mountain pookas, venomous stonemites, and hynid ravagers. The pookas have low DR so VP3 never broke early. The stonemites and ravagers have high DR and, even after MD, VP was resisted. I had to use root and magic debuffs. Respawn seemed to be 16-18 minutes, I will try to get a better number.<br />
<br />
I used root pulling to break the intersection. I had petrifying earth memmed and greater immobilize on pants, so cast PE on one and run like hell, turn and target the  other one and cast GI. If both roots stuck, then I debuffed and cast PE on my victim, then zoned to clear aggro. If it was still there when I got back, then started root-rot (VP for pookas, PE for ravagers).<br />
<br />
When I remembered, I would slow (mostly successful) and cripple so I could probably survive a couple of hits if things got out of hand.<br />
<br />
I did try one stonemite, just to see if I could survive the summoning/bashing cycle. I rooted, debuffed, slowed, and crippled it, then Q'd myself and dotted it. After getting summoned twice I made it to the zone with 1% health....don't bother.<br />
<br />
I'm going to spend some more time to see if I can get a rhythm going. 8-10% aa exp is drool-worthy for me, but a couple more deaths will probably cause me to move on. On one occasion I was able to clear the intersection and pull the single in the right-hand path before respawns, but they were all pookas.<br />
<br />
edit 7/31 - updated summary</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ok, after 2 days of logging in and not doing anything since I've been pretty bored of the same crap over and over, finally got the guts to try this tonight.<br />
<br />
Honestly... wasn't bad at all. Though I gotta say it was definately the most fun soloing I've done yet.  You really gotta be on your toes for this.<br />
<br />
I was getting 11% AA a kill off the yellows. Using only Bane, BoS and BoU I was finishing the mobs off within 3 mins. I also have ER 4, BA 4 and SH 4 from Tribute which helps a lot.<br />
<br />
I'd ignore all stonemites and get another expedition if they were the only mobs in my way left to pull. Root one mob with PE and run all the way to the zone line, root with GI, malos, re-root with PE and zone out to clear aggro. Then come back in and take them down.<br />
<br />
Being close to the zone line gave me two option if root broke. If I start getting hit fast I can zone asap. It also gives me plenty of room to run around and get a GI back off. Root only broke about 3 times out of about 7 pulls.<br />
<br />
Sadly the night ended on a bad note. Halfway through my last mob for the night, 2% away from a Ding, I went LD. Came back and I was naked in PoK. To make matters worse I did happen to have a friend barindu to rez me but when she did I got bugged and didn't get my XP back.<br />
<br />
But hey, 60%+ AA for 6 kills in one night is damn nice. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>jvrebi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">So once you've passed this trial can you instance it again for exp and if so how?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shiuna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">So once you've passed this trial can you instance it again for exp and if so how?<br />
<br />
Actually, I haven't passed any GoD trials at all. I simply say &quot;vxed&quot; to Apprentice Udranda and he gives me a trial. He's located northeast of the temple standing in a small pool on the left side of the entrance to the deadend canyon on the east side of the zone. Once you get the trial you run east then north through the canyon to the deadend. There's always a pile of corpses there because it's where you eventually get dumped if you die in a trial. On the right side of the deadend you will see a crack in the wall next to the Golem Stoneshifter (indifferent con). Run into the crack and you will zone into your trial instance zone. You can zone in and out multiple times. I don't know how long the zone lasts because I only get 3 or 4 kills max before I have too many stonemites as entrance spawns.<br />
<br />
Nothing in the canyon normally sees thru invis, so you can run up and down safely, but during prime time quite often there are groups pulling stuff into the canyon and fighting there.<br />
<br />
There's a 6-minute lockout timer for a trial, which means even if you disband from the trial, you can't get another one until the timer expires. The timer starts when you get the trial. Alt-z will display the expedition window with the timer. If the little display area in the middle of the window is empty, then the timer has already expired.<br />
<br />
You have to uninvis to talk to Udranda. If you stand in the pool against the north wall you shouldn't aggro any wanderers.<br />
<br />
Good luck and let us know how you do.<br />
<br />
p.s. I haven't tried this, but I understand you can talk to Gamesh and get sewer trials for exp only. I understand you can select the one you want. Gamesh is standing in a pool in the southeast corner of the temple area.<br />
<br />
edit 7/31 - fixed some compass directions after looking at the map  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Yeah Gamesh will let you pick and choose sewer trials for XP and loot only.<br />
<br />
Crematory zone in may be easy to solo. I haven't actually tried yet. I did try and solo a mob in the Lair once while I waited for some friends but it resisted PE and started cutting me up very quickly. I was forced to zone before I could even try and get another root off. There's just not a lot of room to move around in there.<br />
<br />
Just keep in mind the muck covered flies are immune to root. So don't bother with them.<br />
<br />
As for a timer in Vxed, it's 6 hours I believe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Shenen Alquimista</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">as far as i know, the only timer in vxed is the 6 minute one .. i've won vxed and done another immediately, so there's no 6 hour timer if you win or lose it.<br />
<br />
BTW .. i also finally got the guts up to try this.  Went in with no tribute, ER, BA, SH .. nothing.  Just me and my FT3 (at the time) and a few mana pres items.  Even going in totally unprepared like that, it was still an amazing rush.  I had a blast and will definately be going back (now have BA4 tribute to take with me as well)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've been doing them self buffed, and it hasn't been a problem because it takes me so long to kill them. I'm back to full mana by the time they die. 3400 or 4800hp doesn't make much difference when they catch me because they usually stun me on the initial hit.<br />
<br />
Pookas are definitely the mob of choice. I haven't had VP break yet once I have MD on them.<br />
<br />
Levitate helps with line-of-sight casting issues. Stay close to the ground, though. I've had a couple of instances where I was high up on a wall spamming root after a pull, and I kept getting &quot;out of range&quot; messages until it warped into my face  :eek: .<br />
<br />
This is just an impression, but it seems like the dark blue mobs break root early or resist spells more often than the white and yellow ones. Having two yellow pookas at the entrance is like hitting the jackpot on the nickel slots....20% of an aa for 15 minutes work!  :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
My friends and I got kicked out once. It gave us a 5 minute warning before we got the boot then once our time was up we all got booted out to Barindu.<br />
<br />
I wasn't keeping time but when I asked all my friends how long we were in there for they said 6 hours.<br />
<br />
Umbiki was up too and we wiped on him at the 5 min warning :(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Foramorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Yes, the Vxed trial does have a timer of 6 hours.<br />
<br />
I've completed all of the trials, 1-6, in addition to Smith Rondo.<br />
<br />
Vxed was by far the hardest, due to the fact that you used to have to kill 100 mobs to get the NPC to spawn at the end.<br />
<br />
From what I have heard this number is now only 50.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Shiuna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Just wanted to repeat a warning about staying up on the walls when pulling. Normally I'm levitated and run about half way up one of the side walls at the ramp to target and cast. Then I run at about a 45% angle down to the ground and out until I get to my turn-and-cast place, or continue on to the zone if I'm debuffing.<br />
<br />
I decided that I was wasting time by running to the ground, and instead stayed on the wall to run to the zone. A pooka caught and killed me  :o  . Apparently the pooka, normally a slow runner, warped to me.<br />

First time I guess I hit the jackpot.  Two yellow pookas at first courtyard and a hynid up to the right followed by a repeat.  Was getting nearly 11% off the yellow pookas.  <br />
<br />
Tried again the next morning and always had at least one stonemite in the first two mobs.  It gets a lot slower when you have to split them kill the non summoning mob, quit expedition and repeat.<br />
<br />
But all in all, well worth the effort.  ( no significant loot at all)</div></div><hr />

<br />
If the stonemite is on the right side, it is possible to pull from the left ramp without aggroing it.  Same thing if the stonemite is on the left side.  You can even pull from up the middle if you pull around the stonemite that is up (either right or left).  This is a lot more risky of course, and being high up the wall is a death sentence.<br />
<br />
I have been spoiling myself though, and boxing my brothers necro to snare and FD pull for me.  Think I was getting an aa every 30 minutes on the good runs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Flobedeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">If theres Stonemites at the begining just zone out and quit then go get a new exped, far easier than tactics IMO and its somthing a bit differant (for a while anyway) and the AA xp is quite nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Shiuna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">OK, I've done about 24 aa's here, and it's the best place I've found so far to get solo experience without elemental flags.<br />
<br />
I have about 3350 hp self buffed with bazaar gear, VP3, BoS, and BoU. If they catch me, I survive the first round about 50% of the time when I'm facing them, and die 100% of the time with my back to them.<br />
<br />
I only kill pookas and ravagers, and average about 11 kills per aa point with 90% to aa exp. With BA4 tribute, it takes about 2.5 BoU plus all the BoS that will fit during that time to kill one. I estimate they have 30-35K hps. Respawn time is about 14 minutes. Both pookas and ravagers run at 10% health.<br />
<br />
Pookas are easiest to kill because VP never breaks after MD, and they are slow runners. Ravagers have much higher DR, and occasionally BoU is resisted even after MD. I use GI on ravagers for its cast time, but even after Malosinia it's not reliable.<br />
<br />
My strategy depends on what's at the entrance. If I have 2 pookas, then I pull one with MD, run to the dead tree, VP it, zone out/in, and kill it. Then I pull the other one with MD, run to tree, VP it, and kill it. If there's a pooka straight ahead or right, then I pull ir with MD, run to  tree, VP it, and kill it. During this fight the first entrance mob will respawn. As long as I keep getting pookas, I'm golden.<br />
<br />
If I have only 1 pooka at the entrance, then I Malos the other one and zone out/in, then root the other one, target pooka, run to tree, MD, VP, zone out/in, and kill it. If the other mob is a ravager then I GI it, Malosinia, BoS, MD, BoU, run to tree and wait for root to break, re-GI as needed and kill it. If GI breaks before I get to the tree, I just zone and get another expedition. If the other mob is a stonemite and there are pookas straight ahead or in the right passage (and I'm feeling lucky), then I will GI and Malosinia the stonemite, pull pooka with MD, etc. This will get your heart rate up quickly.<br />
<br />
If there are no pookas at the entrance, I wait 6 minutes and get another expedition.<br />
<br />
My best time for an aa was about 90 minutes, but 2 to 2.5 hours is more typical.<br />
<br />
I didn't get the mask.  :(</div></div><hr />

You are severly handicapping yourself by not using bane and anathema.  Seriously take a break from Vxed farming aas and knock out the adventures you need to get Bane and Anathema.  You will easily cut down the kill time in half, maybe even to a third.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I can't speak for Anathema but at least Bane is very well worth it.<br />
<br />
As I stated above I use BoU, BoS and Bane. I also throw in my Epic DoT from time to time. One cast of BoU and the mobs are usually dead just as it finishes up. So under 3 mins to take down one mob.<br />
<br />
I've gotten an AA point in 45 mins or so at least a few times when I've gotten lucky and had no stonemite pops at the front during that time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>vincenzovs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Aside from nameds, <br />
<br />
only ukun and stonemites summon here.<br />
<br />
Noc's just have that horrible proc if they hit you.<br />
<br />
ukun cast snare too -- watch out for that.</div></div><hr />

I know, I know &lt;sigh&gt; I have to whip myself to do adventures. I really just enjoy puttering around doing whatever I can by myself. I ride the bleeding edge of spousal aggro, so I have to be able to stop what I'm doing at a moment's notice.<br />
<br />
I took a break from Vxed this week to do the first 8 coldain rings. I have to say that the ring quest, shawl quest, and our epic are the best storylines and fun quests in the game.<br />
<br />
I'm hoping that the new DoTs in OOW will be reasonably accessable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Ubex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I use bane, anethema, BoS, and BoU, have BAIV and the Critical DoT AA.  With that lineup, the yellow pookas drop just after BoU wears off so guess about 3 min. <br />
<br />
Beleive me Bane is worth it, some mobs are very resistant to poison.  In that case you will be glad to have the majic based DoT's.<br />
<br />
I still have trouble breaking the entry sometimes.  This morning I had 3 pairs of hynids.  They have high enough magic resistance that splitting can be a real chalange.</div></div><hr />
