<br />
It seems to be woking, but your mana bar does not automatically update like it does when you are not on a horse. Mine had not moved in half an hour and then I cast a spell on myself and my mana bar went all the way back to full.<br />
<br />
Standing Still:<br />
Standing still on a horse (models off) regains mana like you are sitting but you have to *prompt* your mana bar to see the results (i.e., cast a spell).<br />
<br />
Standing Still (while spining):<br />
Same as above.<br />
<br />
Moving Around:<br />
Did the same test, but instead of standing still I ran around in a circle. I then cast a spell on myself to *prompt* my mana bar and there was no movement on the blue. No meditaion while moving.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Humbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Easiest way I check my mana bar is using an insta click item like sow boots. Even if you are indoors or have a better spell in place it will still update the mana bar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Junder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Did you happen to verify that SoW stacks with the horse. I am thinking of buying the slug model if I can still use SoW.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">SoW stacks with the horse if and only if you have the models turned off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">turn the model off.  You can cast stack SoW, not have an annoying horse head on your screen, AND you dont start up and slow down slowly.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>humburto</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">if the horse models are turned off, since sow stacks do you run at sow speed. I bought the junky horse just so i could med after i slow stuff, and it works really well, except I need to unclick the horse when i need to run away or travel across zones because its so slow.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Spinashe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ok.. I'm really sorry to have to ask anything but I keep reading about horses and people post misinformation and the page at castersrealm isn't totally descriptive..<br />
<br />
1. Do you regain mana when casting just right clicks or when casting spells too? (i.e. the only way when stood still that you won't regen mana is by autoattacking)<br />
<br />
2. SoW can override the horse if you have horse models switched off correct?<br />
<br />
3. Do you still regain mana when horse models are switched off when standing still / casting ?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help, if I get a JBB soon I'll just buy a cheap horse regardless I think :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Just got a horse to play with after readinga  few posts such as this one.    Played around with it for a while after turning off the graphics.   Sorta bites that I see the old stupid elementals now :(  But very nice that I move at SoW, and med while JBBing.  Now in solo fights I actually use Ebolt more often (keep it on always pretty much) and I come out FM and down maybe 2 bars of health most times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Spinashe:<br />
<br />
1.  You continue to med while casting and while right-clicking.  As long as you're not moving and not medding, you're medding.<br />
<br />
2.  You can use SoW while you are on the horse, but SoW won't make the horse go away (won't override it.)  The horse shows up as a buff (and takes a buff slot.)<br />
<br />
3.  Yup.  <br />
<br />
One interesting thing- while the horse shows up as a buff spot you need to re-summon it every time you log in (unlike your other buffs).  No biggee, but there have been a few times I've logged in and started killing stuff, then thought &quot;Geez, my mana regen sucks!&quot; before I realize I forgot to summon Mr. Ed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Models or no models, the horse still screws up invis - so remember to click him off before running anywhere invis'd.  Took me 3 or 4 good sized trains in the Grey to figure that one out :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ahpok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Click off the horse if you camp out when model off. It coz LD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Another thing to note about horses, is that you only ever get your standing regeneration rate. Of course the extra mana outweighs this disadvantage, but if you are low on HP and mana, the most efficient way to recover is to click off the horse and sit down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hail,<br />
<br />
Bought myself one of the &quot;slow ass glue-factory horses&quot; for about ~8.4kpp.  The extra kpp for white or black models was too much for me. :P  So my tan mare may be common, but she's loyal.<br />
I love my little pokey mare.  Played with models on yesterday and 3rd person view for kicks and had a blast while gaining a full yellow in 53.<br />
<br />
Just as an aside, I recommend NOT using your pretty little ponies on any boats.  Zoned from EFP to OOT and found myself treading water instead of on the boat.  Amber drowned soon after (oh yeah, ponies drown quickly in water), so I levitated, cast scale of wolf, and was at my spot in less time than if I was sitting on the boat.  BUT, it is important to note if you were planning on going AFK on the boat. <br />
<br />
 Make sure you dismount from your horse before taking a boat ride!   <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Ahjahahaaaa - so that why i was going ld - camping with horse on - dang I could not figure that out - THANKS!!<br />
<br />
So..........if you have models off and try and camp while mounted on horse you go LD - HURRAY that was driving me nuts!<br />
<br />
And I can confirm horsey screws up invis - stuff sees ya and wants to kill ya.<br />
<br />
Someone tell VI.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">!!! So horsey is whats making me go LD when camping?!  Bah, that made ma have to redo 7th ring = \ camped out after pulling dorf away from the giants and rooting him and turned out I went LD after I camped and killed him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Irksome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Horsey + Shrink + Cazic Thule = Da Bomb</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ahaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">when you turn off horse model, you can sit, is that make you have double mana regen rate ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Some people said it does, but I saw no difference when I tested it.<br />
<br />
Another horse issue to be aware of - yesterday someone in my group couldn't heal me while I had my horse summoned. I'm not sure exactly what was going wrong, but when I clicked off the horse, he could heal me.</div></div><hr />
