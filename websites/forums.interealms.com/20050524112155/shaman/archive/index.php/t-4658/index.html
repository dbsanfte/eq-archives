<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Galdir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I think they should make groups bigger mybe 8 players that whould help more players to get a group and druids to, <br />
I think the 6 palyer like it is now is not good make it 8 should not be to hard to do for em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Finally an idea I support!  Those &quot;non-essential&quot; classes might get a huge leg up from such a change.  Port classes would be back &quot;in&quot; for instance.  Mages would perhaps be more sought after since their massive damage fits perfectly with the idea of a 7th or 8th member.  Necros as well would be invaluable for all the utility and damage they can offer.  Hybrids would have found a place.  <br />
<br />
I think I heard that they are considering this already.  It may go live with PoP in fact.  Might be up to 12 group members even!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Doing this may increase the DPS of a group so much that it makes dotting classes useless though.... :confused:<br />
<br />
I dunno, just a thought - otherwise I like it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Why would anyone group for XP anyways? Soloing many light blues is way better than killing for XP in CT or Ssra or even Akheva.</div></div><hr />

Why would anyone group for XP anyways?<br />
<br />
I can only solo for so long before I go insane with boredom.  It's nice to just do stuff with other players outside of a raid situation, where there is no pressure.<br />
<br />
I like this idea :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Odaya Cliffhopper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">more people in exp groups! another downside for those non soloers is they have to add more exp per kill to the mobs or you would level many times slower in a full group</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cerum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Maybe they'll add bonus XP for each group member after the 5th ^_^ Unlike the hidden rumour of XP bonus for the 6th group member, which was stated false by Verant I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">A little known fact is that if you group with another person, or even five other people, go to another zone, and solo you will now get the group exp bonus without having to share the exp.  Same goes for the other group members, plus you get someone to chat with while you solo or duo or however you decide to split it up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Not big on this one. MOBs for the most part seem &quot; tailored &quot; for a 6 man group. Can be done with less, especially with the new superman powers, but like raising the level limit to 70, I think this might trivialize certain aspects of the game.<br />
<br />
Besides, if the level limit were raised to 10 - do you REALLY need a 2nd cleric? Mucho dynamics change. With an 8 man group you could have a 2nd CC'er a 2nd tank, and really put out the damage and level much faster.<br />
<br />
Hmmm....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Toshizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">yeah it might make the game a bit unbalaced, usually when im in a group of six nothing that we pull lives long even if it is four five levels higher, it has to do with a caster having major-aggro and sow running from it while the melees bite it from behind but thats not what I was talking about. If they made a 8 person group they might have to rebalance some areas. Some of you guys might know Diablo II has a 8 people party and even with five or four nothing usually lives to bug you long. Soo if they do stick 8 in a group then...be ready for harder MOBs, thats the only way i can think of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Pingpang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It'll never happen, unless code is put in place to limit the numbers of a specific class in a group; otherwise think of the damage that could be put out by a 8 (or even worse, a 12) member mana burn wizard group.<br />
<br />
An 8 (or 12) member AoE group would be just as bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>engelica</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">in the plans, rumors, and idea department<br />
<br />
VI said they are working on &quot;war parties&quot; which would split exp between 2 or more groups, ie everyone in the raid would get a piece of the pie. 1/36 of mob exp might not be all that great but would be something better than the rogue, ranger or wiz group getting it all<br />
so i guess you could from smaller war groups for exping, but finding enough mobs for an 8-12 way split could be hard,<br />
but<br />
<br />
also in the works, VI said they really don't like the idea of killing tons of easier blues compared to killing of a mob that is a challage, so they are looking at a way to increase the exp of mobs that do challage a group. somehow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It is a good idea, one that has been talked about before and the main issue about not doing it was because of Experience distribution. Adding more players means less experience, however this would be very ideal for Raids.</div></div><hr />
