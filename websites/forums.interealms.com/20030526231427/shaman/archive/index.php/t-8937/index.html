<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gukar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok after 4 days in TT hunting yun shaman I got the powder. So I gate and head out to TD. I get to Gorla Island to find no bag, no crushed diamonds any place on that island. So I wait, 2 hrs later I still don't have the diamonds. I went to the loc that was given in the guide but still no luck on them. Have they removed the spawn of the diamonds??? Any info would be great ty<br />

P.S. This quest will drive you nuts, also I found the yun shaman at neg 2457, pos 265 in TT gl on that one.<br />

And no, Crushed Diamond Dust has nothing to do with the Cannibalize II quest. Different item name, different expansion.</div></div><hr />

I think I noticed where they might have gone to...There's one guy on my server that CONTSTATLY has them for sale now...for 250pp. Reeeediculous!</div></div><hr />
