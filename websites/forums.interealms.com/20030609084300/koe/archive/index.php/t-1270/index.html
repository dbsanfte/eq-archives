<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Moebeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">There are a number of zones in Velious that I haven't had the chance to explore much of and thats what I plan on doing this weekend other than the Hate rate Saturday morning.<br />
<br />
These are the zones that I am interested in hitting this weekend,  post with what you're interested in and your expected weekend play schedule and current level and class and I'll try to put a few adventure sessions together.<br />
<br />
Sirens Grotto<br />
Western Wastes<br />
Frozen Shadow<br />
Velks Lab<br />
Wakening Lands (now that Wuoshi aggro is minimized)<br />
<br />
My only requirement is a 49+ cleric for the possibility of a rez being necessary.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So what we gonna do first?  It all matters on you!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Arsecn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Count me in... except sunday, work til 5pm est.  I'd also love to go up in the tower, never been past 3rd floor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'll be on Saturday after 2:00 pm cst since I have a car meet at 12:30 pm. I'd love to go exploring these zones.<br />
<br />
As to Runnyeye....forget it. Went there today. Same zone. Higher level pickclaw goblins with different names. Boring for my level. Would be more fun for my other characters though due to exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rekaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've been to velk's and frozen shadow before, but I had so much fun I'd go back to either anytime.  Actually, doesn't matter to me where I hunt so long as it's fun (read - exciting), and since you're such a bad ass chanter Moe, I'd be down for any group you make since any ranger can pull all the trains in the world safely with you around ;).<br />
<br />
For the next 2 weeks I can't play until 9 PST during the weeks but I can negotiate deals with my loving wife to allow extra playing time over the weekend :p.<br />
<br />
A regular exploration squad could be cool...<br />
<br />
PS - I stay up late</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aranuil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have been for some time REALLY wanting to go to Siren's Grotto.  Even though I have only seen a little of it, that zone just looks fantastic.  I think it would be a blast to see more of it!<br />
<br />
If you are going to SG, let me know.  I will bring my SCUBA gear, and my weapons, and we can go own! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Chmee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Not sure yet if I will be available but definitely interested</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Knarlz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm going to the hate thingie Sat, if not all jpn poofed. and wont be on till late Sun ( will try  velks).<br />
<br />
But I for one would love to go to the tower thing in iceclad some day. So if not this weekend, then soon.  ( plus we are out of sync in week Moe so :(  )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Moebeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">/bump<br />
<br />
Basically during the weekends I'm going to try to throw one of these things together.<br />
<br />
We've done some SG learned a bit and know more what we need when we go back  (like 2 groups heavy melee).<br />
<br />
I'd like to hit Velks or the Tower this weekend some time perhaps after a raid when some people want to do some arse kicking with exp as a change of pace.  The Tower we can waltz through with a group of 55's or so.  Velks is not too bad until we get past the kobolds so if we can get 2 groups together perhaps we can do that. <br />
I wouldn't be against getting a single group together to do the kobolds though!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Bearan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The wife is out of town this weekend with the kids so I am available Friday night and all day Sat.<br />
I love the Tower of Money err Shadow and also hold keys to all the floors there including the key to take you straight to Lv 6.  You will not see much xp in the Tower though.<br />
I also love VL and SG they are a blast.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The Kobolds are great exp for one group. I'd like to do it again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I've been to a few places in Velious but no means have hunted there extensively (although that is slowly changing due to my disgust at the transformation of Seb into Karnor's II: Return of the Jacks). <br />
<br />
I've hunt a few times in Velks (nasty entrance but nice when you get in there).<br />
<br />
I've only passed through the edges of SG (en route to WW).<br />
<br />
I've seen a fair chunk of Kael ( I think almost all we can without killing the King).<br />
<br />
I've skirted the edges of WL ( my golden rule of travel: follow the wall until you know it well).<br />
<br />
I've only seen WW from the SG zone to DN and ToV.<br />
<br />
Don't know Iceclad that much, or EW either (mostly just the ways to the Kael/GD zones).<br />
<br />
Unless I get drafted into some type of raid, I'm up for exploratory missions!</div></div><hr />
