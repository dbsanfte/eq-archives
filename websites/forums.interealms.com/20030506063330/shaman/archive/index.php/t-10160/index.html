<br />
Was wondering if you could take a look at my gear and give me any suggestions on what I should upgrade.<br />
<br />
I have about 15k in the bank.<br />
<br />
I am just wondering if theres anything I am crazy for keeping and should get rid of.. or if theres something out there I SHOULD have and dont know about.<br />
<br />
Thank you for taking the time to answer.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Clattering Bone Necklace or that smoothmetal torque things from PoI<br />
Barbed Dragonscale Boots (just thought of it from another equipment thread...dusty soriz boots, a little ac loss, but 40 hp on them)<br />
Hardened Grey Flesh Sleeves<br />
Shissar or coldain skin gauntlets<br />
shadel bandit ring or another velium fire opal instead of that wis ring<br />
dump both earrings for electrum black sapphire, or get a solstice too<br />
metal linked crown<br />
sarnak battle shield<br />
enshrouded veil, crystal spider eyes, death mask of the elysians (they have radically different costs for similar benefit)<br />
ceremonial iksar chestplate<br />
<br />
Wis isn't something you should base gear choices on.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You seem to go for a lot of wisdom on your gear, where most shaman go for hp. Most important upgrades IMO would be:<br />
<br />
Change Ivory imbued earring for a Solstice earring for ~8k<br />
<br />
Leaf scale gloves is a VERY cheap (I'm talking 10-50pp) upgrade. Sell your JB gloves to vendor and you actually make money from upgrading.<br />
<br />
Change wis ring for shadel ring (~2k) if possible, otherwise 6/65 ring (~400pp).<br />
<br />
You can get a Metal linked crown for ~300pp which is nice upgrade from JB helm.<br />
<br />
Range slot - goranga idol is a cheap alternative.<br />
<br />
Face, Boots, forest loop, arms and neck piece could also use an upgrade. Gwain had some good suggestions.<br />
<br />
You could probably upgrade all of slots mentioned easily for 15k total. <br />
<br />
Those Artificers ringmail stuff is nice! too bad there's no resists on them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Velious quest armor is better than pretty much all of you armor pieces.  Course you have to loot or MQ the pieces but they are very nice items to have.  Click on my stuff,  I have mostly Thurg quest armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tify</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thank you VERY much for the suggestions!<br />
<br />
I will look into those suggestions and see if I cant better my equipment.  <br />
<br />
Once again..  Thank you for taking the time to check it out and let me know  =)<br />
