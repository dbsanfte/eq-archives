If you do not have spirit faction does Dire or the wolves that guard him agro without being attacked? <br />
<br />
I assume your asking if your KOS to Truespirit faction whether they will agro on you.  If you managed to get kos, like an SK or whatever once his epic is done, then yea, he'll agro. Kos is kos.<br />
<br />
If your asking, &quot;If I don't have the right faction&quot; then no, as long as you are not glares or scowls he won't attack you unless you attack him, or say the phrase.<br />
<br />
If I guessed wrong, clarify a little and I can tell you for sure :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>uglytobone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks. You covered part of the question I wanted answered with your second answer. <br />
<br />
You wouldn't happen to know if anyone starts out KOS to true spirit? In other words if anyone doesn't actually take a true spirit faction hit are they KOS?<br />
<br />
Our group is about to attempt Dire with our highest level char being under level 50 so the initial pull will bring his wolf buddies.<br />
<br />
If we are not grouped at anytime during the pull, then once the puller zones will the rest of us be safe if we just happen to be standing at the zone when Dire and friends get there.<br />
<br />
Also would a fear animal spell affect Dire?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm pretty sure nobody start out KOS to true spirit. <br />
<br />
You can have your puller zone or feign and hail dire while  the other wolves return to their spawn point. I'm pretty sure you could harmony pull the first two wolves and then dire, never tried that though. <br />
<br />
Never tried to fear him but if your highest lvl is 50 odds are you'll have trouble landing spells on him, I wouldn't count on any strategy that requires snare and fear to stick relatively early in the battle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">&quot;Fear Animal&quot; won't work... because he's not an animal. Just a general Brand-X monster according to the EQ Beastiary.<br />
A Black Dire  <br />
Monster <br />
Shadowknight <br />
<br />
Hits in the 200s and harmtouches. <br />
<br />
Note that despite being in wolf form, this is NOT flagged as an animal and as such is not susceptible to Animal-Only spells. <br />
Minimum Level: 50    Maximum Level:50<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Question of my own actually.<br />
<br />
What's the minimum level you'd have to be for a single pull?<br />
