<br />
<br />
Adapted from Watlzing matilda.<br />
<br />
Once a jolly ranger, ported to the plane of hate, <br />
Under the shade of a friendly guild's raid, <br />
And he sang as he watched and waited 'til the pulls came in, <br />
&quot;Who'll come a-waltzing, Matilda, with me?&quot; <br />
<br />
Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda <br />
Who'll come a-waltzing, Matilda, with me <br />
And he sang as he watched and waited 'til the pulls came in, <br />
&quot;Who'll come a-waltzing, Matilda, with me?&quot; <br />
<br />
Incomming a minibos pulled out from the upper floor, <br />
Up stepped the ranger and tanked him with glee, <br />
And he sang as he stuck the emerald in his rallic pack, <br />
&quot;You'll come a-waltzing, Matilda, with me&quot;. <br />
<br />
Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda <br />
Who'll come a-waltzing, Matilda, with me <br />
And he sang as he watched and waited 'til the pulls came in, <br />
&quot;Who'll come a-waltzing, Matilda, with me?&quot;. <br />
<br />
Up came the maestro, bringing down a massive train, <br />
Down went the clerics, one, two, three, <br />
&quot;Whose is that jolly emerald you've got in your rallic pack?&quot; <br />
&quot;You'll come a-waltzing, Matilda, with me&quot;. <br />
<br />
Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda <br />
Who'll come a-waltzing, Matilda, with me <br />
And he sang as he watched and waited 'til the pulls came in, <br />
&quot;Who'll come a-waltzing, Matilda, with me?&quot;. <br />
<br />
Up jumped the ranger, weapons twirling snaring three, <br />
&quot;You'll never take me alive,&quot; said he, <br />
And his ghost may be heard as you port up to the plane of hate, <br />
&quot;Who'll come a-waltzing, Matilda, with me&quot;. <br />
<br />
Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda <br />
Who'll come a-waltzing, Matilda, with me <br />
And he sang as he watched and waited 'til the pulls came in, <br />
&quot;Who'll come a-waltzing, Matilda, with me?&quot;</div></div><hr />
