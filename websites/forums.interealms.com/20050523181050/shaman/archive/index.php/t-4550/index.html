<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nikki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Do Shaman solo well indoors?<br />
<br />
I am not online for extended peroids of time so I prefer to solo.<br />
<br />
After Soloing my Bard up to 57 I realized that I have missed out on alot of things.  I can solo anything breathing outside, sure, but I want to be able to solo indoors and Bards without uber equipment are not built for it.  Are Shaman able to be efficient soloers indoors?  If so any tactics would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Short answer - yes. I don't know about efficiency, I don't really care about that aspect of the game that much (I mean min-maxing to the ultimate).<br />
<br />
But I do know I can solo in a dungeon and get xp and not die :)<br />
<br />
I'm currently honing my skills in lower guk - you might laugh but there are a couple of spots where all the mobs are dark blue to me and a very challenging fight - several times I've been evicted from Guk by a mob of angry frogs. But I've solod the frenzied ghoul (easy at my level), and am currently working on the froglok king. After I've done him I'll do the ghoul lord I think.</div></div><hr />
