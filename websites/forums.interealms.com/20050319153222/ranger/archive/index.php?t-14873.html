<br />
the trials to get flagged sucking for me since i'm only 54 but my friends are in PoV and want me to come<br />
<br />
can someone post this *other* route to advance into other planes??</div></div><hr />

I don't remember the details off the top of my head, but you need to turn in 4 different wurm hides to Grimror in PoDisease to get a key for Crypt. I'm guessing the spawn rate / drop rate of the different hides have been increased.</div></div><hr />

<br />
some of the quest is still kind of sketchy... havn't heard of anyone finishing it yet... but i'm sure people are and just don't want it to be as crowded as PoV and PoS are... although its been a lot better recently with people raiding again</div></div><hr />

This would mean you don't have to kill the big bosses of the Desert and Forest area to obtain the flag.<br />
<br />
This both speeds up the process greatly as the minibosses have a much quicker respawn timer and also makes it alot easier to get the flags as the minibosses are alot easier to tackle than the big bosses.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kinkia</div><div class="date">12-04-2002, 10:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is not a bad idea.<br />
<br />
PoV/PoS/PoN/PoI/PoD was the mainstream content.<br />
<br />
CoD/CoDb/HoH/HoHb/ToM/PoTact/PoTorm//SoroTow/PoW/PoF/PoA/PoE/PoTime was too much content to reserve to 1 or 2 guilds per server.<br />
<br />
Yes there are new giant mini bosses in PoS. 2 in Desert and 2 in Forest. They drop a few medalions, a trinket, and spectral. They are like the ocean mini's.<br />
<br />
I don't know yet if the Drunder quest in PoS will be easier. I don't know if the HoH quest in PoV/PoJ will be easier. I don't know if the CoD  quest in PoD will be easier. I hope so though. It would open up a lot more of the expansion. Ubers would still have many zones of content all to themselves.</div></div><hr />

<br />
spawn rates, drop rates for existing quests probably will be upped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tarmor</div><div class="date">12-04-2002, 12:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Desert/Forest Giant mini bosses (similar to the ones in the Ocean area) are in place now as was intended from the start, and the quest NPC has been retuned to give a combine container for medallion pieces instead of using a multi item turn in (which was functioning incorrectly due to faction issues and partial turn ins from other players).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aedail Mistwalker</div><div class="date">12-04-2002, 01:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aedail you guessing or got info, because this makes the quest TOOO easy. <br />
<br />
The new NPC's are definately there, I went over to check on them to confirm they were indeed giants. <br />
<br />
Zertuken the Unyielding and Laruken the Rigid are located in the forest section, inside the forest fort, they come up as white cons at 65 on track.<br />
<br />
Solnebk the Unruly is located inside the tent in the desert area of the zone and Perdubk the Turbulent is located at a rock formation not far from the tent, he has 2 giants standing besides him. These also comes up as white at 65.<br />
<br />
I haven't killed them yet, but I'm 95% sure they will drop medallions.<br />
<br />
And yes, this makes the quest pretty trivial, you can complete it with group in just a few hours, the respawn on the minibosses are about 4-5 hours if it wasn't changed in patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Northerner</div><div class="date">12-05-2002, 06:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Minis are still pretty damn tough for one group.  Even if they drop two each, you are still looking at an exp group of 6 in each location for at least 6 hours per area, at a very minimum.<br />
<br />
Heck, multiple raid flags should not be the only option to advance right?  It's not like the guildless hordes are going to storm PoTime anytime soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dalgonar</div><div class="date">12-05-2002, 07:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The new NPC's drop the medallions, 3 each. No need to drop the big lords anymore unless you really want to bother, the nameds are on a quite fast spawntime too. BoT access seems pretty easy to get now. Oh, and if i remember right the big lord only dropped three medallions instead of five also after the patch...<br />
<br />
This was after the patch on Wed 4th, will see soon what today's patch did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kruull</div><div class="date">12-05-2002, 07:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Mini's Drop too nice of loot too. I hope they move that back to the bosses again. Risk vs Reward was out of wack</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">timcooper</div><div class="date">12-05-2002, 09:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">minis CAN drop spectral scrolls but werer 1 for 8 or so kills<br />
can drop 45hp/mana 5int caster earring<br />
Lords drop nice items and spectrals more commonly<br />
Can do lords with 2-3 grps if have decent tank aka &gt;8K<br />
Minis are doable with 1 grp but 2 makes it easier and xp is good in raid with 2grps.<br />
<br />
Makes BoT flag a joke, and is seriously  a bad idea imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">timcooper</div><div class="date">12-05-2002, 09:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">oops<br />
minis drop 3<br />
Lords drop 4 medallions</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dalgonar</div><div class="date">12-05-2002, 11:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, forest lord is unslowable now (after the patch on 5th day). Unless they seriously upgraded his drops I can't really see why anyone would bother killing him, quads for 1400 hurt :). No idea if the same change applied to desert lord also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">timcooper</div><div class="date">12-05-2002, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">minis now unslowable as well im told</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sasandra</div><div class="date">12-05-2002, 12:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">forest mini's are unslowable, my guild did them last night, not sure about the ocean and desert mini's</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">timcooper</div><div class="date">12-06-2002, 08:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">needf 2 out of 3 medallions<br />
