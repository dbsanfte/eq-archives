<p>Well...much to my surprise, I conned an outside-Cabilis trooper the other day (LegionsOfCabilis faction, I believe) as dubious. I'm a barbarian tribunal-worshipping shaman.<br>
<br>
Now, this leads me to believe that I can get to the point where I'm totally non-kos in Cabilis. It'd be really nice to be able to buy food there and bank and sell. <br>
<br>
So.<br>
<br>
Does anyone know what every faction in Cabilis is, and what I can do to raise them? Thanks.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

Greetings,<br>
<br>
LegionOfCabilis is the Warriors (Troopers)<br>
CitizensOfCabilis (merchants?)<br>
ScaledMystics (shamans)<br>
<br>
Since you are dubious to the troopers, if you go to the Field of bone... and to the Cabilis entrance... the Trooper to the RIGHT side of the zone in has a quest... give him 4 bone chips... you get faction hits with almost every faction group ( I think it is missing necros... ).  Be careful though, there are shadow knights around (Crusaders)... as an Iksar, my faction started higher with troopers than crusaders.<br><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

<p><b><img src="images/icons/Disco_Ball_Face.gif" alt="" width="15" height="15" border="0"> </b></p>

<p>You have to press yourself into the wall <b>beside</b> Trooper Mojo, as far away from the entrance as possible, to hand in bone-chips and avoid a 2 second death to the Crusaders.  Get ready to hand in 4000+ bonechips to get dubious to CrusadersOfGreenmist faction.<br>
<br>
Now that VI has fixed the secondary faction bug, anyone should be able to become non-kos in Cabilis.  The Mojo quest doesn't do necro faction (BroodOfKotiz) but that's only a problem with West Cabilis and one part of East Cabilis (a tavern on the right side of the canal looking away from the shaman guild has a necro inside called Grype).<br>
<br>
To raise necro faction, you have to kill Iksar Bandits, Marauders, Manslayers, Pariahs, Exiles, etc (and LOTS of them).<br>
<br>
I did this as a 40th Cazic-worshipping troll shaman and had to hand in 4000 bonechips to get my faction up.  Best way to get bone-chips is to buy them while slaughtering skeles (with pet <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="">) in Kurn's Tower.  Most people in there are ~15th level and are more than happy to <b>give</b> you every chip they get in exhange for shaman buffs (particularly chloro, tuna and alacrity!)  Even so, it took me 40 hours online collecting bonechips to get 4000 of the buggers.  Cabilis is worth it though... you can:<br>
<br>
 - BANK!!!<br>
 - cut down travelling time<br>
 - buy food, water; sell gear<br>
 - train and buy spells<br>
 - do iksar quests!  (hehe, I like this one <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><br>
<br>
Hope that helps.<br>

<p><b> Damn innoruk and double bone chips</b></p>

<p>I was just about to do a huge Cabilis Faction post but Ysgwyrthyr got there before me <img src="images/smilies/biggrin.gif" border="0" alt=""><br>
<br>
Couple of things he didn't mention.....<br>
<br>
It took him 4000 chips it will take you 8000 to be able to trade. (Same as me coz I worship inny).<br>
<br>
You don't have to do just bopne chips any more since the faction patch, you can do any of the Legion quests (but bone chips is still probably best).<br>
<br>
The alchemy vendors are in West Cabilis.<br>
<br>
The necro Grype is level 30 so if you are a sufficient level, then he won't aggro.<br>
<br>
Another good place to collect bone chips is Paineel as the newbie ground has insta spawn decaying skellys if you are far enough away from the spawn point. I got my 8000 chips here and it took me about 40 hours online time so maybe it is better going here than Kurns (Kurns would be more fun though).<br>
<br>
That's all I can think of for now....<br>
<br>
As far as I know me and Ysg are the only two trolls on CT that can get into Cabilis <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><br>

Cabilis also makes the life of a troll blacksmith a lot easier.  I mean, really, a lot.  Heck, I might even take up pottery.<br>
<br>
Paineel is <b>the</b> bone chip factory.  Start up an Erudite necromancer (you know you want to <img src="images/smilies/biggrin.gif" border="0" alt="">), give your pet a halberd, and get to level 5 just on decaying skeletons.  It won't take long, it will be a nice break, and you'll have several backpacks full.<br>
<br>
If that's too far out of the way, the undead ruins in the NE corner of the Feerrott are pretty good too.<br>

<p>I worships da Cazic Thule. I also kills lots a snarks.<br>
<br>
So far, I hand in over 700 bones to the Trooper Mezo. I am amiable to da Legions, and just squeaked up to Threatening with da Crusaders. Dammit, I wanna be welcome in more than 4 cities in dis world. #5 in Cabilis and #6 in Thurgadin make me nearly twice as popular!<br>
<br>
Speaking of Paineel...some time ago, I heard about how Erudite Clerics who worship da Cazic Thule get disciple symbols dat go round da neck. Dey's also usable by Troll Shaman of da same faith. So, I trek across Norrath, wade my way through Qeynos sewers (where me and a beggar fight over a dead rat), snuck aboard da boat, went invizzes through Erudin, and went up to Paineel's guards to ask for a key to da city when I see da skellies scowlin at me.<br>
<br>
One, how do skellies scowl without lips, and One more than One, how come I'm KOS in Paineel if I'm eligible for the same disciple symbol? Inkies have no problems with Troll worshippers of Innoruuk wearing their symbols. When did the "evil" erudites get so uppity about it?<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

<p><b><img src="images/icons/Dizzy_Face.gif" alt="" width="15" height="15" border="0"> Pretty thorough walkthrough</b></p>

<p>Ok I am a troll shaman that worships Inno, and I did this way back when kunark was just released. The factions will be listed below along with what I consider the best ways to raise them.<br>
<br>
First of all, the factions and who they correspond to...<br>
<br>
Legions of Cabilis--------Troopers and Warrior guild<br>
Scaled Mystics------------Shaman guild<br>
Crusaders of Greenmist----SK Guild<br>
Swifttails (i think hehe)-Monks Guild<br>
Cabilis Residents---------Bankers, most vendors in<br>
                          east cabilis, some vendors<br>
                          in west cabilis, various others<br>
                          especially in east cabilis.<br>
Brood of Kotiz------------Necros, Most Vendors in west<br>
                          cabilis (including alchemy)<br>
<br>
Lots of things will raise legions faction, but only thing I have found so far that raises Brood of Kotiz faction, as another poster pointed out, are the iksar bandit types. (Footpad, bandit, manslayer, etc.) My recommendation if you are just starting out on cabilis faction is to kill iksar bandit types exclusively if you can. This will raise the all important legions faction (needed for most of the faction quests that are easy to do) as well as the necro faction. This is good because you will then be non kos in west cabilis as well after you finish the faction quests, and also because they sell muffins and milk in west cab <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><br>
<br>
The bone chip quest in FoB is offered by Trooper Mogo at the cab entrance. You can be relatively close to him, but should definitely be as close to the wall as possible to avoid aggro from crusaders. Also, be warned...if you think you are close to finally being non kos with the crusaders, do not make the judgement based on /con of Crusader Quarg....he is some slightly strange faction so that you can actually be dubious with him, yet still threateningly by Crusader Bodli and all others. If you do the bone chips quest all the way through making Crusader Bodli dubious to you, then you will be non kos to almost all of east cabilis. If you are an agnostic, you probably will be non kos to all, unless you didn't work on necro faction, then yes, Grype will kos you, but he is only up in the upstairs of the Tink and Bauble (sp?) during the nightime (in-game) hours. If you are a worshipper of Inno, like myself, then at this point you will still be KOS with the bankers, 2 iksars at the hut right by the bank (ones name is Jozter), Haggle Baron, and Haggle Baron's assistant guy (upstairs in Tink and Bauble in Grype's place during daylight in-game hours). <br>
<br>
Anyhow that is how it works, so working up till apprehensive with crusader bodli would be recommended to make sure that you are probably high enough faction that nothing in east cab will kos you. Good luck, and sorry if this started rambling...because I seomtimes start rambling hehe<br>

<p><b> Quarg</b></p>

<p>Crusader Quarg is on Scaled mystics faction, and you get a bonus to this being a shaman, so it goes dubious before Crusaders do, you also get a bonus to Monks (Swifttails) as well for some unknown reason.<br>
<br>
As far as I know only the initiate synbol of Cazic thule has been found and yes CT trolls can wear it but you have to faction Paineel to do it.<br>
<br>
Trooper <b>MOZO</b> has the bone chip quest despite all the misspellings above <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><br>

<p><b><img src="images/icons/icon3.gif" alt="Lightbulb" width="15" height="15" border="0"> Paineel segway..</b></p>

<p>I've read the bit about Paineel on AllaKhazam's site. Very good info, btw.  Read the "Faction" thread. Very in-depth for raising Paineel faction.  One question though.  Is it possible to get one of the bone keys to gain access to the city itself or will you have to find someone to let you in?  I know that newbie evil erudites have a no drop, lore bone key that locks and unlocks the elevator.  How would a non-erudite obtain one of those?  As a lizzie shammy, I thoght that it would be kinda nice to have another out-of-the-way city to hang out it.  lol.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

<p>to get a key get someone to let you in and hail one of the guards (once your faction is good of course)<br>
<br>
they will ask you if you need a key.<br>
<br>
respond to them and they hand you a key.<br>

<p><b><img src="images/icons/Mad_As_Hell.gif" alt="" width="15" height="15" border="0"> </b></p>

<p>Hmm... Paineel scowls so we save that for another day.<br>
<br>
Me immediate problem is Cab.  Me hand in maybe 2500 bone chips and Crusader Quaq and Crusader Bodli (?) still scowl at me.  Through a combination of gobbies and iksar bandits and bones, Troopers are Kindly.  I conned a Klok someone in Warsilik and he is dubious.  I think I did about 2500 bones.  It may be more or less, but certainly more than 2000 and maybe even 3000.<br>
<br>
Am I close?  Is it hopeless or will it change in 4 more bones?  I do see the bug fix works and factions change when I turn in bones.  How many more bones you think it take?  Me did some of them 2500 bones before the bug fix, but once me hit the bug me stopped until it was fixed.<br>
<br>
By the way, I read a thread somewhere else you can turn in 4 stacks of 4 and get faction for all....I tried it and it works.  real time saver.<br>
<br>
Me Ogre Shaman and as far as I know me no hurt crusader facrtions.<br>
<br>
Please tell Torvo if Crusaders at least start Threatening soon at least!  me sad and discouraged.  <img src="images/smilies/frown.gif" border="0" alt=""><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

<table border="0" width="218"> <tr>    <td align="center" width="119"><font color="FFFFFF">up to -801</font></td>   <td width="85"><font color="FFFFFF">Scowling</font></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td align="center" width="119"><font color="FFFFFF">-800 to -501</font></td>    <td width="85"><font color="FFFFFF">Threatening</font></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td align="center" width="119"><font color="FFFFFF">-500 to -101</font></td>    <td width="85"><font color="FFFFFF">Dubious</font></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td align="center" width="119"><font color="FFFFFF">-100 to -1</font></td>    <td width="85"><font color="FFFFFF">Apprehensive</font></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td align="center" width="119"><font color="FFFFFF">0 to 100</font></td>    <td width="85"><font color="FFFFFF">Indifferent</font></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td align="center" width="119"><font color="FFFFFF">101 to 500</font></td>    <td width="85"><font color="FFFFFF">Amiably</font></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td align="center" width="119"><font color="FFFFFF">501 to 800</font></td>    <td width="85"><font color="FFFFFF">Kindly</font></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td align="center" width="119"><font color="FFFFFF">801 or more</font></td>    <td width="85"><font color="FFFFFF">Warmly</font></td>  </tr></table><br>
<br>
Now, most race/class/deity combinations have a starting fakshun of -1500 with Iksar fakshuns.  Cazic-Thule worshippers get a +500 bonus (or, rather, they don't get the extra 500 penalty) so they start at -1000 with Iksar fakshuns.  Da bonechip quest gives one point per four chips.  Dis means me needed ta hand in 2000 chips (+500 points) ta get to dubious (i.e. -1000 + 500 = -500).  Anyone else will need an extra 2000 chips.<br>
<br>
Threatening starts at -800 or maybe -750, not sure, so you either need 2800 or 3000 chips to become threatening.  You should be close Torvo.  You'll need 4000 chips to go unmolested on dubious (except fer da necros, still kos ta dem) but you still won't be able to buy/sell with the vendors.  You'll need to give *another* 1600 chips to be able to buy and sell (apprehensive starts at -100).<br>
<br>
Assuming they still have the +/-2000 point cap from starting faction, the best fakshun a non-Cazic worshipper can get is Kindly (with 8000 chips) or maybe one point into amiable.  Maybe that cap isn't there anymore though (???).<br>
<br>
BTW, all merchants (including Iksar Kloks) con dubious at worst.  Thus, even if their fakshun is scowling, they'll still con dubious and won't attack.  This change was in a patch shortly after Kunark was released.<br>
<br>
Hope dat helps.<br>
<br>
Yzzy, beloved of lizzies<br>
<br>
<br>
PS: Oh yeah, methinx Fulaq mentioned it above but... once one of da crusaders becomes dubious, you need to do another 200 chips (50 points) to get the other crusader, and the rest of Cabilis, to dubious.  I think Fulaq gave their names above and which was which, can't see it here... <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><br>

<p><b> Yzzy</b></p>

<p>OK Yzzy is pretty much on the nail.<br>
<br>
<b>Cazic thule worshippers and Agnostic characters:</b><br>
<br>
-1000 to all Cabilis factions<br>
<br>
<b>Characters with Good gods:</b><br>
<br>
-2000 to all cabilis factions<br>
<br>
<b>Characters with evil gods which are not cazic thule:</b><br>
<br>
-1000 troopers<br>
-1500 Scaled Mystics<br>
-1500 Swittails<br>
-1550 Crusaders<br>
-2000 Merchants<br>
<br>
Torvo you fall in the above category....so if you have handed in 5000 bone chips you will have ammassed 1,250 faction points, This should easily put you into threatening if not dubious with most factions (except necros).  You can't have far to go man.<br>
<br>
Yzzy's Long answer was right on the money, but his short answer is a little off I think. You just need to multiply the amount of faction points you need by 4 to get the amount of chips you need to hand in.<br>
<br>
Keep it up Cabilis is a superb city, your faction with merchants will cap at Indifferently, with sufficient CHA you can get the best prices in there and it has <b>everything</b> you could ever need.<br>

<p>Before, I stated I had gotten up threatening with the Crusaders. Now I'm back to scowling somehow, and my tally is up to 1000. I worship CZ. Plus, I'd mainly bought bone chips from newbies in EC. Guess I'll set up a bone chip mule in Paineel now...<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

<p>That gud news.  Me get discouraged when me hands in so many bones and see no change at all.  Can never tell if it really changing or not.  Now me do more.<br>
<br>
<br>
By the way, me con scowling to both Quaq and Bodli, but me thought me used to be threatening to one.  Me no wrote down so just assumed it mistake.  That was before the patch (maybe they reset it?) Me gave a lot of bones before the patch until me factions stopped changing.<br>
<br>
Oh well, once crusaders start to go to threatening me will feel better.  It seems that initial change is da hardest for me.  And once they no KOS me, then me feel lot better because won't be so risky handing in chips.<br>

First off Verant removed the faction cap a few patches back so you can now raise your faction with these guys by questing or with the troopers by killing mobs even if you used to not get faction from doing so. Second off the bone chips quest along with watcher torches, sarnak brains, scorpion pincers, etc all give the same factions it's just that bone chips are stackable and you can even turn them in 16 at a time by dropping stacks of 4 in all four trade slots with the trooper, this makes it the preferred quest for such a huge faction change. <br>
<br>
All the guards with names Trooper something along with the Warrior NPCs are on Legion of Cabilis faction. <br>
<br>
All the guards with names Crusader something EXCEPT Quarg along with all the Shadow Knight NPCs are on Crusaders of Greenmist faction. <br>
<br>
Crusader Quarg and all the Shaman NPCs are on Scaled Mystics faction, you can tell Quarg is with the shaman because he is part of one of their quests even though he IS a shadow knight. <br>
<br>
Swifttails is the faction of all the Monk NPCs <br>
Brood of Kotiz is the Necromancers in West Cabilis along with a few Iksar NPCs in East Cabilis. <br>
<br>
Troopers can be raised by killing Sarnak and Goblins in many Kunark Zones. Brood of Kotiz can be raised by killing outcast/forsaken/etc iksars in many Kunark Zones. <br>
The rest can only be raised with quests, the best source for this being the bone chips quest in Field of Bone. <br><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

<p>"Troopers can be raised by killing Sarnak and Goblins in many Kunark Zones. Brood of Kotiz can be raised by killing outcast/forsaken/etc iksars in many Kunark Zones."<br>
<br>
Me friend and I killed things in drreadlands one morning before we realized it was hurting iksar necro faction.  me killed lots of iksar bandits/marauders/etc since then.  Do you know:<br>
<br>
1.  if the stuff in dreadlands hurt same as each kill of bandit helps?  In other words, if me hurt it 20 times will 20 bandits put it where it started?  Or will I need kill 10 bandits to fix each bad kill?<br>
<br>
2. If me get back to starting faction, how many bandits me need kill?  Me found a 6-spawn with two 3-spwans nearby so can kill at good rate.  me also kill wanderers when buying bones from newbies in FOB.<br>
<br>
Once I get all the bone factions fixed and the necro faction fixed, will there be anything still KOS to ogre shaman?  Me would love an entire city where me totally non-KOS!  Right now, Oggok is only one me think.<br>
<br>
Ok, me go play now.<br>

<p><b> Confusion reigns :)</b></p>

<p>As far as I know there is nothing in Dreadlands that will lower your brood of Kotiz faction, sarnaks will lower your brood of Dizok faction, which is a different thing entirely.  So that might be what you were noticing Torvo.<br>
<br>
The forsaken (Bandits etc...) give you one faction point per kill, so from start you need to kill 2000 to get to indifferent in West cabilis.<br>
<br>
Once you get all your bonechips and Forsaken killing done you should be:<br>
<br>
Necro's indifferent<br>
Merchants indifferent<br>
Monks amiable<br>
Shaman amiable<br>
Warriors kindly/warmly<br>
Sk's amiable<br>
<br>
There are no other factions in Cabilis, you will be not KOS anywhere at all in the city and can wander freely, trade bank train etc. etc. etc.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

<p>Me did 600 more bones since last post with no change in faction, so me gots to be close to that 3000.<br>
<br>
Hope you right about the brood factions.  Me killed maybe a few hundred bandit types already.  It would be great to have another city where me can roam completely non-kos.  Oggok and evil outposts only ones right now... even grobb have some NPC no like me.  There only one NPC in FV kos.<br>
<br>
If me get Iksar, there only one NPC in all Kunark from playable race cities that would be KOS to me (a barbie in FV).<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

<p>Aye, once it moves it moves a lot faster.  Guag went to dubious and shortly after Bodli did too.<br>
<br>
Went inside and cast Insiduous Vision on necro lizzy friend and I think we conned every NPC in E Cab and FoB.  All dubious or warmly, except for the neco on the second floor.  He scowled, so guess a lot of bandits will have to die. <img src="images/smilies/wink.gif" border="0" alt=""><br>

<p>Be careful camping near guards and NPC's there is a bug which happens very occasionally, when you log in the game loads your gained faction as you enter the world, if this doesn't sync properly you will be KOS for about 0.5 seconds, if they aggro you in this time, you will stay aggroed.<br>
<br>
PS the necro in E cab is too low level to aggro you<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

<br>
Yes you have a Loooong way to go the trainer is on Scaled mystics faction, the spell vendors are on CabRes Faction<br>
<br>
6,000 bonechips till you can train<br>
<br>
7,600 bonechips till you can buy spells<br>
<br>
8,000 bonechips till you can get good prices<br>
<br>
(Above only applies to Barbie shammies)<br>

So yes a hell of a long way.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

<br>
Thanks.  you been great help.  Me suspected this bug because one time guard in N Freeport aggro'd on me when me logged in for no reason.  Me was careful to camp where me think no guard walks by (me hope).  Is it rare bug or common?<br>
<br>
Me glad to here necro won't aggro on me.  me be careful not sit by him.  In Misty Thicket, me did a quest with a  greenie wh hated me, but me big enough he no fight me.  Any quest me can 'force-feed' a necro to get faction faster?<br>
<br>
Oh, me see froggies slaves, but iksar tell me they no get guards to help them and they low low green.  They no aggro on me either even though threatening.<br>
<br>
fiannly, any neat quest me can do now that normally Ogre no get do?  (assume me fix factiona  bit more).<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

<p><b> DE Rogue, a worshipper of Innoruuk</b></p>

<p>I have turned in more bonechips than I can remember.  EVERYONE in East Cabilis is now non-KOS, except for the two bankers, and two nearby NPC's (Joxxter and Frizzaz?).  As a DE worshipper of Innoruuk, is there hope for the bankers?  I have slowy watched all the other NPC's go from scowling, to threatening, to dubious, but the bankers haven't budged, and they still scowl.  As a Rogue, I can bank and sell, but I would like to remove the worry that something can go wrong and I get turned into a snack for the Iksar.<br>
Has any other DE Innoruuk worshipper made a dent in the banker con, or am stuck sneaking and hiding for the rest of my life?<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

CAUTION  CAUTION CAUTION!<br>

This necro will absolutely aggro on a standing lvl 54 ogre shaman, even if you are outside of the building.  And with the crusader nearby, death is near instant.  Me found out hard way.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

<p><b> By the way.....</b></p>

<p>I have found that the easiest way to collect bone chips is to grab all of your "monk junk" out of you bank.  Then go to FOB, and auction Item 1 for x number of bone chips, Item 2 for y number of bone chips....and so on.  Let everyone know that you will be back in 5 to 6 hours to trade.  Come back in 5 hours and collect your bone chips =).<br>
<br>
Same thing with necro stuff for Painel.<br>
<br>
Works like a charm, and more effective then just offering money.<br>

<p>Well, me no like getting whacked by necro and dying, so me work more on necro faction.<br>
<br>
Me make a little loop in warslisks.... kill da 6-spawn, run to end of river and kill 3 easy spawns then 3 more near there, then back to 6-spawn which is almost ready to respawn by then. It take about 7 minutes max to da the loop of 12 kills.  So, if me no see stragglers that 35 seconds a kill, or about 100 per hour.  Me did about 400 tonight and no idea how many in past.<br>

How many kills to dubious?<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

Yur fakshun wif da dead lizzies shudda started at -2000 (deep scowling).  Ya need ta get ta -500 fer dubious so dat means 1500 forsaken... dat's a lot more fingas an toes dan me gots.  Dam glad me be a Cazic-Fearin troll, it were only 500 yellow lizzies fer me... only 500... *sigh*<br>
<br>
<b>Story time:</b><br>
Wen me first raised all me Cabilis fakshuns but necros, me decided ta take a peek inside East Cabilis.  Dis was real early days and me didna know if der were any lizzies on da necro fakshun in East Cabilis or not.  Me'd not heard o' Grype at dis time.<br>
<br>
So me's bein real careful like, inchin forward, lookin everywhere, conning everythin, jumpin every time a trooper or crusader came 'round a corner, yu know da deal.  Me was jumpin coz me remembered wot happened wen me finally got ta dubious wif Crusader Quarg... me stepped away frum da wall me'd been pressed against fer days and... ****SPAM****... three screenfuls of red an white text in two seconds followed by... LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...  Who'd hav thort Quarg an Bodli went ta diffrent skools?<br>
<br>
Anywayz, me's creepin 'round as me sed wen Grype starts sayin 'I hate trolls like you!' or sumptin like dat.  Da nearby Crusader joins in da slangin match.  Him obviously like Grype more dan me.  Da ting is, it scared me so much dat me musta jerked da mouse an moved forward, fallin inta da water.  Den it went all quiet... me gots no idea wot happened but me had plenty o' time ta gate outta der.  Mebbe, for once, me was saved by bad pathin, hehe.  Hadta go outside an hammer in a coughin nail tho ta slow down me heart!<br>
<br>
G'luk wif da dead lizzies brudda.<br>

<p>'Dat necro aggro's on me even though he wasn't supposed to.  Me was running by da building he live in and me stopped for a second 'cause me had to duck below da porch ceiling.  Me die so fast me managed only take a few steps back, so me had da necro, the crusader, and da vendor who give the final blow.</p>

<p>BroodOfKotiz -- iksar necro guild and some merchants<br>
raise:  kill iksar bandits, iksar marauders, etc<br>
<br>
BroodOfDiZok -- sarnaks<br>
SarnakCollective -- sarnaks<br>
lower:  kill sarnaks<br>
<br>
I was confused too until this thread, since "brood" implies birdies.  With all the typos this game has had, maybe BroodOfKotiz was supposed to say <i>Blood</i> of Kotiz, like the Bloodsabers necro guild of Qeynos.  Or maybe they really did mean Brood, like a brood of lizards.</p>

<p><b> Status</b></p>

<p>Me indifferent to all crusaders and vendors in E Cab.  Can bank, train, buy/sell.  necros still hate me, figure about 800-1000 kills to dubious. <br>
<br>
By the way, and Ogre draws quite a crowd at the bank, but it's a great place to auction because more mid-level characters with hordes of bones in the city than FOB.</p>

<p>Me now AMIABLE to vendors and Crusaders, Warmly to troopers and Dubuios to Necros.<br>
<br>
Me now totatally non-KOS in cabalis!  Bones and killing bandits still giving all the usual faction increases too.</p>

Assuming they still have the +/-2000 point cap from starting faction, the best fakshun a non-Cazic worshipper can get is Kindly (with 8000 chips) or maybe one point into amiable.  Maybe that cap isn't there anymore though (???).<br>

Me warmly to troopers, so maybe it no capped anymore... which means me can somedat get best prices in city.</p>

<p><b> Keep it up</b></p>

<p>Cab is without a doubt the BEST city in Kurnak and is almost required if you plan upon playing alot [and leveling] in Kurnak.  Having access to a guild trainier, your spells and a full city [alchemy and trade skill vendors] is well worth the time you will spend improving your faction.<br>
<br>
It took me about a week to get my DE Necro no indiff or better with all factions and once I make 34th I plan upon doing the same with my Barb Shaman.  Cab just has to many good things about it to pass up.<br>

<p>OK, where can I find a lot of these outcast iksar?  preferably a big ol clump of them on a reasonably fast respawn?<br>
<br>
Would like to start hunting in Kunark dungeons which will trash my VS faction soon.<br>
<br>
Then again, may just be easier to do warbraids a few million more times. <br>
<br>
My Grobb faction may even be in jeopardy, since it looks like it will take many a ruby to get my ivandyr's, once I gather up enough cash to do it.  Did about 15 before, knocked me down to indiff with dabashers.<br>

<p>there are lots of them in a cave in WW and in a cave in FOB.<br>
<br>
Not sure on exact locs but the one in FOB is directly across from the Tangrin isle.<br>
<br>
Don't trash your VS faction till you get your port hammer though. I spent a few days collecting tails to get to amiable, got my hammer, then went to HS and went KOS in 2 hours of hunting :P<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
