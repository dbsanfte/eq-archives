<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was reading up today on Bards songs and was relieved to be reminded that they stack with Enchanter and Shaman slow songs. I am using Largo's melodic binding sometimes and Selo's consonant chain sometimes. Does anyone know the extent of this? At 35 I can visibly see the difference when I use, much like when my shaman casts slow. They seem to just stop in their tracks almost. Any other spells or things I should be aware of?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Willowwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sorry for the absence as of late but school and my current Studio Max projects take a huge chunk of time.  <br />
<br />
Ok as far as the songs your selo's consonant chain is your snare and with a good drum it works awesome.  The largo's is nice but it's area effect.  When pulling only one mob it is nice.  At 35 you should be able to kite and fear kite like the dickens :).  Now here's what to do.   Use Selo's Consonant Chain, Boastful Bellow, and Fufill's Curtailing Chant.   Mixing 3 songs shouldnt be hard later on you'll get the speed of using your keys and will be able to do 4 songs.  Once you hit 39 mix in your Tuyen's Chant of Flame instead of the bellow.  <br />
<br />
If you can get a Walrus Skin Drum it is only slightly less effective than Selos Drums of the March and is better than Nostrolos Tamborine.  At level 39+ you'll really no longer have a need for melee unless you want to get your defense and weapon skills up.  At 48 with my Walrus Skin Drum, weaving 3 dots and my snare I do 331dmg which I continuously stack.  Also if you want to show off to those quad kiting druids dont use your snare song but mix in your accelerandro and kite 10 things at once :).  <br />
<br />
If you want some help or another Bard to group with give me a message.  My email is willowwing@hotmail.com . My ingame times are limited to only 2 weeknights at most and a weekend.  I try to get together with KoE if I can on a Saturday because I know something will be going on.  Also if you want a good piercer I have one.  A Sainy's Claw.  Falamil/Fallanthas gave it to me as a wedding gift a few months back and after the KoE hosted Hate raid I got 2 good weapons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The snare and AC debuff effect of Largos will stack, the slow component will not.  I still use it a lot, even when grouped with a shaman and a druid, for the AC debuff.<br />
<br />
<br />
Check out www.eqsongs.com.  Very good analysis on all of the songs, other than the ones added with SoL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have read on eqdiva and other message boards that the slow does stack now. It was patched.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fallanthas Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hrmm, might be an unintended effect of giving us stacking haste songs.<br />
<br />
<br />
Time to test!<br />
<br />
<br />
With a shaman and a bard, we can get to 100% slow easily.  Enchanter and bard would be in the neigborhood of 85%</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well I have further questions about charming. I believe there may have been changes since I tried this many months ago. Charm used to last for too short of a duration for me to mess with it. Supposedly now it last almost 3 ticks. Also they had changed it so that the charmed mob would not auto attack if you were attacked. <br />
<br />
So in short how is charm working now? My cha is between 100 and 110. Do you have macros set up to make targeting easier? It was always such a pain to have to retarget the mob you were charming, charm it, then retarget the mob you wanted it to hit every few seconds. So much so that I never used it. I hear people talking about using charm a lot and wonder what I am missing. How is it possible to make this work better. The mezzing part I have down. Charming I need help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fallanthas Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Bem,<br />

I did a little research on the stacking question this morning.  I still haven't found a reference to the songs slow effect being made stackable.  All the other components of the song will hit, though.  If you use Largo's, you will still get the snare and AC debuff effects, but a higher slow from an enchanter or shaman will cance the slow effect of the song.  Still looking, I hope you are right and I am wrong on this one.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As far as charm, if we are talking about just two mobs it's not that tough.  More than two makes it darn near impossible.  <br />
<br />
You will want three hotkeys.  <br />
<br />
1.  One with your charm song and a message to let your group know which mob you are charming.<br />
<br />
2.  One with the command /pet attack (pretty sure you know how this one works ;) )<br />
<br />
3.  An assist key set to whoever is tanking in your current group.<br />
<br />
<br />
Target your soon to be pet, hotkey 1 to charm.  As soon as it sticks, use F8 to target the hostile and hit hotkey 2.  Then hit F1 twice to retarget your pet  (NOTE: I am assuming you are noncombat and letting your pet tank.  If you are tanking as well, ignore the bold text).  <br />
When your pet breaks, it's hotkey 1 again and repeat the sequence (NOTE:  If you don't have your pet targetted when it breaks, back up and use F8 again.  The former pet will stick to you like glue and should be the closest hostile).  I also like to have Hymn hotkeyed and fire it up as soon as I send the pet in to heal any damage I may be taking from the two during the charm break.  <br />
Whatever you do, DO NOT charm the mob you have been beating on unless your former pet is at very, very low health.  As long as you haven't hit the target mob, he will turn to fight your pet.  If you have damaged him in any way, or otherwise generated hate (i.e. charm), he will come after you and ignore your pet.  This means that: <br />
A.  your pet is dealing very little damage while chasing the target, <br />
<br />
B. your pet isn't TAKING damage (remember, you want to finish him off next), and <br />
C. You are getting beat on.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
A full charm is 15 seconds.  Once you get a feel for the duration, you can be backing away from both mobs while recasting charm (assuming you have the room to do so) and take very little damage.  With hotkeys, you can have your pet back on target in less than a second after recharming.  <br />
<br />
Charm works better than mez until level 53, especially from level 40 to 52.  Crissons pixie strike (your low level mez) has a terrible resist rate.  Charm goes in much easier.  Once you get Song of Twighlight at 53, you will use charm less and less.<br />
<br />
One last note, 120 CHA seems to be the best target for charming.  I haven't seen any difference in running CHA higher than this, but there is a noticable difference in resist rate with your CHA lower than 120.  Pick up a set of opaline earrings and 7 CHA bracers when you can.  They are cheap and should put you over 120.  Switch em out for AC when in a full group.<br />
P.S. ( I'm sure all this pet control looks pretty familiar to you, Bemidian.  I wrote most of this assuming others might want to try the technique as well)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">This is where I read about the songs. Maybe they are just talking about the snare component. I don't know. http://www.eqdiva.com/songs.asp?song=26 <br />
<br />
As to charming, I hate to ask this but what does F8 do? I have never used that. My question was also about the charmed mob auto attacking your attacker. When I was doing this before they would just stand there while you were being hit until you told them to attack. And I am more interested in how to solo this way right now rather than how this works in a group. Also it would not let me cast charm on the mob while it was already charmed. I had to wait until it broke. This means if I start the charm song after it breaks there will be a several second delay while I am recharming. Then I have to retarget the mob I want it to attack and send it again. The issue with not being able to recharm while it was charmed is what made me stop using charm while soloing. You can remezz them but not charm, or at least it used to be that way. I charm animals all the time as a Druid but it lasts a while and I have time to retarget and such.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fallanthas Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">F8 targets the nearest hostile NPC.  Well, the nearest NPC that isn't a pet, actually.  Pets will attack now only after you are aggroed, so you have to either tell them to attack or get hit at least once for the pet to go back in.<br />
<br />
<br />
Using F8 and a /pet attack hotkey, you can get your pet back on target very fast.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think the key to charm soloing is having room to do it.  If you can back away from your pet a bit and back up while recasting charm, you won't get hit much.<br />
<br />
<br />
And no, you cannot recharm until charm breaks.  This works the same way for all charms, as far as I am aware.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, stick to outdoor zones where you can get some room to maneuver.  If you want to avoid getting hit altogether, twist in Selos just before the break and back away while recasting.  Or buy SoW potions and keep SoW up.  Either will keep you out of range while you recast, F8, and hit your /pet attack hotkey.<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S.  ( Another great way to do this is to partner with a druid.  If the mobs are snared you are guaranteed to take almost no damage, and a nuke or two is handy to finish off your pet after the first target goes down.  Very mana efficient, almost no downtime at all.)</div></div><hr />
