Waiting for your commentary :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>oOga[FoH]</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It was a crazy crazy fight.. I have been a member of FoH since the first month of final release and quite honestly, nothing to date compares to the fight we had last night.. Everyone performed their duties to perfection and we finally got him after over 30 long minutes.. When we started gathering the items necessary to take Seru down it felt like it would never end.. It was not fun one bit, and as an officer, it was very challenging at times to keep people motivated to press on.. Let alone myself.. We went after him for our first run on Monday night.. We had taken in folks for initial testing as we gathered the necessary items, but Monday night was our first full force attempt.. And well, he spanked us hard.. I was furious.. I was asking myself over and over why on earth would Verant require a nearly 60 day GUILD effort just to get to him, then to find out that we all completely wasted our time.. The developers already have so much on their plates that there was no way in hell they were going to set aside the needs of the majority of the 400k+ player base to retune Seru for a measly 50 people.. Dont get me wrong, we have been in this position in nearly every expansion.. This is definitely not new.. However, nothing had required the incredible time sinks as the end game content in Luclin does.. We had put in our time, and god damnit, we wanted our paychecks..<br />
<br />
Well there was no way in hell we were going to wait around for Seru to get tuned.. So we did what we do best.. We put our heads together, crunched numbers and killed the sob.. Everyone had to give 110% effort or the win would be out of reach.. I can honestly say that each and every person put in 150% and we accomplished our goal..<br />
<br />
Now that Seru is dead and we have the attention of the developers, we can get the finer points of the encounter tuned properly.. Many things about the fight such as guard repops, pathing and features of Seru himself are damn right absurd.. Kendrick, the original designer of Sanctus Seru and Lord Inquisitor before he departed from Verant last year, will even tell you the same on page 3 of this post: http://www.fohguild.org/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=677<br />
<br />
The loot was great and I can't wait to go after him again.. And yes, he can be yawned.. Although I will warn you, without a Trollbane turgur, its a pain in the ass..<br />
<br />
Cheers!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Other then acquiring the weapons it took to kill him, why was this guy so hard?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>oOga[FoH]</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">A wiz on graffe's forums summed it up pretty well so I will just paste his summary.. Enjoy!<br />
<br />
He hits in the 700's with a non existant delay. His damage output simply fowns the avatar of wars. He cannot be hit except with serubane weapons (supposively monk fists too, dunno) has insane AC, has a perma AE rain with 500dmg 750manadrain unresistable. Flurries on top of his already insane delay. Basically, yah. Bad Mutha F*cka.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Forgot to add that he procs a 200dmg 20sec unresistable stun as well!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>WhiteandBlack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">After reading Furor's post I found it amazing the time sinks Verant comes up with, and I thought the VP key quest was a pain gzzz.<br />
<br />
Some general questions, if you don't mind, without giving away strat:<br />
<br />
Is the sword All/All (the one needed to kill him)?<br />
Now that FoH has the swords can you gank him on pop, or is the a time sink you have to redo?<br />
Just curious what was your role in that insane fight?<br />

The answer to that remains to be seen!  Who knows, it may be for a quest down the road so we are holding on to them.. But afaik there is no use for it currently other then to piss people off..</div></div><hr />

People like to exaggerate. His delay however seems to be very low. I doubt his DPS is higher than the AoW's after he is slowed. Even with the rain.</div></div><hr />

I played with Kendrick old school pre kunark on test server, let me tell you he is a total jack as-s.<br />
<br />
He would get mad at you if you didn't do huge damage, when all his stuff was gm created disgustingly overpowered.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">What seperates the best guilds from the other &quot;uber&quot; guilds is dedication and determination. <br />
Time doesn't matter in this, it's the will to focus on something, while other &quot;uber&quot; guilds spend their times farming.<br />
<br />
You are right if you say uber guilds invest alot more time than the guilds with tons of casual players. Then again no casual player can be as &quot;good&quot; as the hardcore gamer in EQ and there's no point in comparing accomplishments therefore.<br />
<br />
To be the best in EQ(whatever this means) the basic requirement is time, but time at hand alone doesn't make you the best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Thumbs up to oOga and Kazlaaz for taking the time to post on Shaman board about Shaman issues.   If I had a Axe to grind with FoH ... I would take it to their boards.    Good to see all sides of issues being covered here ... from Newbie questions to Uber End Game fights.<br />
<br />
Thanks guys for the update and Congra's.   On a break through fight like this ... it's good to know that Shaman's have a role.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It isn't. A &quot;scientist&quot; is simply a person who studies and learns about something through a systematic, analytical approach. There's no special trick to it. It's just matter of finding information and figuring out what to do with it. Having more time to spend finding the information obviously helps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I beg to differ, I have played with plenty of people who play ALOT but still suck (take Illia from Illia's Beastiary, 3 years to get lvl 60).<br />
<br />
And in FPS games some players are just naturally good.  I bet good ole Thresh could come back and play Quake 3 which he isn't hardcore into and still own.  Or someone like Soso, Gadianton, or [B_Blade]Leader in StarCraft.</div></div><hr />

Cause I guarantee you if we're being denied content, guess who suffers? The average Joe guy on the street. The same poor schmuck who always suffers. Yea, YOU DUMBASS.<br />
<br />
Oh yah, and I am hope the Veeshan server people won't suffer now, AKA &quot;same poor shmuck&quot;. FoH wasn't denied &quot;content&quot;.<br />

<br />
/boggle somebody sucks just because they took 3 years to get to lvl 60?  What kind of value judgement is that?  There ARE other things to the game besides levelling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">lol ... people can flame (or at least try to flame) FoH for many things but one thing that should stand above all on them.   They pay the price in time, effort, and thought on winning these encounters ... doing it their way.    Sure there are other ways to do things ... but alot of the top end encounters have been done by FoH in one way or the other.<br />
<br />
But I've been more impressed that Shaman's from FoH drop by - post - and comment on things from their prespective.   It certainly makes interesting reading.</div></div><hr />

I would have to echo what someone else stated above, if you have a problem with FoH go to their board to bitch.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, Ooga what was your role exactly? Just curious.<br />

<br />
 <br />
<br />
3 years to make level 60  != playing a lot.<br />
<br />
thats like an average of 1.7 levels every month. <br />
<br />
yes it helps to play a lot.  no, the casual player will not be as good in this situation.  The casual player will get bored, leave the raid, not have all the key shi+ done.  While the powergamer would be hacking at 4-5 keys done for people still have mass amounts of AA and be able to play the entire duration of the raid more then likely playing 2 or more PC's.<br />
<br />
Grats on killing this freak FoH.</div></div><hr />
