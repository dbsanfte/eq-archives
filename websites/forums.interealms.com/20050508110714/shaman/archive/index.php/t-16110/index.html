<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I couldn't care less. The day that I go on a raid and the raid leader says &quot;okay our main slower is going to be our Beastlord&quot; I might have a problem but I dont see that being any day soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It time for a new dabate of this? They have had the ability awhile and ive never felt pinched out by them having the 65% slow. If it hasn't happen now i dont know that its going too. I mean least they have the shaman spells and have to level to earn the slow not lke some of the spells and efferts that get pimped out to items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Pop has been out for 7ish months and so far I have yet to be threatened by beastlord slow.  I come across the occasional group that uses a beastlord as a slower, but really that is fine with me.  Not every group should have to have a chanter or shaman.  It is good to have a third class available to fill the vital slower role.  Whenever I join a group that was using a beastlord to slow, everyone, especially the beastlord, is happy to have me take over slows.<br />
<br />
Like someone else said, the day my raidleader says &quot;Ok, our main slower is going to be a beastlord tonight, Jinheim is going to be joining the clerics and using kraggs in a CH loop&quot; is the day I will have a problem with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>DvenMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have both at 65 shaman and a 65 Beastlord<br />
<br />
Here are my thoughts since i have played both alot in exp groups and raids.<br />
<br />
Raids- No contest shaman arent gonna be loosing there jobs to a beastlord. Raid mobs need the best slow that can be slapped on them.<br />
Alot of times when i playing my beast in fact i dont even mem slow. ( like if we have 6 shamans etc) I dont see any threat here from beast having 65% slow.<br />
<br />
Exp groups- 65% slow when playing my beast is nice, make alot of difference soloing but...its nearly impossible to slow anything named or normal mobs with high MR since beasts have no debuffs. But in exp groups minus named mobs you can barely notice the difference, and as long as there is a bard,enchanter,mage that can debuff named beast can slow it (albiet not as easy) as a shaman. Now for getting a group i never had a problem getting a group with either class. Slowers are pretty much a needed class for exp. But i have found it to be a little easier as a beast to get a group than even with shaman. Why?? well there is a perception of DPS beasts are considered DPS and its true i do alot of DPS with beast and in general beasts all do alot of DPS. So a slowing class that does DPS seems to be prefered. <br />
<br />
NOW, before some of you say well shaman can do decent DPS your full of it. Yes shaman can do dps and alot of it but....not all shaman some alot of shaman out there just seem to be happy slowing and buffing and &quot;taking it easy&quot; or atleast i have come across alot of it on my server. Also even if we do damage it just isnt usually noticed, shaman kinda getting a bum rap.<br />
<br />
But now on the other hand if im playing my shaman and the cleric goes LD or leaves , im plenty capable of filling the role temporarily or even all together depending on zone.<br />
<br />
So in my view to sum it up<br />
<br />
Shamans - Raid (Have nothing to worry about)<br />
<br />
Exp group- Been on both sides if a group has a cleric it seems the group sometimes would prefer a beast but most arent picky will take either class.<br />
<br />
But when that group takes the beast and cleric leaves abruptly the group disbands. When they take the shaman they keep playing. (of course this is also influenced if there is a druid by chance in group)<br />
<br />
Bottom line people see the beastlord as a DPS class, sometimes its perception sometimes it is reality.<br />
<br />
Ofcourse if a well known respected enchanter is lfg , youll prob loose out anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tiorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">BL get their 65% slow at 65<br />
<br />
We get ours at 51 and it scales up from there<br />
<br />
Thats alot of game playing time - 14 levels of it.<br />
<br />
Be known as the guy who knows how to practise good crowd control, which is really what makes a capable shaman.<br />
<br />
Debuff, Root park adds and Slow thats my role above dps<br />
<br />
For anyone who understands the true nature of the mechanics of EQ, they would always prefer to have a well balanced group of dps, healing and crowd control.<br />
<br />
Everyone hates wiping, If you can manage crowd control well, you will always be welcome in groups.</div></div><hr />

I was just thinking the same thing. :)<br />
<br />
I'm currently playing a beastlord, and I'm wishing for a better slow and heal lol. Hoping to get my epics sometime in the near future though - 55% slow proc with dot + 40% haste and +30 atk sounds real fun. =D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Xhosa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'm regularly the only Shaman on a raid and some of the time we don't even have an Enchanter.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">They are supposedly a shaman hybrid... makes sense that they get a decent slow.  Should probably give em sow a bit earlier than rangers too, but oh well.<br />
<br />
   All I want changed about Beastlords is to have mroe of em out there, more skill in each of them, and less obnoxious people playing em.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Chernobul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">while ya they are a mix of shaman and monk, they shouldn't have the highlights of both classes. they do some insane damage and they have a nice little slow there. take a look at the original hybrids: paladins are sub-par damage and below warrior tanking (in terms of damage takin not aggro holding), shadowknights are decent damage with decent damage spells (because necros own so much), and rangers, they used to have crappy damage and laughable tanking ability (and boy did we laugh).<br />
<br />
suddenly we've got sony's pet of a class orgy. good damage, crack ability, uber pet, uber pet heals (good groups can replace a warrior with a BL no problem) slows that pretty much land every time.<br />
<br />
the pluses are in strange proportions to the negatives based on sony's previous ways.</div></div><hr />

I have a question somehow related. Does mitigation reduce the effect of slow or limits it to a fixed percent?<br />
Example: (numbers picked for easy calculations)<br />
case 1: (slow*2/3)<br />
 - slow 75% becomes slow 50%<br />
 - slow 60% becomes slow 40%<br />
case 2: (max slow = 50%)<br />
  -slow &gt;50% becomes 50%<br />
<br />
If second case is the real one, that 10% difference beastlords have is nothing when mob mitigates.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Case 1 is the correct one.  When pop first came out and mitigation was buggy, it worked like case 2 (using togors in execution trial, anyone?).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Yodelroy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Never take 1 class ability out of context. A major reason to group with beastlord is paragon and buffs. The utility of all his buffs (IoS/SD/SP/etc) is equal to Focus/Sta in many people's eyes. A major reason to group with shamans is melee haste spell. <br />
<br />
DPS is perceived. Actualy DPS can vary from the shaman but is consistent from a BST. For example, some shamans will dot/canni up the wazoo, some won't. Shamans should almost ALWAYS cast a pet, it's free DPS - yet most dont. So if people want DPS they will take any BST over a stranger shaman. If you build a DPS rep as a shaman, then your prospects should improve.<br />
<br />
I think a major problem with shamans is they don't sell themselves. Many don't communicate well, so the group doesn't know what they are doing. They should be coordinating/telling what they do with the puller, and coordinating/telling what they do with the healer as soon as they join a group. They should be asking who wants focus, sta, haste, stats, etc. Not waiting on someone to ask it. I've seen many shamans without a 'Im canning please dont heal me' macro, and they'll cann, cast quiescence, then the cleric heals em. That type of stuff is bad. <br />
<br />
In general an average or bad beastlord is far more effective than an average or bad shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Playing a betabuff beastlord=p, their 65% slow is nice and powerful, short duration though only 3 mins ish. I dunno if you know the 2 guards in Vah shir, well basically pet was able to take one on and me playing the beastlord one. Could almost take them unslowed also but then beastlord has a very bad way of healing himself if he takes much damage.<br />
<br />
But slowed Beastlord took no damage, and pet and beastlord took both down   at about same time. However outside there are 2 guards and some barbarian thing, beastlord and pet was owned by them which I know my shaman wouldn't because he could at least control the situation with root. However would be slower fights compared.</div></div><hr />

If becoming &quot;replaceable&quot; bothers you, consider how clerics felt when druids and shaman got their improved heals - and that was at 58, not 65!</div></div><hr />

Wait, wait, let me get what you're saying here straight:<br />
<br />
1. If you say shamans can do good DPS, you're wrong<br />
2. Shamans can do a lot of damage<br />
3. People seem to incorrectly think shamans can't do a lot of damage.<br />
<br />
Well, with statements like that one to clear things up, I don't know how the heck people could be confused.  ::boggle::</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">The 10pct gap means 40pct more healing for clerics that if a shaman slowed.<br />
<br />
Myth.  Well actually its stretching the truth a bit.<br />
<br />
Compared to total dmg the clerics only have to heal 10% more than they would with shaman slow.<br />
<br />
The 40% comes when comparing how much more dmg the shm slow mitigates  in comparison to the bst slow.  Not really the same thing.<br />
<br />
When stating Healers have to heal x% more because a shaman isnt slowing they just have to do a simple difference between the slow percentages because this covers the dmg done by a mob.  Otherwise we just state the Healers have to heal x% more than the ammount a shaman mitigates only.<br />
<br />
Sorry I just dislike this urban legend being spread.<br />
<br />
PS The BST slow won't cause a problem in EQ with shaman.  Because people like big flashy numbers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I haven't encountered any issues regarding BST slow vs SHM slow. I still get groups, I often get invited to groups that already have a BST. I slow, and when resisted BST throws his slow on until I get mine to stick. Both classes are useful in a group situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Beastlords buff better than shamans? lol. You forget that shamans get IoS at 49? BSTs have some good ATK buffs, but they dont stack very well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I really dont think about it at all.  I rarely group with a beastlord, and when I do they are happy to let me do the debuffs, while they concentrate on adding dps.<br />
<br />
I suppose its good to know that they can slow so well, in case I am playing an alt and a beastlord is lfg...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Daekar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">/shrug it really doesn't concern me all that much, we still have the better slow and provide more than just that spell line to a group anyway.  Hey more power to the bst's out there helps those groups that can't find a shaman when they need at least a semi-decent slower (granted that level of a slow is a considerably high level bst, so again it's not like there is much competition between us and bst's) /shrug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Wulfson Soulforger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Let them slow.  Heheh, I lead with Malos like most of you do.  They are probably chain casting their slow getting aggro that I dont want or need while they do it.  Their's will probably land while I am waiting on recast time.  I will overwrite when I can get Turgur's off and they will still have the aggro saving the healer (sometimes me) can stay focussed on the MT or the MBL if it applies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Shaman slow longest recast, longest duration and highest percent.<br />
Beastlord slow, shortest casting time, middle recast and lowest percent of the 3.<br />
Enchanter slow, longest casting(3.9 sec), quick recast(almost instant recast) and middle. <br />
I don't see a problem with beastlord slow, I was concerned it had a resistadj, but looking at lucy none of the slows do.</div></div><hr />
