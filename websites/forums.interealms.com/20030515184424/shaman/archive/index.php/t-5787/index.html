<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just FYI, the old Bug of &quot;Kirn's pet being up but Kirn does not respawn&quot; still exists.<br />
<br />
Last night my guild went to the hole, twice. Five hours apart.<br />
<br />
Kirn wasn't up then, but his pet was. Nobody knew when he had been killed last. We left, stupidly not killing the pet (I should've remembered this bug, my fault, plus we were in a hurry to get a rare enchanter mob that was now up)<br />
<br />
So we went back after nailing the Wraith of Shisskar, five hours later.... and kirn's pet is up, kirn is not. Some people who had been there the whole time grinding said kirn hadn't been taken.<br />
<br />
We petitioned and left, as Enchanter turned in stuff to Powm and wanted to do final turn-in.<br />
<br />
Another shaman needs the hole too, so this means at least 2 more hole trips, lucky us. *sigh*. Got my tear, my guild has done neh for kicks, just need that stupid kirn and we're ready to rock....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Heelah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">when i did kirn with 2 friends of mine his pet depopped when the ring-bearing kirn popped right after the hand-in. what would cause his pet to stay up like that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>sorsisis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ive seen this bug first hand myself, but have no idea how it happens. When you do the hand in, kirn depops killing pet, then respawns without pet and immediately aggros you. Its a wierd bug indeed =/</div></div><hr />
