<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kaalisti_Painstorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Our guild is considering switching to a points loot system.<br />
<br />
Do any of you know of a website where the working model of this system is explained in detail? Does a program exist for this system? (Like the RaidLeader and GuildLeader programs)<br />
<br />
I've never been in a guild that's used it so unfortunately I'm unversed in it's inner workings, need info please!<br />
<br />
<br />
Guys - please don't hijack this thread with the age-old arguements of which system is more fair. I would just like to know how -this- system works please. :D <br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

be very careful tho. It's extremely hard to balance the points to make both full time and part time player happy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't like point systems.  My friend is in a guild that uses raid points, and he's completely fed up with it.  It rewards you for being in the guild longer, not just playing the most and being the most hardcore.  My friend has only been in the guild a few weeks, but he plays every day almost.  However, he's seen a skyshrine plate BP (he's a 60 SK) go to a semi-innactive level 52 paladin, and just the other day, he saw a CoF go to an almost entirely innactive level 53 ranger.  These items are just sitting on these characters, hardly being used, when they really should have gone to my friend, a hardcore player who plays and would have made use of them every day.  The only reason he lost on these items were because the other guys have been in the clan for a lot longer and been to more total raids, although they havent been a very active member for several months.<br />
<br />
The point system is a good idea, except for this.  Senior members shouldn't get an advantage over new members.  If I helped found a guild and get it on it's feet, but a year later, I barely play, the new guild shaman that plays every day should have a better chance at winning gear than I do.  He uses it more.<br />
<br />
The common alternative, though, is to have one person (usually guild or raid leader) appoint loot.  The problem with this is, of course, that one person is deciding who gets everything.  If this person is of the opinion &quot;hmmmm shamans dont reallly need a chestplate of vindication, its really for tanks, not casters&quot; then we're fooked and don't get a chestplate of vindication - ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Personally, point systems works for guilds that are heavy raiders and don't have part-timers.   <br />
<br />
There are tons of factors to look at.  The obvious one, is raid attendence.   Unfortunately, most point systems soley look at that.   There's attitude of the player, knowledge, &quot;guts&quot; (a monk afraid to pull, is a bad thing, mmkay?), sacrifice (kudos to those who put their lives on the line to drive away adds to save a raid),<br />
people helping others out, I can go on and on.  I've known part-time players that know their job and kick butt better than full-timers, and well, it would really suck for them to be passed on for something great, because they don't have the points for it.<br />
<br />
Point systems DO, however, relieve officer stress of deciding loot, IF you are that guild that has minimums for raid attendence.<br />
<br />
Loot/greed (not the only thing, but a big part) broke up my guild (L`Malla on Druzzil Ro) over a month ago.  We were around for three years, and not to brag, but was a major force (one guild was a step or two ahead of us, I'll admit).   We raided... a lot.  But we also had quite a few part-time people.  We looked at RL&gt;EQ.  We considered ourselves a &quot;family guild&quot; that could take out major mobs.  Loot distro was decided amongst the officers (chat channels made it a lot easier).  Sometimes it was easy, sometimes not, but we factored in things that I mentioned a couple paragraphs up.   We weren't perfect; they knew it, we knew it, but most stood by our decisions.   <br />
<br />
I was an officer for just under two years, and the last few months were the most frustrating.   People were getting more vocal about loot, wanting a point system, and some rebelling against the course of what the officers' best interests for the guild was.<br />
The final nail in the coffin, was someone looting a primal brawlstick when it was rewarded to someone else, because he thought he was more deserving.  He was already stacked with gear and only been in the guild for half a year (and did have a primal handwraps).  You can say, &quot;well why not just boot him and move on?&quot; Because, what was sad was, some people stood by him what he did.   It use to be &quot;grats Player_01&quot; but now it became, &quot;/tell Ramhorn  Why didn't I get that?&quot;   It was this growing attitude that made our GM/officers just say &quot;f**k it.&quot;  We didn't like doing it one bit, because we had a lot of great people, but if some chronic disease is going to develop, sometimes pulling the life support, is the only choice.<br />
<br />
We had a system that worked for the most part, but I guess in a &quot;NOW&quot; society, people need their loot like fast food.    What's hypocrital about this is, now I wished I didn't pass up stuff so others can benefit.  It went with a lot of other officers in my guild.  We took pride in seeing others get stuff, and eventually our turn came.   But, something wonderful you have (the guild) can suddenly be gone, and then be left with nothing.   Then again, pride is more important than pixelated belongings.</div></div><hr />

He's in the guild a few weeks and thinks he should get a Velious BP and a CoF over members who have been in the guild for much much longer?  Sounds like the point system works just fine to me. Those people may not play every day like him but they obviously have put in the time and effort to have the points to deserve that item.  <br />

<br />
Now to the original topic...<br />
<br />
Most guilds I've seen have developed their own system.  You'll need to sit down and decide how you want to do it.  Afterlife's DKP system is a very good one to look at for ideas, but its pretty intensive.  <br />
<br />
First you'll want to set a range of what loot can be worth, standard is pretty much 0 to 20 points.  20 points being the top of the line end game type item,  0 being stuff that has very little to no use to anyone on the raid (stuff that drops off mobs that is so crappy that even most twinks wouldn't use it type stuff).  There are some things that will also be considered into the point value:  How hard is the item to obtain,  how much demand is there for it,  is it class specific,  is it tradeable,  how fast can you get more,  etc.<br />
<br />
Then you'll need to start setting point values that members will receive for killing certain mobs.  The point value will mainly be determined by the point value of the mob's loots and the amount of people it takes to kill the mob.   Time it takes to kill a mob, time it takes to clear to a mob, amount of people needed to kill, etc all take part in determining the point value of the mob.  But the goal is to have the value of points awarded to the raid as a whole to be very close to the value of the loot dropped.<br />
<br />
You will also need to have a system keep track and display current points after each raid.  You'll probably need 4-5 people that are going to track all raids and loot drops so that at least one person is online to keep track of the info.   Those 4-5 will also need to be constantly keeping up with new loot to get point values assigned before the items start being obtained, also they'll need to keep track of any upgrades/nerfs to items and do possible rerating of point values, including retro point changes to players that got the items already.   You'll also need a way to handle trade ins for items that are no longer used by the player and are droppable and the player gives that item to someone else in the guild.<br />
<br />
When you first change over you'll also need to have a period of time where points are given out for participation but loot is not deducted during that time.  Give out the loot the current way you are doing it but don't charge the players points.  Do this for a 60-90 day period. What this does is gives you a good way to start awarding on points based on participation for the last few months.   You can't start up with everyone at the same points from scratch because then you are putting everyone at equal footing, the hard core players on every day and the ones on once a month,  you need some time to build up a good amount of points based on participation.   This time period really depends on how often you raid, but you'll probably want to get your most active every day type player to around 60-80 points before starting, that will give you enough time to get a good spread on points.  The very active will be near 80, the active will be in the 50s, the less active in the 20s.  Now everyone has a good judge of how often each plays and loot can start being docked from the points value.  Once that active player gets a couple of items he'll be lower than the active player and the active player will get items etc.<br />
<br />
Now you need a way to determine who gets the item,  some go just straight highest points win,  others like Afterlife use a teir based system,  others let players bid points for the items with highest bidder winning.  Our guild does straight highest points wins, you put in more time with less reward so its yours.<br />
<br />
You'll also want to set up guidelines on when players can't be in some rolls.  Mains should always get gear over alts regardless of points.  Some items like FT items, Haste items, etc should go to the right classes, but in any successful guild this shouldn't be an issue.<br />
<br />
Best thing to do is have an officer set up a system, then let officers discuss it and make changes till it looks good.  Then let the guild see it and discuss it, once you get to a point where it looks good, go with it.   During this time is when you start tracking raid info.  Just record who is at every raid,  what loot drops, what is killed, etc.  You can fill in the points later once you figure out what they are worth, don't bother for now, just keep a list of that info.   Using the new channels is a great way to keep track of who was there,  just have everyone on the raid join the channel and /list the channel to make a list of everyone there.<br />
<br />
Each guild is different, so each system tends to be different to fit the needs of that guild.</div></div><hr />

<br />
An inactive player will quickly approach zero points by getting items like this.  Your friend will build up points faster and eventually get his shot.  Remember that the purpose of a point system (or merit system) is not to decide who gets what, but who gets what _first_.  These systems work best with guilds that raid the same thing over and over with the intention of outfitting the majority of the guild.<br />
<br />
Also, there's something kinda wrong about your friend thinking he deserves _anything_, let alone nice stuff like this, after being in a guild only two weeks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Go check out http://www.afterlifeguild.org.<br />
<br />
There is a link from their main page that talks about DKP and how it works in guild. I believe that they were  first major guild in EQ to use DKP and the system seems more than fair to me. DKP systems only work well in guilds that have fairly mature people though IMO. If you have loot hungry whiners that think that they have some innate claim to something just because it drops, they will not help the system to work. Of course, if you have responsible guild leadership and they are not afraid to boot people that are disruptive and undermine the integrity of the guild, then even that won't be much of a problem. <br />
<br />
Afterlife is arguably the best guild in the game, but is at least the same stature as FoH, Triton, LoS, etc., and they have been using DKP since the beginning. IMO, DKP systems are the absolutely most fair system there is for doing loot because if you don't put in effort and time to the guild functions, you don't get the loot. Those who contribute the most get first dibs on stuff with their points buildup. However, due to whatever reasons, DKP systems won't work for just anyone. Good luck with it in your guild though :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Duh, I forgot to answer the first question.  Got sidetracked.<br />
<br />
&lt;a href=&quot;http://pub114.ezboard.com/flegacyofsteel43089general.showMessage?topicID=891.topic&quot;&gt;This thread&lt;/a&gt; should be required reading for anyone considering a DKP system, or just wanting to know how it works.  Wendolyn from AL wrote a friggen novel, and is definitely in a position to speak from experience.  Excellent thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">A DKP system is imo the fairest system around.  <br />
<br />
If you are a part time player, you are a part time loot getter. Those who have more points DO deserve first crack at the item they want.<br />
<br />
Disagree? Here's a horror story for you.<br />
<br />
My Monk joined a guild that was sort of floundering. Helped them pull and kill Phinny. Showed the proper way to do Rak. Pulled, led and died on numerous Hate raids. <br />
<br />
On the last one I pulled - Grandmaster R'tal popped. His rare is a Rakusha cloak. (Monk only ND 36% haste). He dropped the cloak.<br />
<br />
The loot decision? Random.<br />
<br />
I lost the roll to a Monk who had been in the guild a whopping total of.............drum roll..............<br />
<br />
One day.<br />
<br />
THAT is why random is completely bogus within a guild.<br />
<br />
Guild officers &quot; awarding &quot; items is rife with potential for human error, and is in many ways worse than random.<br />
<br />
The points system works on a simple premise - the more you raid , the better chance you have of getting that item you WANT.<br />
<br />
Points system is not for the lazy. It can be an administrative nightmate, it is time intensive, what with determining what item is worth how many points.<br />
<br />
It IS however, in the long run, the FAIREST way to determine who gets their pick of items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Lor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I always preferred officer assigned. See the drop, determine what classes get it, /who GUILD class, /tell officer chat x, x, and x can upgrade to this item. who's your pick?<br />
<br />
Point system is a very viable solution though, assuming the members agree that part time players are not going to benefit the guild in uber_bp02 as much as the ever present mainstays.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Like one member of my guild says.<br />
&lt;b&gt;&quot;Troll before roll&quot;&lt;/b&gt;<br />
Dat sounds fair ta me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The problems with officer assigned loot is that everyone has to believe that the officers involved are unbiased or they start bitching, the officers in fact DO need to be unbiased or just people that are the most popular end up with the best drops while others that put in their time but might not be as popular get nothing, and also that type of system is limited by perception. Maybe officer x doesn't seen you there, or they haven't noticed you being at all the raids the last few weeks, and that colors their perception of how deserving you might actually be. With a points system, there are hard facts. X person has X number of points because they attended the raids. It is right there for everyone to see. Nobody would have a leg to stand on arguing that you aren't worthy of the drop if you have the points, but in an officer award system, there are always those that will be thinking that so and so got whatever because they were better liked or whatever reason. Still my opinion that points system is most fair all around, as long as you have a mature group of people as your guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'm very much against officer awarded, for two reasons - 1) no matter how fair you are, someone will get upset and start bitching (because they have some reason why the person awarded it doesn't deserve), and 2) the officers need to know not only what impact every item has for every class, but they have to know the full gear of every guildmember.<br />
<br />
I'm also against a point system, mainly because it requires someone to have a full time job tracking points, and you could have some stereotypical undeserving part timer save up loads of points &amp; massively outbid a deserving full timer on one nifty item.<br />
<br />
We decided a long time ago to go with all random - if it's an upgrade for you and you will use it, you can roll.  As for fairness of rewarding longterm members - the more raids you are on, the more stuff drops, the more rolls you get in on.  Looking at any one drop, it might not be fair, as in Faerns example - but looking at it over many raids, the more active folks will get more upgrades.<br />
<br />
But really, the bottom line is simple - if it works for you guys, stay with it.  If there are problems, then look at adjustments, but be aware of the consequences a major change might have.</div></div><hr />

Loot will rip a guild apart.  ONCE  you have assigned a value to items and set up rules and looked at exceptions it becomes easier.<br />
<br />
 and you could have some stereotypical undeserving part timer save up loads of points &amp; massively outbid a deserving full timer on one nifty item. <br />
<br />
ERm no. A &quot; part-timer&quot; could never amass more points than someone who raids all the time. And if the part timer DID amass more points because the full-timer bought item(s) then great - the system is working !  <br />
<br />
Couple of facts: People look at a raid calendar and decide in advance where they want to spend points. The full timer has been raiding non-stop and bought and let rot (another concept hard to get your hands around) lots of gear.<br />
<br />
The full-timer already HAS the piece of gear the part-timer wants to pay for. The full-timer isn't going to spend his or her few points because they're waiting for the guild to hit the next zone where better loot drops.<br />
<br />
Simple premise and results:<br />
<br />
The more you raid the better your chance of getting the item you want.<br />
<br />
DKP works because it ensures the long term continuity of the guild and the guild loot system. People in a guild for the &quot; here and now loot&quot; will be against a DKP system. Those who are ready to commit to raiding, those who show up to every raid, those who participate more - get more.<br />
<br />
But like you said - go with what works for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Lor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">We use the free love system currently, Khallin, kinda like you guys. Although I always liked Bre's point system, I'm not sure on its effectiveness in a guild-wide setup. it did work beautifully back when we were takin out the old world dragons. I attended prolly 20 or more of those, never won a thing, but i've never been a lucky sort so I just spent my hour buffing everyone and shut up lol. I came out of it with knowledge, which is a hell of a lot better than a rune 4 shield imo. <br />
<br />
I'm trying to move towards officer vote with my guild, or at least a reasonable mix. All too often we see new members with good luck winning the best loot and the long-timers are getting bitter. What's worse, when those lucky sorts have a bad night, THEY get pissed because they didn't walk out of there with something, with little regard to the fact that they've gotten in 4 raids what it's taken others a year to acquire. At best, I hope to have something better in the mix before we reach the next phase of things. <br />
<br />
It just falls into that &quot;you'll never make em all happy&quot; category. The NOW factor is the main issue, they don't want to wait for it to drop again, so they won't be happy in any system if they're of that mind. Like that SK 3 weeks into the guild... mad because he didn't get a bp? I'd have booted him on the spot. I hate loot whores. <br />
<br />
anyway, sorry for the novel. <br />
<br />
--Lor, remembers khallin selling dots under the flag in perma. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Michael J. Kaspar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">We use a point system similar to what Wendolyn talked about in the thread mentioned above.<br />
<br />
We provide more ways to earn points, but lately loot has exceeded points coming into the guild, so this somewhat prevents hoarding.  We award points like this:<br />
<br />
1pt per level 50-55<br />
2pt per level 56-59<br />
3pt at level 60<br />
<br />
If you join the guild at level 60, you start at 17 pts.  Points are also awarded for AA levels.<br />
<br />
You earn 1pt per raid, and 1pt per objective mob killed.  Some of our raids are not pointed, but that is announced ahead of time, and its usually because you don't need a full guild force to kill said mob.<br />
<br />
Every item in the game is pointed 1, 5, 10, 15, or 20.  If there is a question on point value of an item, it is adjusted based on member input on the raid.  If an item is droppable, it is generally 5 pts higher than a comparable no drop item.  Large disagreements in value (very rare) are handled by officers.<br />
<br />
Our system has been tweaked by circumstances, and we do have an &quot;officer override rule&quot; to prevent a non-raider from looting over a raider if we need to implement it, but that is rarely the case.  Furthermore, everytime the system has been challenged, there hasn't been a suitable replacement for it.  It does have flaws, but they are small.  The system prevents arguments, avoids hassles, and initially keeps recent recruits below veterans.<br />
<br />
The system was one of the main reasons I joined the guild, and I think it has withstood the test of time.  It's significantly more fair than ANY random type system out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Heh I used to be rabidly anti-loot systems, until we decided we had to have one in order to progress in the game and went for an award by commitee system. Wouldnt change a thing, its been painful at times but the change in the abilities of the guild has been immense. Players who have played since the first day the server came up saying how they've never had so much fun.<br />
<br />
To the person who said it would be difficult for officers to know exactly what people are wearing - well EQW and Magelo make that alot easier, theres always inspect and you could even ask them!<br />
<br />
There will never be a perfect system, only a system with more advantages than another, good luck with it Kaal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Boraman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">&lt;i&gt;The problems with officer assigned loot is that everyone has to believe that the officers involved are unbiased or they start bitching, the officers in fact DO need to be unbiased or just people that are the most popular end up with the best drops while others that put in their time but might not be as popular get nothing, and also that type of system is limited by perception.

<br />
I strongly agree with this.  It is my #1 reason I dsislike having officers decide loot.  <br />
<br />
I can hardly believe anyone is even advocating Random loot rolls.  Maybe thats fine for a guild doing the planes or even Kael Arena, but I can't imaging randoming in ToV or Luclin bosses.<br />
<br />
My guild just started using points this month, I managed to collect 65 pts so far but haven't felt the need to &quot;buy&quot; anything yet.  Partly because shaman loot is few and far between at our level, I feel I have a slight advantage to &quot;hold out&quot; while everyone else scrambles for drops.  We are having our first foray into NToV soon so I figure I'll find out shortly how well it all works out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I dont really have a problem with either way of handing out loot.  I am usually the only shaman on most guild raids so I get the shaman drops anyway :)<br />
<br />
My guild uses the officer system and we have had our problems with it.  We have even had some of our long time members leave the guild over loot.  So for some people it is all about the loot and you can never make them happy.<br />
<br />
I used to be all about the gear as well.  Then I realized that even though I thought that the gear I had was crappy when I compared it to other shams of the same lvl (Thank you Magelo) I realized that I had some pretty nice stuff and should be happy about what I have instead of mad about what I wanted.<br />
<br />
I think that a point system is a good idea as long as someone will maintain it properly.  Point systems take alot of work but can be worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>morbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">DKP is garbage unless you have a guild with a lot of mature players.  Even with DKP, you have to use discretion, and not let just anyone buy something because they can.<br />
<br />
I have a friend who was in a DKP system guild months back.  Kael BP drops in ToV.  Guy with SS BP already buys it over him, because he liked the way it looked better or some such.<br />
<br />

DKP is garbage unless you have a guild with a lot of mature players.  Even with DKP, you have to use discretion, and not let just anyone buy something because they can.<br />
<br />
I have a friend who was in a DKP system guild months back.  Kael BP drops in ToV.  Guy with SS BP already buys it over him, because he liked the way it looked better or some such.<br />

<br />
DKP is only garbage is people abuse the system, which happened in this case.  The system is fine provided you have accurate record keeping.  However, as with all systems, if you have garbage people participating, you end up with garbage situations like the one above.  In our guild, officers would have stepped in and asked the looter to &quot;adjust&quot; his reasoning.<br />
<br />
You would think that people who are thinking of themselves (as above) would get weeded out from a guild.<br />
<br />
We have had people come into the guild and ask the usual questions about the system.  How long will it take, how can I loot if person X has over 100 pts, etc.  Once the member explain logically how it works, most fears are alieveated.  If the issue continues to be pressed, they usually don't last in the guild.  We have a system that has worked for us for over 2 years, and someone with one month (or less) exposure to the guild wants to change things.  Not going to happen, unless its a reasonable modification to the system that fixes a problem recently uncovered, that (usually) doesn't involve said person (they are acting as a third party not involved).</div></div><hr />

You build points by raid attendance and it increases your chances at an item but having a decider prevents anything lame like a twink receiving something needed by a main or a retarded bard thinking he is gonna get a blade of carnage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Or you can just stick a warrior only flag on the BoC, and make it a rule that loot goes to primaries first...<br />
<br />
Merit is fine, until you let a human run it.  Humans make mistakes and have biases, and certainly can't remember everyone's attendance.  On the other hand, machines are emotionless and almost perfect.<br />
<br />
People don't buy marginal upgrades often under DKP because it's &quot;wasted&quot; DKP.  They will have less points in the future for items that aren't &quot;marginal&quot;.<br />
<br />
The entire point of DKP is to reward people's time.  If you don't think people's time should be rewarded, chances are you don't like DKP.  Most of the arguments I hear against DKP stem from this.  But it's the core principal of the system and what makes it work.  If you don't think people should be rewarded for their time, you've got a lot of problems other than a loot system :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Nicely said Talinia.  Time put in NEEDS to be rewarded if the guild is to SURVIVE and not be dragged apart by loot squabbling.<br />
<br />
My guild uses DKP with RPP points.  The points are awarded to everyone on a raid where we take down a loot dropping target.  The RPP value of the total loot dropped is already known, since values are settled on in advance.  The RPP awarded to each member present is based on the RPP value of the loot divided by the number of guildies there.  So a 10 RPP valued Vindy bp on a 30 guildie raid would work out to a 0.3 RPP awarded to each guildie on that raid.  This is fine since vindy is a short easy raid anyhow. <br />
<br />
Since we have been doing NTOV, all our most active members are deeply in RPP debt.  A new guildie only a week old with the guild probably has a better shot at winning some NToV loot than an old timer, simply because the old timers are still playing catch-up on RPP cause they spent so much.  <br />
<br />
Most people I have seen rolling for an item EVER was FIVE people.  Mostly tho, the items are rolled between two people or maybe three who want the item.  That is out of a 50 person raid too!  <br />
<br />
Basically RPP means you gotta put in time, but then when your item drops and you have the RPP needed, it's yours.  Or at the very least you have to beat like one or two others on the roll.  <br />
<br />
People do tend to spend RPP only on the nicest items and we have had some **** rot in the past cause nobody wanted to spend RPP on it, or worse, thought the RPP was too much for the item and didn't loot it hoping the value would drop and the item would be cheaper next time it dropped.  <br />
<br />
NToV is a lewt mine tho, really spoils ya.  <br />
<br />
It's still my opinion that DKP systems are the best for all concerned.  The only time they run into trouble is when the guild isn't strong enuf to get much loot for its members.  Then RPP piles up and nobody is winning cept the oldest members and not many of them even.  People start leaving the guild, bitter arguments ensue, and the guild cracks up.  But that's what HAS to happen to such guilds.  People join guilds for lewt, upgrades, and help and community support.  If the guild can no longer help them, they leave.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Durich</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">My Guild uses a point system and we are only 40-52 in level. The Merit system only works in a &quot;vacuum&quot; and does not work in real life. Unless your a really tight guild where everyone has been around each other playing the game for the last year and everyone has always had a &quot;help your guildmate out&quot; attitude your guild will not survive long. <br />
<br />
Our system has 2 cycles the first one being the build and equip the membership cycle and the second being the twink and bask in your uberness cycle.  Both use the standard attend a raid earn X points. We also mix in some NBG on low end items and alternate ways to earn points.<br />
<br />
The first cycle some items have class restrictions placed on them by the leadership so that a CoF does not go to a cleric to twink his lvl 20 warrior but goes to a Melee present at the raid and who has the points to bid. Then a random is called for those who want to &quot;bid&quot;. The winner gets the item and the points are deducted. Simple and has a bit of chance. We also have a hand down system for that person to give the guild his RBG since he has a nice new CoF and get some points back. For those members who have a life but still want to be part of the guild and have their chance at loot we offer alternate attendance points for gathering quest items, recruiting, and etc.<br />
<br />
The Second cycle is for after the guild has a good base of members and or equipped fairly well. This cycle we will introduce closed bidding where if an item drops and someone at the raid wants (some items may still have class restrictions) then they can send a /tell to the loot officer and the highest bid wins. This type of bidding will be used at raid/mobs that we have done 100's times over and all possible good drops have already gone through the first cycle and the right classes/members have that item.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">READ the Afterlife web site on DKP. The go to LOS boards and look at Gwendolyn's explanations of various &quot; what if &quot; circumstances.<br />
<br />
Land hit some points that needed to be brought out.<br />
<br />
1) For DKP to work you need to be an raiding guild. DKP doesn't work for a once a week foray into Hate.<br />
<br />
2)  People do tend to spend RPP only on the nicest items and we have had some **** rot in the past cause nobody wanted to spend RPP on it, or worse, thought the RPP was too much for the item and didn't loot it hoping the value would drop and the item would be cheaper next time it dropped. <br />
<br />
a) Item rot. Need to understand and get your mind wrapped around this concept EARLY. Items will ROT. And they MUST rot to preserve the integrity of the system.<br />
<br />
b) Item values change over time. While a Hate BP may have been worth X DKP's 6 months ago, the guild has moved on to Trak, Kunark Dragons etc.<br />
<br />
3) Now to the example of the guy winning the BP because he like the looks.<br />
<br />
More power to him. Without knowing the in's and out's of your particular system I can say with some qualification - it works.<br />
<br />
You got someone to lose DKP's (I'll elaborate in a sec), and he got a nice item. Obviously he had put in the time and whether or not you thought his thought process was correct - he DESERVED the item based on points.<br />
<br />
Now to elaborate.<br />
<br />
AL's system uses(used) a tier system wherein if you had X more points than someone else you won the item outright.  This leads to a peculiarity with their system. And one you should take note of.<br />
<br />
It does not matter how many points YOU have. It matters how many points you have relative to the NEXT person.<br />
<br />
One side effect of a constant raiding guild is the accumulation of points - leading to the phenomenon I described above. As a guild you WANT people to spend points. You WANT people to get items and upgrade gear.<br />
<br />
Finally, AL has a simple rule re - twinks. No twink can get an item over a main.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Mearis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I am personally STRONGLY against dkp, and of all the sistems I have heard any uber-guild use, I am heavily in the favour of the system used by Ascending Dawn/Triton/FoH which is a council of officers awarding loot.<br />
<br />
I think having one person only decide on the loot is a recepy for disaster, but a council of officers who have been with the guild since the beginning usually will make the best decision for the guild, while a single leader sometime will make silly mystakes (on my server, a belt of marvelous visions was awarded to a ranger with a dark cloak of sky once).<br />
<br />
The reason why I cannot stand the idea of dkp system, is because it introduces an element of incredible greed in the system that I would never tolerate.  I am sure we are all familiar with the pictures of Aftathott giving Mort two tolan's longswords of the glade because no mains need them, and nobody was willing to fess up dkp points to buy it for a twink.  I admire the knowledge of the game that Aftathott has, and from every single thread that I have read everyone in afterlife is extremly happy with their loot system, but I couldn't stand the idea of watching some loot that could make some friends of mine very happy rot, because the idea of giving it away for free to someone would make people in the guild feel slighted.  <br />
<br />
It is absolutely impossible to do with a dkp system, but imagine if someone known to be a nice person on the server, out of the blue gets a tell, hey, run to ToV, we are going to CoH you over so you can loot something amazing that will rot otherwise.  You will make that person happy for an entire week, and he will always be willing to help you back, but on a dkp system giving away rotting loot to someone out of guild is absolutely unplausable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Cough yes, no points with us, wherever possible we avoid having officers on the commitee (tho there are some). They are voted for by the guild and we have regular revotes, there are an odd number so as to avoid hung decisions. There are two senior officers with the power to revoke decisions if needed.<br />
<br />
If anything the hardest part is getting people to stay doing it as it can be rather stressful. As others have mentioned if you can maintain a steady flow of loot into the guild then you are laughing. Expect very painful times early on in any loot system. points or not. <br />
<br />
One tip, write up a mission statement detailing the aims of the guild eg in 'in 2 months we will be killing X mob and doing x zone in 6' - once you start to achieve those targets then everyone will see the method in the madness. We started with a simple aim of getting every 55+ melee with non epic haste in dragon haste.</div></div><hr />

That sword sucks anyway heh, 15/21?  Trust me, as a ranger, it isn't as good as the other vulak weapons (which were upgraded TWICE and this sword never was)  I wouldn't use it in any circumstance even if I had one.  And if an item rots, chances are it would have just rotted in the bank or someone's twink they never would have played.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
You can set the price of the loot at a very low value, or 0, to counteract rot.  Nonetheless most things that rot simply wouldn't have been used... in which case there was no loss.<br />
<br />
BTW-- DKP doesn't introduce greed; greed is always there.  People aren't altruistic and take a vow of poverty under merit or random...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Tain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">The thing about a points system is it keeps everything fair, and there's a clear audit trail.  It removes even the appearance of favoritism by officers deciding loot.  Even if they try to be as fair as they possible can it's difficult to make subjective calls since someone else is going to disagree when you tell them that Bob helped out just a little bit more than you did, so he's going to get this loot.  You don't want to have to tell someone that, and having a points system helps remove some of the judgement calls that not everyone is going to agree with. <br />
<br />
It's not for everyone, but I do think a points system can work for everyone if they let it.  I think after people look over how it all works the biggest gripe that comes up is about loot rotting.  It's got to happen for the system to work in the long run, and it will.  You know what though, it's not as big a deal as it sounds like.  If you're killing things constantly everyone is going to get equipped how they like.  When things start to be left to rot it's because they're not needed.  If they were, they'd be taken.  <br />
<br />
Assigning loot works for bigger guilds as well, as has been pointed out.  FoH is always the classic example of a top guild that doesn't use DKP.  That doesn't mean it's the fairest or best way to do it, but it might be the best for the guild as a whole.  Certain people are going to have certain jobs, and they may need certain gear to do it, so they're going to get assigned more.  It means backup Warrior #6 might have to wait a while to get things, even though he might be on every raid.  <br />
<br />
You also have to remember that in some cases the guild members have a lot less options.  For many it's either keep taking the loot they're giving without complaining or find a new guild.  On a lot of servers this isn't a very pretty option if you're part of the top pack, so you enjoy what you get. <br />
<br />
My point here is that just because some guilds don't use DKP doesn't mean it's a bad system.  Alternately just using DKP doesn't necessarily mean the guild performs better as loot may get thinned out more, and rather than having a couple 7k HP tanks to take on the big hitters you've got a bunch who die quicker.   I do think the longer you stick with it the healthier the guild is though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Jendain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">if you want fair loot distribution, you want points, plain and simple. you need rules to go with it though.<br />
<br />
for us, it looks like this:<br />
<br />
1 point per 30 minutes (officers do a /who GUILD every 30 minutes and ask for LD people and reloggers to add them manually)<br />
<br />
if an item drops, the officers announce who gets to bid points (class restrictions in some cases, e.g. bio orb for monks first dibs, minimum offer = 10 points)<br />
<br />
full members get to bid first, initiates only get to bid if no full member wants the item.<br />
<br />
you can't bid for alt chars (used to, but even then 5 points from a main counted higher than 300 points for an alt)<br />
<br />
as has been said, points don't decide who gets what, they only decide who gets what FIRST.<br />
<br />
our first dain heads went for upwards of 230 points. i got mine for 174 a few weeks ago (which was all i had hehe).<br />
<br />
It's like in real life. you get what you pay for. if you feel you really NEED this item, you better have a lot of points.<br />
<br />
Is this unfair to the casual player? Maybe. But sooner or later, even the casual player will get, for example, a vindi BP, because the regulars all have one. And most likely, he won't pay nearly as many points as the first 3 people to get the same item, because the market is saturated somewhat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">We have a system that has worked for us for over 2 years <br />

That's the big thing, really... if it works for you and has been for a long time, then it must be a good system for you.<br />
<br />
 Item rot. Need to understand and get your mind wrapped around this concept EARLY. Items will ROT. And they MUST rot to preserve the integrity of the system. <br />
<br />
And that's an idea I have a problem with too...  letting an item rot that someone can use as an upgrade does nothing, in my opinion, but screw over someone and the guild.  The biggest thing that people need to grasp about raid loots - it's to upgrade the guild as a whole, not to get one person a fancy new set of gear.<br />
<br />
<br />
Heh, those Vox &amp; Naggy raids were a ways back (24 from May to September).  Yeah, Brewall put together a pretty nice raid points system on it, and I think it worked good - especially considering those were all open raids.  Info is still up on our site if anyone cares to look at it.. not sure how it compares to other point systems, as I've never bothered to check any of them out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In our sytem anything about to rot ends up at 1pt.  That way we are pretty sure if an item is rotting its because no one wants it or needs it.  It happens alot because most loot tables are just not that deep, you start to get the same things over and over.  SS Chain Guantlets anyone? <br />
<br />
(Of course this could be abused by people &quot;holding&quot; out on class specific items althought it hasn't occured yet)<br />
<br />
In other cases loot is just crap and doesn't deserve to be on the mob it drops from.  Like the stupid ranger whip from Yelinak, we <br />
had 3 of them drop one night...sheeesh.<br />
<br />
&lt;quote&gt;&lt;i&gt;I couldn't stand the idea of watching some loot that could make some friends of mine very happy rot, because the idea of giving it away for free to someone would make people in the guild feel slighted.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/quote&gt;<br />

I dont know about other raid level guilds but my guild is not in the habbit of twinking out a bunch of non-guild members.  I have personally destroyed at least 10 peices of SS Quest armor because no primary member needed it.</div></div><hr />

I really like my guild, but I also have a vast amount of friends outside of it so if I can prevent something as trivial as a teaching of grekan from rotting by asking a friend who I know is working for her circlet of fanikeben to come and loot it I will do so, I just think that destroying loot rather than giving it to someone who has not 'earned' it is petty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Durich</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Item rots -<br />
<br />
Well if your Guild is using a Point system and no mains can use it shouldn't the next step be to allow alts/twinks to bid on it? Allow people to spend their points?<br />
<br />
If you have class restrictions placed on an item and no one wants it and it's dropable/mq'able why not loot if for the Guild Bank and sell it for something the Guild Needs like a copy of Topor?<br />
<br />
If you don't have class restrictions and its still going to rot and no one wants to bid on it for main or even alts and it's not MQ'able then why not offer it up as a ask your friend if he wants? I understand some guild philosophy about hording items to guild only but really except for maybe 1-2 guilds per server who can enter and raid some tough zones most high end guilds can attempt these zones and thus the 'loot' is not unique to the guild.<br />
<br />
Point systems work if they are managed well and the guild is active. Items will rot and those who attend raids will be rewarded for their efforts when they are ready for it. <br />
<br />
Officer loot voting works but there are times when they themselves are influenced or there is only 1-2 on during an event. It's easy to see things one way but to see it from everyone in your guild perspective is impossible so a neutral equalizer must be used and that check and balance system - points.</div></div><hr />

If the item is tradeable it stays in the bank until someone buys it with points or its sold in EC for guild funds.  If its MQ-able quest peice such as Thurg armor it gets saved and MQ'ed with a primary.  <br />
<br />
In response to this:<br />
&lt;i&gt;but do you not have any friends outside of your own guild? &lt;/i&gt;<br />
<br />
Yes I have friends outside the guild, I encourage them to level and apply to my guild or just attend raids as guests.  If they are on the raid and the item will rot it would certianly be given to them even as a guest (and has in the past).  <br />
<br />
Still we are not going to mq full suits a SS quest armor with friends and twinks.  You may see it as petty but its just not fair to the people who spent hours devising tactics, leveling up, purchasing resist gear, and taking countless deaths to get us to this level.<br />

Its not about unique loot.  Its about alot of things like I mentioned before, putting in time and hard work, commitment to the guild and giving of yourself.<br />
<br />
Its also about competition for spawns. My guild is direct competition with at least 5 other guilds for named spawns. anyone not in our guild who has no stake in what we do is a potential resource for another guild.<br />
<br />
*Edit* I forgot to say this all has no bearing on what type of system of loot is used.  These same rules applied long before we were using a point system (which as I mentioned in another post has only been implemented for a few weeks) .</div></div><hr />

A similiar topic was brought up on the Cazic boards, and one person commented that over the months he noted a pattern - the best loot went to officers &amp; their friends.  That's when he /guildremove'd himself.  But still, he was out that time he spent to help equip those people.<br />
<br />
And of course, the other side of awarded loot...  truth is in the eye of the beholder.  If someone perceives that they are getting screwed, then no argument will convince them otherwise.<br />
<br />
Heh, and I agree with you at times about the babysitter comment. :p</div></div><hr />

 I don't like a points system for a simple reason. It allowes rules that can be exploited to have the final say. <br />
<br />
PLease elaborate. Especially considering yoru next statement (s).<br />
<br />
 If someone gets pissed about a guildmate getting loot that I determened would be best suited to go to another then sorry charlie, we don't need you. <br />
<br />
With people who are there most of the time they will get good loot. But I have said. No random, the loot goes to X before. Why? because he deserved it. If people are going to second guess me or the people that I have put in charge, then they take it up with me. If they don't like my reasons, or explination then they are welcome to take it up at the next NAAWP (National Association of Whiny People) meeting for all I care. <br />

I lead the guild. Trust me to do what I feel is right for the guild. If you don't trust me then go elsewhere. <br />

Wow - demagogue much? I believe the above is a pretty strong indictment of the &quot; Officer reward system&quot; and a pretty strong argument FOR a points system.<br />
<br />
Points systems make the rich Richer. They reward time sure, They are fair sure. But it is an accounting type of fair. <br />
<br />
How do points make the &quot; Rich richer?<br />
<br />
Oh and a points system is fair - but you don't like it? Erm ok. Cuz damn it we can't have fairness - * I * Need to determine who gets these pixels - all BOW BEFORE ME YOUR OMNISCIENT GUILD LEADER !<br />

Problem is, it's impossible for a human to make that call.  Do you track everyone's attendance?  Do you value some raids more than others?  &quot;Deserve&quot; has little to do with the effort they invested, and fails to quantify the time between them getting items, and how much each item is relatively worth.<br />
<br />
Look at the real world.  You think businesses just promote / give bonuses to whoever willy nilly and don't track performance or the amount of work done? BS.<br />
<br />
In order for someone to deserve something, they must have done something for it.  &quot;Officer choice&quot; or &quot;merit&quot; doesn't even bother keeping track of what was done to deserve something.  How can someone deserve an item as you say, when you don't even know how many raids they've attended, or what items they've gotten in the past?<br />
<br />
You can't.  Hence, DKP.</div></div><hr />

I don't really think that's true. I actually have found loot commitees to be more intricate then point systems at times because you're tracking not only raid attendance but other stuff as well. Such as overall attitude and helpfulness, willingness to sacrifice yourself for the good of the guild etc. Not that DKP systems don't do that as well but those that do aren't as common. So there is tracking, it's just that the efforts of a guild member aren't translated into currency to purchase items. <br />
<br />
I think both systems work and have their place in EQ. Afterlife has shown DKP to be effective and FoH has shown officer awarded loot to be effective. One is not better then the other, it's all a matter of personal preferance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Slithis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">It really depends upon your guild.<br />
<br />
the Point System:<br />
<br />
The point system, as has been stated several times, is best for a raiding guild.  It emphasizes going to guild events.  The more you do, the more points, the more loot, the better all around.  The rich don't get richer, since if they spend less time while others spend more, they'll have less points and soon the other will bypass them.  If they spend equal time, they'll equal out.  And someone that's new to a guild can typically upgrade a lot of gear very quickly simply because nobody that's been in longer wants it.  However, it isn't casual friendly and there's no easy way to make it casual friendly.  You might have a person that does a lot for your guild but doesn't play during your guild's primary raid hours.  There's also the commitment it takes to keep track of point values and points earned.  It's also not the most invite friendly and loot must be allowed to rot to protect the integrety of the system.<br />
<br />
A great thing for it is that people can complain about the system, but rarely about the people.  A nice perk for the officers to make up for the increased workload.<br />
<br />
the Officer/Loot Committee:<br />
<br />
Officer decision has it's good and bad points.  The biggest bad point is mistakes will be made.  Officers are human and fallible.  If your officers are greedy SoBs, you're hosed and odds are, eventually your guild will collapse because of it.  It also has it's good points.  It's a bit more friendly to casuals or off hour players and invites.  It's also less labor intensive, as long as your guild isn't full of loot whores who whine about every call.  Basically, responses to an announced loot call should consist of one &quot;thanks&quot; and many &quot;grats&quot;.  In the long run, with a good officer crew, it'll balance out.<br />
<br />
As your guild grows though, especially if you don't get a matching increase in number of drops, people will complain more and more.<br />
<br />
/Random:<br />
<br />
Random, well, in the long run, it's sorta fair, in theory.  But in the short run, it's really, really annoying to see the super rare item you've drooled over for a long time go to a person that's done squat for the guild.  Not to mention some people are lucky and some aren't.<br />
<br />
I see it as a progression guilds go for.  With a small guild, you might go with random or officer.  But as you increase in size, you typically shift away from random to just officer.  Later still, when your size and levels allow for more constant raiding, you'll go to DKP just because the officers are sick and tired of your whining.  (I'm an officer, if you can't tell. *grin* )<br />
<br />
My own guild is getting closer to the time when we'll switch to DKP.  Not quite there yet, I think.  Need to step up another tier or two, but soon as more and more of our members hit 60+ and want to raid more, it'll become more desired.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Arorot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">The following is my old guilds loot system it is a DKP and addresses the posted question at hand.<br />
<br />
1) Points counting <br />
<br />
First slain of an uber mob : 8<br />
Attempt on an uber mob that we haven't killed before : 4<br />
Slain of an uber mob : 4<br />
Common raid (includes armor farming) : 2<br />
Showing up for more than half of raid period : 100% points<br />
Showing up for less than half of raid period : 50% points<br />
Late night raids : 50% points<br />
<br />
It is basicly 2 4 8 , actually it is based on 1 2 4 system, but I doubled it . The reason why I doubled it is to avoid odd numbers like 0.5. To be fair, people aren't able to get full points as conditions listed above.<br />
<br />
2) Loots trading <br />
<br />
People who has the highest total points gets the loot.<br />
People who sends tell for the loot loses 2 point.<br />
Points cost for a loot = ( number of people who send tell ) X 2 + ( number of raid people ) / 5<br />
<br />
For example, I got 6 tells for a plate BP in a 23 people raid (tov farming), so the cost will be 6 X 2 + 4 = 16 . The people who has the highest points ( 68 ) gets the BP and then loses 16 points, so he has 52 points left.<br />
<br />
By this way, we avoid the trouble of making a database of 500 items and avoid the trouble of tuning the cost of each item. And it still reflects the value of an item. <br />
<br />
This is just one take on the DKP.Personally I liked losing 2 points for sending a tell on loot.It made people think a little longer as to whether they REALLY want the item at hand or not.<br />
Late night raids were only counted as half value so people that played 24/7 couldnt amass as many added points as someone that worked and needed to log to sleep.<br />
This was a medium sized guild about 40ish members just with a large pacific rim contingent.And they effectively punished themselves with the late night penalty.<br />
<br />
Of course there is one cause for discrepency here. In basing it on the number of people that send a tell for said item.<br />
Use the example of the plate BP above it cost the winner 16 points.now the same size raid force goes in to TOV again 4 months later and a plate BP drops only one person sends a tell and the BP ends up costing them 6 DKPs instead.<br />
Now two people have the same BP yet one paid less then half as many points to acquire.<br />
Not totally fair in one sense but when you view it from the stance that the original purchaser of the BP had its use for 4 months longer it balances out a bit more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">A small misconception here.<br />
<br />
My guild at the moment has 12 people. <br />
<br />
Yes I can keep track of everyones attendance.<br />
<br />
Besides loot doesnt really matter much to us. (for the most part)<br />
<br />
We upgrade and pass stuff down to each other. <br />
<br />
One person can keep track of raid attendance if they are precise about it. Even in a 90 man guild. It is called a who list and a computer. <br />
<br />
The people that I depend on will normally get more loot than the person that only plays two nights a week. The reason is if they are there when the loot drops they get first crack at it. But I have taken a peice of loot that will benifit somone who is not there and gotten it to them before too. If it isnt an upgrade and somone else in the guild can use it as an upgrade then we will give it to them.<br />
<br />
It may not make much sense to you. I am also not explaining it to the best of my ability. But the gist of it is the people in my guild are given upgrades when and how we are able. Mains first, twinks last. Cash loot (as in stuff to sell) are done on a random basis with people dropping out once they win something.<br />
<br />
I have gotten Zero upgrades from dropped loot in 3 months. But I am happy still. Because my friends are all improving and we can take some things like Radir Fireshower and The mini named in Umbral with  most of us on.<br />

The function of my guild is to play with each other and see and enjoy what norrath has to offer.  We will never kill Emporer. We will never Kill Seru. We will never go into Vex thall by ourselves. Yet we still have fun.<br />
<br />
Wow - demagogue much? I believe the above is a pretty strong indictment of the &quot; Officer reward system&quot; and a pretty strong argument FOR a points system.  <br />
<br />
Have I every done anything to you? Have I ever screwed you out of loot? Do you know of anyone that I have ever screwed over for loot? A 50 K item that a guildy needs is thiers. An item that only drops once every 100 spawns that the thief that has a 3 day a week play time has still gotten good upgrades.  I follow all the guidelines that the rest of the guild follows. Except I first ask if anyone can use an item more than I before I consider even thinking about getting it for myself.<br />
<br />
We are not in the guild for our own benifit. Every single person we have is in the guild not for what we can get for ourselves, they could go to other stonger guilds and get Phat loot. We are guilded because we know trust and like each other. I make it clear to any new recruit that if they want to be Uber to go elsewhere. But if they want to do things that others say is foolish, to go with a single group with no enchanter and no cleric and a necromancer as the primary healer to crypt, or do whatever a single group or two groups can do then they might like us. <br />
<br />
I do not play like the uber guilds. I have people around me that agree with me. I also have people around that call me a damn fool.  We don't always agree, but at least we trust each other. <br />
<br />
I am not playing the game to aquire phat loots. I am playing to enjoy the challange and avoid the headaches. I am old enough and wise enough now to know I will never be the best in the world at this stupid game.  <br />

But I am the best in the world at being Snoww Silverhammer, a simple shaman who sometimes is a bear. And likes to hit things.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Boraman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">No one has really mentioned one huge advantage to the points method. <br />
<br />
And that is controling your own destiny.   I get to pick my own upgrades, not my GM not a loot council, but me.  For me thats huge, and I think for end-game items its huge.  <br />
<br />
Just read a few of the end-game equipment threads, there are so many options out there its impossible for one or a few people to determine what best for your character.  So for me I'm happy I can save my points and hold out for a Belt of Dorf slaying rather than being awared some other belt that I dont care for. <br />
<br />
&lt;i&gt;I am not playing the game to aquire phat loots. I am playing to enjoy the challange and avoid the headaches. &lt;/i&gt;<br />
<br />
So are we all.   This doesn't change the fact that phat lewts do indeed drop and must be awarded to someone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Tryg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">My guild has tried a few different methods of loot, the first one was full random rolls which resulted in a very similar case to Faern where a new low level monk got the Rak cloak over more senior monks.<br />
<br />
Secondly we did a raid attendance points scheme where you got points based on attending raids with more if you were there all the time, points were used by auctioning the items with anyone allowed to roll though this was tightened up on later on. The scheme itself was good in the end but needed a lot of work to maintain and got some bitching as people got their points missed off etc.<br />
<br />
Thirdly for ease of use the current scheme is a loot channel is set up for one or more officers plus two or three random (ish) members of the guild. Any loot is announced in the loot channel and people decide whether it should be a default or who should be allowed to roll also taken into account is activeness etc so that someone may get three shots at an item against a casual player that will only get one. This is a very fast system to use, it is transparant so people in the guild dont think you are scamming as it isnt officers that decide and gives the most chances to the most active people but allows the casuals players a chance at the loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Gotesblud</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">No system will satisfy all members, all of the time. Under DKP systems, casual players will sometimes complain, not seeing the fairness inherent in the principle that says, &quot;if you do more, you get more.&quot; Under officer decided loot systems, both non-officers and officers alike succumb to various misapprehensions, bias, selfishness, and favoritism at times. Unjustifiable calls are inevitable, just given the human factor -- and this can and does create turmoil within a guild's ranks.<br />
<br />
 In my opinion, though,  a hybrid system is best -- one that tracks participation as well as loot, but allows the guild officers to use this information to make informed decisions when awarding drops. This can be as detailed as the guild officers want it to be, with the general principle being the more information conveyed, the better.<br />
<br />
 Strictly speaking on a DKP vs. Officer's Decision system, I think either can work fairly well. Guilds that have used both types of systems have survived and even flourished since the early days of EQ. It just depends a lot on the guild composition and temperament. In any case, I think a /random system is absolutely the worst system, as exceptional merit can effectively be nullified by bad luck.<br />

Gotesblud, thanks for that idea.<br />
Question... where did the +4 come from in the equation above?<br />
<br />
=======================================<br />
<br />
Thank you everyone for your input on this thread.<br />
It came close to getting hijacked a few times, but the arguments raised were very good, and well thought out. I was really hoping this one wouldn't catch on fire *laughs*<br />
<br />
I really appreciate you all taking the time to answer my questions.<br />
As an officer of my guild, and (if we adopt this system) the likely Keeper of the Points, I knew I could turn to the crucible to find out everything I needed to know about this issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Arorot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Read the equation again on where the plus 4 pts came from.<br />
The formula is number of tells sent for item times 2 PLUS the number of people on the raid divided by 5 ;)<br />
so in the example above 23 people were used 23 divided by 5 = 4 (we always rounded down)<br />
so <br />
6tells sent for plate bp x 2pts per tell =12pts<br />
                                                                 +<br />
23 people on raid divided by 5 would =  4pts<br />
                                                              ______<br />
                                                              <br />
therefore the bp used in example costs  16pts</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Points cost for a loot = ( number of people who send tell ) X 2 + ( number of raid people ) / 5 <br />
<br />
For example, I got 6 tells for a plate BP in a 23 people raid (tov farming), so the cost will be 6 X 2 + 4 = 16 . The people who has the highest points ( 68 ) gets the BP and then loses 16 points, so he has 52 points left. <br />
<br />
<br />
The 4 points come from the 23people / 5 = 4 (rounded down I assume)<br />
<br />
BTW I like the idea of this as far DKP goes. The fact that it generates points for items 'on the fly' sounds like a good idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">Does the person winning the item have an opportunity to back out when he finds out what it costs?  Or, in the case of noone having enough points once the cost is calculated, what happens?  This seems like one of the craziest DKP implementations I've heard of, but there's probably a lot of details that have been left out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Torelorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">My question is this:<br />
<br />
How did you come up with that formula?  I am sure there is some detailed reasoning behind it and I would like to know the particulars.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Arorot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Hehe its not that deep on a reasoning level its just that most guilds go by a FOH DKP system which is really complex and takes constant retuning of item pt values.<br />
Can you imagine what kinda headache every expansion must be for whoever maintains the point values of items? (hears POP knocking on the door)<br />
Or even when a guild moves to the next level of encounters say from kunark dragons to velious uber mobs youll either need to retune the value of a kunark class BP or up the price on anything in velious.<br />
<br />
To answer the question about backing out , no thats never occured.But then if you REALLY want the item at hand the point cost shouldnt deter you.Remember the person with the most points wins the item anyways.In addition it allowed foir the person needing the upgrade more to attain it.A warrior with a thurg plate BP would be less likely to send a tell (and lose points)for a Kael one if five other warriors were still in barbed ringmail or whatever.<br />
<br />
Also it helped keep one person from dominating the top of the pile.But we had two people hit negative numbers.like neg 3 or neg 1 DKPs after a raid.Once someone was in negative of course they would only get anything by default (which still cost minimal points of number of raiders divided by 5)<br />
You dont really know the cost of the item til about a week later. <br />
We were updating fairly regularly.Just a simple spread sheet on our web page at a glance would tell you who all had how many points.GL or raid leader just kept track of who got what at how many points.<br />
Everyone kept a fairly close eye on their points as well so if say a vindi BP dropped and i had 80 pts and another shaman on the raid only had 50 they wouldnt bother to send a tell.<br />
<br />
Just for point of reference most in the guild were seasoned raiders,id guesstimate 80% or better were already decked out in TOV gear with some luclin pieces thrown in here and there.<br />
But to me the beauty of the system is it should reflect a fair value on any item dropped no matter the raid level of the guild.</div></div><hr />
