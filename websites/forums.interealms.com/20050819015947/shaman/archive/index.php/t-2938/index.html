I need suggestions on which one to chose. Any suggestions would be appreciated. Thank you for ur time.<br />

But make ogre, too many barb shamans around :D</div></div><hr />

Please notice where I said within a week people will be asking certain questions.<br />
<br />
Looks like I was off by about 6 days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sengal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Honestly, play what you like. There is no &quot;best&quot; race. Although Barbarians &gt; than all :)<br />
<br />
What you could do is try both races. You can level to 10 in less than 6 hours untwinked these days so you can get a feel for what race fits your personality better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Between those two races, unless the additional 10% exp penalty on an ogre is an issue, I'd go ogre all the way.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Moonhaawk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">IMHO I think it depends on how comfortable you are in EQ.  If this is one of your first characters, I think a good race will be easier for you.  Many more &quot;welcome mats&quot; are out.  Less KOS.  If not, the age old debate will continue.  Good luck and good hunting..<br />

Why: Too many Barbs already and Ogres don't wear dresses. Oh wait those are kilts...NM ! <br />

Be born unto us as a child of Halas...the drinks are better and the fires a warmer....and everyonce in a while we throw Bandl McMerrin down the well for kicks....he's such a good sport.<br />

It's too cold, your ass freezes to the ground when you sit down. You have to take a friggin raft to get to town, and you can barely see 2 feet ahead of you because of all the damn snow. Nice place to live for a race that is blind as a bat ! <br />
<br />
Only good thing about Halas are the drinks and the chicks !<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
/em drools over female Barb boobies !  ( o Y o )<br />
WooHoo !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hey how you get a pic of Gloriana's boobies, stormrazor?  No fair :/<br />
<br />
Anyway, ah yes, the good ol' race discussion.  Before the lurking idiots like Ogrym crawl out of their holes to throw in their biased 2cp worth, let me offer you an objective response.<br />
<br />
Barbs -- pros: low EXP penalty, good starting faction, can wear all types of shaman armor (save for race/deity-specific stuff of course).<br />
--cons:  night blind, most common shaman race (this bugs some people, but I could care less), no innate racial advanages (such as unstunnability, natural regen, natural nightvision, etc.)<br />
<br />
Ogres -- pros: Awesome melee stats, cannot be stunned from the front, innate night vision.<br />
--cons: Horrible starting faction (although, old world faction really isn't a big issue anymore), high EXP penalty (10%), more limited in what they can wear (compared to Barb), low starting WIS.<br />
<br />
That's just a very basic guide to the two races.  What it ultimately boils down to is what suits you the most.  Not having fun with your Barb?  Then remake an ogre.  Same goes for the opposite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'd say both races are practically equal in effectiveness.  Pick whichever one you think is cooler and go with it (the correct answer, btw, is iksar).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Originally posted by stormrazor <br />

<br />
You have to take a friggin raft to get to town<br />
 <br />
<br />
The raft is for visitors.  True natives of Halas prefer a bracing dip in the pool...  and it helps keep up that Swimming skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I got a spiritstone, and now I love going back to Halas.  It has all my baking supplies, there's no one around, and it has some of the best newbies in the game.  I can't really explain it, but there's a definite difference between the newbie are here and in Gfay when it comes to quality of players.</div></div><hr />
