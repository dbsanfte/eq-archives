You used to be only able to buy these for around 550pp per stack so i'm going to be selling stacks for 200pp or so - you will always get some people to lazy to raise their brewing skill so there will be a market for them. Makes Velious smithing and tailoring a lot better now....<br />
<br />
Oh and check this thread for a sort of short cut to one of the ingredients:<br />

<br />
But 200 is what it costs to brew a stack.<br />
<br />
4 x 0.126 - Celestial Solvent<br />
4 x 1.575 - The Scent of Marr<br />
0.079 - Shotglass<br />
0.010 - Water Flask<br />
0.016 - Brown Algae<br />
2.100 - Allspice<br />
--------<br />
9.009 pp per Coldain Velium Temper<br />
<br />
It's a lot of clicking and travelling, but yeah it's cheaper than buying them from the vendor for 26.250 each.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I hate to break it to you but alchemy skill has nothing to do with making these. All combines are brewing. Sure it uses 1 alchemy component but it's all brewing skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sartog1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">200 or so I said - after I broke the cost down I realised and am selling em for 300pp per stack - still a considerable saving. <br />
<br />
As for the not requiring alchemy I think you'll find that one of these combo's does require you to be able to learn the skill  - a lot of people (with trivial brewing skills i.e. 160+) are reporting failures on one these combo's - cant remember which I didnt read all the posts that accurately as there was a lot to plow through. With 163 brewing I failed 5 combo's out of 60.<br />
<br />
*shrug* already got my first customer who wants 5 stacks at 300pp - which will instantly repay all the money i've plowed into my trade skills (alchemy non-withstanding of course ;) )</div></div><hr />

Ok show me the combine that happens in the potion bag not the brew barrel because thats the only way it would be alchemy skill. the combine people where talking about was in a mortar and pestle (poison making container).<br />
<br />
If you finish reading the thread the one combine that people where complaining about seems to have been made a no fail combine anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sartog1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm not sure it is a no fail combine - you must remember that the char who originally did the shawl quest's and walkthroughs was a shaman and to him it is no fail - but i'll have to talk to a few of my friends in game when they get to this combine in there shawls and see what they say. From the threads it is quite obviously an alchemy combine using the mortar and pestle even though that is a poison making implement. *shrug* obviously verant changed things for this one recipe - or it is in error</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Celestial Essence is done in a mortar &amp; pestal (poison skill, but it doesn't matter because it's no-fail -- I've done about 1000 of them).  The other two combines for velium tempers are done in a brew barrel (brewing skill).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sartog1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeah if the celestial essence is coming of poison skill why are all we shamans having absolutely no problems but other classes are failing on this combo? I'll keep checking the eqtrader boards really need to see if a rogue is suceeding constantly at this - because druids definitely arent. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>FilurGlamrist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Just after the recipee went live on may 8th you could fail the solvent combine. This was changed in the followup patch and now i havent seen anyone saying they fail the combine.<br />
<br />
I have also done several hundred of them and have yet to fail one.<br />
