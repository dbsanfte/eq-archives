<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lonig</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wondering why there seems to be so many new shamans out there? On my server(torv) there are people saying its the flavor of the month and all that.<br />
<br />
I've been gone from EQ for about a year now, and just wondered whats changed so much that people are playing them now more than then?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A lot of druids don't like that they have been turned into mini-clerics. Perhaps that's part of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If I had to guess, I'd say it's because the long-time shamans are all quitting, and the people twinking them up don't really know the issues with shamans in the high-end game... yet.</div></div><hr />

I played a beastlord to 50 untwinked and it was scary how much more useful than my shaman it was.  Faster slows kickass pet and you can smack stuff and do dps.  Its funner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">yeah, when I left 6 months ago for FFXI, one of the deciding factors was how useless I was feeling when raiding with my guild (getting ready for elementals at that point) due to the fact that we had about 4 or even 5 shaman at most raids. <br />
Now I'm back, shaman are much more sparse, and while not rare, we are back to normallity. What I think is happening on Torv, is probably a residue of slow levelers from the Flavour of the Month feelings a while back? :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lately I've just been grouping with people in my guild...haven't gone LFG (except for raids =P) for a week or two now. I guess next time I'm on I'll check out how many shamans are LFG.<br />
<br />
Lonig: Where are you seeing all these shaman popping up? You see them running through PoK? /who all lfg? Either of those might show how the class is just becoming more useless...shamans hanging out in PoK or showing up alot on the lfg search tool because people don't want them in groups? /shrug<br />
<br />
I guess you could compare us to swimwear during the winter...no one is buying us so if we don't get put away in storage, you'll see us all over the store? Bah, for some reason that sounds bad. Probably because I've got a phone ringing in my ear...</div></div><hr />

Besides people looking forward to my FA spell and haste and my slows I can't help but feel useless.  For one ldon mission I felt I had a purpose but hated it because I was the main healer.  The 69 other missions I keep wondering to myself are the other people wondering why I am not dishing out any damage?  Besides dog dog the only other damage I do is BoN because the damage is faster than BoU and higher in a shorter amount of time and most mobs we face die before BoN runs out.  Still after I read message after message of critical hit this, critical spell that, I wonder if people see my message 214 non melee damage every so often.  The only time I use melee is on a caster mob for interuptions.  As I have said though I love ldon and I am at the point where people start looking for me to join their group but I still feel useless damage wise.  Is there a different spell I should be using to up my damage or should I not worry about anything since this is how the shaman is ment to be played?  I am not in a raiding guild so I don't have that nice uber gear.  Also a person above mentioned something about getting lots of tells for buffs running through PoK.

Well it takes a lot of mana and more cannying work but I can usually get off 2-3 spear of torments each fight in normal LDON.  With max crit aa's thats about 2500 damage per fight, say puppy does 500 (on a good day).  So, buffing, hasting, slowing, FA, and 3k damage per mob - I'd say that is carrying my weight and then some. Plus it is nice to get all the crit messages.  If I really want to lay out the smack - say boss mob, I can add in the little puppies, pop in spear of fate and alternate tears of saryrn, spear,spear, tears, spear, spear and thats probably about 7-8k on the boss.  I have not mememed a dot in about 2 years except for soloing.<br />
<br />
But, I have all mana saving aa's, ornate boots, ornate gloves and FT 12 and Iksar regen to keep up the pace.  I am absolutely sold on our quicker casting DD's (quicker only in relation to the joke cold one).  Bane is the only possible dot I would use in place of a DD and the recast time is too long for my taste because I like maximimum flexibility.  <br />
<br />
Something to think about and to perhaps make a goal of - since you might need something to get excited about (if you read these boards and have not rerolled a beasty, lol).  Shaman are still a good class - we just need to work harder than everyone else unfortunately to keep up.  That's the sad truth I rarely see stated on this board.  Bards don't work any harder than a well played shaman.<br />

Now its starting to fall back again, many guilds need shaman again because many people are quiting, particularly, shaman. I now see alot of lower level shaman (lvl 60-64) on the rise again. They are all new too. At one time I knew all the lvl 65 shaman on the server. That ceases to exist anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My guild alone has about 6 active shaman...<br />
<br />
http://www.soulsofthearcane.net/roster.htm ... SOTA has 15 of them ... and they're all active characters. This does not count the shaman alts currently guilded, nor does it count those guilded as of three weeks ago (slow to update the roster). *sigh* I suppose it's a nice problem to have. But I'll tell you what ... I'm my guild's main slower, it's rare that I miss a raid. I have one shaman I put on Malos every raid because I can trust that she'll cast it quickly enough so as to make Turgur's worth something. But when you've got three other shaman who show up to a raid (YES, that's 5 shaman on a raid, and we've had up to 7) and you're the senior shaman trying to find jobs for everyone ... life can suck. Badly.<br />

We were still actively recruiting shamans up until a few weeks ago. We also have quite a few shaman bots.<br />

Its funny though cause sometimes life is pretty boring on our raids. And some of the senior shamans still try to get me to mgb agi /boggle hehe.</div></div><hr />

I feel useful, but we're doing tier 2/3 stuff and working on VT keys.  I believe I'm nearing the peak of my usefulness at this point, though.  When I do Hard LDoNs or used to go to Gates zones, I felt pretty darn useless.  The good news for me is that due to time contraints, I'm about maxed out on what I can do from a time commitment anyway.  I feel for the folks that the newer content and &quot;end game&quot; stuff is doing to our class.  Honestly, if I logged on today and all my characters were gone, I'd probably start a shaman again knowing that the major issues will probaby never affect me, but I'm sure many of you wouldn't.</div></div><hr />

Urm... not picking on you, but that's casting epic dot 4 times on boss mob... 9 second cast each... for 36 seconds of casting time.  I've never seen the boss mob last more than a minute.  ;) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">On tarew, there's a huge shortage of slowers, healers and tanks (from least to most).  Popping up the LFG tool will yield a boatload of DPS classes, a few tanks, a cleric or druid or three and maybe an enchanter or shaman.  2 shaman LFG at the same time (and I'm one of them) is unusual, unless it's in the middle of prime time, then it happens 2-3 nights a week.  I've found that I get groups within 10 minutes and I'm either the last (&quot;just need a slower guys&quot;) or the first (&quot;I better get the slower nailed down first&quot;).<br />
<br />
My favorite slow is now tigirs.  As said, no one notices the difference and slowing 4 mobs are once means you can not dork around with single pulling - which any halfway competent pick LDoN group shouldn't have to do anyway.  I've even offtanked when the ranger got whiny about his melee DPS being so much lower than his bow.<br />
<br />
And yes, I 2 box with a SK if I don't feel like grouping - the SK was my first main but he fell behind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I have one issue with slowing with Tigir's.  If you have multiple mobs with the same name and cast this spell you have no idea, at first, which mobs resisted or not.</div></div><hr />

And yes, I noticed the lack of bards - that's why one has been my main for 4 months now. I'm having a blast, I feel much more useful than my shaman, and I'm usually fighting off the &quot;want a group?&quot; tells even without LFG on.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Rokktor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">I two box a shaman with my SK main.  Why?  Because enchanters can't heal, BLs can't heal, clerics can't slow, and druids don't heal all that great nor slow.  <br />
<br />
In my guild, we are lucky to get 1 shaman main on a raid.  Three of us knights have a shaman bot at 60+, and one enchanter (wth?) has a 62 shaman bot as well.  One of the clerics also has a shaman bot around 60 but he never brings him.<br />
<br />
I guess it really boils down to... a cleric is hard to bot on raids because they are on the CHC.  A shaman bot on the other hand, is only really needed for slows if they happen to be the highest one in attendance.  After that, the bot can be ignored.  And for offtanking on raids, a shaman bot is enough to keep me alive.<br />
<br />
Besides, I can get Virtue and C3 in PoK and they last a long time.  <br />
<br />
I've played a druid then cleric to 55-56.  My shaman is almost 62 and is definitely the best bot I could have.  He basically covers all bases between focus, slow, haste, heals, SoW for pet pulls, regen for lich, shrink because I'm an ogre, invis so he can travel (unlike a cleric).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Predicus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">It is very true that there are a lot of shammy bots out there, but with playing on the Brell server there seems to be a shortage of shaman mains.  I tend to spend more and more time in /role mode when farming/traveling through PoK, but that doesn't seem to stop me from getting tells for groups.  I just recently broke 200 aa's and finished up the healing section, and Wow! its a substantial difference.  I went from healing for 1300 to healing 1600-1700 (crit for 3.3-3.4k [often]) on heals with aa's/focus effect.  I see no problem covering the main healing roll for any group role outside of GoD. (GoD is broke, lousy content)  I have also noticed that the people I group with have increased &quot;gear-wise&quot;.   Elemental/Time guilds seem to be hurting on shaman attendance outside of raid times, and are picking up indies.  Those indy shamans that cut the mustard on competence get repeat tells in the future and so on.  I played around with different dps options in LDoN, (I had the same problem- felt useless in the dps department for quite a while) and here were some things I noticed:<br />
<br />
1.  It takes longer to build up a shaman than other classes, many of our abilities start out as sub-par, but with aa's go to avg/above avg.<br />

2.  If you want to up your dps- I think LR5/ID5 is mandatory. (you are going to get aggro at some point) <br />
<br />
3.  Get Bane / Tears of Saryrn asap [getting VP3 is also highly recommended.]<br />
<br />
reasons:<br />
<br />
- Tears of Saryrn seemed to solve a few issues for me.  It helped regulate my mana usage better than any other nuke.  Before I would use Spear of Torment (2-3 casts) where now I usually cast 1-2 ToS.<br />
ToS has a higher resist rate for being a rain, but seems to get resisted as often as every other spell in our book so its not like we are losing out on that one.<br />
<br />
- Bane is a good backup spell when you have too many mezzed/rooted mobs jumbled up together where your aoe would be detriemntal.  I also use Bane when I need an opportunity to Canni.<br />
<br />
- VP3 is great for mob positioning in LDoN when you need to make some room for ToS or split adds off the MT. [Side benefit: VP irritates 9 out of 10 enchanters- thumbs up for me!]  [Another side benefit: when a mob somehow happens to be punted to the top of a wall- no one suspects the shaman- another thumbs up for me!]<br />
<br />
PoP zones seem to work the same way for me as LDoN, just mobs with more hps, so I sometimes switch out nukes for dots.  GoD on the other hand, is a completely different story.<br />
<br />
Ferubi seems to be the flavor of the month on Brell- it has a decent xp rate and doesn't require flagging to access.  Group make-up is pretty standard: tank, monk/bard, dps, slower, cleric, dps/cc.  Same setup applies to the Sewer trials, and think the druid is hurting more on invites to these areas because a. they can't slow b. they can't rez.  <br />
<br />
Tipt/Vxed trials are another matter and mostly because you need: A. a competant chanter that is used to playing with charmed mobs and B. a decent to above avg tank.  Tanks really have a hard time actually tanking the mobs if they are not sitting at around 8k unbuffed, so if they can't then the enchanter pet is tanking which tends to get ugly real quick.  Class dps is neglible in the trials where you have a chanter pet, so I see mages hurting more than us.  I also see rangers and druids interchangable depending on the tank's hitpoints.  If the tank is at 8k or above then groups tend to grab a druid for extra healing, if the tank is below then they tend to grab a ranger for the weapon shield disc.  <br />
<br />
As for OoW, its going to have to answer a lot of complaints from a varied customer base in order to be successful:<br />
<br />
- A brand-new fun timesink: titles or the &quot;quest system&quot; might do it.<br />
<br />
- New, upper tier, finished, un-craptastic, raid content that kicks the GoD guilds out of time with viable upgrades for equivalent risk.<br />
<br />
- New content for the casual player: &quot;quest system&quot; might do it.<br />
<br />
Its a lot to live up to for one expansion that seems to be rushed, but I will stick around to see what happens.</div></div><hr />
