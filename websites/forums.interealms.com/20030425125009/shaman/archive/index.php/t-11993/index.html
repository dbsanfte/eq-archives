<br />
I have a 65 shaman and was wondering what is the best way to PL my enchanter.  Any one have experience ?  I know since shaman have no mana regen buffs, this will take a while.   Any good suggestion of tactics and zones to go ?<br />
<br />
Also what is the main Enchanter Forums site ? is there one ??<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Find a low level melee, usually a level or two below your enchanters level and PL them together.</div></div><hr />

I just PL'd my enchanter to 29 with my 56 Shaman. I think we did a newbie zone for the first three levels, then moved to east commons until like level 7 or so, then into Paludal Caverns until 23, then to Frontier Mountains at the giant fort until 29.<br />
<br />
 Up until I got the memory wipe, I would just sit haste Mr. Gnome and his pet, sit back and heal. Of course I bought him a fast weapon, and buffed him to the hilt. Then when the mob got to like 40% health, step in and smack em with my hammer.<br />
<br />
 When I got memory wipe, in PC and FM, I would just slow and melee them myself down to like 10% or less, root them and back up. Memory wipe with the gnome, then cast a couple spells, and melee them with the gnome. Went pretty fast, especially in PC. I'd say got 4 levels in 2 hours, maybe more. In FM, I'd get a level every 1-2 hours or so. I picked the giant fort because I was comfortable with the area, and could get some good loot while we were there. I bound myself there, when I got a load of the lore weapons, I'd use my Everfrost port, sell them and gate back for more.<br />

 Free clarity for all!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Baldkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Some ideas...<br />
<br />
You pull with slow, then root mob.<br />
<br />
Chanter steps in, does 1 dmg, pet attacks (focused and hasted)<br />
<br />
Chanter backs off<br />
<br />
You heal pet<br />
<br />
Mob at 40% you sick dogdog on it to kill faster.<br />
<br />
Buff pet to the  hilt, and buy mage toys for it too (if you can)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Wow, memwipe is a great way to PL a chanter.  What level do chanters get that?<br />
<br />
I have PL'd casters before and it's a real pain past level 20 because their melee sucks so bad.  I usually find a melee and they are happy to be PL'd along with my chanter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Make a bunch of DS potions and use them on your chanter to level through the early levels.  Basically do this: drink potion, run into newbie area and whack mob for 1pt of damage, run to next mob whack for 1pt of damage, run to next ... you will be level 15 in like an hour.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Doesn't our best DS potion do lvl/2 dmg (not to mention lasting like lvl/4 minutes)?  Seems like the mobs would take you out before that would kill them, plus you'd be broke from the duration issues.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>ludgurorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">damage shield method is ok for low levels to get the chanter some def skill ups but I would ask a druid to do it.  Potions way too expensive.  teen levels, group with a melee and sponge exp.  Easiest pay to powerlevel was to /ooc Shaman 65 looking for powerlevel a ranger, no charge.  People always wanted to do this even only getting 1/2 the exp.<br />
<br />
after i got mem wipe, I pulled with malo line, and used dogdog to pound the mob then enchanter mezzes.  this step is crucial. Once mezzed, pet stops attacking, and you have time to mem wipe which can take 2-3 attempts.  Without mezz, you usually lose the mob to the dog.  Until the wipe occurs the dog is still high on the hate list.   I would also position the dog and the enchanter at sharp angles so you can see the mob turn toward the chanter.  This means you are now on top of the hate list and memwipe worked.  then nuke or let pet finish mob off.  remember to do 1 pt damage with chanter to get full exp.<br />

Ran the enchanter from 1 to 35 in a few weeks doing this then lost interest.</div></div><hr />
