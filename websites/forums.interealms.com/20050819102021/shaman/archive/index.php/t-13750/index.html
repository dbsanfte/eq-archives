<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kazgal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello fellow shaman's <br />
<br />
Im having a &quot;MAJOR&quot; problems atm and was wondering if any of you have expericed it.<br />
<br />
The problem is when i join a channel i.e Auction or a raid channel it will only last for 20-30sec and then it disappears + i cant join anyothers and i cant even do a /list (to see if im still joined in that channel) the only way i know of how to fix this issue is to zone but then again i have only 20 - 30 sec's and then no channel.<br />
<br />
This goes for any channel i want to join example raid channel or auction or whatever. <br />
<br />
It suxs bigtime as i have formatted my HDD twice + reaload EQ twice! <br />
<br />

<br />
thx <br />

Did you recently purchase some new computer networking hardware, i.e. a router?  It could also be your high speed provider if this just started...<br />
