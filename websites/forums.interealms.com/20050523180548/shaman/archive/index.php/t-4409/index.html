<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">For an owlbear spear, or whatever it is called.<br />
<br />
The 6 ac the owlbear offers is apealing, but I don't know if I want to give up my Harpoon, sentimental and stun has saved my ass quite a few times.<br />
<br />
I know the genral rule is never weigh a proc on a weapon very highly when picking, but it does proc quite often and is very usefull.<br />
<br />
Very undecided.<br />
<br />
Plus the 600+ extra plat I could make off the swap would be nice.<br />
<br />
Plus dosent the owlbear have a better delay?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">right now im using a spine chill .<br />
<br />
im actualy happy with it . the only other thing i can think of off the top of my head besides epic would be Rune Etched Ice Wurm Fang . when you melee as well as us :p  its nice ot have procs and with the dex buffs we get , they proc alot ;)</div></div><hr />

not bad considering you can get it in the bazaar from 300-600 pp<br />
from the stats i posted i wuld still go with the spine chill . 28 delay is still very low and it hits harder *shrugs*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I upgraded from Slimey Harpoon to Spine Chill poker, and I'm quite happy with it, good damage, low delay and a ice proc. Got a great deal on it too, bought mine for 150pp. Wish someone would make a typo when I'm looking for a REIF. DAMN !! <br />
Only a few other spears I'd trade it for Epic (duh), REIF, or Winterstorm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The stun on the howler is too short a duration and too random (in the case of fighting casters) to be as effective as the spears posted by Litgruv.  I personally would go with the the Owlbear as I cast more and the AC might help against aggro damage.  Then again, I like resists.  Procs are candy, if you got the dex and a haste item, only then would I consider a proc as a basis of equiping an item.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you really think 5ac is worth it though ? if it ws 10 or more id agree , i know ever lil bit helps , but i personal didnt think  that small amount was worth it which is why i recommended the spine chill .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kikak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">With Focus, I can hit max of 72 so far with the winterstorm. I don't have piercing maxxed yet.<br />
<br />
23/22 spear plust stats and click DD is not bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm going to get myself one as the AC is ideal for those of us who are using horses and so don't actually melee much anymore.<br />
<br />
I've got a spine chill spear but I usually swap it out for my little bowl I got from the grimling chief. Can't remember the title but it has 5AC and some wis. The only problem is my guild mates all take the piss out of me for carrying that instead of my spear ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vallya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">(ooc)<br />
I just swapped Vallya's Spine Chill for the Owl Feather. Owl does less damage, but what kind of melee damage is a 52 shaman doing anyway? I'd rather have the 5ac. If you like a pointy stick with a stun, shop for a Spear of Mortification(sp). Its a stun proc with a 21 delay. I picked one up for 75 plat and swap it for the Owl when I fight casters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">im a 52 shaman and i do alot of melee. im about 50/50 solo/group</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I just wish the owlbear spear fit in the range slot. then it would rock! :)</div></div><hr />
