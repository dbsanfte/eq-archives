<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xhosa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sorry to start another thread like this.<br />
<br />
Why is it when balancing thread come around that the JBB always gets brought into it. I don't understand how an item that not all of the class can use be seriously considered a balancing item.<br />
<br />
The fact is the Shaman is defined by his abilities as a spell caster and is LUCKY enough to be a large/medium size so our defence stats are better (which is pure luck more than anything).<br />
<br />
NO right-click item can be considered a balancing tool PERIOD .... EVER. <br />
<br />
A shaman that can take down a big mob without the JBB is real class. A shaman that claim to do it but used a JBB is not.  <br />
<br />
When you consider balancing a class you have to take into account the non-guilded shaman (with no online friends) and with no epic or JBB into account.<br />
<br />
At level 55 in Kael Arena I had 2 giants wacking on me and I still managed to channel through a slow. There is nothing wrong with our channeling. It just requires a bit of luck. But it feels great knowing you gave the clerics time to camp out by holding agro long enough and the CR changed from 2 hours to 10 minutes (Thanks to 5 PoZ's being trained into us)<br />
<br />
Now what balancing features do you propose ?<br />
<br />
1) I would like the epic boots to be permanent run-speed 4 or 5 instead of click-sow. Either that or allow us to cast it on others as well. ( Not likely to happen)<br />
<br />
2) Fix the Alchemy prices and effects . I want to have some fun with my own trade skill.  (VI are probably just too lazy to fix)<br />
<br />
3) VI to test their changes before they implement them. (Even less likely to happen than 1 above)<br />
<br />
4) Fix the money drops on mobs. Higher levels should drop more money. Then you wouldn't have mindless money grinding to buy that Torpor or Malo. Instead you could group or solo and gain the rewards. Example is the over camped HG's. Some people say you must try organise those higher levels spells in your early 50's, but some of us don't want to spend 500 hours camping HG's and other non-experience mobs. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Potens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1.) As said before right click/eq should not determine the shaman/balanced. So why did you include that?  Anyways I wouldn't wear the boots they have bad stats.  So that permanent run speed would be a nerf.<br />
<br />
2.) Alchemy prices are the way Verant wants them, they are not &quot;lazy&quot; but content.<br />
<br />
3.) That is not a balance issue.<br />
<br />
4.) More money in the economy would just make the price rise.  The only way to make the price of the spell drop is make the spell drop more often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I use jbb when soloing regular mobs like around 45-50, but I hardly ever use it in difficult encounters, except maybe towards the end when he's trying to run.<br />
<br />
Anyways, with high level mobs, there's not really much time to jbb.  If the mobs are doubling in the 200s, you're not gunna wait 8 seconds so that hopefully a 263 dd can land.  Fights like those take dots (including epic if you have), hasted pet, canni IV like mad, and torpor.</div></div><hr />

- Defense stats? Translation please. Every race has same defense skill for the same class, and small races have MORE AGI than bigger ones. So your point was?<br />
<br />
A shaman that can take down a big mob without the JBB is real class. A shaman that claim to do it but used a JBB is not.  <br />
- &quot;Only a fool would throw his advantages away&quot; - Sun Tzu. So when I get less damage because my IGS absorbs more than a junk shoulders it means I am NOT a &quot;real shaman&quot;. Or when I deal out more damage with my Barbarian Spiritist Hammer? Or how about an Iksar wearing superior hate armor? Right, unless every shaman has a specific set of gear he is not a &quot;real shaman&quot;. I think this is the most retarded thing I read in a while. Quite a long while.<br />
<br />
When you consider balancing a class you have to take into account the non-guilded shaman (with no online friends) and with no epic or JBB into account.<br />
- Wow, you should put a sign infront of your room: Do not disturb, genius at work.<br />
<br />
At level 55 in Kael Arena I had 2 giants wacking on me and I still managed to channel through a slow. <br />
- At level 60, went LD in AL's room. Next day get back, Guard up. Doubling for 400ish, I didn't bother slowing. I sit down, mem gate, gate, channel, get out. Do I win a medal?<br />
<br />
There is nothing wrong with our channeling. <br />
- You sure bring a lot of hard evidence and facts to this. Psssst, you tried the AA channeling skill?<br />
<br />
It just requires a bit of luck. <br />
- There is no such thing as luck. Even the random number generator is predictable, it's an algorythm.<br />
<br />
(Thanks to 5 PoZ's being trained into us)<br />
- 5 PoZ? Hardly probably. You have to split Kalis Stormcaller from the others, kill it, have someone pull Vindicator side PoZs THEN pull the cleric door PoZs and all that THE SAME TIME. Of course that person will aggro a crapload of giants in the way.<br />
<br />
1) I would like the epic boots to be permanent run-speed 4 or 5 instead of click-sow. Either that or allow us to cast it on others as well. ( Not likely to happen)<br />
- This will surely address stackability issues, DoT resist issues, healing issues ...<br />
<br />
4) Fix the money drops on mobs. Higher levels should drop more money. <br />
- Mob coin loot is the perfect example of a caster balancing issue, especially shaman balancing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Let me guess, you are a persecuted, hunted and hates Iksar right?<br />
<br />
And also, after 2 years playing EQ, I finally seen the light: I AM NOT A REAL SHAMAN BECAUSE I JBB NUKE! Oh the horror! My life just flashed before my eyes, I am devastated. Goodbye cruel world! :(</div></div><hr />

Errr....<br />
<br />
While we are making a list of stupid stuff that is in no way necessary.<br />
<br />
1) Change JBB to a insta cast<br />
2) Gives shamans snare/ports/rez/Cheals<br />
3) Make all alchemy herbs cost 1cp each.<br />
4) Cana VI 1hp 100 mana</div></div><hr />

I think I detected a hint of bitterness in the original post... just a hint...  or maybe that was just BS, who knows.<br />

OK, everybody, what's the toughest MOB you have ever brought down NAKED?</div></div><hr />

It still kick ass at level 59, I have been using since level 47.  <br />
<br />
JBB = no down time, this is why it is considered a game breaking item.  <br />
<br />
If I didnt have a JBB I probaly be in my low 50's still.<br />
<br />
If your a solo or Duo Shaman this item is Godly, if your a group kind of Shaman then the JBB is not that big of a deal IMO.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not as effective as it use to be pre 60 -AA Skills - Focus Items.  I do much better now casting Ice Strike/Torrent of posion (Where AA skills come into play). Mana Reducing, Spell Haste, Damage Improvement Focus items come into play. I kill much faster using my regular spells then with the JBB.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I really like our black fur boots since they serve as an insta cast buff item against dispelling mobs.  The more insta click items, the better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Talamay Crystalspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">when i quit, i gave away my jbb.  at the time i wasn't using it much.  now that i'm playing again, i sure wish i had it.  i'm not in a guild, so i do a lot of stuff solo.  jbb sure makes it easier and less like work or drudgery.<br />
<br />
as for the four proposed balance issues... i think zorlac summed that up pretty well. <br />
<br />
there is of course the issue of healing outside a group for raid purposes, but for me that's pretty minor now.  more importantly is the lag in healing ability from 51 to level 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">/agree Gloriana<br />
<br />
Epic-bound Shamans come with a built-in clicky item, VERY useful for dispelling mobs.<br />
<br />
About the JBB:<br />
Until I got my epic this week, I had no idea how powerful mana-free damage can be.  A clickable nuke would have been REALLY useful for leveling up to now.  Root is trivial mana cost...having the extra mana to maintain the pet (particularly with the new pet exp rules) would have meant non-stop powerleveling myself to 55.   At this point, however, 250hps of extra clicky damage on an 8 second timer has limited usefulness except as a pull tool (i always pull with slow), or as a coup de grace tool.<br />
<br />
Yes, I agree that there should have been an Iksar answer to the JBB...but I managed to make it to (almost) 55 without it, and now that I'm here there are MUCH more powerful options.   We still look cool, and regen just a little extra..perhaps I should just keep a 250hp ice nuke memmed (NOT!).<br />
<br />
Let's talk about something else now..please?</div></div><hr />

Just came back from 1 year away......<br />

Had to start over.... was given a jbb on loan...<br />
<br />
It helps a bit... but if your one of those.... root blast... for 5 or 10 minute people then I assume its a boon for you...<br />
<br />
Me I like to group or duo.... it is helping in the prime jbb levels... 45 to 50 but I also see it as a nice toy... later... when I solo... and whatnot... I assume it will help me on my powerleveling...</div></div><hr />
