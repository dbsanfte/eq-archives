<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">well i was thinking , then i thought whats is our main role. i would say buffing debuffing.  secondary is healing , dps.<br />
<br />
i think we need a complete rethink of our buffing and debuffing. what we need in general is ways for our buff the really help mellees alot. So helping what damage they do, things that will increase thier maxium hit, increase there average dps and things that only shaman can do and really have an impact. at the moment we dont. examples increase max hit25%, increase proc damage 25% ?<br />
<br />
debuffing, again, our debuffing skills have degraded we to have a huge rethink /balance on this. i would say a cripple line that actually cripples, none this reduce stats crap thats does nothing , i mean reduces mobs max hit but %25/50%/75%? slow doesnt do that any more. 75% might be a bit high but 50% would be good. even if it didn`t stack with slow, could use slow on non mitagating mobs and cripple on ones that do. have debuffs that slow mobs procs or reduce proc damage?<br />
<br />
anyhow this what i think.<br />
<br />
some improvement of  secondary skills also needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Don't ask for static melee debuffs. If Shamans had a debuff to lower the target's dps by a set percentage, you'd have the Slow fiasco all over again and the class and it's future abilities woulod be balanced around it.<br />
<br />
If they want to give Shamans a useful debuff it would make sense to lower the hit rate of the target by X % of the target's hit percentage. <br />
<br />
This would result in a lower damage output of the target, but it wouldn't be as concrete as a slow since the RNG is streaky. Sometimes the mob would hit 30% of the time and others just 5%.<br />
<br />
This would add some uniqueness to the class and together with mitigated slows it would reinstate us as the kings of melee debuffers.<br />
<br />
However, healing would still need to be revised for all 3 priest classes. That's if they intend to keep EQ a popular and interesting game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I agree with what Bara Cudar posted. Those are the sorts of improvements that will most define a shaman's utility in the future IMO, and are definitely what I want anyway. Some sort of short duration mini versions of warrior defensive discs to help out the knights, A buff which would even out mob damage spikes (min hits for more, max hits for less, for example), an AC version of FA, a hp version of FA, the sort of situational things which can be decisive in the tougher fights.<br />
<br />
Our primary role I believe is to enhance our group and dis-enhance what we are fighting, and we need better tools to do that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You do not need to redesign our class from scratch to make us balanced. Give us some more healing, give us the current ancient cannibalize, bring our buffs in line with what everyone else got, give us some more DPS, preferably via nukes.<br />
<br />
That would make us a balanced class on balanced content. That is a completely different issue. With the content in GoD several classes are just left out in the cold and fully compensating for that will just make future content harder to balance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">main role of a shaman?  <br />
<br />
well, if you guage our main role by what we are most often asked for by other people (seems like a fair way to me)<br />
<br />
Focus<br />
STA and STR for the few that do not have it maxed<br />
SoW<br />
Haste<br />
Avatar<br />
Slow (about this time the tanks will ask if you are slowing the mobs)<br />
Regen<br />
Send in the Dog<br />
time to Reapply Haste and Avatar as the Rogue is yelling and you know it is flashing<br />
Reapply as necessary<br />
CHA so the main looter can sell for split.<br />
<br />
that about covers it, i think</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>TeodorLuath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think one of the problems with the shaman is not that we don't have good spells/abilities or that we don't have clear roles to fill in groups etc.  The problem is more that some of our abilities and roles have been trivialized.<br />
<br />
1) For elemental geared folks, are buffs aren't critical:<br />
<br />
Fo7<br />
<br />
Most people will want this because any extra HP is a good thing.  It helps that it stack with most other HP buffs, but the Str and Dex are unimportant<br />
<br />
FA<br />
<br />
Its usefulness is restricted by a short duration and long recast time.  But for the most part this is solid<br />
<br />
Talis of Diaku<br />
Talis of Boar<br />
Talis of Wrulan<br />
Talisman of Tribunal<br />
Ancestral Guard<br />
<br />
With the exception of Talisman of Tribunal, these are considered useless buff slots wasters by most folks and Talisman of Tribunal isn't regarded too highly by those who's resists are where they should be ;)<br />
<br />
I'd make some simple changes to solve these problems:<br />
<br />
a) Add a new HP buff along the lines of Talisman of Kragg that buffs approx 900 hp and stacks the same as Kragg.<br />
b) Add a group FA<br />
c) Add an Endurance regen buff<br />
<br />
2) Our debuffs need an upgrade:<br />
<br />
Slow is fine as is, mitigation and all.<br />
Cripple needs an upgrade<br />
Malo line is fine as is.<br />
<br />
3) Heals - in theory I like the changes they've made<br />
<br />
4) DPS - no idea....<br />
<br />
Just thinking outloud....</div></div><hr />
