<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>glydor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok so im a lvl 56 barb sham, and im still a newb lol. Anywho I know the extreme power and importance of torpor and know exactly what it does. However how do most shamans utilitze it? For instance, in the heat of battle, would lv 60_shaman_00 cast to regen and to save his life as a tank? Or how about casting and canning and possibly regaining the mana lost from torpor. Or torpor+canni 5 i would guess. Just some input on how its generally used would be great, I may have known all this time and not realized it hehehe ::confused: :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Don't torpor a tank during combat.  It takes torpor 30 seconds to heal 1200 pts. from the moment you start casting it until it finishes healing.  It takes Kragg's Mending at 58 10 seconds to heal 1950 points.<br />
<br />
During combat, Torpor snares and slows the tank... The best way to think of it, is not to even consider Torpor a heal.  Consider it a tool to heal over time during off-combat times when you're not being hit.  It isn't a combat heal.<br />
<br />
It's good for regaining Hit Points from cannibalization, or as a pre-emptive countermeasure when you think you're about to take some damage.  <br />
<br />
Especially, don't wait for someone to get low on health during combat while any decent DPS mobs beating on them and think Torpor will fix 'em right up - with Torpor they'll just die waiting on it to heal.  Kragg's Mending is MUCH better in that scenario.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If medding, torpor and chain canni, canni4/torpor means you will by the end of torpor gain about 700 hp, so canni down about 850, torpor, and chain canni till the end of it.  In battle, if YOU are the tank, heal yourself with it at about 1K from max health, or closer depending on mobs DPS.<br />
<br />
   Heal casters with it if you are in a camp situation and not dungeon crawling.  Especially heal casters who take aggro if they are the annoying type who like to run a mob all over the area instead of waiting on a tank to peel it.<br />
<br />
  Make a hotkey for torpor to heal your tanks with it between battles so they know they have it, and work out with the cleric so that he will quit casting CE on you and wasting his mana while you are torpor'ing.<br />
<br />
  I think that covers most all situations save a couple random rare ones where each shaman would do it differently.   WHen you do finally mem torpor, stay fighting the same mobs you normally solo for a while, get used to it.   Move up to pulling more at once for a while, then once used to that go after bigger game.   If you don't already do WW dragons using KM, then you should probably wait a while to start trying them with torpor.<br />
<br />
  For a conservative solo fighter, I would say a good progression with torpor practice is Goranga's in ME, double pulling, triple pulling.  Then Xi Vius and Xin Thal Centiens for practice against casters, then head to UP for some Moktor action.   After that I'd try out the WW dragons for a few or maybe some of the larger beasts in the new planes.   I think a fair test would be the lower level Guardians in PoJ, they hit semi fast and can hit rather hard, but are quite easy when you get used to it.<br />
<br />
<br />
  But the different tactics you need to learn eventually are against unslowable mobs, against multiple mobs, against casters, against dispellers/AE'ers and against quad-hitters (essentially same as unslowable, just more annoying).  If you get used to those scenarios then you will probably be able to adapt yourself to odd situations that arise.<br />
<br />
<br />
  And, once you hit 62 an dscribe Tnarg's you'll see less need of Torpor to heal anyone but yourself in even the most dire of situations.</div></div><hr />

/g SLOW INC on Ranger_00!<br />

/cast torpor</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">the high guardians of justice in PoJ are great torpor practice.  They hit for around 470 so you have to root/rot them, but you learn the most important use of torpor: mana regen.  The High guardians take around 10 min to kill so you learn to can while you are being torpored for maximum mana gain.  When you start getting good a t it you will find out that you can fight indefinitely because you regain mana so fast in battle.</div></div><hr />
