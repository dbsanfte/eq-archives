<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well I want to get a Hole Key. So some people would say go fight in warrens, but that takes way to damn long, like 90billion kobolds to raise faction.<br />
So I decided to solo guards in Erudin <br />
<br />
here's some info about me:<br />
lvl 42 ogre shaman - only regen is from spell, only haste is from spell<br />
<br />
ac ~650-660buffed<br />
hp ~1200 buffed<br />
wis ~160 w/ bearform<br />
<br />
The guards are paladins, who use LoH every time, and heal themselves alot. All the guards so far have conned Light blue.<br />
<br />
Tactic 1: Root &amp; Rot<br />
Did not work well at all. Halfway through he LoH himself, so I reapplied the dots and root and sat back down, at about 1/4 I had to nuke like crazy (Used ice dd), cause he had kept healing himself. The last nuke I had mana for did not kill him, but it broke root and he started in his death walk, so I melee'd him with my feeble melee skill.<br />
<br />
After that I cannied up, and gated to rest up (bound in Firepot room)<br />
<br />
Tactic 2: Pet tanks I use spells only<br />
Got back in, found a spot, summoned a pet, buffed him, blah blah whole 9 yards. Pulled a guard, used Togor's Insects. and dott'ed him. Fight was very shakey(course my pet was green, and I can get lightblue ones still). Had to heal my pet a bunch, and keep dot'ing guard, with some nukes and such. Barely won that one. Found a safe place to med/rest.<br />
<br />
 Tactic 3: I tank, pet kills<br />
<br />
I buffed everything I could think of (even cha! :) ) Made sure my pet had all the good stuff up (haste str ect). I used uhm rage or fury, can't remember its name, instead of dex though.<br />
Well, pulled with Togor's, used Scourge and VOS. and had to gate, cause he was just kicking my ass, and my pet wouldn't interupt his healing.<br />
<br />
 Tactic 4: ????<br />
Any ideas on how I can solo light blue pallies, who only cast LoH, and heals. always spawn with a 2hb weapon, but sometimes spawn with an extra weapon in hand to make them DW.<br />
<br />
The 3 things I tried were not very successful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well one thing i notice is that your AC seems kind of low, i have about 804 unbuffed, perhaps spend some time getting defence up? Or buying/questing/looting some ac/hp gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Falyin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">AC is certainly a plus (L19, mine is 538 unbuffed), but I don't think that will help too much in this situation (Max defense and offense, though)<br />
<br />
I know from killing Tabien the Goodly for our epic that paladins can be a pain, LH will be used every time...<br />
<br />
Honestly, killing kobolds is STILL your best bet =\ Either that, or just slide into the Hole without a key (you may be able to bearform your way in.) I have yet to use a key for the Hole =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Geal Icehammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Is there anything other than the Hole key you want from Paineel? As Falyin said you can use bear form  with duck to squeeze into the hole.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The only light-blue pallie I've fought was Tabien the Goodly, but I didn't have much trouble. I was level 44 at the time and just getting around to starting the epic. I went to RM, found him and started to set up. I summoned a pet and buffed him up with all melee buffs and haste. I was already buffed (melee buffs, hp buff, haste), so as soon as I was FM, I attacked him. His magic resistance seemed high, as I couldn't slow him, but his cold resistance wasn't a factor, so I just nuked him with Blizzard Blast while the pet ate away at him. He did LoH and try to heal himself, but he couldn't heal himself faster than I could damage him, so after a few nukes, he started his death march. The pet and I just followed and beat him down. My offense and defense were close to maxxed out and piercing was maxxed for my level. At 42, you don't have Blizzard Blast yet, but it does seem like your ac is a bit low. How's your defense? If it's not maxxed, or close, make that a priority. It will make things much easier. I don't know if the pallies you're fighting in Paineel are harder than Tabien, but if they're roughly the same, then well, you may be having trouble with them now, but at 44, they will be trivial for you. ;) Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">well i thought defense maxxed at 150, so when I saw it was at 140's i stopped &quot;trying&quot; to get it maxxed... then about 2 days ago, I realised it maxxed at 200.. so its still only 149.<br />
<br />
I need a key for the Hole because I need to get the door open for an entire group. And we want to make sure everyone can get in, without having to rely on wolfform or shrink potions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>leoice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It just takes a little practice and anyone can squeeze through the hole. I make it in as a barbarian everytime. Just swim up to the hole in the rock, then duck repeatidly while moving forward and slightly to the left.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">First, get some real armor.  If you have tons of cash, then save your +wis stuff for when (if) you take up alchemy, but whatever you do, get real AC gear.  Then go over to DL and solo in OT for a few nights until your def and weapon skills are maxed.  That's pretty much it.  The pallys should be cake after that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I spent my only 400pp on JB arms tonight.<br />
<br />
My friends are ogres, and they will not squeeze through the crack.<br />
<br />
I can make shrink potions, but we want different options<br />
<br />
I will never willingly set foot in the ****pot known as dreadland, or the sewer line that leads to it, aka OT.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sides my defense is going up pretty fast soloing in Sol B.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jenoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">(1) Start a little necro mule and buy the key<br />
<br />
(2) Have him open the door for your friends then log back to your shaman.<br />
<br />
(3) Use bearform to wiggle through the cracks in the rocks<br />
<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">to answer your specific question:<br />
Any ideas on how I can solo light blue pallies, who only cast LoH, and heals. always spawn with a 2hb weapon, but sometimes spawn with an extra weapon in hand to make them DW.  <br />
<br />
I have no freakin clue.  LoH cant be interrupted, so you are going to have to try and kill them with a DD before they cast it...good luck with your 263pt Winter's Roar.  Once you hit 44 you will get a 412pt Blizzard Blast so it might be a bit easier.<br />
<br />
BUT...more general advice about your predicament.<br />
<br />
<br />
1 - Don't solo paladins. :)<br />
<br />
2 - You said you have Oger friends...  Bring a friend (he can ride the spires from Nexus) and the two of you should be able to beat the snot out of these guys.  2 Ogers = Dead anything.  (ok, wild exaggeration)<br />
<br />
3 - I like your style...stay out of DL / OT.  You will be assimilated if you go there.<br />
<br />
4 - Don't make this a priority.  What lvl are you planning on entering the Hole?  I understand its a 50+ zone, so you have 8 lvls (and some great new spells) before it's critical to get the key.<br />
<br />
<br />
PS - If you are planning on going into the Hole at lvl 42 then send me a tell if you are on the Luclin server....you got big balls and I wanna go.<br />
<br />
<br />
PPS - I haven't done any faction work (that I know of) and I con threatening to the Erudin guards, but they won't attack me, even the red ones in Toxx Forest.  So I've decided that it's nice to be able to gate in (via firepots) and not worry about getting jumped immediatly... Although this will probably get me killed at some point.  I would recommend you consider it if you haven't already lowered your faction too much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It is VERY easy to wiggle into the hole in bearform. I barely slow down to get in now..just takes some practice.<br />
<br />
However, I am interested in strategies for all levels in Erudin, since I would like to be able to bank/shop in Paineel.  I was considering finding a comfortable pull spot somewhere inside the city where there are still blue-to-me at 54 mobs.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">1) Pallies suck.  NPC pallies hit for too much too often and annoy the heck out of me.  Avoid them like a Rosanne Barr diet method.<br />
<br />
2) Max D' and Offense is KEY to everything.  <br />
<br />
3) 660 AC is NOT going to cut it for you unless you play in the 4th gen Kunark idiot chain (LOIO, OT, FM, DL, KC, Velk).  You NEED to get that up.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you are going to solo these guys your best bet is Slow, melee, place your pet behind him, dot, let him LOH and keep pounding him out of bear form (you dont' want to lose your slam ability) until he falls down.  <br />
<br />
You wont' stop LOH so don't even bother.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't solo vs. healers.  They just suck.  <br />
<br />
<br />
As for the key, it's just not worth it IMO.  But that's me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">look at it this way, perfect your technique here and you will have no trouble when in comes time to solo'ing king in guk :p.<br />
<br />
BTW you never mentioned if you were using slam or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Anomalos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Then go over to DL and solo in OT for a few nights until your def and weapon skills are maxed. That's pretty much it. The pallys should be cake after that.<br />
<br />
Took me from lvl 46 to almost 49 to get my defense from 165-200, and piercing from 80-160, doin probly 60% melee - 40% JBB, with my druid healing and DS'n me.  A few nights anywhere won't max out your defense/weapons skills =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">A few nights anywhere won't max out your defense/weapons skills =) <br />
<br />
There are other alternatives to maxing skills that people use. Like fighting pets (at your level a 59 necro or mage epic pet).. think that still works,<br />
<br />
Also there are mobs in the game that are very high level but hit like wimps. We used to work skills ont he gnome outside of FP who was red to 60 and hit for like 25 or something like that. If you are fighting blues all day long your right they won't go up very fast. But if you are on yellows and reds they fly (relatively speaking). <br />
<br />
I am sure there are some others now that people do but not something I have looked at recently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Takk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I think your tactics are fine but againt guards that can LoH themselves, it is basically a lose situation. Ya have to basically kill two mobs for the experience of one.... The only other thing I would try might be pet kiting...<br />
Tactic:<br />
  1) slow him (also draws agro and protects pet)<br />
  2) dot him with your best disease and poision spell (retains agro)<br />
  3) flash of light him. and step back<br />
  At this point  if you have more agro than your pet it will ignore him and &quot;run away&quot; (wish I had snare but if you have enough room you  don't need it)<br />
  4) pet nips him as you canni dance, prepare for reapplying another poision or disease spell<br />
  5) when the flash of light fades, one angry mob goes for you... you refresh or stack another DOT and go back to step 3.<br />
 6) when you get low on mana then you duke it out...  Hopefully, a mob can cast LoH if it is running away but don't depend on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">If you are going to work Def/Weapons Skills just make sure you max out your stats the best you can.  To be honest. the best way I found was in group with a bard, with haste, hitting between cann casts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Just as a add.   I'm amiable now based on Warrens faction work.   There are a number of simple fast quests that can be completed over and over again to speed the process up.   A couple of sites offer quest information concerning this ... and the drops while very poor to a 30 or up person ... are nice rewards to newbies in the area.   I've made quite a few people pretty happy with stuff that dropped off King or such.   <br />
<br />
And if no one is in the zone ... just load up good ole pet and sit in front of every thing you see.   Your pet can kill things faster than you can and will protect you.   Only extra spell I loaded was summon pet due to the poor pathing in the Warrens.    <br />
<br />
All in all ... a few hours in a completely empty Warrens will increase your faction amazingly.  Everything spawns very fast as well.    Plus it is fun to laid waste to a area due to your Badness.   /Wink</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Hey Targar, where exactly is that Gnome outside FP for skill raising?  Which Freeport zone?<br />
<br />
Are you talking about the NPC who sells hairpieces at the tent camp in the newbie zone outside West Freeport?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Ya thats the one but he got buffed awhile back. (hits much harder now)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Reylin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">For the faction thing in Warrens, grab a cleric and maybe a few other AE type casters. (Can even grab a few lowbies and help them get some xp)  With a good AE type group you can pull most of the zone and get the faction for almost all of the kills.  I have done this with my DE Cleric in BlackBurrow to get him faction for Qeynos.  Clerics have a couple of PBAEs one that does about 380dmg to unlimited mobs in 25ft or so radius and is really low mana (At 57 it is at least)  So if you run with the mobs you will not hit the 3 at a time rule and s/he will be able to nock a ton out quick.  Couple hours clearing the zone like this and you will have your faction in a good place.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sure it will, just dont slow the mobs, don't JBB, and don't group/chat/dick around/whatever.  Stay focused, it doesn't take all that long.  I did approx 150 to a few points shy of max at 43 in DL in 3 long nights.  <br />
<br />
Also, with your druid healing and DSing you AND a JBB, 46 to almost 49 shouldn't take you more than 3 nights, so I'm not sure what your example means.  =)</div></div><hr />

DL isn't critical.  Max your defense however/wherever you like, as long as it happens.  You'll be amazed at what you can do with decent ac, especially if you've been playing without it for that long.  I know I was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>TweadleDimm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I did those dock pallys in erudin last night at 52,they are a pain in the butt.<br />
<br />
I went from dubious to scowling in 5 kills hehe,im an ogre btw.<br />
<br />
<br />
I was oom after the 3rd add,was pretty sketchy for a minute.without the JBB i would have had to run out over the watter canni down to 1 bubb and gate.<br />
<br />
Decided they suck,and I'll get my faction in the warrens hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>uglytobone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Just kill Sentinel Creot 5-8 times in Tox to get Paineel faction. He's about a 10 min spawn and I was taking him fairly easily at level 34 by pet kiting along the river. Creot roams the Erudin side bank of the river, but usually is standing in front of a vendor hut at the Erudin wall end of the river.<br />
<br />
Here's how you do it. <br />
Summon dog. TAUNT OFF! <br />
Med up.<br />
Quick dog.<br />
Root/ dot Creot.<br />
Med until root breaks then run down river with dog biting his rear.<br />
When dog gets agro nuke and kite somemore.<br />
<br />
This will ruin your Erudin faction.<br />
<br />
There was another red con in front of the river hut by a little pier. Check and make sure you are not KOS to him before trying this. Occasionally a roaming green erudite npc will be near so either wait until it leaves or kill it first.<br />
<br />
PS. If you are Cazil Thul, go ahead and do the CT Initiate and Disciple quest after getting Paineel faction. Items give fear animal and fear undead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I've been in your position for killing the guards.<br />
Here's what you do.<br />
Go to the place you teleport up as you walk into Erudin from Tox forest.<br />
Summon a pet and park it there and buff up.<br />
Head into Erudin a bit and watch for the wandering guards to come nearby.<br />
When you see one, pull it back to your pet and slow him.<br />
As a paladin, he's going to be healing himself a lot, and use lay hands.  Expect this.  You don't have the spells available to kill them fast enough before they heal themselves.  (I don't think)<br />
The guards are only level 30 or so, so you shouldn't have that much trouble tanking them.<br />
The biggest problem is if you get 2 guards on you at once.  That's a lot of healing power, and much more damage output.  If you do, take the teleport down to Tox entrance, and camp out.  The guards can't path down to you through the teleport.</div></div><hr />
