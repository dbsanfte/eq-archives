<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>MMshammy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a lvl 30 BST on Stromm (I started it, and play it when my normal server is down) which I am thinking of transferring to a PvP server.  Having never played PvP, but always intrigued by it, I would like some advice.<br />
<br />
Which servers would you recommend moving to and why?<br />
<br />
Is BST an effective character as PvP?<br />
<br />
What are the 5 things i should have as a priority when starting out on a PvP server?<br />
<br />
What are the 5 things i should never forget when on a PvP server?<br />
<br />
What are the general Rules/restrictions on the PvP servers?<br />
<br />
A lot to ask for my 3rd post i know, but thanks in advance for your help :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>xorekill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Short and sweet from a TZ shaman.<br />
<br />
If, and I do mean if, you are serious about going to a PvP server, I would recommend you start a character on whichever server you choose, your options are as follows ...<br />
<br />
Rallos Zek - From lvl 6 forward, anyone in a 4 level range to you ( 4 above, 4 below ) can kill you.  If you die, they take all your coin and one item.  Only exception is if the item is in a container.<br />
<br />
Tallon, Vallon Zek - Pvp Teams...similar to Rallos, except the lvl range is increased to 8 ( 8 above, 8 below ), and only coins can be looted.  You may only pvp against someone not on your &quot;team&quot;<br />
<br />
Shorts - Halfings, Dwarves, Gnomes<br />
Human - Humans, Erudites, Vah Shir, Barb, Frogs<br />
Dark - Iksar, Troll, D. Elf, Ogre<br />
Elf - High elves, Half Elves, Wood elves<br />
<br />
However people on opposing teams CAN heal / buff one another, leading to instances where you must face out of range healers the same level as the person you are fighting, who you can NEVER do anything to.  Most high end content is locked down by guilds composing of all four team members.  On TZ, you WILL NOT be able to enter Time and not be immediately killed unless you are a member of the top guild Pandemonium.  That guild does not accept ANY new members who do not meet strict guidelines ( including already being Time flagged ) and they prevent the progression of other guilds as well.  And the rest of the guilds, by and large, do the same with everything below them.<br />
<br />
Sullon Zek - Deity based teams, No pvp range...a lvl 65 can walk up to a lvl 6 and gut them, and there is nothing you can do about it.<br />
<br />
If you MUST play on a pvp server, I would recommend not transferring, but starting fresh.  In that way, you are not paying 75$ to find out you do not like pvp.  It takes less than an hour to hit lvl 10 and begin participating.<br />
<br />
Generally speaking, most pvp is won before it is began.  How?  By gear.  Very very few people are new when they start on a red server, and most are severely twinked.<br />
<br />
BST are effective in pvp, but only so long as their pet remains unrooted / mezzed / stunned / feared.  Without your pet, you're a sub-par monk and shaman.  Possibly the best classes for pvp are SK's, Necro's, or Bards.  Shaman like myself, have a hard time killing due to the fact our nukes are no where near overpowering, and our dots can be easily cured away.<br />
<br />
www.everquestlive.com has more detailed information about the red servers...but before you transfer, make an alt on the one you want and see for yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i would add that i believe no drop gear cannot be looted on Rallos and because people are using anything from LDoN to augment all of their gear it has made item loot about non existent after people can get into LDoN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>MMshammy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Cool, some excellent advice, TY guys.<br />
<br />
Your right Xore, $75 is an expensive lesson, (i thought it was $25, but you are indeed correct) and from what i can find out BST are ok with PvP, but it will get harder as I lvl, so I will take your advice and try a few different alts and play them thru to lvl 10 ish.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Can only speak about Vallon Zek really.<br />
<br />
On VZ, at the top end it is not really a &quot;teams&quot; server any more, as almost allt he top guilds are 4-team. It is more of a guild v guild server. There is one guild (defiant) that is top dog, and a handful of 2nd tier guilds (Aduentus, Ancient Dawn, Zephyros, Aerist). Then there are a whole lot of 3rd tier guilds...too many to name.<br />
<br />
The 1st and 2nd tier guilds do a lot of mass PvP over control of zones.<br />
<br />
At lower level, PvP tends to be more 1 on 1 or 2 on 1 or small grp pvp. Unfortunatley, at the lower levels, PvP is dominated by alt characters who are twinked up the wazoo. No matter what you do or how good you are, go up against somebody who has spent 10000000 plat on gearing up a low level twink and you are going to get owned! I have seen level 38 players with a &quot;baron&quot; tag and an epic - they have de-levelled just to &quot;own&quot; in PvP<br />
<br />
The above may sound depressing, and certainly don't expect to come to a PvP server and not get very dead very fast a lot of times, but sometimes, just surviving PvP can be a lot of fun! <br />
<br />
Also, there are zones that are kinda known for PvP and zones that it is very rare, so once you get to know where the action tends to be, you can basically pick how much PvP you want to do.<br />
<br />
I am in a third tier guild at the moment, and do not PvP all that often. I get killed more than I kill, but I savour my victories, or even my narrow escapes. I don't get upset when I get beaten, and I wouldn't leave PvP servers now.<br />
<br />
A couple of things to bear in mind.<br />
Resists are super important on a PvP server. Many people carry around &quot;resist gear&quot; to swap in for PvP (which I think is a waste of time unless you are actively the aggressor, in most PvP, if you get attacked, you will not have time to do much gear swapping or you will be dead).<br />
<br />
Instacast clickies are very important for PvP. You always put your &quot;important&quot; buffs at the back of your buff line-up, and if you are getting stripped of buffs (annul magic, etc) you need to be able to instacast &quot;junk&quot; buffs on the run.<br />
<br />
In one on one PvP, Necros are hard to beat, as are bards. Shaman suck at killing anything, but are fairly hard to kill.<br />
<br />
In group/mass PvP Shaman are much more poweful - Malo / Malos can be a real deciding factor. In mass PvP it is usually the Clerics, Chanters and Shaman who get targetted first (ouch)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You will, unfortunately, learn very little about a class up to level 10. You will, in particular, learn diddly squat about PvP to that level. In my opinion, no class starts to be defined until its mid 20s.<br />
<br />
On Vallon Zek, PvP starts to get &quot;balanced&quot; around mid 30s - befoer that, the level difference  (+/-8 levels to PvP) is just too much. But it doesn't take long to get to mid 30's these days.<br />
<br />
It is difficult to give specific PvP tips because strategies depend on your class, your opponent's class, levels, gear, etc. A few general tips are:<br />
<br />
Potions are your friend. Crimson potion (vendor) and Stinging wort (shaman alchemy) break mez. Damage shield potions are great against certain classes. If you aren't a snaring class, clicky snares are great for PvP and aren;t hard to farm.<br />
<br />
<br />
Get used to checking who is in zone often - you will get to recognise names of players or guilds, and can prepare (for a shaman, PvP can be a very different spellset from PvE)<br />
<br />
Don't get upset by PvP ever - there are griefers, immature idiots and FeFs who will try to get under your skin, will use lameass tactics, will train you, will do every stupid thing in the book, and then shout or /ooc afterwards. Its just a game, and don't let them have the satisfaction of seeing that they have got to you. Don't lower yourself to their level - if you get a rep as a dishonorable PvPer, life can get pretty limited. Enjoy the PvP but do it right and do it honorable (otherwise go to Sullon Zek haha)<br />
<br />
Choose your guilds carefully. Guild reputation is important. You can get a bad rep just by association with a dishonorable guild that can stay with you even after you leave that guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>MMshammy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Wooohooo another aussie in the house... Queenslander here  :D .  My home port was Hobart when i was crewing on the supply vessels... many years ago :/... originally from Cairns.  Pretty much Norrath full time now tho LOL.<br />
<br />
I should mention that I have been playing EQ for a few years, and have several characters, 4 of which are 55+.  Given that I will be starting out without knowing anyone (and i understand this may be putting a bullseye on my back :( ) I may try to swap some plat from my server to VZ.<br />
<br />
I was going to go with a class that i know, but maybe go for a different race.  I have played a SK, RGR, SHA and Mage all to 55/56, I also have 30 BST, 45 MNK and a 36 WIZ.<br />
<br />
Which class would you recommend of these?  Would you suggest avoiding any particular teams?<br />
<br />
Are there any zones which are deemed &quot;safe&quot;, for example PoK? Baz?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">G'day Cobber!<br />
<br />
Actually, I am Scottish, but I have been living/working in Tasmania for nearly 10 years and love it here...but I digress...<br />
<br />
If you can easily bring a load of plat with ya, it will make life easier a helluva lot easier.<br />
<br />
I guess Sullon Zek is the real hardcore PvP server. Vallon Zek is PvP but not so full on - its kinda like &quot;how much PvP do you want?&quot;<br />
<br />
I cannot really advise which class. I love my shaman, and the only other class I play much is ranger. What class you enjoy playing on the blue server, play that! Of the classes you have named, SK is probably best pure PvP class, but just whatever floats your canoe.  <br />
<br />
If you decide to come to Vallon, send me a /tell and I try to will hook you up with some people or a guild that is comparable with your level. A good guild is half the battle on Vallon Zek. <br />
<br />
On VZ there are several zones where you cannot PvP: Bazaar (although the arena is free for all, of course), Nexus, Plane of Knowledge and Plane of Tranquility are the ones that spring immediately to mind. Team really doesn't matter, except some people still mistrust Dark team (throwback from early days of server where Dark team was much more powerful than the other 3 teams), but really it doesn't matter any more</div></div><hr />

Wey, thanks for your offer to hook me up, i appreciate it, and may just take you up on it.  I think I am gonna go with a human SK, I want to get some levels up first, but will drop you a /tell sometime.<br />
<br />
Thanks again all. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Sk's are the most overpowered pvp class in the game, if you want a class that requires zero skill and can get coins with a simple hotkey push then sk is the way to go.<br />
<br />
Wizards are powerful, they get a ton of kills but require at least a bit of skill due to lack of hp.<br />
<br />
beyond that its hard to give good advice, pure melees are bottom of the barrel on any pvp server. with no spells and no channeling ability they are easy kills for most casters. <br />
<br />
hybrids tend to due well in general.<br />
<br />
shaman are tough to kill but also dont score as many kills as other classes. once somone zones our dots become generic. so if you dot someone and they cross a zl and die you dont get credit...I cant tell you how many casters I have killed at their bind point. :(<br />
<br />
carry pumice, carry Crimson potions, if you can afford them shaman potions come in a ton of useful pvp flavors, Stinging wort, Damage sheilds, Sow, Levitate, Shrink, Heal over times that are very effective (and expensive) <br />
carry bandaids until you are high enough to Always have a better faster heal. (if you are a healing class) <br />
weapons with pvp proccs are nice, stuns/snares/darkness/nukes/blind are all good examples of a nice pvp procc.<br />
resist gear. possibly the single most important pvp related gear issue. a full set of blue diamond/diamond resist gear is usually the best bet for those to low to score raid lvl gear.<br />
<br />
thats the best blanket info I can give.<br />
<br />
as for servers, rallos at the highest lvls is pure blue. no pvp to be found in sight.<br />
tz/vz are poorly coded, imortal healers are just one issue you face on a server with xteam grouping/casting allowed.<br />
sullon, my personal favorite of the 3 servers I have tried, not for the faint of heart or the easily frustrated. once you hit lvl 6 you are fair game in any zone other than pok/pot/nexus/baz. you can only group/heal/buff people on your team. 3 teams are yours and the other one. (ok evil has all the sk's and necros but no ranger/druid/paly's, Neuts have all 3 shorties and all the classes other than sk/necro, Goods have cats/frogs and same classes as neuts)<br />
currently neuts are in a close second to goods with evils WAY the hell out in front as far as endgame content is concerned.<br />
lower lvls you can pvp as much as you want, there is always a fight and as much as it sucks getting ganked by a lvl 65 when you are 14 it truly is nice when you score a kill on somone 30 lvls higher than you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Unless you happen to be one of your servers best geared and skilled shamans, you can only hope to ever kill someone who is either not equiped for pvp, is retarded or has rotten luck. But then again, so can anyone.<br />
<br />
Mass pvp is another thing, but even the smallest gaps in gear/skills/dedication between the guilds tend to leave very large gaps in the result table.<br />
<br />
As a result of this in combination with people taking a game to seriously has caused very bad atmosphere between guilds on my server. Im still amazed everyday with the fantasitc officers who labour their asses of everyday to keep the fragile system from breaking down into a griefing frenzy.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>NinthSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I recently played my friend's account(65 necro) on Vallon Zek and Used to play a 65 shaman(good team) and 65 druid(neut team) on Sullon Zek.  VZ has some &quot;rules&quot; that i wasn't aware of that you might want to be aware of.  No training, no corpse camping, and No entering a zone for 2 hours after you've left it?  I might be wrong but i zoned after attacking a ranger and getting a rogue add...and having no idea how to play the necro other than dot dot lifetap, lifeburn (hehe i've been lifeburned so many times i wanted to see what it was like to lifeburn someone) i zoned.  Then my friend tells, me that i can't re enter the zone for 2 hours.  My advice is, you can go sullon zek... but don't be sk #200001320343082022 or necro #01074308104380   join good team or newt team and make a difference!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Koridar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">it's 1 Hour actually. or if the people you ran from/died to vacate the zone or allow you to come back in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>EeyonRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">i hang out on sullon every once in a while just for a change of pace, but i could never stand making the switch. pvp servers are pretty well loaded up with with the scum among scum of the world. no offense to any of you guys, but i'm sure you know what i mean.<br />
<br />
the thing you have to realise about eq pvp is that there really hasn't been much of any attention paid to it in a long long time because not many people play it. when i first started playing eq, it was actually a big decision to make on whether or not you were going to be pvp, but over time interest really dropped off and pvpers are now just a tiny portion of the paying base of eq. you play on a blue server now. you know the small ammount of attention paid to the players by the staff there. now assign a number to it, multiply that number by 0, and you have your modified pvp care factor.<br />
<br />
most changes that are made in the game revolve around high level characters on non pvp servers and the high end encounters they face. no one cares if a shadowknight or a wizard on sullon can accidentally kill people due to a cat jumping on a keyboard somewhere while an enchanter has approximately 0 chance of using any spells on anyone. <br />
<br />
not to try and deter you or anything, but eq pvp is ridiculously out of whack, and that won't likely change any time soon. the first time i played on sullon i started in greater faydark, and somewhere between 60 and 70 percent of the hundred or two elves packed in around the hometown were bards. that's just kinda how it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Koridar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">the Imbalances you speak of in PVP are Imbalances of classes mostly. all i ever get to do these days is malos someone and then run around and click my black fur boots while people try to snare/dispell me. at some point a rogue with a tendonslicer will get close to me and that's all she wrote. or if they finally figure out i can't be snared even with Malos i will be nuked and /or manaburned.  If i get just 150 more MR, 155 CR, and 145 FR i'll be able to resist lures. there are people on the server who can do it. it's quite sad that there isn't a single spell past malos and malicious decay that will land with any consistency. SKs get a negative 500 resist check Lifetap.  Yay?  BTW beasltords do well in mass PVP IF they can get a pet up. otherwise if you zone into some people who want you dead you will be dead in no time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>EeyonRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">radiant cure probably didnt make playing a shaman on a pvp server much more fun either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>soldieint</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">If i where you, I would make a bard. They are the new overpowed Pvp class. SK arent that Uber again, yea they have a 99% chance of a kill every one hour. But then again, where is the fun, getting a kill, with a one click on the DT buttom. <br />
The fun pvp fights 1 vs 1, is normaly the ones, where you have been fighting for more then 5 mins, before one of you die.(gotta get the adraline pumping)<br />
<br />
Since you are new to the Zek servers. A bard, would be a good start you will allways  have the chance, to run away, if things start to burn. <br />
     And beeing a bard there arent any class you cant kill 1 vs 1. <br />
For mass pvp a bard, can have a very importen role on the outcome of the battle.<br />

<br />
No offense taken, but I'd like to correct you.<br />
<br />
As applied to VZ no I don't agree. In fact I'd wager there are just as many, or if not even more, 'scum' on many other servers. In an environment where rep means something and you have the tools to actively and directly influence others you do not last long as 'scum'.<br />
<br />
On a server where the players set up pvp-etiquette and rules (laugh away SZ'ers ;) ), where guildleaders/officers do their best to police their members and adhere to these rules I fail to see how we can be saturated with scum.<br />
<br />
The reason I am getting defensive is that I really dislike when people paint up this stereotype image of the pvp servers and almost turn it into propaganda.<br />
<br />
To some extent I can see your point as applied to SZ, but that server is a special case that REQUIRES you to be a 'scum' to survive.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I used to play on TZ back in the good old days when there was no Pandemonium or 4 teamers. I loved that server so much and it broke my heart when Crapmonium came to be and the server just went to s**t then. I loved the 300+ people battles in Neriak forest. I thought that good vs evil was the best idea for the entire server. I kind of wish they would have hard coded it that way. I think the 4 team method just doesn't work that well. But what always surprised me the most that the player made rules (loot and scoot, no corpse camping) were actually follwed by people, which just shows you that people can police themselves. Shame that the server went to hell, I really loved it.<br />
<br />
I went over to RZ because if I was gonna be fighting 4 teamers I might as well be able to kill everybody. I totally suck at pvp and I really hate how the shaman class has degenerated into how sad it is in PvP. RZ has lots of pvp at 65. We get the usual guild wars (DoZ vs. everybody lol) and The Curse kill everyone. They are pretty formidable in pvp because they always bring a group or two and wipe out anyone in their path. Most everyone then waits around for AD, MiM, or Wudan to come in and beat them to the ground so they can get their corpses. LDoN pretty much made looting items a non factor. It is very nice that they did though. Now my alts can actually wear some gear instead of being naked all the time. <br />
<br />
RZ you will find lots of pvp at all levels. It is mostly done in only a few zones. Paludal Caverns is a big pvp zone from 8 - 25 because that is where everyone levels. So if you pick your zones well you can level in peace until you are ready for some action and hit those zones. If you go to RZ i would recommend getting in a pk guild if that is what you want to do. It can be a waste of time to go 'anti' since you are gonna get attacked anyway by a pk guild or some ganker. I am too much of a softie to go gank so I guess I am screwed. LoL.<br />

Oh btw. Don't go bard for pvp. SoE totally broke the bard class (64 bard as well) and they can do about as much in pvp now that a shaman can. I think it is the classes I play they nerf the most. Maybe I should level up a SK, wiz, and necro and maybe they will get burnt to the grouond in PvP like the shaman/bard has. Hrmmmm.</div></div><hr />

and yes,  pick a bard. once you have selo's you can outrun most PVP and heal if you are in trouble.<br />
and no, not all SHM are swedes</div></div><hr />
