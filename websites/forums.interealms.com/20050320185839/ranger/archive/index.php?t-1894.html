<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VaderJM4</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 11:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I considered that, but I'm using the Microsoft(nod to Kullaas) Intellieye mouse, which makes it all the more peculiar. Sorry for not specifying earlier.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VaderJM4</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 11:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Connection? You mean the part that plugs into the computer?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kullaas</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 11:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes.  It's probaly a USB connection and they can act funky when dirty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VaderJM4</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 11:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks, it is USB and I'll check it out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My keyboard at work has done the same kind of thing - the only solution would be to get a new one, but they don't have any in stock that I like, so I just reboot 3-4 times a day when it starts acting funny.</div></div><hr />

I prefer logitech optical ones myself... great for first person shooters as you can pick them up and they won't move your aim around where as roller ones will jiggle the aim if you got to pick up the mouse.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Llegolas</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 01:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My mouse used to stop moving and then I'd have to reboot the computer.<br />
<br />
Problem was my cord had been pulled on one too many times and it began to come loose, which caused the red laser light to flash for just a second, although it was enough to cause me to have to reboot every time it happened. <br />
<br />
Solution:  I took the mouse apart and played with the wires until it looked like I had a stable connection, then taped the wires in place and put the mouse back together.<br />
<br />
Caution:  Intelli-Mice are HARD to take apart.  I pried at the thing with a couple of screwdrivers for about an hour and a half before I managed to take the top off.  Now my mouse has a few scratches and dents, but hey, it works.  Better than having to buy a new one.</div></div><hr />
