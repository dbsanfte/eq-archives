<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Predicus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, as we have reiterated our problems in countless posts in the past 3-4 months and many previously; we know we have problems.  Continually complaining to ourselves again and again in this forum really isn't going to solve anything, and this is the reason why:<br />
<br />
1.  Class envy of other classes to ourselves is high.  They see us as the greener side, even though most of us feel that is not the case.<br />
<br />
2.  Verant/SOE only tends to fix things when it becomes blatantly obvious that something is wrong.<br />
<br />
Some examples:<br />
<br />
1. Warrior Taunt- how many warriors do you thing were on endless lfg before something was done?  This problem didn't start 6 months ago, and it was &quot;sort of&quot; fixed.<br />
<br />
2. Monk nerf- these guys have been lfg since the game started.  Their gear line sucked for a long time, and was finally fixed with Velious/PoP?<br />
They are &quot;THE PULLER&quot; class, and for a long time could not perform that function to the efficiency level that other classes could at the time.<br />
<br />
3. Druids- like it or not, but before their spells were augmented there really wasn't a whole lot of necessary abilities that these guys were bringing to groups.<br />
<br />
4. Shadowknights- anyone remember how horribly bugged these guys were back in the day?  They just &quot;sort of&quot; un-nerfed the Decrepit Hide drop rate.  A Shadowknight in my guild killed 500+ mobs in PoHate (after revamp) to get this damn thing to drop.  Think how bad it was for these guys when Hate was still a raid only zone.<br />
<br />
The list goes on.  I am pretty sure each class has had their dark times, but here is the catch.  When changes were implemented it was very obvious to OTHER CLASSES that they were having problems.  Most classes, even our priest counterparts are completely oblivious to the problems that we are running into.  This is due mostly to perceived notions of how our spells work as opposed to the actual technicalities.  We see a drawback to active mana regeneration while other classes see that our class is the first to completely recover from a rez.  We see our heals as being weak and inefficient, while other class see it as the way we were able to solo mobs like Lodizal and Guardian Wurms.  Before SOE will even think about making changes the other classes would have to agree that we are hurting.  Why is this the case?  Instead of receiving 200 feedbacks a day saying &quot;un-nerf the shamans&quot; they would be receiving 10 times that amount in &quot;nerf the shaman, they are too powerful.&quot;  Verant/SOE has always made classes/races pay for special abilities whether through xp penalty, additional kos zones, unwearable equipment, and many other examples.  WE ARE A MULTI-TALENTED SOLOING CLASS, and we are paying an ADDITIONAL PENALTY for SLOW, CANNIBALIZE, AND the ABILITY TO HEAL.  <br />
<br />
In conclusion, darker times are ahead because the fixes are not coming.  Its going to take more complaining from EVERYONE, not just shamans.  THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CLASS ENVY AND CLASS BALANCING.  My suggestion is just to cool it for a bit, make a rant section like we have a general/spell/quest section, and politely inform other classes of your dilema.  When a melee wants to know why you can't cast FA on him...EXPLAIN!  Eventually the problem will get across to even the most dense of people- the only drawback is to expect more soloing time while we wait a few months or so for changes.<br />
<br />
I feel that whining and complaining is warranted on this chat board, because many others feel the same plight- other classes don't want to hear it.  I feel though that it is best to clean up the boards a bit and move threads like this to a rant section.<br />
<br />
P.S. as a reply to the thread with the rez/corpse summon- no way in hell, necros have had it rough for a while.  The last thing I would want is a fight breaking out with them.<br />
<br />
My two cents<br />
/rant off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">WOW (not the game), somebody else actually shares my point of view :D<br />
<br />
Give us a RANT forum, so I don't have to read thru 30 rants in the general section before I hit something...err...general :D<br />
<br />
I survived being a Ranger w/o AM3 for a couple years, at least my Shaman can slowly kill until the Devs get their heads out of their...err...hats.  I love the class, but SOE is stalling on the fix, probably have an office pool going on how many Shamans quit or reroll.  GoD will just have to remain uncharted territory for most of us until something gets fixed I guess.  No big deal tho, I can always go kill &quot;ubah&quot; mobs all day long /sighs at the silly Clerics<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>hillaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">A rant board is a good idea they have one at the steel warrior called the outhouse. The funny thing is though, thats almost always the first place I look when I visit there. Thats where most of the intertaining therads are.</div></div><hr />
