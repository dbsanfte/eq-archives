<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After dying the other day I lost my Heyokah title.  It wasn't even a choice anymore in the titles list.  So I got back to my body looted all but an item got my rez, went back to the titles screen and lo and behold I had the choice again.  Later that day exploring OoW a bit I died again.  I lost the title choice from the list and from my name again.  This time I checked after each item was looted.  I finally was given the choice again AFTER I looted my TA.  Doesn't it seem odd that until you have a certain item in your inventory that you wouldn't be granted a certain title?  Anyone else notice this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">thats lovely, not only is the TA a game changing item for shamans.. it is now also what gives us the coolest title ever, LOVELY</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wazbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It is because it will not register that you have your epic if you are dead, because its not on you.  Which kind of sucks that you will have to do it each time you die.  Hopefully SOE can fix this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think he said the wrong thing, cause Heyokah is our epic title, not the title for Time's Antithesis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">No I said the right thing, I think it Odd that when I looted my epic and equipped it my Title was not there.  After I looted and Equipped my TA It was.  This is not a maybe type thing I made sure.  I am 100% positive that it did not appear until after I looted and put on the TA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wazbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Strange, your epic should have been the trigger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">That is why this is odd lol.  I am going to duel tonight.  Before I do this I will put TA in the bank.  We will see what happens as I wish to get a proper bug report to send in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Was your epic in one of your bags? I don't get the title unless it's in one of my bags.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah I tried with epic in bag and then equipped.  Maybe there is a delay from when you loot/equip until the title appears.  When I equipped the TA it was at the end of that &quot;timer&quot; and just made me think it was because of it.  I will try putting Epic in the bank and see if I lose the title choice.  Also Ancient is that AA or Level?  Whats the best title for Alchemy?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Journeyman Alchemist is the best you can do, if you have a skill of 200.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ahh ok 3 more skill points then lol as I only have Apprentice Alchemist atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gabus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Paladins are finding the same at PoN. There is a title associated with your epic. For them it is &quot;Lightbringer.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If I have to go to Time to be a Heyokah, I am going to be rightly pissed...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I can assure you that you do not. I am Heyokah Bethiana Gunnadie, and I'm still Coirnav and Rathe from Time :p</div></div><hr />
