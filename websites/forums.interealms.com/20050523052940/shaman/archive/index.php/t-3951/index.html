<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Asegai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Seems like Shaman are very popular.  Are they among the most played classes?  How do they rank?  How do they compare to Paladans in terms of most played and most fun.  I'm looking for a hybrid caster, tank mage type, but I would prefer to play a human. (The barbarian doesn't really float my boat)  I have a Vah Shir now and they seem to be fun, but I wonder about long term success.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Irksome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My experience is that shaman is near the bottom in terms of regularly played character types.  That doesn't make us undesirable, tho.  I had a hell of a time finding groups as I leveled up, but once you hit raiding level you will always find raids to attend.  Many high level raids simply cannot be done efficiently without at least one shaman.<br />
<br />
I think you have a flaw in your thinking when you compare 'most played' and 'most fun'.  Every class is the 'most fun' to someone.  Play style will really dictate what is 'most fun' to you.  'Most played' also doesn't necessarily relate to 'fun', since some classes you just need a lot of.  For instance, many many people 2-box a gimp cleric.  Is cleric fun for these people?  Probably not.  Is the cleric required?  Hell yeah.  Similarly, how many people have a port-bot, wizard or druid?  Tons.  Do all these people (and the high play time) mean they enjoy those chars the most?  Not necessarily, they may have levelled up those characters simply for transport needs.<br />
<br />
Shaman is fun if you enjoy being a shaman.  Personally, I love it.  =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I see a LOT or shaman below 30s.  There's a noticable dip in the 30s and 40s, then there are a decent number of shaman in the 50s.<br />
<br />
Nowhere near as many as some other classes, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Falyin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Druids and monks.... there are more druids and monks than any other. Everyone seems to have a monk twink, and MANY people play druids (as they are so easy) This is not to say all druids are played by people looking for the easy-out, or that all monks are nothing but twinks, but that seems to be a notable trend none-the-less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Shammys are pretty fun to play.<br />
<br />
<br />
We can do things that no other class can do, and do most things that the other ones are known for pretty well(even if it is improvised).  We can do standard things like slow/heal/debuff/buff, but then we can also do cooler things such as Ghetto-mez(park), Solo well(godlike at later levels), Alchemy, even tank! I personally love it when i have an unslowed mob hitting on me, and i take little damage cause it whiffs most the time :)  <br />
The list of what we can do goes on and on, Shammys are commonly called a jack of all trades(though i personally dont believe we are the master of none).  <br />
<br />
The reason alot of people dont play shamans is cause they dont know what a real shammy can do.  Most people -play the kunark circuit, and thus group w/ 600AC, 200+wis shammys(In DL or OT), thus labeling shamans as 'druid like'(cant take a punch).  A good shaman can make these guys jaw's drop though :)<br />
<br />
Anyway, a shaman is fun to play, we can do alot of stuff, and all of it pretty well.  If you decide to start one up, dont quit it...The problem w/ shaman is that even a well twinked one will have a hard time before 24... give a monk some gear, they will shoot up.  Many people simply burnout, often times in 19-24(jesus this took me along time), cause they dont get 24, then 34(where we REALLy get strong).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Falyin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Actually, that may be it, Xertt. This is not a class you can easily level (at lower stages), you actually have to work for. I am willing to bet the vast majority of lowbies these days are twinks, and not many people enjoy *working* through those low levels again (and again, and again....)<br />
<br />
I think I have 5 shamans now, but I finally decided to just stick with Fal. lol. I love shamans.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Shamen seem to be one of the fewest twinked characters I've seen, that make it to a somewhat decent level anyway.<br />
<br />
You'll see a bunch in Oasis area, but once they get to 19 and it starts to get tough, most usually quit.<br />
<br />
However on my server, there seems to be alot of 50+ shamen (I'll be one soon hehe :))<br />
<br />
But also, most of them take the Lemming Path of Idiocy (IE: Lake of Ill Omen/Paludal, FM, OT, DL, KC, Velks. And have low ac/hp and monster wis. <br />
<br />
I am generally the only shaman in the zones I fight in :) Which makes it nice for gettin' groups heh :)<br />
<br />
I'd say on my server: As mains shamen are in the top middle...<br />
and as alts, near the bottom, probably with mages there at the bottom.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Actually allakhazam did a survey on mains, shaman came up in lower middle of the pack.  Paladins, druids, monks, warriors, clerics, enchanters, wizards, rogues, and rangers were all more common mains.  Less common were bards, mages, SKs, necros, and bringing up last place, beastlords.  <br />
<br />
Being in the most common classes means generally that you will have a lot more work to do in order to stand out of the pack as an exceptional player/character.  It also means you'll share your class with more jackasses on average.  <br />
<br />
If you can take the carpal tunnel syndrome or have a way to twist songs without clicking too much, I'd do a bard.  No other class is more sought after for raiding guilds at this time.  No other class is as versatile either.  Lotta twink bards about, but very few mains.  It's something to think about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Shamans used to be fairly rare, but they are much more popular nowadays.</div></div><hr />

And contrary to Rokkeb's experience, usually twinked. Which wouldn't annoy me except for one thing, out of the new Shaman I see I would say maybe 1 in 5 of them aren't holding a book. I know, I know, differing playstyles but it just makes me cringe.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Numer one, I consider myself a ShaBear, or Shabby for short ;)  And I'll tell you that it seems that our class is one of the most sought classes in the endgame.  I always hear in /gu we can do this we can do that, but we need a Shaman.  It normally takes me 2 minutes when I get on to get a group, if not less.<br />
<br />
I've seen us raid a LOT of different high end dragons and mobs and I'll tell you, it seems as though our class seems to take some of the most skill to play well.  Sticking Malo, Malosini and slow without getting the undevided attention of the dragon, in time to keep the MA alive on his CH rotation makes you VERY popular with the guild.  The only other thing that seems to take more skill is the pulling monk, getting only one dragon at a time and not getting killed in the process.<br />
<br />
The Bard way is a tough one.  They can't solo as well as almost any other class, so progression is slow.  They're VERY useful for groups, so they can get groupage easily, but they NEED groupage.  Once they get high level, they're Golden for whole raids, but they spend their time twisting twisting twisting.  Many Bards have gone mad and thrown themselves off the ledge of Paineel into the Hole.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The thing is, with the new gear that came out in Velious and SoL, shamans are getting so powerful as to do things that are truly miraculous.  <br />
<br />
And the exceptional players of the class who share their exploits just make the class all the more intriguing to the power-hungry player base. <br />
<br />
Shaman twinks are inevitable.  True shamans who identify with the class, want to know how to play it in all situations, and who actively test their limits are rare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Vorpatril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">&gt;&gt; &quot;... They can't solo as well as almost any other class, so progression is slow..&quot;<br />
<br />
A bit off the subject, but I have to argue this point. From the levels 27 to around 53 or so, bards are probably the BEST ( or close ) soloing class in the game. Of course, that's a bold assertion and could be refuted based on style of play, types of gear etc. But in general, I think it holds. Lvl 27 is when bards get mana free charm. Outdoor zone + mana free charm + selos  == unlimited exp. It's tricky and can be tiring, but until the lvl 27 charm stops working it is insane. The charm is not often resisted, even by low red cons. I've seen a lvl 41 bard charm kiting all 4 spectres in Oasis at once using this technique.  <br />
<br />
After they get their third Chant song, they can also do &quot;chant kiting&quot; where they run in a big circle casting their Chant dots. Since this does not cost mana, this can be done non-stop. The distance and the damage output is pretty good in the 30s to low 50s. <br />
<br />
Combining these tactics can result in dramatic victories. As a non-twinked lvl 40 bard, I soloed a lvl 47 Mountain Giant Patriarch in Dreadlands. It took a loooong time... but I won. I'm not sure how many non-twinked classes could do that. <br />
<br />
On the downside, after around lvl 51 or so it starts getting tough to solo. Charm kiting gets much riskier since the mobs hit so hard, and the higher level charm song takes mana, so one can do it for only so long. Chant kiting also doesn't work so well because the damage output does not go up as fast as mob HP. <br />
<br />
It DOES get tiring to play a bard. After I made a bard I made a cleric. Sitting down all the time and healing once in a while was just what my hands needed. ;)<br />

<br />
<br />
Actually this couldnt be further frmo the truth.  Its the fastest way to level because its become the norm.  I firmly believe that dungeons do make players better because you tend to learn more about the games mechanics inside of dungeons.  All of the top end zones are dungeon models, Sleepers, TOV, VT (even tho its outdoor class), CT, Sebilis, etc.  When you take someone that has done nothing but outdoor zones and have had the freedom to run to the nearest zone line ALL of the time to escape death, thats what makes the experience go faster.   YOu don't die nearly as often.  You also don't fine tune the player skills for dungeon crawling and top boss encounters because outdoor zones typically don't have a 'boss' to deal with, there are a lot of mini-bosses but nothing hardcore for the level of players there.  Outdoor zones also don't teach people how to cr, how to recover frmo cr expeditiously, or how to navigate vefry well.  It does produce excellent kiters.  Pullers tend to suck.  Its a hella lot harder to learn pulling dungeons then to scope out 200 yards away and proximity agro everything to bring to camp.<br />
<br />
On a side note, most outdoor zones don't have the experience modifiers that dungeons do.  Making dungeons the better choice for more experienced players/twinks, and people who really want to learn the game inside and out (no pun intended).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was extremely spoiled with a regular group that loved dungeons.  We met around level 27 in CT, then we went to Dalnir, Kaesora, Nurga, Droga (spent a LOT of time in Droga), CoM... We had a set time to play every night and tried to camp out where we'd be hunting the next day.  Log in at 7, meet group, start hunting, it was great.<br />
<br />
Sure we did some outdoor hunting occasionally if time was limited, so I know the difference between single, safe pulls to the FM zone in OT and crawling all the way to the chief's room in Droga.<br />
<br />
The outdoor zones are great because it's easy to find a group and you don't have to travel anywhere, two things that can cut into a productive night of exp.</div></div><hr />

This is my first/only character, and I am one hell of a shaman thank you very much :)<br />
<br />
Admittedly it took till about level 30 until I found out our dots stack, or even understood the concept of dotting something and rooting it and moving the hell out of the way...lol.  (strangely enough this was around the same time I discovered this website)<br />
<br />
Leveling in outdoor zones is not stupid. Its the easiest way to find a group, which is NEEDED by untwinked, true newbies. Hell this game is supossed to be social: IE grouping. <br />
<br />
I hadn't even seen more than about 10-15 zones by the time I hit lvl 50.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I have to agree with both sides.  My lovable oracle is my first char, and she grew up on the lemming path (I remember telling my EQ noob frinds &quot;I found the coolest place, you have to come to oasis!&quot;).  It definitely leveled me up.  And it sure didn't teach me a freaking thing about being a good shaman.  But I did learn the dead basics of grouping and EQ etiquette.   I think most folks starting this game from zilch are well served by that path.  Once you're higher level and can twink out some alts, then you get the joy of dungeon crawling with your friends' twinked alts...  ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've spent time in pretty much all of the non-high end dungeons, and the experience is never nearly as good as soloing.<br />
<br />
As far as I'm concerned, dungeons are for raids and hanging out with friends.  Outdoor zones are for xp.  The bazaar is for loot.  :)</div></div><hr />

I get online somewhere between 8:00 and 8:30, 4-5 nights a week.  Unfortunately I have to get up at 6:00 am eastern, so I'm done by 11:00 most nights, possibly a bit after midnight if I'm willing to not play the next night and catch up on sleep.<br />
<br />
How long does it take to find a group, get to the dungeon, figure out if it's camped, work your way in to the interesting part, and work your way back out?  How long does that CR take when you got killed at 10:30?<br />
<br />
Compare that to how long it takes to set up and kill at the FM giant fort.  You can start when you want, you can quit when you want.<br />
<br />
So you can sneer all you want, but I spent a lot of time in LOIO-FM-OT-DL.  And I'm not a wisdom shaman at the cost of ac/hp, and I can hold my own in Chardok, the Hole, and CoM just fine.</div></div><hr />

You can play how you like, but that is just an ignorant statement.  The responses to it have nailed it on the head already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">About a year ago I had all the free time I wanted to level/group..etc, etc, etc. I took my Iksar SK from 22 to 43 in about 4 months (total solo time) this was when class penalty was active so I was leveling at a snails pace. But since then I've switched Mains and gotten a bit of a RL (girlfriend, school ) now I can play about 2-3 times a week max. Not sure where I'm going with this but oh well, it's Friday, tired from staying out late (finished finals) and I'm ready to go home ! <br />
<br />
Anyway, even now Shaman don't seem to be THAT popular, I see countless monks, druids, warriors....I usually do a who /all Shaman in every zone I'm in, I'm lucky to get 4 Shaman in any one zone at a time. I also do a who /all Iksar Shaman and sometimes I can get up to 9 (most I've seen) and as little as 2. So Shaman aren't that popular it would seem. You know what ? I like it like that, the less people know how awesome Shaman are the less boneheads we'll have playing them. I don't do dungeons that often.....because I just don't have the time to find a group in a dungeon. I can buff up, summon Cujo and go whack some outdoor mobs alot faster than it takes to find an efficient group or a group that doesn't expect me to be just a buff whore/main healer...I'M NOT A CLERIC, DAMNIT !!  I slow stuff, debuff it, rot it, and slap it around like a prison b@tch !!! <br />
<br />
I also didn't want to do the &quot;ol Kunark circuit LOIO-FM-OT-DL-KC, I'm a casual player so what's the rush to get to 60 ? I'm unguilded, I may never get my epic, I'll never see zones like ST, Vex, VP, HoT, more than likely I may never see any of the planes so why rush ? <br />
I go where I can level and gain some loot maybe group a little or solo (which I mostly do). And I'm having a good time ! It's always good to read about how some Shaman soloed mob X, and whatnot....does me proud...because regardless of race we are all in the fraternity of Shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Wow, lots to respond to here:<br />
<br />
&quot;and MANY people play druids (as they are so easy)&quot;<br />
<br />
I have a druid for port reasons, but I find him actually quite difficult to play.  Why?  Because I am spoiled on mana regen.  And druids do not get a form of this until their mid 50s.  As a result, my med breaks are so long that I find it hard to get the motivation to even load him up to solo anymore.<br />
<br />
&quot;But also, most of them take the Lemming Path of Idiocy (IE: Lake of Ill Omen/Paludal, FM, OT, DL, KC, Velks. And have low ac/hp and monster wis.&quot;<br />
<br />
Absolutely nothing wrong with this.  In fact, one thing I have always liked about Kunark is that is has an excellent leveling structure set up.  What you just described (save for Paludal of course) is probably the best way to proceed in Kunark, and I'm sure this setup was in large part due to the fact that they knew Iksars would be sticking to Kunark (since they are universally hated). <br />
<br />
&quot;Which wouldn't annoy me except for one thing, out of the new Shaman I see I would say maybe 1 in 5 of them aren't holding a book. I know, I know, differing playstyles but it just makes me cringe.&quot;<br />
<br />
Personally, I try to keep HPs, AC, and WIS as my &quot;Anchor Stats.&quot;  In other words, I will go for these three stats before any others, but I still try to maintain a balance between all stats.<br />
Overall, I find it best to keep an open mind about how to play a shaman.  If someone wants to play the pure WIS or pure AC route, that's fine.  I play how I think is best for me personally.  <br />
<br />
&quot;and outdoor zones don't make you a ****tier player.&quot;<br />
<br />
I agree.<br />
<br />
&quot;I firmly believe that dungeons do make players better because you tend to learn more about the games mechanics inside of dungeons.&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm on both sides here, too.  Learning to fight in a dungeon is very important since a large part of the high-end game is dungeon-oriented, but learning how to function in a group (which is where outdoor zones shine) is equally important.  The best-played shamans (IMO) are those that have mastered both.<br />
<br />
&quot;The outdoor zones are really for casual players.&quot;<br />
<br />
Not always true -- I was a hardcore player for about two years and I loved outdoor zones.  In general, I do not really like dungeons, but I am trying to experience them more.  Once I hit the higher levels (especially lvl 60) dungeons have become nowhere near as intimidating.<br />
<br />
&quot;So Shaman aren't that popular it would seem. You know what ? I like it like that, the less people know how awesome Shaman are the less boneheads we'll have playing them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ah, back on the original topic.  And yes, I agree.  I tend to notice less poorly-played (although this is such a relative term) shamans out there than any other class.<br />
<br />
a group that doesn't expect me to be just a buff whore/main healer...I'M NOT A CLERIC, DAMNIT !! I slow stuff, debuff it, rot it, and slap it around like a prison b@tch !!!<br />
<br />
IMO, adaption and versatility is the key here.  As a shaman, a very important skill is the ability to fill-in whatever role is lacking to the best of your ability.  On the other hand, you and your groupmates also need to know your limitations.  If you or those with you think that you can (for example) crowd control as efficiently as an enchanter, or heal as efficiently as a cleric, then you are just setting yourselves up for disappointment (of course, that's not to say that we can't do these things, just not to the level of efficiency as the classes that were designed to do them can).<br />
But if it gets me a group or a spot in a raid, I'll play just about any role they want me to.<br />

I also didn't want to do the &quot;ol Kunark circuit LOIO-FM-OT-DL-KC, I'm a casual player so what's the rush to get to 60 ? I'm unguilded, I may never get my epic, I'll never see zones like ST, Vex, VP, HoT, more than likely I may never see any of the planes so why rush ? <br />
I go where I can level and gain some loot maybe group a little or solo (which I mostly do). And I'm having a good time ! It's always good to read about how some Shaman soloed mob X, and whatnot....does me proud...because regardless of race we are all in the fraternity of Shaman. <br />

Anyways, i went to route of the lemming.  I'm level 60 now, and I finally made my first twink two days ago.  Guess what?  He will be going the route of the lemming as well.  Why?  b/c I already know how to play the frikking game and there is no point in going to a dungeon and doing anything risky when I can just stick to the outdoor zones that I know and get him to 50 in a few weeks, where all the real fun begins (mmmmmm ice comet).<br />
<br />
My first real exp session in a dungeon was in seb in my low 50's.  I don't count velks b/c except for the dogs camps, its just like an outdoor zone (except for no sow).  My first time in seb, I just sat quietly in the corner and pretended I was used to the place.  I slowed mobs, buffed, threw in the heal where it was needed.  I got the hang of it in about 30 minutes.  After about a day, I was as good at dungeons as anyone else is.  It's not like it is hard.  Now, after untold hours spent in plenty of dungeons, I am quite good at them.  I am usually the puller and first wave crowd control for my groups (i root mezz, chanter true mezzes).  The only real difference between dungeons and outdoor zones is that you can't run around like a jackass in dungeons and you have to be more careful with your aggro.  Not a big difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Chukzombi Astrocreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I never ever  had a problem finding groups as my shaman. no matter where i went  or what level i was i always got a group within 15 minutes of asking.  When i was GDI 2 years ago, finding a raid was no problem either as i was usually only shaman at raids. The thing is to never need a group. go to a dungeon with the intention of soloing , /ooc lfg and start pulling small mobs to pass the time.  in OS this was perfect for me. pull to the bridge and the zone gawkers would get jealous of all the exp and ask if i could group them. before i knew it we had a full group heading to necrosis.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">What always bugs me about these threads is every person who doesn't play an Iksar starts spouting off about how much better they are for not having leveled on Kunark. That's great and all that some of you feel the need to insult the play skills of people you don't know but don't you think after 2 years it's getting a bit old? <br />
<br />
Put yourself in a new players position. They get the game when Kunark comes out and they create an Iksar. They don't know of all the l337 non-Kunark leveling spots or that in 2 years they'll be shunned for taking advantage of the hunting grounds provided to them. They go to LoIO because it's right next door. They go to DL because they still aren't sure how they'll manage buying/selling away from their home. They try to go into dungeons but solo'ing untwinked in a caster heavy dungeon, even then, wasn't the best choice for your sanity. <br />
<br />
There are idiots in every zone in the game and there is no &quot;right way&quot; to get to 60. <br />
<br />
Oh, Rodahn, balance is nice and all but I reserve the right to cringe when I see yet another level 20 Barbarian run past me with GEBs, Runed Mithril Bracers and Gatorscale leggings while wielding two books. That's nice that you want to &quot;keep an open mind&quot;, would be nice if you would actually practice that when reading these boards. My opinion is just as valid as yours ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Damn, Rodahn's gone and pissed someone else off!  Ah, i remember the days when we were feuding over something, can't remember what atm tho.  <br />
<br />
Um, I agree with balance actually.  If you go hog wild on ac/hps you'll cripple your casting skills.  You'll fizzle a lot more, you won't have enuf mana pool to deal with a crisis, and your skills in casting will progress more slowly.  <br />
If you go apemonkey on wisdom, you'll have low defensive skills which are even MORE crippling than low casting skills at later levels.  That's the most serious consequence.  You'll also miss out on the joys of tanking a mob and feeling the true power of the shaman.  Finally you will be lousy as snot at crowd control, a role you will increasingly be required to fill as you attempt more challenging hunting grounds . . . if you do.  Nowadays many shamans take the freeway to 60 and learn jack and squat about Norrath, the way mobs behave, how to utilize the strengths of each class to help a group, how to pull, when to heal, when to cast what spell . . . the list goes on really.<br />
<br />
Then again I hear you that the freeway to 60 IS the fastest route.  You really will have a hard time beating the pace of leveling since it's so consistent.  I'm not against this.  I'm against people who think this is all there is to EQ.  <br />
<br />
If you are going to take the freeway to 60, take a few detours now and then.  See the sights, check out a different zone, turn LFG on and see if you can get picked up for someplace truly exciting!  Make an exploratory group!  <br />
<br />
I took a group of lvl 59-60's down to fungi king last night.  Me, warrior, monk, wizard, druid, and cleric.  No chanter . . we don't need no stinking chanters!  At least not when you've got me along heh.  So the wizard zoned in and looked around, finally we got him to follow us down towards the first rock.  Then he didn't know how to get to the water room and almost died finding it.  His reason?  He'd never been there, never been on a Trak raid, or a fungi camp, or juggs camp.  We are talking about a lvl SIXTY wizard with almost 30 AA points!!!!!!!   It was embarrassing.  <br />
<br />
Don't do yourself a disservice and pretend that you can gimp along to 60 and then magically become &quot;uber.&quot;  I'm sorry but lvl 60 is only part of it.  The rest is one hell of a lot of information you need to learn about the world of Norrath.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The people who are saying that one is more likely to find a group, more likely to survive and more likely to progress quickly outdoors are also right. <br />
<br />
I love dungeons. I wish they had never made lvl 30+ outdoor zones. But now that they have, it's dang near impossible to get a group in a dungeon. I went to whack the Froglok King for his crown the other day and was the only person in LGuk. The only one. I remember that dungeon having 100+ ( pre-kunark ). If I were a lvl 35 warrior and I wanted to get some exp, would I hazard my way through UGuk to get to LGuk to sit alone waiting for other people to show up for a group? Of course not, I'd head to FM/OT and grind away. <br />
<br />
Orakul Fatmystic is just stating a sad truth about EQ - if you want to find people to join a pickup group under lvl 50, you are going to have to go to an outdoor zone.  <br />
<br />
All of the folks who are saying that dungeons are better places to go are, of course, correct. But how are you going to get a group? Sure, if you have a group of well-balanced friends who are all on at the same time, then you are set - but most of us are not that lucky. <br />
<br />
I realize I'm stating the obvious, but so many of the posts above seem to be making generalizations about the wise and mighty dungeon dwellers and the lazy and lame outdoor zone dwellers.  People who can't solo go to places where they can group - which, for a variety of reasons, is outdoors. <br />
<br />
One possible way Sony could fix this is to make the ZEM public for all dungeons and to make it BIG, or at least make it really big relative to outdoor zones. Currently, a person can make something like 25% better exp in The Hole than a person can in the Dreadlands. Wow, that's great! Uh, well, given the amount of time it will take to get a group together to go to the Hole, set up, and start pulling, you could have stayed in DL and made up that 25%. And what happens to our Hole group when someone has to leave? Where are you going to get reinforcements? More hassle, more downtime, less fighting. All of that makes 25% (or whatever) seem really insignificant. <br />
<br />
Now if the ZEM was like 300% relative to DL, then that's would make it worthwhile. Even if you had to jump through all sorts of hoops to get to The Hole, just a short time fighting there would get you a lot more exp than DL. Also, with a bonus that big, people would be more likely to hang around there hoping to get a group, thereby decreasing the hassles of getting a group. I realize that bonus seems enormous - I'm not saying make it easier to level. Putting a negative ZEM on outdoor zones would be just as effective. The point is to just make the difference between indoors and outdoors very large. <br />
<br />
<br />
To summarize: as it stands now, I think that the system encourages people to take the dull outdoor path. Unless one has a ready group, the dull path is fastest exp-wise. I would like to see that changed, but it won't change until there is an exp bonus large enough to draw people into dungeons.<br />

Exactly! I've been thinking this same thought for a long time. As it stands all we really know about ZEMs is how much they were increased by in that one patch long ago. Has anyone actually figured out the ZEM percentages for zones, via showeq or whatever? It seems to be a relative mystery, and I'm sure a large amount of the EQ populace doesn't even know what a ZEM is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's all I am trying to say :)<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Also, concerning the Iksar-hating comments on this thread, I was actually defending your opinion on that one.  The &quot;Kunark Cycle&quot; is an extremely well-designed leveling structure, IMO.  And I think the faction problems of Iksars was one big reason why this cycle was put into the game.  Not a slam on Iksars, just an observation about a game feature :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">On the original point of this topic I agree, there are more and more Shaman popping up everyday.

Insofar as outdoor vs indoor leveling - it is always easy to spot the person who took the path of least resistance.<br />

/g Oasis_LOIO_FM_OT_DL_d00d: ZONE !<br />
/g Rest of group: LOL.<br />

Yes the time constraints are less outdoors. But da.mn, when people have seen 5 whopping zones at level 55 and then are breaking mezz, asking questions they should know at level 30, you think: &quot;E-bay&quot; &quot;N00bie&quot; &quot;PoLR&quot;<br />
<br />
Why is the indoor player better? Because when you're level 35 and trying to break and hold frenzy, you CAN'T mess up. OTOH, in OT and you get too many - you zone. You don't learn as much about class interdependancy and what to do when the fe.ces hits the fan.<br />
<br />
But when the day is done - it's your account and your $12.95. Have fun, be safe.</div></div><hr />

Isn't it weird to do a /who all shaman 60 and not recognize half the names?<br />

You know how I found my regular group at level 27?  One was my boyfriend, one was a friend and the other two people who just always seemed to be on when we were on. It was simple enough to say, &quot;hey, this was fun tonight, want to do the same thing tomorrow?&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">something weird...as i lvled i would always see other shaman my lvl on at all times of the day.  when i hit my 50s many times i would /who all shaman (lvl) and late night i would be the only one on.  seems to be that way all through the 50s till you hit lvl 60.  i have yet to see less than 2 lvl 60 shamans on at all times.<br />
<br />
on a personal note, i have played all the other classes at one time or another.  maybe i have not lvled them high enough but i find shamans the most fun to play.  clerics are THE worst. i hate my cleric and i stripped his gear and sold it for shaman spells lol</div></div><hr />

No kidding.  This is one thing that really saddens me about seeing the influx of more shamans.  In the past, being a shaman (especially a high lvl one) was an exclusive fraternity where (like Cheers) everyone knew your name.  Even Barbs, the most common shaman race, felt that exclusive bond.<br />
Now, even a lvl 60 shaman is quickly becoming just another face in the crowd.  Before, if a shaman backed out of a group, it was very difficult for that group to find a replacement, and often they had to make other plans.  Now, it's not a big of deal -- you back out, no problem, there are plenty more to choose from.  I see us, sadly, becoming more and more interchangeable.  <br />
/shrug maybe it's just my server.<br />
<br />
Now does this make me like the class any less?  No.  <br />
Am I going to give up my shaman just because we are becoming more popular?  Hell no.<br />
<br />
Just hope our quality does not start to suffer due to quantity.</div></div><hr />
