<br />
It is still in its infancy, but the website is now presentable and ready to be viewed by the public.<br />
<br />
Check it out at: http://www.everquest-2.com</div></div><hr />

I'd like opinions from anyone about that site ; ) <br />
<br />
Not crazy about the color scheme but the organization is fine.<br />
<br />
I am anxiously awaiting more info about the game.  It's a bit sparse so far. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Blackguard</div><div class="date">04-30-2002, 01:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Forums will be up soon.  We're going to transfer the entire site to a new host pretty soon to a faster host that allows us to use more bandwidth.  We had an amazing 14367 hits yesterday, and we literally just announced the website on about 5 forums... images sucked up 72% of the total bandwidth<br />
<br />
I'm not crazy about the color scheme either!  That's being changed with the new design, which may have to be fairly simple as far as graphics go so we can conserve bandwidth (it's not cheap and we don't have any advertisements yet).<br />
<br />
We're also anxious about getting more EQ2 news.  When it becomes availalable, we WILL have it on the website =)<br />
<br />
Keep checking the website for updates, there will probably be a new design up in a couple days.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the feedback!<br />
<br />
P.S.  Please change your bookmarks to http://www.everquest-2.com<br />
<br />
If you have the index.asp in there it won't work in a few days, because we're just masking the true host right nwo.</div></div><hr />

Even tho I have high speed access, I prefer sites that consciously keep the graphics down to what's necessary and tasteful.  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
With all of the people who've shown an interest in the website, we're porting to a new host, redesigning the site sooner than expected, getting the forums up the day that the site gets transferred to the new host and redesigned, and a few other things.</div></div><hr />
