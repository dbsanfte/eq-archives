<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>luvless??</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know of a couple shammies (i'm one of them Ravenbeast is the other) that don't have sufficient firepower to break and take fear..<br />
<br />
personally i'm guildless.. i'm not going to get into the reasons.. lets just say no &quot;guild&quot; has impressed me yet.. although quite a few guilded individuals have..<br />
<br />
i think ravenbeasts situation is that he's in a smaller guild that wouldn't be able to take on fear (correct me if i'm wrong here raven)..<br />
<br />
anyway.. i was wondering if anyone would like to plan a fear raid to help us get our tears.. i know ashen rage just took down the golems tonite in their fear raid for MQ tears.. i don't know if they plan to sell them or give them away or stockpile for their next shammies..<br />
<br />
which leaves aobut 60 hours till next repop.. ya that's kinda short notice.. but its a start..<br />
<br />
so if anyone would like to lend a hand.. and bring some friends.. we can give it a whirl..<br />
<br />
note: i'm sure there are other shaman on 7th in the same situation.. i just don't happen to know them personally.. if you're one of them speak up.. send me a tell or whatever.. i'm sure i can prolly bring at least 1 group of friends with..<br />
<br />
hell we could even make this a semi-regular thing.. hittin shammy epic mobs for shammies and not for guild banks.. or cashloot.. or whatever else people are doing with them..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>MoonDoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I was in the same situation a while back, but a good friend in NW got me an invite to go along on a Fear raid and loot the tear.<br />
<br />
At the weekend I was in Fear again with RdN and saw the iksar there, I dont think anyone looted it as it wasn't needed. I'm sorry that I didnt think to loot it for MQ as I was a guest at the time.<br />
<br />
I'd suggest that you contact people you know in other guilds who might be doing Fear, it's easy enough to zone in and run to the mob if the zone is being cleared.  If you get aggro just stand and die and get a loc.<br />
<br />
I've seen you around so I'll certainly remember your name if I go there again, and I'll send you a tell if the raid leader says it's OK, I'm sure that an extra slower/healer wouldnt be unwelcome.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Blackdust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You guys need to join a guild that does Fear. Many guilds still do it, just not necessarily the same guilds that did it a year ago. Try looking the 7th Hammer Message Boards (http://pub148.ezboard.com/f7thhammerfrm11.showMessage?topicID=4.topic) for a list of guilds.<br />
<br />
I would suggest Virtute et Armis, Ashen Rage, Steel Thunder, Phoenix Ascendant to name a few. It's seriously so easy now, keep you're eyes open and I'm sure you can hook up with one of these guilds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ravenbeast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hello Luvless,<br />
  How are you?<br />
I will go to fear anytime we can get the people to go.. )<br />
Before they change all the safe zones my guild at that time tryed at least 5 times to get me my iksar tear :(<br />
Everytime it was a wipe out...<br />
I have not been there sence the wipe outs but I would go again if we (all shamans) can get are tears :)<br />
