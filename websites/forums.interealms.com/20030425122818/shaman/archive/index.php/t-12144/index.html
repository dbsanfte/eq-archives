<br />
tried to by sebilite scale leggings but they aren't trollable.<br />
<br />
that neck with extended buff time is next on my list.  anyway, i'd like some suggestions, even though i am a twink.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Your equipment is fine for your level</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zenbudda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">...i know i'm fine for my level, i spent well in the 10k range already.  i'm looking for upgrades that will last me a while so i don't have to worry about equip, and just about leveling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Huth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would say your already there until 50+</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zenbudda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">thanks.  so at 50, what would your recommended upgrades be?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Huth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ok things i would be looking at getting rid of would be the Forest Loop, Molten Cloak, LizardScale Mantle, Shissar Scale Headband. I would swap them out for the items i have tbh (check my profile), there might be some new stuff floating around from LoY that i haven't seen. <br />
<br />
I would think about not wearing your black fur boot and leaving them in your inventory (they are clickable from there), an old favourite for the feet slot is a pair of barbed dragonscale boots. These usually run about 5k on AB but i picked up some luggald scale boots for 2k which i think are really nice.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hail,<br />
<br />
Replace these items:<br />
Forest Loop, Molten Cloak, LizardScale Mantle, &amp; CC shield.<br />
Bag the Black fur Boots. <br />
<br />
Possibilities:<br />
Silver Hammer Earring or Skull Charm, or Electrified Earring of Tempests.<br />
<br />
Sarnak Battle Shield.<br />
<br />
Cloak of the Wise, Justice Cape, Arctic Wyvern Cloak.<br />
<br />
Obulus Death Shroud or Death Watcher's Shroud.  Heck, even a Tattered Mantle would be better here.<br />
<br />
Barbed Dragonscale Boots or Peerless Dragonhide Boots (offsets your Fungi negative agility).<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />
