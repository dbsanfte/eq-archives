From the random /ooc babble I was hearing I have to do something to get a flag in order to go in....... but how?  They said I had to talk to the NPC near my zone, but there wasnt one anywhere near the PLane of Storms Zone..............<br />
<br />
any input?</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is some info on the Justice one in another thread in this forum.</div></div><hr />

There is no NPC to speak with at the stone and you are not able to enter. I would imagine you will need a character flag obtained by completion of some quest or encounter (i.e. Justice Tribunals or such). No one I have spoken with has found anything related to it yet.</div></div><hr />
