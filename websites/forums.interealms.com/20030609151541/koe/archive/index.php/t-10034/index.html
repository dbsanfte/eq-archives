<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Blacksin Soulclaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings all,<br />
<br />
I have been reading a bit about the plane of growth and have become interested in visiting there.  Now I know that those of you who are not already hated by the world as my blue bretheren and select species are do not hunt here because of faction, but I think I might enjoy it.  Now here's my question, to hunt here can you throw up your LFG flag and have a chance, or do you need to have an evil assembly all-ready to go?  Also has anyone ever seen pick-up group offers in say the nexus for the POG?<br />
<br />
<br />
Just wondering<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

It is not an inhabited zone, per se. There are a few of us who would love to go.. Me, Siji..there were a couple others who don't care about making the high elves mad... <br />
<br />
We just need one good group with some DPS and a porter to get the melee back out...</div></div><hr />
