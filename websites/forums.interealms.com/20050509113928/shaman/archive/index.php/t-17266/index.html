<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Namurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I dislike the PoP expansion and the subsequent ones.  If I had the oppurtunity to play on an 'old rules' server where PoP didn't exist, I'd take it.  Personally, much as I'd like to keep Luclin and the bazaar out of it, I think it'd get a bit boring once you hit 60, without any AA Points to work on... So my choice is old world-Luclin.<br />
<br />
Would you play on an old rules server, and if so, which one?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If there was pvp and a lvl50 cap. Yes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd play the level cap 50 one as long as the current balancing that is in effect and changes that have gone into the game since pre-kunark were also there.  Those were the fun days really imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">No...<br />
<br />
PoP isn't flawed in execution, it is just flawed in design. It makes travel ridiculously easy, experience incredibly fast, and what would be amazing stat items within arms' reach.<br />
<br />
The best analogy I can think of relates to current life. Going from planes of power back to Old World would take away so many things you take for granted. It would be as if electricity didn't exist, the combustion engine hadn't been created, no running water, and our shelter went back to mud, branches and animal skins. All of the players are accustomed to the niceties of PoP by now. If you had to transport by druid, had to /auction in East Freeport, had to slave day and night just to reach level 47, and had to work your ass off for those +6 agility sleeves you would go into a state of EQ shock and lose interest in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I would play on a server with imagination and a theme! Possibly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I like the new expansions..mostly LDON.  It gives people something for their time and is easily the best ever expansion in my eyes.  Although you could argue it was just lazy itemization on their parts, but at least you know if you spend a week in LDON you should walk away with SOMETHING for your time besides a sore butt and wrist.<br />
<br />
I'm of the opinion a lot of you that would do &quot;old rules&quot; would find you really didnt like the old days as much as you think you did :) .  My guess is you liked the exploration and newness of the game, but you wont have that if you were to play on an &quot;old rules&quot; server as there really wont be anything new.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">old world only, with level 50 cap.. BUT IT HAS TO HAVE KITTIES. i dont care if that doesnt follow the storyline.. eq has no storyline anyways</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>windfinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">just close off planer traval to people under 45 and it would help. since any new world with pop and kunark would find EVERY new person in field of bones just like it did with the lunch of the brand new server a bit ago. dear GOD that was a cluster in that zone. you did not get on that server the comunity that formed with most of the iksar communs on most of the other servers simpley becouse thay could not be issolationanest for a bit. THAT even fit with the story line thay hate everyone and everyone hates them ( save the cats couse there dumb ). yes I play a iksar and yes I did go to the new server and hope to recature some of the lower level joy in the game I had by starting a nother iksar and it did not work.</div></div><hr />

I disagree.  Not going to get too into it, but I fully understand that the 'newbie' feeling can't be recaptured; however that's not what I (and most I think) would hope to get out of an old rules server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hmm I played on a new server when it came out, it was fun because everyone was the same level. There was like a &quot;community&quot; effect. Tradeskills were useful as were quests. I don't know if I would argue for removing some of the expansions. Part of recreating as a newbie is actually experiencing some of the zones you never experienced when you were one. However I  know there is a lot of people that would want such a server as this. And I reckon it could pick up demand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I am going to add on, if they perhaps fixed some of the quests at the low end also on this &quot;special server&quot; and perhaps made it a little different the rewards. However as I said earlier I would favour perhaps a more imaginative and themed server. But the thing with eq is you require so much time investment to start a new character(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Its worthwhile to point out, that you can just install basic eq and have the 50 cap, low xp, etc.<br />
I seriously doubt few people could stand it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">1. they dont sell basic EQ anymore, its either trilogy (up to and including velious), or evolutions (up to pop i believe).<br />
2. No matter what you buy or play with the lvl cap is still 65 (no AA's w/o luclin)<br />
3. the whole point of an old school server is that everyone else on the server is in the same boat, installing only a few expansions just wouldnt have the same feel or challenge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">are you sure about the lvl cap on pre-PoP expansions? i remember people going back to 50 because eq thought they only had basic eq.. it wouldnt do that if basic eq's cap was 65, unless im mistaken on the reason for the level losses</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">2. No matter what you buy or play with the lvl cap is still 65 (no AA's w/o luclin)<br />
<br />
Nope, you need PoP to be able to level beyond 60.<br />
<br />
You only need one of Kunark, Velious, Luclin or PoP to be able to level beyond 50 though. I think you need either Luclin or PoP for AAs. I don't think LDoN affects the level limit at all, though I don't know for certain.<br />
<br />
I would have thought that most people will have all expansions though, so it's not a huge issue as things stand.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh yes, I’d love to go back to spending half an hour or more to ride the boats from Butcherblock Mountains to Freeport.  And I would especially love the challenge of playing a low level “evil” character trying not to get killed while doing so and having to do it all over again, after the corpse run that is.  After all, who wants to be able to group with friends no mater where in Norrath they are?<br />
<br />
And I absolutely hate all the new items that have been introduced to the game.  All that variety absolutely spoils game play for me.<br />
<br />
Trade skills were so much more fun back in the day as well.  I hate the convenience of collapsible containers.  And who’s stupid idea was it to make things like spider silks, lion skins and casks stackable.  It’s so much more enjoyable to have each and every one take up a slot in my backpack.<br />
<br />
Oh, and who’s stupid idea was it to add shard bank space and a shared plat slot?  Don’t the idiots at Sony realize how much I looked forward to trying to find an isolated spot so I could drop my most valuable items on the ground to trade them to the other characters on my account?  Logging back in and finding that someone had picked them up added so much excitement to the game.  <br />
<br />
And can you believe Sony added LDoN to the game?  What incompetent fools!  Do they really think I want to be able to log on, complete an adventure in a couple of hours and log off again?  What do they think I have outside of EQ, a life?<br />
<br />
I say we all burn every expansion that’s come out since EQ’s release and demand that Sony remove all the patches as well.  Otherwise there’s no way any of us will have any fun.<br />

Most people that are for such a server all seem to want to keep balance changes that have been made since release (i.e. Soulbinders, updated tradeskills, class balance issues, etc.) but they don't want port stones or the bazaar.<br />
<br />
/boggle<br />
<br />
I never had fun /oocing in EC or GFay to sell off my items. I never enjoyed waiting for hours to find a group in a handful of dungeons. I hated having a very limited selection of gear to chose from and competing with every other Shaman on the server for it.<br />
<br />
I like what Penny said. Going back would be like giving up electricity or something. I feel that EverQuest is a much better game now than it ever was at release. Everything is a lot more sane.<br />

<br />
That way, I can stare at a stupid spellbook for 35 levels, which take 6 months to get through!. <br />
<br />
Even better, I can walk into L Guk and see 100 people, but can walk from the dead side zoneline to the Ghoul Lord spawn, then to the Froglok King spawn, and then over to the live side zoneline - without EVER seeing a mob that isn't already engaged by other players. <br />
<br />
Trying to find something to kill pre-Kunark drove me off live servers to the low-population test server. You couldn't pay me enough to play that game again.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Onte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I was thinking this weekend about how cool the nexus pads seemed when Luclin was released and about how thrilled I was about them.  Then PoP books....there's not a day that goes by that I do not thank SoE, in my own quiet little way, for putting those freakin' things in and eliminating 90% of all travel time-sinks.  I've got no desire to return to pre-PoP or pre-Luclin, for that matter and have to spend most of my time ingame, running.  I've got no desire to plan out trips in EQ like roadtrips IRL.  I did that, I experienced the &quot;old rules&quot; and I've got no desire to experience that again.  I bet the newer players would benefit greatly from having to run around without the aid of the books, but I frankly don't wish the hell that is boats or 90 minute runs upon anyone.    <br />
<br />
Realizing PoP isn't all about faster travel, but I wouldn't turn my back on the expansion for the books, alone.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">OK, new question for those over 30 -<br />
<br />
Would you go back to your high school/college days if you could?<br />
<br />
Well, no, I wouldn't.  Those were some of the best times of my life, but then again those friends aren't there any more, I've gotten older and don't relate to the kids there well any more, I'm not really interested in living on peanut butter and instant soup the last week of every month because the money is gone, etc etc.<br />
<br />
Sure, many of us enjoyed the pre-Kunark (or Pre-Velious or Pre-Luclin or Pre-POP) game, but the community has evolved past that point.  Just rolling the ruleset back isn't going to change that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Old world server where the only high end content is naggy vox pof poh and poa.  Anyone who picks this option wasn't level 50 for 5 months before kunark came out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">If you want to go back, you can.  Uninstall EQ, make sure you deleta all of the files, and reinstall from your original EQ disk.  If you haven't been playing long enough to have a separate EQ CD, ask around, I'm sure someone in your area has one.<br />
<br />
I really don't think a new server needs to be set aside for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Thaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Cap it at Velious and I'm so there.<br />
<br />
Velious was by far the best expansion to date. While it may not have been the smoothest, it was certainly the best. Great story, great zones (well, dungeons kinda sucked, but you know...), just great everything (except for the mentality that adding more HP to mobs makes them more difficult, /boggle).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Would you go back to your high school/college days if you could?<br />
Hell yes!  I had a blast in HS and then university  and if I knew then what I know now, I'd have had even more fun.  Granted, I like my life better now, but I miss some of my old stupidity and look back fondly on the fun I used to have.</div></div><hr />

I do like the idea sorta cause the game was 10 times deeper even if it was a pain int he ass to ride a boat, but in the end with LDoN and PoK, i dont think id want to. Now what would be great is if they implemented things into the old world content form the new world. Or you know what i always thought would be great, makeing the boat rides fun, like give you a reason to take a boat right, give us drinks at the bars and merchants and a PvP area where when you die your ported up deck with full mana and health, make it fun, cause as much as a pain the boat was, it was also part of what made EQ so in depth. Right now EQ is VERY shallow and geared to a type of people that didnt start EQ, but more geared to a market type so that it can perpetuate itself. Thats truly sad cause if you think about it, the type of people that first started EQ are the type of people that will log in for years and years like its a good ol book they love or will create a long standing life with weddings and long term goals instead of the PoP/Power gaming crowd that HAS to get better loot and HAS to get that next mob or they are leaving and will bitch and whine to high heaven if they dont get it.<br />
<br />
So as a shaman with my Q and horse and spiritstone and PA oh and can5 i wouldnt, but its a good idea and with another toon as my main love, i just might.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">The *only* thing I miss is the 'hugeness' of the world.  The sense that travelling across a continent was actually a considerable journey.  You spent more time in one area, simply because it took so freakin long to get anywhere. If you took the time to hunt in an isolated area, you were truly isolated.  Which was great if you liked to solo, and didn't die :)  Sucks if you require a grp or need a rez.<br />
<br />
BUT - I would never go back to that.  As small as the world is today, I'm happy that I can reach most anywhere I need to go in a few minutes (except Luclin).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>bakkal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I think people love to remember the good old days of EQ. How great it was.. How all these &quot;newbies&quot; have ruined the game.  Sort of an elite club of &quot;Look how old my character is&quot; acting as a wise old veteran.  The fact is that EQ did what no other game was able to accomplish.  I'll be proven wrong I'm sure, but EQ was the first online graphic based game where you could log into a world and interact with everyone (not just deathmatch scenarios) and do your own thing all day long without seeing another person and have lots to do.  Love it or hate it, Everquest is the most groundbreaking and arguable the best video game ever made.  Don't start with the &quot;I loved Monkey Island 1...&quot; So did I. I was all over that stuff. But after 3-4 years, I'm still here and wondering what craziness I'll get into on EQ tonight.  Monkey Island was bagged after a couple of weeks.  I love games just as much as the first person, but there will NEVER be the nostalgia induced glory that the game began as.  You could make a server just like posted above all the way back to &quot;day 1 EQ&quot; and people would hate it.  They would know about the progress the game has made, the upgrades to be had, how much easier and better it would be.  <br />
<br />
After spending WEEKS camping a Jade Mace in Karnors it was one of the greatest feelings of my gaming history to have it land in my hands as I strutted around with my &quot;uber weapon&quot;, yet now if the server started again it just wouldn't be the same, and I wouldn't be any part of it.<br />
<br />
I enjoyed the game for what it was back then, I enjoy the game for what it is now.  It's an evolving game that has been targetted towards the gaming community.  You may have POP, but some people absolutely love it (myself included) <br />
<br />
Nostalgia is just that.. Don't overglorify how great things would be today &quot;If only....&quot;  They were great because of the newness the game brought to a non existant genre, not because starting over in the same scenario today would bring up those same feelings, because they wouldn't.</div></div><hr />

I hate to be the one to prove you wrong, assuming I’m correct, but I believe that UO came out before EQ.  But your point is still well taken.  I played UO for a year and a half before coming to EQ and I must agree that those first months in a new world are always the most fun.  Everything is new and the world is filled with possibilities.  That’s one reason I’ll most likely be placing my characters in mothballs for an indefinite period of time when Horizons comes out.  I’m looking forward to a new world, and new adventures to discover.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Much of what was great about eq, was that it was NEW.  Everything was an adventure, everything a challenge.  It simply doesn't matter what rule set you play, the fact is, you already KNOW whats out there.  Kinda spoils the sense of adventure.<br />
Until recently (not sure about right now), even the boxed editions had the everquest expansions on seperate cd's.  You could (can?) install any/all of them you want.  Yes, you can go back.  You'll just hate yourself for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Namurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">You really can't just voluntarily 'go back'.  If I bought a horse and rode it around town, I'd get quite a bit of attention, possibly some projectiles thrown at me, and I have a feeling the police might want a word with me as well.  I'd be on a horse, but it would still be 2003, not 1803.  When SOE finally implements a /testbuff 65 command (I'm guessing Summer '04), will it not affect the game because you can still level up the old way?<br />
<br />
I don't see how my above post was sarcastic.. the only thing that might be considered as such is that I feigned sincerity when agreeing with another poster's sarcastic 'recollection' of the good old days.  Really thought it was more humorous than sarcastic...  Aside from that I simply made a couple of observations, certainly didn't mean to offend anyone and don't see how I could have.  Perhaps you're just upset with me for posting a poll which shows that more than a handful of people dislike the direction EQ has gone in?<br />
<br />
At any rate.. I do enjoy reminiscing on the good old days.  I enjoyed them very much, and just like high school and college, I know full well that I can't go back, and I'm ok with that.  I agree that new content is necessary to avoid stagnation.  I just don't like the new content that we've gotten, starting with PoP, for a multitude of reasons.  The only good change since Luclin, IMO, was the KEI fix.. although I feel it was too little, too late.  With temperance, the hp-buff side of the fix is barely a bandaid.</div></div><hr />

I played that game for a little bit but didn't enjoy it.   All the same arguments could be made for UO too I'm sure as some are hardcore into that game and likely still play it like crazy.<br />
<br />
If WOW or EQ2 comes out and blows us away, we'll have a new era to say &quot;Wow! Look how great this is!&quot;  I personally can't wait.. Is a fun time to be a gamer.</div></div><hr />

But this is just my personal opinion.  If you wish to play on an old rules server and you think the idea would be sufficiently popular I wish you luck getting SOE to implement it.  <br />
<br />
IIRC EQ 2 will be EQ with just the old world content - perphaps you will prefer that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I don't think its entirely nostalgia, somethings could clearly stay the same ie the med book at 35 is just stupid anyway. Its the experience of being part of a crowd of people at the low level. I can't describe it but when I started over on Kane Bayle I think it was, it was fun and nothing around nostalgia. There are so many zones, many underutilized and now obsolete I can see the idea the poster has in mind. If exp was perhaps toned up a bit and expansions were unlocked over time it could work. I am not arguing for such a server, I am arguing for open mindedness and simply from my perspective nostalgia is not at all the only incentive. <br />
<br />
In my post &quot;the ideal patch&quot; one of the things I mention is a low level themed zone. By suggestion of this,  this adds an additional mechanism. All the fun is not all simply at the high end of the game, or does not have to be. Its just that its such a big time investment to start again that so many totally prefer not to.</div></div><hr />

I pretty much agree.  I do think the ease of travel and easier leveling have reduced people's appreciation of EQ's content but I can deal.  I like the ease of travel and have no problems with slightly easier leveling.<br />
<br />
I would like to see them balance/reduce/eliminate some of the bonus xp mods in some zones...just to get people out of the same old boring arsed zones...but otherwise I like that state of the game.<br />
<br />
I first played EQ from release to just before Kunark and left because I was totally burned out on being 50 for months, travelling forever just to find nothing to do, raids that took forever to setup and even longer to execute and all the bitching involved, the frequent deaths and xp rebuilding from said encounters, and such.<br />
<br />
I'm on my 2nd round of EQ now and I like almost all of the evolution of EQ.  The only thing that really bums me out is that there's so much content that people are spread out so much that it's often hard to get a group unless you're in the few popular places.<br />
<br />
EQ was great fun in the ancient times...but it's still great fun now and there are so many great additions and changes that I've come to enjoy that I wouldn't want to give em up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Ungerargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">What I'd be more interested would be a &quot;Storylines&quot; server, or something of the sort, that started off with basic EQ, 3 months later released Kunark and LoY, 3 months after that released Velious, 3 months after that released Luclin and LDoN, and at the one year mark released PoP.  Such a server would have much more of a homegrown feel, more of a sense of purpose.  <br />
<br />
Granted, there's not a helluva lot to do until Kunark gets released, but, with only old world, it could feasibly take close to 3 months to level to 50, heh.  Perhaps in that order people would actually go to LoY, as it's superior to Kunark in many ways.  The &quot;epic goldrush&quot; would be horrendous when Kunark was released, I suppose, but overall I think this would be a nice way to encapsulate the history of EQ, a microcosm of 4.5 years and 50 servers over the course of 1 year on (at least) 1 server.</div></div><hr />
