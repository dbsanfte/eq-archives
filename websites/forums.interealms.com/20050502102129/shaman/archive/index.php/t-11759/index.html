<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ShakoBoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After about 90 some odd days played I finally dinged 60 today :D<br />
( It's not lvl 65, but I never expected to make 60 in the first place :P )<br />
<br />
And the best part about is I found Torpor for sale in the Bazaar on the same day for 35k.  I just had enough to buy it and I'm flat broke now, but it was worth it :D<br />
<br />
Now its time to work on getting Malo and my Canni5 AA skill :)<br />
<br />
Also, thanks to all the posters here for a lot of really nice information.  I konw that if I hadn't of came here and read like I did my playing style would probably be much different.  Thanks again for all the good tips though.</div></div><hr />
