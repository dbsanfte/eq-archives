I find it funny how clueless most wizards are about the way DoTs work :\ I'm glad they dropped the mana cost of Curse of Moiri, maybe they'll look at the other DoTs also. Really, they need to do 4 things to fix DoT spells in the current game:<br />
<br />
1) make DoTs use mana on a per tick basis, or implement content where they last full duration.<br />
2) Increase Resist Adjustments, or allow partial per tick resists.<br />
3) Bring back the efficiency margain that has diminished each expansion.<br />
4) Fix agro so each tick of damage is equal to if it were a nuke doing that quantity. Remove counter agro altogether.<br />
<br />
On a side note, If I ever get around to it, I'll do some parsing with my warrior friend to see exactly how much agro we're talking. I plan on picking a mob with absurdly high hit points (a rubble rouser should work) and giving him a head start in agro of a minute or so, then going all out in DoT DPS and seeing how much damage I've done by the time I get summoned, then compare it to the DPS of the warrior and factor in hate procs to get a ballpark figure of the agro I'm slinging.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">that will be an interesting parse, I know how easy it is to steal agro from the guilds best warrior with dots after hes had a few minutes lead on me, (translation the mob is at 50% when I start piling them on) I wont be surprised at all to find you tanking with less than 50% of the warriors hate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I too am curious to see how DoT aggro plays out.  Please pay specific mind to Poison DoT's in particular.  These seem to be the ones that cause the most &quot;out of proportion&quot; aggro.<br />
<br />
I know I can throw Ultor, Pox &amp; Plague on a mob at 90%+ health and my pet can hold aggro . . . but a single Poison DoT at 50% gets me aggro for the rest of the mobs life.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would be interested to see someone calculate the added aggro (or non-existence of added aggro) that a dot crit tick will generate.   Because I think crit ticks generate a lot more aggro than a regular tick.</div></div><hr />

That should be pretty enlightening.  We all know how badly DoT agro is dorked, but quantifying it somewhat through the test you described will be fascinating.  Keep us informed, please.  I'd love to hear the results.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tenien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">In case anyone is wondering, I figured up the damage BoU, BoS and Bane would have to do to have the equivalent efficiency over Strike of Solusek that Envenomed Bolt did over Ice Comet at 49 (I was bored).<br />
<br />
Bane 2650 dmg/490 mana<br />
Blood of Saryn 2890 dmg/535 mana<br />
Breath of Ultor 3405 dmg/550 mana</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">not that it matters, but what efficiency would BoU need to have to match the efficiency plague had over ice comet? heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">after seeing that thread i have come to the conclusion that wizards are retarded, contantly nuking has shortened thier brain power.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zaniza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Another way to calculate aggro is to use an SK with his fixed Aggro spell and cast it like 10 times.. then see how much it would take to pull the creature off him.<br />
<br />
Sounds good on paper, but I have yet to try it out.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>haruuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">all i'd like to see with dots is reduced aggro for dots, and for shammies, a resist mod similar to the one necros get so we don't *have* to malos first to be able to dot. (allowing us to use Bane, Anathema, etc in short duration fights effectively)<br />
<br />
i don't want more dps than a wizard. their entire purpose is dps, with the added bonus of TL ability.<br />
<br />
necros should shut up about dot vs nukes, as well...wizzies don't have pets, or dire charm pets, they can't fd, they can't lifetap, and their mana regen is far less efficient than that of a necro. <br />
<br />
<br />
ridiculous. people will whine about everything. <br />
<br />
<br />
i half expect to find one day that clerics are complaining that they can't match rogue melee dps.<br />
<br />
pfft.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Necro mana regen isn't *that* much more than a wizards. When you consider both will benefit from:<br />
<br />
1) Horse<br />
2) Bard Song<br />
3) SD<br />
4) Pot9<br />
5) Access to mana clickies like emp cloak/quarm shawl<br />
6) FT15<br />
<br />
A wizard also has Flappy, and enhanced flappy AAs which close the gap on top of the above. Not to mention the wizard can have KEI (doesn't stack with lich).<br />
<br />
Just like our mana regen has decreased in proportion due to the above, a necro suffers from the same dilemma. Compound the addition of short fights, the need to feign after every Blood of Thule, and the fact that a necro has to stack several DoTs of several resists for optimal damage, where a wizard can just pick a spell and chain it, and... well, you get the drift.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Grizlor, iinm, Necro Lich line at 65 trumps KEI + Harvest for a Wizard by a WIDE margin.  Somebody posted on another thread that the final Mana Regen for a Necro was something god-awful like 60 + a TIC.<br />
<br />
Suffice to say, both have incredible MR without the constant pounding of a key.<br />
<br />
Oh and Wizzies get snare as well. (Atols?) We used to use them as snarers in Sebilis when no Druids, Necros or Rangers were around.<br />
<br />
Now when I join HoH GY Kiting groups or PoV outer cave kiting groups, the Necros never get aggro. Not sure how many DOTs they are piling on, but (thankfully), Snare + Flame Lick REALLY makes a MOB mad.<br />
<br />
Oh and Necro DPS is ungodly. Had 3 in my group once in HoH.  MOBs would take * ONE * trip around the tree then fall over dead. We couldn't pull fast enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Just for clarification. Necro mana difference from the baseline is +50/tick currently. Wizards is;<br />
+18 from VoQ,<br />
+8 from allegiant familiar,<br />
+8 from the two harvests,<br />
Giving a +16 mana per tick advantage to the necro, which is certainly nice, but not if it's fed through spells with bad ratio's (necro nukes, incomplete DoT's). You'll also find that very few necro's use horses because they can't agro dump with them, so if horses are allowed the wizard possibly has more mana regen.<br />
<br />
Faern - In a proper raid 60 mana a tick is pretty much standard for everyone. Necro's get aggro all the time, necro poison DoT's are just as bad as shaman poison DoT's, but both wizards and necro's (unlike shaman) have an agro dump.<br />
<br />
But yes, necro's rock in a kite group. I've kited HoH with 4 raid geared necro's and the mobs just melted, was cool fun.</div></div><hr />
