<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I went to Plane of Air yesterday, and lots of quest pieces for other classes dropped, but i really want the Fairy-Hide Mantle. We made it to the 3rd island when i had to go(they got to 4th, and i think they stopped there) and we will be there for most t\of this week. So how rare are the pieces? And where do they drop(which lsland?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The rarest piece is the mantle part which drops off the Spiroc Lord on Island 5. He drops one quest item at a time and there are 13 classes....<br />
<br />
I've killed the Spiroc Lord at least 20 times (probably more) seen one mantle drop.  The good thing is, he can be spawned over and over (many guilds do this to farm spiroc wing blades for the warrior epic) so there's a chance you might see your drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fenril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">We killed the spiroc lords many many many times for our warriors (my guild did 5 or 6 FA War).<br />
<br />
Last time we even had to chain kill him more than 12 times for a blade drop.<br />
<br />
Maybe are we just unlucky, but till now, we got only 1 mantle :( and a crapload of bard/ranger/monk items from him :\.</div></div><hr />
