<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Batuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">When channels were first introduced I was excited about the ability to share information and meet other Shamans on other servers.  It was great in the beginning but it has deteriorated greatly over the past several months.  Instead of swapping ideas on strategies and equipment, we are spammed with mindless quotes from a small handful of immature people.  I'm all for some jokes and fun, but getting spammed nonstop by &quot;ur ghey&quot;, &quot; go f yourself&quot;, and &quot;Staff of Eternal Flames&quot; just doesn't do it for me.<br />
<br />
I'm not here to insult them because that would bring me down to their level.  However, I would like to ask those acting inappropriately to have some respect for others.  I feel like in my old bazaar zone (EC) where there was arguing and L33+ speak all over the auction channel.  It takes a ton of aggravation for someone to make me add their name to the ignore list.  I learned tonight that you can ignore individuals by including their server name before their name.  For example, to ignore Lenine on Karana you would type:  /ignore karana.lenine or for Redspeed on Stormhammer you would type /ignore stormhammer.redspeed.<br />
<br />
I think there is great potential for this channel.  It is sad that a few idiots contribute to 75% of the text that is absolutely worthless.  I've added these fools to my ignore list but that is not a solution--it is just a Band-Aid.  Solutions could involve making a couple channels or actually booting the goofs out of the channel.<br />
<br />
I'd just like to see more maturity and less jackass.  Is that too much to ask?  Does anyone else feel this way?</div></div><hr />

<br />
With EQ, the statistics are skewed, since the average is usually quite low.<br />
<br />
What can you do? Well, there really isn't anything you can do. Free speech comes with a price, you just have to deal with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes, unfortunately, I have joined crucible only a handful of times and promptly left.  <br />

Even though its called serverwide crucible, it has nothing to do with the crucible messageboards.</div></div><hr />

It can even be fun! Plus, it helps make buff time a little more bearable.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Slaorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I agree. In the beginning it was usefull, but now it's a pop in, ask your question,  get your answer, get out quick channel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cantiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You guys actually join that channel? I joined it the night I heard about it, was in it about 10 minutes and felt like I was watching Jerry Springer or something. The amount of mindless morons so overwhelmed me I had to log and take a shower. If ya want my advice, create your channel and invite the shaman who you feel best challenge, inform, understand and help you. Then once you get a few then have them start inviting a few. After a while you may have a decent channel with other like minded individuals. Just a thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I joined it maybe 10 times when it was first created then never joined it again.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Blackdust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I couldn't agree with you more on this. When serverwide channels first came out I was excited about the shaman channel and joined it every day. After awhile though I found that it was only the very immature and inexperienced players that said anything on this channel and I stopped joining it. Its been months since I've joined this channel and I doubt I ever will again. Kinda sad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I have it on autojoin, it got a lot more peaceful after I ignored about 10 people.  Most of us are pretty busy in game, I usually just let the text fly by unless I see a question I can answer.  I look at this post and I see people who would be valuable and witty contributors that no longer join, a real pity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Genine Goosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I have joined it a few times and asked questions and usually get smart ass remarks. Either calling me a druman or something like that.  Don't even bother anymore.<br />

In defense of Redspeed, he is a great guy! I have known him for awhile and he would give you the shirt off his back. When he heard that I failed my Rak fight he was there offering to MQ a tear for me and has been very helpful with any questions that I have asked him. I was able to get another tear myself and didn't need his, but I thought it was very nice of him to offer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Koraden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">You all realise that everyone who just said &quot;I only pop in there to ask a question and then leave&quot;, contributes to the channel being what it is. <br />
<br />
If even a small percentage of the posters here stayed in the channel, ignored the idiots, and tried to participate in conversations, answer questions, and ask questions, whatever, then the channel would be on the way to being an ingame version of these boards. &lt;- A Good Thing (TM)</div></div><hr />

I myself only ignore people when they really get to me, or are just jerks.  I can deal with spam, and it actually keeps me entertained until the 50th posting of staff of eternal flames, but ah well.

If I'm playing a melee the spam is too much anyway, you haven't seen text fly until you play a Monk with max haste. :) I loved the old ui and the ability to put that text elsewhere.<br />

make another chat box, right click, go to filters -&gt; chat channels (I think it says) and then all channels you are currently in will be listed.  You can filter chat channels to any window you want just like you can with melee information or spell casting, etc. <br />

This is the crux as to why I removed it from my autojoin....  I have to talk in guildchat, in groupchat and answer whomever is sending tells to me at any given time.  I found crucible chat pushed me over the edge.  Either I had to prioritize where I was concentrating or my stress level went WAY up.  <br />
<br />
I prefer to some to answer questions here, when I can do them at MY pace, rather than ingame, while a giant is trying to pound my bear butt.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I  can handle it, I usually find answers to my questions. You have to remember eq is played by a large audience and not just yourself. Part of the aspects of playing an online game. The people that play eq are anywhere in the age range of 13- to about say 46, so opinions are going to differ and what is acceptable to you, is maybe not to the next person. Ignore is your friend, it can reduce a lot of the spam.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Urnti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I have it on auto join and only really pay attention when I have downtime.  Other than that it gets ignored.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have a good brain for trivia. For instance, friend sends me tells in tears... her 8th shawl armour won't combine... you using the right mold? No, that's the banded armour mold, the plate mold is sold by the guy in the bazaar in the middle area, look for the human.<br />
<br />
The problem is I now get tells from cross servers asking me stuff like that, like last night I had to look up where to find white sand for the sonic wolf quest... :)<br />
<br />
Which I don't mind....<br />
<br />
Except when I'm in the middle of a raid that's going wrong and I've got ten things breathing down my neck. Then I ignore all else until things are better - I feel bad, but I have to unless I want to be more of a kitty smear than I am.<br />
<br />
But walking someone through how to make a valor ring while handling Doomshade is another matter :)<br />
<br />
As for the shaman channel, I left cause I got tired of &quot;but it has CHA!&quot; over and over. It was funny the first week. Now it's just boring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Fozy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I don't really join it because  I am usually to busy with pressing the cani button, buffing, doting, nuking and watching the health bars to do much else.   Not to mention reading group, tells and the channel my friends and I have.  If there is a shaman on vaz that asks me a question I am usually more than happy to answer it, unless its like d00d can u plz l3nd me som3 pp, k thx? lala ~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Well I haven't joined for a couple reasons.    First I have a nice network running so not only do I have 2 accounts - 2 PC's running but 3 others that are available for use within 5 feet of me.   <br />
<br />
HUGE PLUG for this site but it's normally my first choice on my off PC.    If I have a question on almost any Shaman issue ... it goes here first.   But I keep in mind that the channel is there for access if the need arises.<br />
<br />
So while server-wide channel may be a good tool for some - Crucible is my mainstay.  I don't know what I would have done if Crucible wasn't here as a outlet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I like the chat channel, but that might be cause of one of the below 50%.... Oh well, i try to answer any questions i can that i know, and i really only see a few people answering quetions. Also, you can talk too! If you have something to say, just say it, does it really look like we care about the people who don't talk? Well thats cause we don't know who that would be so it would be hard to meet your demands. If you have a question, ask it, if not, no one is holding you back to /leave, and you'd rather have no one talking at all most of the time compared to some people that actully use the channel to talk about other things when no one brings up anything shaman related to talk about, just speak up in the channel, and see how that works.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">In defense of Redspeed, he is a great guy!<br />
<br />
No, he isn't. I don't care what he does in game on a server, he turns the crucible channel into a toilet that, as has been demonstrated here, has useful people not logging into it. I usually have him on ignore.<br />
<br />
Oh and what's up with the PASSWORDS?<br />
<br />
Passworded channels linger (with the password) if nobody is in them. If there wasn't a password, then someone could log in (say, after a patch), create the channel fresh, and then change the password so that nobody else could get in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">/ignore seventh.tikoko<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Kagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">The high amount of useless spam is generally what keeps me out of the serverwide channel. I join it from time to time when really bored, but more often then not, I just don't join.<br />
<br />
One thing that would be interesting, at least for me would be something similar to what the monk community has done. They have a channel which the channel name/password is not handed out to the general public, and is geared more toward the high end/level community. Requirements for gaining access to the channel is be 60+. It sort of strays away a little from being a pure information source/place to get help for the younger shaman out there, but is probably a channel that I would find a lot more interesting to hang out in.<br />
<br />
Here is the thread the monks have about thier channel:<br />
http://pub147.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=34097.topic<br />
<br />
Having something similar set up for the shaman community would be interesting imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Zalaton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">I've joined crucible channel occaisonally. Sometimes it's interesting and I'll stick around, other times it's an ub3r contest and I'll leave.<br />
I do occaisonally pop in just for a question, but I try to make up for it by staying long enough to answer the next three random questions I know the answer to :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">I used to hang out there all the time, but I eventually got sick of all the stupid cha jokes and other dumb crap.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">It all comes down to this:<br />
How many original thoughts about playing a shaman can really be expected to come up during a day of playtime?<br />
Also, there seem to be a lot of people who talk there who must not be doing anything else.  Or perhaps they're naturally chatty.  The spam gets to be too much a lot of times and I turn it off.  I don't read it anyway a lot of the time unless I see my name or something.  The other day someone had to tell me I was sending %T slowed messages in crucible!  OMG so embarrassing but I was really busy at the time in BoT trying to stay alive.  <br />
<br />
It IS nice to see people from this board online tho, and I've gotten the chance to chat with several of you.  It's different than talking to a board, you can see something of what the people are really like.  /hug Gloriana</div></div><hr />

it's annoying but it's the prestige of the Crucible and the reputation of these boards that brings people to the channel<br />

I always have it on autojoin (mostly because I'm too used to typing /3 before the next channel on my list and I'd be lost in mistells if I didn't).  Ask questions, I'd say 95% of the questions I see asked when I'm online get answered.  It's not as bad as it sounds.  If you don't want to listen to certain people, then don't, but you can't expect 50-100 people to sit in a chat channel and not say a word all night except to answer &quot;what should I upgrade my gear with?&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">In the last couple of months there has been a huge increase both in spam and general idiotic remarks, as well as link spams and certain jokes repeated ad nauseam for weeks, months.  While I try to make the occasional non-sequitur and idiotic remark myself, the channel has gotten so out of control that I've had to put two or three people on ignore.  At least two of them are actually pretty nice people.  <br />
<br />
I suspect they might be two of the same people others have ignored. ;)<br />
<br />
Shame that some people just can't control themselves and have to grandstand or whatever, totally taking over the channel -- without even saying anything worth reading while they do.<br />
<br />
Hey, I NEED to read spell casting and resist messages and /tells and /groupsay and /guildsay.  Spamming, especially day after day, makes it so that people really have absolutely no choice but to /ignore you.  Even if they actually like you.  It's either ignore you or screw up their groups or raids by making REAL info too likely to get swallowed up in spam.<br />
<br />
I hope some people wise up.  It's not that some of the spammers are bad people(even if some are boring and repetitive) -- it's just that spamming forces you to be treated exactly like a jerk - with /ignore.  <br />
<br />
And you'll never have a chance to talk with that person or ask questions of them again.<br />
<br />
Sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">I've got it on autojoin.  I don't really expect any &quot;real&quot; conversation, I can just go to the boards for some.  Its too much to ask for a chat channel to have intelligent discussion when you really can't research or plan out the ideas you want to discuss in real time.  So I go there for the cha jokes and the l33t beta infoz! jk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Genine Goosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">You are a druman though :/ <br />
<br />
That's the kind of crap I am talking about. If you have never grouped with me or chatted with me I don't care what you think of me. When I ask for equipment advice then I will welcome your suggestions. I could go on and on about people playing for why/how they want, but it would a waste of time on you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Inqubus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">I have it on auto join, and have it filtered to a separate window out of the way.  When I'm raiding or just plain busy, I minimize the window so I don't have to watch the spam.  I try to answer any legitimate questions that pop up and enjoy seeing some of the higher end gear (although some of the linkages are getting old) that Shaman are finding in the higher tier zones than what our guild is on currently (Tier 3 PoP atm).  I don't expect outstanding convos there, but there have been quite some good discussions in there when certain people aren't in there, and that alone makes me keep it on autojoin, even though it gets ignored when I'm the only Shaman on a raid and have 10 billion buffs to take care of on top of everything else ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">good idea Inq.<br />
I think it's still a decent channel but the spam makes me turn it off during raids . . . which is most of the time lately since the guild got into VT and is UNCONTESTED at the moment.  The former VT inhabitants having pharmed their loot there and off working the elemental planes.   <br />
<br />
Hope I haven't made anyone's ignore list yet.  Erm, nobody important anyway :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>GeddarRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">Have it on /autojoin myself, leave it a lot though :( , mostly the people that go around talking about how uber they are, are the people who just now got into VT or NToV... seems the people that really should be there or are the ones that have seen end game and such don't bother with the channel.  Used to be a good channel imo but now its just spam cha jokes and elemental bp... how lame :(<br />
<br />
Then again, now and then there are great discussion's it's not ALL bad.. I did'nt know you could /ignore x-server.. thanks =p</div></div><hr />

Hrmm, i wonder if anyone has me ignored, I'm naturally chatty, so I've made a few spammish remarks in my day :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Phallax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">I use to join the channel and just watch talk alot never really talked much in it, i eventually just stopped joining cuz every twink and thier mother joined it...if you arent a shaman dont join the damn channel, we dont care how many hps your warriors has...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Heigelyac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">What's funny about that channel is that it's just FILLED with item link spam.  And then somehow, that same link shows up in /ooc or guildchat about 3 minutes later.  What i have found is that if I just watch guild chat, I get about 90% of the same information I get from the crucible channel.  At least in guild chat I can feel reasonably comfortable calling someone a doofus for spamming the links without sparking an hour long spamathon on  &quot;yer a doofus!  No, you are!  WTH is yer problem EBAY?  **** Fool i pwn you, I was in VT bangin yer mom when i got this &lt;broken item link&gt;. etc&quot;</div></div><hr />

:shrug:<br />
<br />
You complained people calling you a druman, well by the made up word druman thats what you are .<br />
<br />
<br />
I never said you couldn't play you want, but how does grouping or chatting you change that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Genine Goosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">well by the made up word druman thats what you are . <br />
<br />
I will try to guess what you are saying here since it's so unclear. Last time that I checked I was a shaman. Let's see, I slow the mob, buff my group, dot the mob, patch heal, root park adds, canni to 40 health too many times to count and if I remember correctly, that's a shaman. We all know what people mean when they use the word &quot;Druman&quot;. <br />
<br />
Do you have any idea how freaking boring EQ would be if everybody wore the same gear? There would be no need for people to brag about their gear because everybody would have it. Because I chose to play casually I am not better or worse than any other shaman who plays their character right. Because I end up being main healer in my groups A LOT I chose to have higher wisdom than some shaman. <br />
<br />
Why don't you look around at the MAJORITY of shaman. There are a lot of magelos on here that look almost identical to mine and if I am a druman because i have 199 wisdom, I guess 90% of all shaman are then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">People can play their character however they want.  A &quot;druman&quot; is one branch of shaman.  Why take that as an insult?  I understand that some people mean it as an an insult, but does their opinion of you really matter?  Concerning yourself with the opinion of a jackass that makes fun of your playstyle doesn't seem terribly productive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Jonat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">the channel has so much potential because there are alot of shaman like glorianna and arriana that are very helpful but its just not worth it to join when all you see are &quot;**** druman&quot; , &quot;**** uber&quot;, &quot; l33t &quot; or &quot;in teh face&quot; can only take em so much before it gets real annoying. i have asked and have seen alot of good questions asked that are ignored while people just spam and argue of stupid things. it sucks but thats just the way it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Mazirus Slaymaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">aye id rather not have to see ppl in channel that act like some of the kids at school.. ya know, the ones you just want to beat up due to their never closing mouth of annoying jokes/useless info<br />
<br />
rare use is ok, but frequent.. no<br />

such as its ok to say arriana is a n00b just this once :P</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">199 wisdom is farking crazy.<br />
<br />
<br />
A shaman wisdom should be around 99  - 198 or so</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">Actually, with the really nice gear available these days, I don't think it would be that difficult for a level 50+ shaman to have 200+ wisdom while balancing decent AC/mana/hitpoints.<br />
<br />
Decent gear when I was in my 50s compared to current readily available gear:<br />
<br />
* Mammoth cloak --&gt; heiro cloak<br />
* SBS --&gt; Skull Marked Shield<br />
* Chryso Talisman --&gt; tracking wolf collar, slime necklace, clattering bone, etc.<br />
* Jarsath legs --&gt; barbed rubicite leggings, player made cultural leggings, dragonhide from WW<br />
* runed mith bracer --&gt; barbed rubicite leggings, player made cultural leggings, dragonhide from WW<br />
* forest loops --&gt; silver hammered, earring of the solstice<br />
* slime coated harpoon in range --&gt; talisman of ben., divine inspiration<br />
<br />
etc. etc.<br />
<br />
For mid level shaman today, a high wisdom does not necessarily mean skimping in other areas.</div></div><hr />

There are cool things said in serverwide.crucible, unfortunatly I also think it is going downhill. Its sad that the shamans with interesting things to say are scared away by a minority of idiots.<br />

Maybe we should start a new one. <br />
