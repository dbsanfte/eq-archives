<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So what does Spell Casting Mastery actually do?  I've heard conflicting reports.  1) It gives you a higher chance to trigger your specialization and therefore save you 50% mana on that cast, but only on whatever you specialized in.  2) It saves you mana on every spell like Mana Preservation.<br />
<br />
Is there a definitive source for this answer?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The mana you save is a set so it dont vary.<br />
<br />
The skill you have specialized in you save like 10% each cast and the rest of the skills you save like 5% , those are not exact numbers but there about I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sony describe the effect as (1) in your post - a chance to trigger your specialisation. Every single test I've ever seen show that this is not the case and that it is a fixed amount much like MP. As Sony are unlikely to post any test results (now there's a thought for a feedback :p), I'm going to have to stick with what I've seen and go with the MP effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Check the library of www.graffe.com/forums for some detailed information about this topic (that i am too lazy to look up myself at the moment :D ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chifari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">MP is not fixed but random.  Can verify that from posts on Graffe's or do your own test (I did, just to be sure, and, yes, it is in fact random).  10% mana pres item = random 1 to 10, or average 5.5%.<br />
<br />
SCM3, however, is not random, but gives a fixed savings on each spell. <br />
<br />
chif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">what really matters is that the difference is noticable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Sorry, had a brain fart when I was writing that, re-editied some of a sentence and didn't re-read. /spanks self with branches and dresses in sack cloth<br />
<br />
Chif is right, MP is not  fixed. What I meant to say was that SCM works in the same way as MP, ie you get a saving on every spell not just the ones on your specialisation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">SCM work same way as  MP 4 and stackable, both 10% random(with average 5-6%)<br />
<br />
SCRM work same way as extend enchantment 4 and stackable, with fixed %<br />
<br />
also, SCM work same % on every spell, not just your specialized spell. overall you can stack SCM aa + specialized skill + MP item for saving mana</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Specialisation and SCM both give you a guaranteed, direct reduction in the mana cost of the spell being cast. The SCM bonus applies equally to all spells.<br />
<br />
Specialize skill 50: ~3% mana cost reduction.<br />
Specialize skill 200: ~11% mana cost reduction.<br />
Spellcasting Mastery III: A further ~10% mana cost reduction<br />
<br />
I think the confusion over specialisations is that sometimes people add these up, so overall on non spec spells you get 12.5% savings, and on spec skills you get a total of ~20% savings. The contribution from SCM is the same for both though.<br />
<br />
The tricky thing is deciding how important 10% mana reduction is when compared to all the other AA. I find mana regen/pool isn't a huge issue in most fights with Canni V and normally at least one of kei/Pot9/SP/Wind of Marr but its normally possible to find something to do with more mana if I have it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Goldark is right. Specialization is a constant mana savings on all spells based on the level of the skill. Spell casting mastery is an addition 10% mana savings on all spells cast.<br />
<br />
Mana pres focus items are a random 1 to x% mana saved on every cast. <br />
<br />
Both can be pretty easily confirmed now a days with the % bars for mana. Casting a large mana spell it's possible to see the the difference in cost especially if you decrease your mana pool size. For example in my normal gear a PoP imbue spell is anywhere from 10-13% of my mana pool. Take off my mp item and it's varries by 1% at most. Affliction efficiency is an even easier way to see this since it's a 25% mana pres or 30% for bracer of darkness.</div></div><hr />
