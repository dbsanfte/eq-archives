<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Foggy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is it me or can it not be filtered off anywhere? It currently seems to go to the same place as the standard spell messages window.  Whilst the new feature is cool (is nice to see the damage I am doing) it is spamming my spells window so I am having to scroll back miles to check stuff in there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can turn it on/off it in Options, Filters. The same place where you filter all the melee hits, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tulurean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yea, you can only turn it off. If you move it you move all your spell messages. I /bugged it about every 15 minutes today. Running a necro with 6 Dots running can be a pain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It was cool for the first....oh 2 minutes. Then I turned it off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Foggy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Dont want to turn it off - just want to be able to filter it to its own window that is 2 lines high and invis :)  Basically the same way melee's tend to filter off their Hits window. I use EQ Companion so it is really nice being able to finally parse my damage and see what I am doing!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I love it.  Lots of times when soloing I'm busy when the DOT wears off.  Once I regain control I'm always like &quot;did I remember to refresh Bane?&quot;... usually I DID remember but it's nice to be able to look at the damage output and see.<br />
<br />
I agree that it should be part of the window filters, though.  I'd rather have it go to my Battle Spam window.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I love it.  I have a very large window devoted entirely to spell and melee spam, and it goes there, so it doesn't bother me at all.  It makes it really easy to know when you are going to have to refresh blood of saryrn, and you can time it so the new dot lands just as the old one wears off, and get maximum DPS.  Also helps because sometimes I get sloppy and can't remember if I remembered to refresh a dot, and this helps me remember.  Especially handy when you are soloing more than 1 mob at once and cant remember if you refreshed dots on both of them or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I can remember if I have Bane/Pox on something, but what I can see using it for is knowing when the epic's going to wear off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it's at 159, time to click.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well, I used to have my spell info filtered in to my &quot;main&quot; window. I like seeing the dot information - but I'd prefer to have dots in a separate window, but the &quot;You begin to cast &quot; and the resists/yawns messages in my main window, and this can't be done as it stands.<br />
<br />
Just a minor niggle, really. I mean, I could always turn off the dot information and I'd be no worse off than before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Indeed Kianor - I think they need to add the option to filter spell effects (&quot;an orc pawn yawns&quot;) to a different window to the spell damage (&quot;Your uber_dot_01 spell hit an orc pawn for 3 points&quot;).<br />
<br />
I feedbacked this yesterday, can't hurt if everyone does it :)<br />
<br />
What would also be nice would be a &quot;hitsmode&quot; option for the dot damage, so we could see something like &quot;DoT orc pawn for 214&quot; rather than the very verbose message we get now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'm sure it's just an oversight, you can steer the new &quot;non-combat&quot; spell damage messages to another window.  My guess is the DOT messages were supposed to go with them and didn't make it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Oukast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Anyone know if this works, and works correctly for pvp???</div></div><hr />
