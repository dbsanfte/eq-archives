<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tyrika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I am also a level 41 shaman and group with my fiance, a level 41 rogue every night. So far we have not had trouble getting into groups as a pair but we are getting a little tired of dreadlands/overthere and were also wanting to look into hunting spots for this level. We play on Prexus and these seem like the only zones that people group in on a regular basis.</div></div><hr />
