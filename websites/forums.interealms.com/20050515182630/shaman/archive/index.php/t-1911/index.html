<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">im looking ot make a lil cash , the fist thing i thought of was a SOW potion , i mean what warrior doesnt want that? ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
my question is . Do they sell well ? if not is there anything that sells well ? i want a nice spear and spells for 39th level . im a lil low on cash for all that ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">yes, they sell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Absolutely, if you keep at it and go to the right zones.<br />
<br />
I've had the best luck in FV, DL, Thurg, and GD.<br />
<br />
Don't plan on selling 100 a day or anything.  I don't just sit and auction, but I auction a few times every time I'm in one of those zones, and I stay in those zones pretty often.  I can sell 1-2 sow potions an hour typically.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">how much do you typicaly get for them ?<br />
<br />
i saw someone auctioning them for 100pp , that seemed a lil pricey for 40 min for speed. i guess on a long travel it wouldnt be. but generaly speaking it seems pricey</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">100 pp is generally for a 10-potion stack- and at least on Karana, that's the going rate.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">1) Yes, SoW potions really sell.  They sell better than any other potion...that doesn't mean they sell *great*....but yes you can sell them.<br />
<br />
2) You won't make money at it.  SoW potions Trivial at 37.  At that point you will fail about 35% of the time.  It takes you 15 combines to get one 10dose potion...at 6pp each thats 90pp in materials for a 100pp potion...WHOO!  I made 10plat! I am teh rich shAmAN!!1<br />
<br />
3) To get where you can make Sow Potions reliably get your skill up to 70 - this will take several thousand plat.  Probably about 5k or so.  Then you will have a 95% success rate and you can start making 40 - 50 plat on each potion.<br />
<br />
4) Sow Potions are 100pp for a 10 dose.  Thats the price.  Don't try to 'undercut' the other shamans by selling for 90 - all you're doing is ruining the economy.  However, it is customary to offer a discount for people buying several at once.  Plus the average rate for guildies or good friends is about 75plat.  <br />
<br />
If you want to get repeat customers, throw a 'bonus potion' their way...I sold 4 shrink and 4 SoW potions to a repeat customer...I gave him a slight discount and threw in a 5 dose Damage Shield Potion. Hopefully he will get 'addicted' to the DS potions and start buying them.. (15pt dmg shield for about 15mins).  I also give out 5dose cure poison or cure disease to people that can't cast those spells if they buy a few potions from me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>jannia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Keep your ears open for raids forming. You'll find people there wanting to buy SoW potions at these meeting spots all the time.

<br />
With the new server wide trade channel, I quite often get tells saying &quot;I'll take a potion&quot; but then discover the potential buyer is half way across the planet.<br />
<br />
So I plan on getting together with a wizard friend one evening, and advertising &quot;potions made to order and delivered&quot;. And then at the end of the night, we can split the loot.<br />
<br />
As we will be delivering, I plan on not offering bulk discounts, which I think is fair, but we'll have to see what the market thinks :)</div></div><hr />

Thanks Radag - here is the big version I use on other message boards.  I think this picture was taken in Siberia.<br />
<br />
Two things I like about it - The bear looks massive, and 'wise'.  Sounds a bit goofy, I know.  The other is the wide open background.  He's out there alone, nobody for miles...just sorta reminds me of my playstyle - soloing in empty zones, depending on just me and my pet. :)<br />

If that's what you want to do, but for me personally, I don't really like playing &quot;gopher boy&quot;.<br />
<br />
Why not just pretend alchemy is the devil and never touch it? :)<br />
<br />
Kinda what I had in mind.  Save money and headaches.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>bearknukl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Only way to make a profit from SoW potions is to undercut other shaman.  Saying &quot;Selling sow potions&quot; will take you long periods of time to sell one, add the word &quot;Cheap to the end of that statement, and you get spammed tells how much.  Thats when you try to start selling bulk to minimize the time. &quot;Well it depends on how many you buy, I mean if you buy 1 it'll cost you 95pp, but if you buy 8 you get 2 free, or work out how the deal from there.&quot;  They will most likely go for 1 for 95, so your not cutting much out, but you get a chance to sell a fast bulk amount.  The loss in profit is made up for by the time spent selling, and thats the time that really counts.  Does it seem shady? yes, Is it somewhat like the old bait and switch gag only sugar coated? yes.  Is it damaging to the market? only if alot of people do it and it lowers the cost of Sow potions even further.  Is it profitable? more so than selling them at market price will be.  But hey EQ is a free market economy.<br />
<br />
I've only done this on rare occasion, when i'm 2k short for an item i need for myself or a friend and I want to make fast money.  and usually in freeport where the market is always skewed anyway.  But for the most part i don't sell because its boring, mind numbing, spirit crushing work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Bah, don't undercut us on our ONE item that we can make and sell for profit. It's just not right.<br />
<br />
This is the ONE SINGLE item that those of us with sufficient skill can make money off of, a lot in fact. At skill 125 I have to be very unlucky to actually fail on a sow potion more than once every 20 or 30 tries.<br />
<br />
The price is 100pp. Druids aren't getting any cheaper to gate, wizards aren't getting any cheaper to TL, and clerics aren't getting any cheaper (except the ones who just don't charge) to rez. Why should we get cheaper with our one class ability to make money?<br />
<br />
As soon as the market sees one person selling something for 5pp less than everyone else, they expect everyone to sell it for that.</div></div><hr />

wrong.  dead wrong.  Only way to make a profit is to sell potions for more than it costs to make them....that's the definition of profit. <br />
<br />
Hows this for pissing you off:<br />
<br />
in OT you auction:<br />
/auc WTS 10d SoW potions 100pp<br />
<br />
then see:<br />
/auc WTS SoW potions cheaper than Bearknukl.  PST<br />
<br />
It's happened to me, and at a time when I was making about 10 plat by selling for 100pp.  No way could I afford to get into a 'price war' with a jerk. I simply kept on xping and held my potions for a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">so anyone have any suggestions on how to make great cash ? im getting high enough where i need to get some good armour and stuff . i need da cash</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>uglytobone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The fastest way by far to make  a lot of pp is getting good at the buy/sell/trade game.<br />
<br />
As for sows... if you wait to start alchemy at level 29 (30?) and then train 21 pts you can start out skilling up in alchemy at near zero cost, especially if you can sell sows for 120pp. People will pay this much on Tunare. Once trivial you make sows to finance making shrinks to skill up. This puts you back down to zero cost again (except for time spent) for skilling up.<br />
<br />
As your skill increases sows and shrinks become more profitable and pretty soon you are decent money per sale. Set the price as your server dictates. I think sales depend more on who is in the zone than whether you sell them for 100pp or 120pp.<br />
<br />
With no failures and decent charisma material costs for a stack of sows is about 53pp. Once shrink is trivial your actual cost will be around 55-60pp. Always carry potions with you, refill when convenient, and it will be a consistent source of income.</div></div><hr />

<br />
of course i'm selling above the cost of creation why the hell would anyone sell to lose money?<br />
<br />
as far as pricing goes, maybe you're right, maybe i should be regulate my prices to that of the mass public.  I mean what kind of crazy organization would think of letting merchants within that organization to name their own prices.  I mean to be free in determinining your own business? that's just silly.<br />
/sarcasm off<br />
<br />
I know deflation sucks, but i'm more worried about getting back to enjoying the game than i am in selling sow potions.   If someone can underbid me, more power to them.  Sow potions used to cost 250pp, and now if you suggest  105pp you get your head bitten off.  The market doesn't respect the individuals need to make money so why should i respect the needs of the market.  There is no union in EQ, i'm not crossing any picket lines, and i'm not starving people out of hard earned plat that they need to support their eq families with.  sorry if that sounds harsh but as a business major thats how i see life.  I'm not trying to screw over other industrious shaman, nor would i be dictated to about business ethics in a game in which we kill stuff and then loot the money off the rotting corpse.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The first step in this idiocy was when people started tacking &quot;please send tell&quot; onto the end of their auctions - as if an interested buyer/seller would contact them by any other means. Then a brilliant moron decided he was tired of typing the whole words and abbreviated them to &quot;PST&quot;. Of course, at first nobody knew what the hell he meant (&quot;uh, why does your time zone matter?&quot;). So he explained it in all caps in /shout or /ooc a few times. Then all the morons of average intelligence realized what a great idea it was and started using it. And they told two friends.<br />
<br />

<br />
They've been historically referred to as guilds...and they existed both in real life and in most fantasy settings.  They regulated their members, both in standards of products and in pricing as well.  I guess the modern equivalent is trade cartels (like OPEC).<br />
<br />
I understand you just want to make a fast buck, and get back to doing the things you enjoy.  My point was if you tell a young shaman the only way to make money is to undercut the rest of the market, you're giving him bad info/advice.<br />
<br />
You think most tailors/smiths over at eqtraders.com aren't discussing prices for selling the new cultural armor?  I don't see any difference.<br />
<br />
regarding the rest of your post: you're right.  its just a game, and we don't need to get worked up about it.  I'm done.</div></div><hr />

LOL, that reminds me of some funny stuff in the Nethack game. One of the classes that you can choose from is the Tourist. Here are some of their starting items;<br />
<br />
* Camera - flash blinds &amp; stuns mobs.<br />
* Hawaiian Shirt - Vendors charge you more because you're wearing this.<br />
* Credit Card - Vendors don't accept but you can use it to picklocks.<br />
* Some scrolls of maps<br />
* Assorted junk food.<br />
<br />
I believe the Tourist's equivalent Epic item is the Platinum Yandorian Credit Card. You still can't use it with vendors, but you can &quot;charge&quot; magic items which ran out of charges.</div></div><hr />

It's a hook.

<br />
I disagree I found it a good way to make money when I was Based in FV and Fighting in OT/DL (before I started heading into Nurga etc :D) I used to make as many 10 shots as I could afford and auction them as I passed through zones. I could usually sell all of them by the time I'd finished playing for the night and head back to FV. <br />
<br />
I would take the LOIO-&gt;FM-&gt;DL/OT route as that would give me two extra zones to auction in as I went past. In FM I would also offer 3/4 potions for a forest loop, and then spend time selling it myself later.<br />
<br />
Now though I tend to roam a lot more and ony make potions on order rather than auctioning, but I know if I carried Sows with me I'd easily make 100-200 pp profit each night. <br />
<br />
Another Tip is to Sow the person who's buying your potions as they will remember that you gave them an extra one free. They will remember you and will send you tells when they get low.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>SisterLi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Sow potions sell at 120 plat.  Folks might tell you that 100 is the price, but it is not.      When I had less of a skill, I found that is was usually sufficient to say &quot;At 100, I make maybe 10plat in profit.  That's just not worth my time.  My sow potions sell for 120 plat.&quot;  Then the person either ponyied up the cash, or went on about their business.  No reasonable person is going to begrudge you a reasonable profit.  Making potions takes time, effort, and a lot of bag space.  100 just isn't a reasonable amount of compensation for all of that.  (Until you get to the point where you are succeeding 9 out of 10 -- but that is several levels and skill levels away from 39.  At that point I would (and did) still hold the line at 120.  No need to undercut your fellow shaman.)  <br />
<br />
It's a 10-charge shot of independence.  There are a lot of zones where attempting to run across sans sow is suicide.  My standard line, when I see someone auctioning 100plat sow potions is that they need to change their ad to the following:<br />
<br />
&quot;Sow potions, 120plat each.   Or auction for a rez with the money you saved by not buying my potion.&quot;<br />
<br />
My Alchemy skill is 180, and I ceased selling sow potions a long time ago.  I don't need the cash, and prefer to leave the sow market to shaman who are working on their skills.  But do not undercut the product.  120 is a reasonable price, hold out for that.<br />
