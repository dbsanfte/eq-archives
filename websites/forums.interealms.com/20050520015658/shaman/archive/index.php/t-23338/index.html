<br />
I cant believe this to be the real reason for it?<br />
<br />
I work for a Software Co. I currently do Release Testing for one part of the program.<br />
<br />
I have sat through Enhancement Meeting, worked with Programmer, Management.<br />
<br />
When I look at how we deal with issues and test the program for the Co. I work for. <br />
<br />
I just cant believe our problems are coming from they dont have anyone playing a high lvl Shaman.</div></div><hr />

Man, I get tired of reading these. Go to any class boards, and you'll see the same &quot;We are the doormat of EQ!&quot; claims.<br />
<br />
It will never be perfect in the eyes of the majority. Every time a class is &quot;fixed&quot;, another comes along to fill the role of the most broken and complains until they are also &quot;fixed&quot;.<br />
<br />
Could the shaman class use some tuning? Sure, as could most of the other classes. It's not that bad, people. If you like the idea of playing a shaman, then play a shaman. Otherwise, all the negativity can be completely eliminated if you would just play a class with which you aren't so dissatisfied.<br />
<br />
Honestly, we tend to act sometimes like this is some major piece of government legislation that is adversely affecting our lives. I wish everyone was this passionate about voting for public officials.<br />

If no one read the class boards, but just played the game, everyone would be a lot happier.  It's not a matter of ignorance that I&quot;m talking about, it's turning these minor class issues into these gigantic whine fests.<br />

<br />
Please tell me how others complaining is any different or better than your complaining about there complaints.  I think this is a forum for people to do that about what they feel are class issues or Ideas about the shaman class.  Sometimes people like to vent.  I really don't think anyone should complain about it as long as it's game related.  But to hear your personal thoughts on voting habits is something I feel should be ranted.  If you don't like reading it just use ignore or better yet don't click on the link.  If your concerns are political you could always check out the grey.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>sudamor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I actually agree with Felstaff, and on another note, I think that we have a right to post our non-SoE rant feelings here as those of you who wish to rant.<br />

-- Non-SoE RANT BEGIN --<br />
<br />
I love playing a Shaman.  I love the fact that I am so versitile.  I love the fact that I can add DPS, heal, and/or buff when each action is required.  I've NEVER had a problem getting a group in GoD (currently flagged up to Ikkinz2) and think that the content the SoE puts out on a regular basis is in the most part fair - for instance; earlier today I read a thread complaining about mana costs for new DoTs (the comparison is against the Necro).  Yes, on paper it does cost more mana for us to slap on a few DoTs, however we make up that gap by utilizing canni4 in 12secs.<br />
<br />
Are we &quot;the red-headed stepchild&quot;?  No.  Could we be improved? Yes.  Do I believe that SoE is doing their absolute best? Yes (note: why shouldn't they?  They want to make money don't they?  It makes ZERO sense for them to intentially try to make any class a &quot;red-headed stepchild).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thornebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Since you work for a software company, what else do you think it could be?<br />
<br />
With the company I work for. Any new enhancements are listed they they go through that list.<br />
<br />
1. What will make the largest impacted at what amount of programming hours.<br />
<br />
2. How many enhancements can they do during X amount of programming hours. <br />
<br />
3. Then there is what Marketing Says needs to be added. and what is left over for programming hours (see 1 and 2)<br />
<br />
On Bugs.<br />
<br />
Management plus Programmers meet and list out all new bugs then assing a priority and a release that they need to fix it by. (this effects number of programming hours for new enhcements) (This can be effected by 3, 3 always comes first save Major Bugs)<br />
<br />
any bug that is listed that would take a long time to fix that has little or no impact on things is deferred and nothing ever happens to it.<br />
<br />
And we too have some really nice programs that could much better then they are. But that is not where Marketing wants to go. So they stay in a Maintenance mode</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Do we need some ajustments such as a decent healing upgrade , Down tuned poisan DoT agro , Lessened recast times on several Spells ... Yes we do ...<br />
<br />
but we are NOT in my opinion the &quot;Red headed step child&quot; of EQ .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>oneli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Go play a monk to 65 and then come back and you'll know who the real red-headed stepchild of SoE is ;P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I dunno.  No other class has failed to scale past 60 like monks and shaman have*.  Warriors had agro problems, but those have been fixed (at least I never have agro probs with a warrior that has a clue).  Rogues still pwn everybody else for DPS if they can get position.  Bards actually work.  Heck, if I had to choose another class that needs adjusting, it'd be the post-55 necromancer.  <br />
<br />
I keep up on the other boards.  Most of what's needed by the other classes is fine-tuning.  Shaman, monks, (SIGH, ok... berserkers) all need major changes.  Necros rock as they are, but, like us, they saw their versatility eroded away; they lost their mini-mez, their lull, and their life-flow heal thingies could use a post-60 version.<br />
<br />
We rocked in Classic and Luclin-era EQ.  So did monks (til the mitigation nerf), so did necros.  If anything, we're the blonde-haired blue-eyed kids** that Dad is trying to convince the stepson he loves just as much as us.  Spoiled before, given a cursory nod and a &quot;hi&quot; now.  Red gets the good cloth kite, we get the cheap plastic one.  Hey, we both got kites, right?<br />
<br />
* Berserkers don't count.  They don't exist in my little fantasy world.  I just pretend that my kitty friend is an athsmatic warrior with a chain fetish.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Monks like us shamans need some ajustment .. in my opinion the Repeal of there mitigation nerf would be a good step in the right direction for that class . However I also disagree that monks hold claim too any place of &quot;holy brokenness&quot; just as we shamans dont either ...<br />
<br />
If Shamans got a decent Burst heal upgrade ... Recast times on our Spells reduced and an agro fix for Poisan DoTs .. We would in my opinion be in a much better position ... Those are NOT dramatic changes ... Thats not asking too have ever Druid level healing ...<br />
Since it is my opinion that those few changes would mostly fix our class I am certianly not going too say &quot;OMG shamans are broken&quot; If i felt we were Broken I would have too suggest HUGE sweeping changes and i dont feel those are needed .<br />
<br />
Same I can say , in my opinion of monks ... Repeal the midigation nerf and give a small upward adjustment in DPS and in my opinion they are pretty ok ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Thornebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">OK that's fine you dont have to like or agree with my choice of using &quot;Red-headed Step Child&quot;<br />
<br />
But going back to what said about hearing many times that we have problems becauce no one on Sony's end Plays a High Lvl Shaman.<br />
<br />
I dont think that is it. putting it more into my outlook from work. I think the Shaman is in a Maintenance mode. Which mean they will update it to keep it functioning with the new software but that is it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Go to any class boards, and you'll see the same &quot;We are the doormat of EQ!&quot; claims. <br />
<br />
 Au contraire  dude.  As one with a 65 / 220 Enchanter, I can tell you that such claims are not made on EQ Casters Realm (Dead board) or The Runes.<br />
<br />
Any Druid making such a claim is on the proverbial crack pipe. As is a Bard, Paladin, and especially a Cleric.<br />
<br />
Whether you are looking at erosion of power or pimping out of class abilities, Shaman have taken the lead pipe of cruelty for many expansions now. To question that claim is to question reality, because Shaman work twice as hard to hold their own.<br />
<br />
Now to answer your question &quot;why&quot;?<br />
<br />
I can come up with three explanations.<br />
<br />
1) The first is that nobody at SonyEQ HQ PLAYS a Shaman. Now, they may have a 65 / 300 Shaman, but that gentle reader, begs the question of whether they leveled that toon, or keystroked it.<br />
<br />
Certainly when Rytan claims &quot;stat buffs matter,&quot; and Brenlo states he &quot;played a Shaman to 50 therefore he understands Shaman concerns,&quot; a mental red flag goes up.<br />
<br />
2) Vis-a-vis Rytan's claim.  Back in the day Alchemy was more FUBARED than a teenager busted for a DUI. Now Verant disputed this and disputed this loudly. <br />
<br />
However, a great group of folks over at ShowEQ countered Verant's claim and demonstrated that Alchemy WAS messed up. This led to more backpeddaling by Verant than michael jackson on the  Thriller  tour.<br />
<br />
IMO this public humiliation of Verant led to an institutional mindset of &quot;let's get / show those Shaman,&quot; resulting in a sort of 'benign indifference' on the part of Verant and now Sony towards our class.<br />
<br />
3) Finally, somebody has to be the bottom class. For the past 2-4 expansions it's been us and the Monks. Note - I could accept a sort of revolving &quot;Well so and so needs some tweaking in a positive manner,&quot; HOWEVER, given the thorough lack of imagination concerning new Shaman abilities, the continual erosion of power simply through MUDflation and quite frankly unless a mental earthquake occurs over in San Diego - <br />
<br />
This is the status quo from here on out.</div></div><hr />

How could any of you say our class is weak or underrated..  ya ya some of our stuff is over costed we have canni for that..  ya ya we dont heal so well but we can slow ya ya we cant dot as well but we can buff..  It's like checks n balances..  well all I can really say about the shaman class is there the best the very best class in EQ..  I have played them all in my 5 year run and I have always liked the versitility of a shaman and there is no way I can play a bard tried it 4 times......  what other class can be main healer main slower main buffer all at the same time... none none at all...  what other class can have a group of 5 meelee and one caster type... none unless of course everyone is uber geared and there grpin in BoT or some place that hits for about 500-600...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Every shaman problem was solved long ago.<br />
The class was made better and got all the tools it needed to perform in todays &quot;fast fight&quot; world.<br />
<br />
Only a shame they decided to bundle that problem solving into a new class and create the beast lord. A beastlord is all that a shaman could (or should) have been.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Why does Sony treat us as the Red-headed Step Child?<br />
<br />
It's really simple if you look at it from their point of view:<br />
<br />
Balancing classes doesn't make money.  Selling Expansions do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Dasha, as you progress further into PoP and GoD, you will see where our &quot;power&quot; starts to disappear.  In areas such as Tier 3 and below, I think we, as a class, are fine.  Heck, I was tanking HoH mobs the other day when I was bored after raiding.<br />
<br />
I was boxing my rogue last night in BoT.  We had a group of alts that we were playing.  For the most part, I was only healing the MT with BoT.  Sometimes, if slow resisted, I would cast DM.  I would toss a dot here or there, but for the most part, I played my rogue.<br />
<br />
In Tier 4, I could heal, be MH, in places like PoEarth, but I have to bust my ass to do it.  Means canni all the time.  There was a time in which I boxed a tank, slowed, and healed.  NOW, that sucked :P<br />
<br />
Same with GoD.  I could heal in KT, but again, I have to bust my ass to do it - I cannot heal on named.  <br />
<br />
With slow mitigation, Sony basically nerfed us, and we are paying the price for it in High End Content.  All the Gods in Time are immune to slow, and a lot of the bosses in GoD are immune.  This is where the problems are - High End Content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No one else finds it odd that half the people on this board complain about shaman, but when one at the high end says things are fine, people say well sure, for you.  <br />
<br />
Where is this gap of uselessness occurring</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">How could any of you say our class is weak or underrated..   <br />
well all I can really say about the shaman class is there the best the very best class in EQ..    <br />
what other class can be main healer main slower main buffer all at the same time... none none at all...  <br />
what other class can have a group of 5 meelee and one caster type... none unless of course everyone is uber geared and there grpin in BoT or some place that hits for about 500-600...<br />
I think the point you have missed in all this is that the Shaman class has not been kept &quot;up to speed&quot; with TODAYS EQ content. No one is denying the power we have in relatively trivial content. And yes, BoT and other pre-EP PoP zones are &quot;trivial&quot;. As the game has changed and evolved, the Shaman class has not changed with it. We are still designed to be strong in longer fights, grouping with people who are not maxxed out, against mobs that do not hit for much more than 800ish a swing. None of these things describe EQ today. Yard trash regularly hits for 1200+. Almost everyone, even straight-up Bazaar geared players, is so close to maxxed stats that our buffs are insignificant. Many of &quot;todays&quot; fights last LESSS than 45 seconds, which makes our strongest abilities, slow, DOTs, etc, obsolete. Slow mitigation, gear mudflation, and low HP high DPS mobs have created an enviroment that makes Shaman a relatively useless class. <br />
<br />
We are not alone. A lot of classes are suffering from this shift in the game. SOE is trying to make adjustments, but they just cannot seem to get past the whole &quot;But shaman are SO POWERFUL in trivial content&quot; thing. It seems like they dont DARE increase our healing or DPS, for fear of re-creating the goddly class we were in the days of old. <br />
<br />
I dont think the Shaman class is dead, but we are certainly near the bottom of the list in this new EQ world. It honestly wouldnt take much to bring us back up to a &quot;respectable&quot; level. A few more hundred points on our fast heal and our fast nuke would make us at LEAST mildly effective. And honeslty, I do not see how either would make any older content any less trivial than it already is. <br />
<br />
So far, SOE has upped our HoTs, and upped one buff to a &quot;useful&quot; level, regen. The big problem is that NEITHER of these changes deal with the immidiate problem, how to make Shaman more effective in todays &quot;Short Fight, Low Hp, High DPS Mob&quot; world. Slow is being mitigated, and even if it wasnt, there are other classes with more utility available for that task. Our heals, while handy, cannot keep up with the DPS of many of todays mobs, even the trash (lets not even bring up the Nameds, eh). Our buffs have been reduced to one single thing, the 544 hps from Focus, and of the other Priest classes, this is the lowest, least versitile of them all. 9 adds mana regen. Virt adds AC. Focus adds . . . more useless stats. Other than that, our buffs are almsot totally irrelevant. FA is almost useless in its current, low-duration format, and even if it was longer lasting, once again, it would be a single-directional buff, +attack. The stat portion is worthless. New regen is helpful, but its certainly not going to keep anyone alive when yard trash quads for 1K a whack. <br />
<br />
The bottom line is we just dont bring enough to the table to be attractive in groups anymore. Our raid stackability is horrible. Our healing AND dps is the lowest of any of the priest classes, we cannot tank in higher content (and we actually WERE fair off-tanks in much of the older content, until now).<br />
<br />
I am not one of those &quot;Shaman are doomed and suck out the wang&quot; nay-sayer people, but I have to be realistic about my class. I love playing a shaman. I am useful in many aspects of the game. I am an excellent addition to many groups. I can solo or group effectively in a large portion of the EQ universe. But in the end, we are a &quot;6th wheel&quot; in todays, cutting edge portion of the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Great post!!! Just some comments....<br />
<br />
I don't see how you can say slow is &quot;obsolete&quot;.  Even if a mob is only &quot;partially&quot; slowed, it's still slowed regardless of the duration of the battle.  Can you elaborate?<br />
<br />
Additionally, when I group in GoD (which is where I live 24/7 when I play) I can usually out heal the cleric, and this is by design (note: named are the exception; but doesn't that make sense?  Clerics are the best healing class and this is where they SHOULD be useful).  Let me give you a case in point that I use every day:<br />
<br />
Ikkinz Trials:<br />
- Necro: Pulls with snare<br />
- Warrior: Grabs initial agro with bow<br />
- Enchanter: Cast Recant Magic<br />
- Shaman: Cast &quot;Trushar&quot; on Warrior<br />
- Shaman: Malos<br />
- Warrior: Taunt<br />
- Shaman: Slow (Malos)<br />
- Cleric: Cast Holy Light<br />
- Shaman: Heal at x% with Daluda's Mending (repeat as needed).<br />
- dps, dps, dps, dead (Mage &lt;nuke/pet&gt;, Warrior, Necro &lt;nuke/pet&gt;, Enchanter&lt;nuke/pet&gt;).<br />
<br />
Points to Consider:<br />
- Even though the cleric is there, the shaman (me) plays MH during 90% of the battles.<br />
- Shaman has typically spent 40% of their mana; however, with canni4 he is back to 80-85% at next pull, or even full mana with canni5.<br />
- When cleric does heal, the shaman takes over healing responsility for  ALL other members of the party.<br />
- Regen (i.e., Replenishment) is huge IMHO; when other party members are using Mod Rods  or are necro's it's a must.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps I didnt state that part as clearly as I could have. I meant OUR slow is relatively obsolete, because the other slowing classes can slow just as well as we can (virtually) and add much more utility to a group than our puny heal and puny DPS. Its not like our healing, which is SO  MUCH lower than the other healers in the game. Also, in the world of &quot;30 second fights&quot; slows value is greatly reduced. Factor in mitigation, and you end up with an ability that is nice, but hardly the &quot;bag of chips&quot; it used to be. <br />
<br />
Somewhere on this board, in another thread, there are some rough numbers with regard to slows, heals, DPS, and fight lengths. It basically proved that a Druid healing on an unslowed mob is STILL more efficient than a Shaman healing vs a fully slowable mob. As the length of the fight goes up, the value of slow increases by a ton. <br />
<br />
A lot of our effectiveness in OoW will depend on what sort of encounters are to be found in the &quot;day to day&quot; game. If the fights are longer, or the mobs have more HPs and do a tad less DPS, then we will re-gain some of our lost power. However, if this trend toward short fights continues, we will be on the outside looking in yet again. Luckily, by the time I am level 70, I am sure Vxed, Tipt and KT will be almost to the point of &quot;trivialness&quot; the way that BoT and Tactics are today.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Deep in my heart, I've often wondered if the continuing overlooking of shaman has a lot to do with the fact that the devs are players.  This is something they've touted much, how in touch they are because they are all former and current players.  I worry that too many of them remember with great resentment how a shaman could solo mobs in kunark that would destroy them.<br />
They are human, after all, and its not impossible that petty resentments could have its part to play in this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">if you root around long enough you will find several threads showing where shaman stand in comparison to the closest classes to the relevant ability (buffs/dots/heals/nukes/pets)<br />
the sad truth is we come out either in last place or we just dont have the power other classes have in ANY area. <br />
in short<br />
druids arguably out dot us thanks to resist mods<br />
everyone out nukes us,<br />
chanters out buff us. (sorry 70% haste with atk and kie/voq own every shaman buff in the book for dps)<br />
druids and clerics out heal us by a  vast margine and that margine is NOT made up for with slows, esp with mitigated slows<br />
sk pets kick our pets ass<br />
<br />
shaman have no role where they are the clear undeniable leader and unlike bards our versatility is a hinderance, long cast times, high mana costs, being chained to cani like a big lead weight, 0 resist mods forcing us to malo every single mob, and our primary means of dps is broken on the agro scale to the point that we are unable to crank up the dps unless we are willing and able to tank the mob in question.<br />
<br />
I love the class, I love the solo power, but compared to other classes we are in need of some work, and when you factor in my pvp server status its even worse, shaman in pvp are now one of the worst classes in the game for pvp. but dont start on pvp in this thread not trying to derail here.<br />
<br />
I dont think we are hoplessly broken but god damnit they could fix ONE ****ING thing that matters instead of pumping out another expansion...seriously how long have we been looking for fixes and how many have we recieved that are FIXED??? they bump our heals but the bump is laughably low, the only one I can think of that I am truly happy with is the regen/hot bump they did, Q is now a very effective spell and replenishment is once again worth keeping on the group.<br />

<br />
Quite interesting .. let me guess you have 3 Minutes between pulls? Because it cannot be that you have a mana pool of 2500 when you are in GoD. In my world Canni4 gets me 82 mana every 6 seconds if I chain cast it. that's 820 mana per minute. I got around 6k mana, 40% of my mana pool is 2400 mana .. means it takes me around 3 minutes of pure Canni4 casting to get your claimed 40% mana to 80%.<br />
Now .. in my world, I simply don't have the time to canni4 anymore. I press Canni5 when it's up, drop a HoT on myself and maybe press Canni4 3-4 times while I regain the HPs. But that is basically it. With fights taking less than 1 minute and pulls coming in all the time, I cannot function as a main healer in those zones. Maybe me not having any of the GoD spells might add to that problem.<br />

- dps, dps, dps, dps, = dead much quicker (Mage , Warrior, Necro , Enchanter, +one more).<br />
<br />
And if you wanted to feel safer then add a druid instead of a shaman for better blast healing and also better dps when not healing.<br />
<br />
Yeah, sure, we can feel we are really contributing in groups by landing our &quot;uber&quot; blast heals but the plain fact is that your group would be better off if they ditched you and either got in another dps or a druid (assuming equivalent aa's and gear). Edit: The druid actually adds 2 levels of security, better heals and evac if the poopoo really hits the fan.</div></div><hr />

Casting Trushar on the tank while the mob is incoming, is a huge mistake by itself, which a lot of Shamans seem to make without thinking about. <br />
<br />
Even if your Trushar lands on the tank the second the mob gets into the &quot;camp&quot;, you still just lost 2.25 seconds(spell gem refresh), in which the mob is going to hit your tank unslowed with you just watching. <br />
2.25 seconds of unslowed DPS is a lot more damage than Trushar will have healed your tank for, in that short time till it's slowed.<br />
<br />
Just thought I'd point that out.</div></div><hr />

Well G, in all fairness, the tank isnt usually the one doing the pulling. So, when the INC message is announced (and I /tell pullers in my group to give me a GOOD advanced warning) I can almost always get the HoT off on tank, THEN Malos/slow the mob as it appears. In situations where the mobs are closer, I drop the HoT AS the puller runs off to get one, so I am ready to debuff when it appears. <br />
<br />
But in many situaitons, you are absolutely correct. There isnt time to do all those things. You CERTAINLY do not want your tank taking more than 1 round unslowed. the obvious choice there is debuff, THEN HoT, then cripple/Bane/Tears or whatever you do for the last 20 seconds of these fights.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am goning to be rather blunt.<br />
<br />
Shaman, IMO, are still one of the most powerful classes in EQ. Perhaps not inherantly like they were back in the day, but with the right gear and AA's, I still would not trade in my shaman for any class. And yes I am talking over 400 ass and GoD gear and also a 4 year investemnt.<br />
<br />
I think alot of the arguments here are based on folks who do not, or think they should not, have to put time in to get the pay off. Pretty much, people are lazy. Get 400 aas, raid several hours eavey night after work, don't be a prick to people and get into a good guild. IF you are not prepared to do all this, you are not prepared to have a shaman that is as powerful as they once were. You invest the time you get the rewards, as it should be. EQ is not a game with cheat codes or one that should have anyhting handed to people. <br />
<br />
There will always be people who are 1 expansion behind. They will not beat an expansion without the benefit of gear / aas / levels provided by the next. They have not worked hard enough to do so. <br />
<br />
Work hard like other people and you will get pay offs. Hell if people used the time they come here to cry about things to make their character better they probably whould not think the class sucked.  <br />
<br />
If you work every day, stay in school and take your vitamins (like the hulkster says) you will see this is a very solid class. <br />
<br />
Someone pointed out that if msg boards never existed than there would not be this dislike for classes by their players. I think that is totally valid. <br />
<br />
People compare their characters with 100 aas in a medium guild to the folks with the buffed up magelos with 500+ aas and say that should be me, Im as good as them. Fact is, you're not. You have the ability to be, with effort, but right now you are not. You don't play enough, you don't level enough and if you could do many of the same things as your powerful cousins can, than the drive to get better dies and so does EQ.<br />
<br />
Its all about levels, aas, gear, the individual is a distant 4th. Thats just EQ.<br />
<br />
And to make it clear, anyone who takes any RL validation from a video game is a tool.<br />
<br />
Im not going to say there is nothing wrong with the shaman class, but its not nearly as broken as many, hell its not broken.<br />
<br />

People who might have to bail at any second due to thier kid taking a fall. People who are on call. People who will say I don't feel like playing tonight. I am going out to dinner with my husband.  People who at the drop of a hat will run halfway across the gameworld to help someone who is a complete stranger because another guildy thinks they need help. <br />

And one of the most iportant things. People who don't feel a game should feel like a job, where a single persons greatest contribution is to show up and be a number.

EQ does not depend on playtime to play. Parts of it do. Just like every game everything in life. The more you put in the more you get out. The more you work the more money you make, the better your car, house and clothes. The more you level in diablo the better you gear up, the more you play monololy the better you get. Its all about time in.<br />
<br />
If the argument is EQ needs to be the exception fair enough, but if everyone was on the same level games lose their interest. We play to get better.<br />
<br />
Clearly EQ is not the game for you. Instead of insisting it be made to suit you perhaps you suit a game that already exists.<br />
<br />
I work 40-50 hrs a week, married and still make family functions. Yet in 4 years I have been able to build a pretty descent shaman. <br />
<br />
Once again its not the game or class thats broken, its people not accepting that in their lives, including entertainment (line up for days for tickets to a good show, put in over time to afford front row seats), the more you put in the more you get out.<br />
<br />
The day part time players can accomplish as much as people who word harder, is the day that EQ loses interest for everyone who puts in greater effort. <br />
<br />
You do not have to play EQ. People lose sight of this. Your arguments would be valid if it were not a game and you HAD to play. You choose to.<br />
<br />
EQ should be work=reward. Like everything else. And with work there is nothing wrong with the Shaman class. Without work there is plenty of content suitable for people who have personal lives.</div></div><hr />

We certainly used to be, Buz, but as time has progressed, we have watched our effectiveness fade. Certainly, a shaman is a good, solid addition to most groups. No is denying that we have good versitility and are set up fairly well for many situations. The point people are trying to make is that the GAME has progressed and passed us by. There is almost NO situation you can name in current content where a shaman is the best choice for a particular role, and in todays EQ world of &quot;specilization&quot; thats just a fact of life, a fact we share with other &quot;secondary&quot; classes like Pally/Sks, Mages, Monks, etc. <br />
<br />
We are very powerful and very fun. No one is saying we ARENT. The major complaint we have is that our BEST abilities have been trivialized over time. Chanters and BLs slow as well as we do (the difference is totally trivial) yet we cannot heal even CLOSE to Clerics and Druids. Our buffs have been reduced to a single, 544 hp buff and a short duration +attack buff. In the old days, when NO ONE had maxxed stats, even the top players, Shaman would stack up 10 buffs on people. Now, no one wants STA, AGI, DEX, or STR. Dont need em. Gear has it all covered. <br />
<br />
If you look at what people are asking for, you will see that most shaman, high or low, think we are *THIS* (holds fingers 2 cm apart) close. A cople hundred bigger heal so it actually DOES somethihg toa 10K tank. A couple hunder bigger fast nuke so it actually DOES something to a 30-second dead mob. A few more &quot;cool&quot; abailities on our buffs so people WANT them. Something to make us stack better on raids (even you cant deny that we SUCK on raids for stackability). <br />
<br />

Granted, your group needs to be folks who know how to control agro. Though my class should not be able to overcome bad players (none should). <br />
<br />
More healing AAs going in OOW, but that won't make people happy because they will have to work for them. That should add another 9% to heals and about that again in crits.<br />

Our buffs are gonna break through cap. How long before people start crying about how hard it is to keep swappinh out spells to group buff and how we need an all in one stam, agi, daiku type fos buff?<br />

Have we been watered down since Kunark? Yes.<br />
<br />
We we over powered than? Yes.<br />

Our relative development is lower than other classes, but that is only because we had too much to begin with.<br />

What has pissed me off is people who are frustrated with not being able to access content, based on their play time / investment, that attribute it to the class.  <br />

It is not the class, it is how they choose to play it (ie time put in). <br />

IF you are not prepared to do all this, you are not prepared to have a shaman that is as powerful as they once were. You invest the time you get the rewards, as it should be. EQ is not a game with cheat codes or one that should have anyhting handed to people. <br />
<br />
There will always be people who are 1 expansion behind. They will not beat an expansion without the benefit of gear / aas / levels provided by the next. They have not worked hard enough to do so. <br />
<br />
Work hard like other people and you will get pay offs. Hell if people used the time they come here to cry about things to make their character better they probably whould not think the class sucked.  <br />
<br />
If you work every day, stay in school and take your vitamins (like the hulkster says) you will see this is a very solid class. <br />
<br />
Someone pointed out that if msg boards never existed than there would not be this dislike for classes by their players. I think that is totally valid. <br />
<br />
People compare their characters with 100 aas in a medium guild to the folks with the buffed up magelos with 500+ aas and say that should be me, Im as good as them. Fact is, you're not. You have the ability to be, with effort, but right now you are not. You don't play enough, you don't level enough and if you could do many of the same things as your powerful cousins can, than the drive to get better dies and so does EQ.<br />
<br />
Its all about levels, aas, gear, the individual is a distant 4th. Thats just EQ.<br />
<br />
And to make it clear, anyone who takes any RL validation from a video game is a tool.<br />
<br />
Im not going to say there is nothing wrong with the shaman class, but its not nearly as broken as many, hell its not broken.<br />
<br />
I ready to take my medicine now. Let me have it.<br />
<br />
Sorry to burst your bubble buddy...<br />
<br />
If I had the opportunity to give up my Shaman for another class of equivalent gear and AA... I would be sorely tempted.<br />
<br />
Am I an expansion behind? Do I have less than 400 AA? I'll be the guinea pig for your hypothesis.</div></div><hr />
