<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tinkalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A gigantic thank you for letting me in on a General V'Ghera raid today, and for letting me loot a Kedge Keep Robe.  I am indebted to you, if there is anything I can help with do not hesitate to call on me.  <br />

<br />
Always good to see Akalabethians posting here!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Keistle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm going to add my heartfelt thanks to this thread here, started by my guildmate Tinkalot, who is the object of my unfettered envy at this time.<br />
<br />
I was sorely bummed when i logged in and found out that he completed his epic and i had missed my chance at a general.<br />
<br />
However, i spoke with Arsecn, and he invited me along to do the General again, in the evening.<br />
<br />
It was a little rough, and frustrating, especially since my general got bugged and i had to /petition.... but i finally got my gerneral's pouch.<br />
<br />
Thankyou to all the KoE that took part in this. Thankyou for being patient, and not giving up despite the delays and deaths.<br />
<br />
Lastly, grats to Neofelis, and Mawafu's rogue *it's too hard to spell* who also got their pouches.  I'm glad i could help with those.<br />
<br />
Needless to say, it was quite emotionally draining for me, but i'm glad i was able to take part in it.<br />
thankyou<br />
Keistle, LOA</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Serlina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Congrats to all four of you on your pouches !  Keistle it was a little rough for bit but I knew it would all work out !!  Cant wait to see all 4 of you with that epic in your hands.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Moebeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Was a bit frustrating yes, not only the original FUBAR on my part when the train aggroed the wandering last DE, then we didn't think quick enough to stop the killing of her.<br />
<br />
Later on round 2 we had some aggro problems that caused 2 wipes.  Once we had everything under control we worked him down without much problem.  The last kill was quite exciting and we barely won with the first 2 tanks going down mid fight.<br />
<br />
Gratz to all, and thanks to all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Baracus Baraculous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">That last fight was one of the more exciting battles I've been a part of in EQ. We lost several, but we kept damage going on the general, successfully switched aggro to 3 different tanks, and kept our healers on their feet. What a great victory!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Arsecn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Gratz to all the rogues!  Was a pleasure to be the secondary meat shield even though I'm still walking funny...  And to those rogues who did not yet get a kedge robe for their last step, good luck and godspeed, get dem stickers! :)</div></div><hr />
