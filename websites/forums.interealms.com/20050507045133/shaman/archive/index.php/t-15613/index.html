There was an in-game broadcast to go to this site and sign up.  They have opened sign ups a few times now, but most of the time when you click the link it takes you to a page that just says registration is closed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yea, it was a first come first serve OPEN beta, there was no registration, they just took anyone, i think that kinda lets you know how close LDoN is to being live, they obviously rushed the beta process</div></div><hr />
