<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Roophus Gunthar</div><div class="date">10-27-2002, 02:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am in a guild of mostly all 59-61's atm.   We are relatively small but we gather up about 15-20 people when we really need to raid.    I was curious, what are the trials and how do I do them?    What zones, what npc's, what taks do I need to do, etc?   Any help would be appriciated.   I'd love to head into a tier 2 zone, but I have no clue how and dont see anywhere on here how I might go about doing so.   Thanks for help ahead of time :)</div></div><hr />

Top of the page (well, below this one now).<br />
<br />
Trials are on Plane of Justice.  Talk to Mavuin (track to him, he is at least 59, I think 60), and go through dialogue with him to get the character flag.  Then go to the Tribunal, and say &quot;I am prepared&quot; I believe to start the trial.  Your group will be teleported to the trial area and face something like 4 waves of 4 mobs each on a very strict time limit (this may be different for different trials).<br />
<br />
I have heard that Lashing and Execution are the easiest, but I do not know for sure.<br />
<br />
One last thing.  You can only bring in one group, and they all have to be CLOSE to the person saying the line to the Tribunal.  These are limited, non-raid level encounters, and they are rough.  They seem designed for the 61-65 group levels, and the more below it the rougher it is.  I am really working at getting my guild flagged for the various planes, and its slow going trying to get the pre-60s (like me) up to task, as well as get interest, especially with so little known about the trials themselves.</div></div><hr />
