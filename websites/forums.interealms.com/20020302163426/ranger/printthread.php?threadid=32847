<p><b> Which Mini-bosses?</b></p>

<p>I read in an earlier post that the shattered emerald of corruption only drops from a certain few mini-bosses, those that are on a three day spawn cycle. of course I could have asked this question in that post but I thought it important enough to get everyone's opinions and thoughs in effort to route out the truth. Does anyone have knoweldge of weather this is true? If it is true and the shattered emerald drops only from the mini's with a three day spawn, does anyone have this list?<br />
<br />
Next time I pull four groups off of ToV duty to hold my hand while I try to gimp toward the end of my epic I want to know as soon as we hit the LZ if I am wasting everyone's time.<br />

<p>I'm pretty sure they can drop from any mini, and I was under the impression they are all on a three day spawn cycle. Could be wrong...<br />
<br />
I have seen both the Female rev boss and Maestro drop the stone.<p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2">__________________<br>

<p>Question: What "defines" a mini-boss in PoH?<br />
<br />
Is it any named MoB there? or something else?<br />
Please tell, I've been very curious about this.<p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2">__________________<br>

<p>I was counting anything named, I guess this is what I am questioning also.<p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2">__________________<br>

<p>Well, I'm not positive but I believe all of the following are 'minis':<br />
<br />
Coercer T'Vala<br />
Maestro of Rancor<br />
Lord of Ire<br />
Lord of Loathing<br />
Magi P'tasa<br />
Mistress of Scorn<br />
<br />
The following may be mini's I'm not sure:<br />
<br />
Ashenbone Broodmaster<br />
Avatar of Abhorrence<br />
Grandmaster R'Tal<br />
Master of Spite<br />
Thought Destoryer<br />
<br />
In Hate this last week I got my stone off of Mistress of Scorn, and then another one dropped later off of Maestro.<p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2">__________________<br>

<p>From an old posting (not mine) on Illia's EQ Bestiary (besides Meastro, of course):<br />
<br />
Ashenbone Broodmaster - a very large version of the Ashenbone Drakes. Sometimes drops the Necro focus item Encyclopedia Necrotheurgia. <br />
<br />
Master of Spite - a large version of the Spite Golem. Drops two pieces of shaman armor and sometimes the Tunarian Scimitar or Gardash. Completely MR or atleast from what I've seen. Be ready to chase this one down as it will run before it dies. <br />
<br />
Grandmaster R'tal - a large version of the Kiraikuei. Drops two pieces of warrior armor and sometimes Sode of Empowerment, Sunderfury, or Rakusha Cloak. <br />
<br />
High Priest M'kari - a large version of the Cleric of Innoruuk. Drops two pieces of cleric armor and sometimes Truesight Hammer. <br />
<br />
Avatar of Abhorrents - a large version of the Abhorrents. Drops two pieces of rogue armor and sometimes Vexthorne. <br />
<br />
Mistress of Scorn - a large version of the Scorn Banshees. Drops two pieces of bard armor and sometimes Dawnchaser. She has a very strong disease that takes a high level cleric/shaman to dispell. <br />
<br />
Lord of Ire - a large version of the Ire Ghasts. Sometimes drops the Shield of the Immaculate or Eye of Innoruuk. <br />
<br />
Magi P'tasa - a large version of the male Forsaken Revenant. Drops two pieces of mage armor and sometimes the Staff of Elemental Mastery: Earth. <br />
<br />
Coercer T'vala - a large version of the female Forsaken Revenant. Drops two pieces of enchanter armor. She may also drop Rod of Infinite Thought. <br />
<br />
Lord of Loathing - a large version of the Loathing Lichs. Sometimes drops the Eye of Innoruuk and Beckon. <br />
<br />
All the mini-bosses are around level 55 and are very magic resistant. Most of them are comparable to the Maestro, just slightly less difficult. From what I could see a majority of them spawned infront of the thrones through out the Plane of Hate. Although some of them were in houses right next to the regular static spawns. Each of them dropped something that the old Innoruuk used to drop. Also, those mini-bosses that corresponded with an armor dropping mob, dropped two pieces of the appropriate armor.<p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2">__________________<br>

<p>Emerald from following mobs are confirmed, acording to information from site of a japanese ranger. She gathers these information through her own experiences and through her BBS (her page hit over 10,000 counts recently);<br />
<br />
Innoruuk<br />
Maestro of Rancor<br />
Grandmaster R'tal (Kiraikuei:WAR) : (I got mine off him)<br />
Avatar of Abhorrents (Abhorrent:ROG)<br />
Mistress of Scorn (Scorn Banshee:BRD)<br />
Coercer T'Vala (female Forsaken Revenant:ENC)<br />
Magi P'tasa (male Forsaken Revenant:MAG)<br />
Ashenbone Broodmaster (Ashenbone Drakes)<br />
Thought Destroyer (rare spawn after killing a Scorn Banshee)<br />
<br />
Following mobs are considered as minis, so they can drop an emerald also;<br />
<br />
Lord of Ire (Ire Ghast)<br />
Lord of Loathing (Loathing Lich)<br />
Master of Spite (Spite Golem:MNK)<br />
High Priest M'kari (Cleric of Innoruuk:CLR)<br />
<br />
I was surprised to know Thought Destroyer dropped an emerald. <br />
Now I think even Corrupter of Life (for pally PoG Natures Defender quest) can drop the emerald <img src="images/smilies/wink.gif" border="0" alt=""><br />
Let's kill ALL named =)</p>

<p><b><img src="images/icons/icon5.gif" alt="Question" width="15" height="15" border="0"> Respawn of Mini's?</b></p>

<p>Does anyone know the specific spawn pattern for the mini's?  (i.e., time between? any that might be "triggered"?, etc.)<br />
<br />
Also, I'd been under the impression that they were on the 2nd floor.  It appears from the excellent Mob Table I found below that most are actually on the 1st floor:<br />
