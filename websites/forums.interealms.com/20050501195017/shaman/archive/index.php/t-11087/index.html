<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Eldril Mystwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I seemed to have stumped the glade with this one, so I figured I'd ask the crucible.<br />
<br />
When you get a tell from lots of people I know you can use the TAB key to cycle through them and that /rt will target them. I did it once, but forgot what the keystroke is... <br />
How do you cycle through /rt names and how do you cycle forward through /r's and /rt's(if you tab one time too many)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think you're asking about shift+tab</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Eldril Mystwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">does that work for /rt?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">/shrug, /target (name) always works for me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rascalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Tab used to work to cycle through names of people that you had sent tells to not sure if it was replies to tells or not.   They cycle seemed to stop working for me when SoL came out.  I don't use it cause /RT which targets people works better.  There is no way that I know of to scroll through that.  /RT targets the person that sent a tell and that is it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">IIRC, /rt just hits the last person to send you a tell.  For regular tells, if you hit the r key to get the name up, and then tab + shift/tab you can move around the list.  But i think /rt still pulls up the last person, not the one you've moved the list to (though I could be off, been a few days since I've been on a raid).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>GeddarRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">*shrug* I always used /targ name for fastest buffing, atleast that worked for me on larger raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">When you have a flood of tells for buffs its very convenient to use the /rt when you cant remember all the names of the people who wanted buffs. Of course the /rt only targets the last tell so you can miss some. I know there was a way to cycle thru them because ive done it on accident before, but im not sure how to do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">alt-tab</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">bah, bastards now you have gotten me second guessing myself lol. Its either alt tab or shift tab, I use it everyday.</div></div><hr />

I don't think it's Alt+Tab, that's the keyboard shortcut to switch applications in Windows.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>mift atchou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">unfortunatly there is no easy way to use /rt like you are asking. /rt only targets the last person that sent you a tell, there isnt  a way to cycle thru that. the only thing you can cycle thru is replies from people by using tab and shift-tab.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">/rt is not very usefull when your screen turns purple (or what ever your tell color is) from buff requests.  In that case you are stuck with /target<br />
<br />
It is a shame they didnt make it like /r</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">You can abbreviate player names when targetting.<br />
<br />
/tar doo<br />
will target the player named Doofus as long as he's in range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Eldril Mystwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Ctrl+t was a suggestion from the glade, Im going to give that a shot tonight. I think thats the one I was looking for,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Rascalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Or if you are using raid mode just target people from the raid select screen.   This will help for group buffs on the leaders only etc to cut down on individual tells.</div></div><hr />

Ctrl+t was a suggestion from the glade, Im going to give that a shot tonight. I think thats the one I was looking for, <br />
<br />
No, Ctrl+T is the same as /tt -- send tell to current target.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I thought just tab cycled between you and your last target. Shift + Tab, im not sure. I haven't tried it, but if it does work the way you guys suggest it does, that will be great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I set up a seperate chat window specificly for tells because i would constantly miss them during raid or battle spam.  It's great because its really easy to keep track of everyone who sent you a tell during raids.  It also gets rid of those annoying missed tells when your exping :)</div></div><hr />
