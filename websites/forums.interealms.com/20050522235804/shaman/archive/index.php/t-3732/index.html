<br />
I had a guildy give it to me about a week ago.  I wish he hadn't.  I wish I could unscribe it and destroy it, along with my haste spells.<br />
<br />
Melee_01 is surrounded be a primal aura.<br />
Melee_02 says &quot;Hey, I don't have a clue what that buff is, but give it to me plz kthx!&quot;<br />
Melee_03 says &quot;Me too plz kthx!&quot;<br />
Melee_04 says &quot;haste plz&quot;<br />
Melee_04 says &quot;and whatever that was&quot;<br />
You say &quot;please god kill me now&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd rather have the spell than the VP hammer :(.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">LOL!   Who gave you that spell, Jinheim?   We'll have to beat into them the restrictions on the spell :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Primal cudgle is best :)<br />
<br />
*sorry, its my group only pal* :)<br />
<br />
Actually I look forward to getting the single target spell for non primal'd mele and casters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">2.5 sec cast time with QB3 .. the main goo goo gaa gaa of the spell is the 20sta .. <br />
<br />
it just a choice really <br />
<br />
AGI +60<br />
or<br />
Str/Agi/Dex/Sta +20<br />
<br />
course people with primal weapons still rarely bug ya for the agi .. <br />
<br />
ill take the 60 more hitpoints k thx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Heh I kinda want this spell and I kinda don't. I only usually give sta and focus on raids so I am not keen on having to pass out another buff. and oh yes they would want it, especially tanks that aren't at 255 sta. On some tanks with aa they get upwards of 8hps a sta point. Oh yeah, I have seen it drop in Ssra off a Mystic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wargbearjumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Drops in Ssra off Mobs on 2nd-3rd Floors.<br />
<br />
I like being able to cast it on myself. :)    I'm lucky that I'm in a guild where 90% of the melees have Primal, so they can't use this spell.    I managed to keep this spell secret for about 2 weeks until a Wizard in my group saw me cast it on myself and asked about it, then word got out that it gave 20 Sta that stacked onto Riotous/Brute...  so now I get about 20 Int Casters a night begging me for it.   Like 60 HP or less is actually going to make a difference when the AOW aggros you for over-nuking :)<br />
<br />
Still, I hate shrink a lot more than this spell.  I hate shrink like you would not believe.    Heh, I've seen at least 60% of the Warriors in my Guild shrink themselves with a Cobalt Bracer, but they all pretent they don't own one when the Raid Leader wants people shrunk.  I wish I never bought shrink :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I got a copy last weekend and I like it. Mems quick, casts quick, doesn't use much mana and lasts an hour. Admittedly, if I had to keep it up on 20 tanks in a raid then I'd probably feel differently &lt;g&gt;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jeradin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I am looking forward to this spell. I have the Primal Cudgle, but would be nice to be able to cast this on the MT and not need to drop group to buff MTs group.<br />
<br />
Will never loot VP hammer either!!<br />
<br />
Not had a chance to loot it yet, done a bit of Creator Key camping,b ut still some other guilds perma camping Snake Temple for Emp keys to get in there much. Last night though in the Bazaar saw one of those guilds selling Primal Essence for 30k, and Group Acumen for 30k also.... lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Shissar Mystic drops it as his rare. Common is the uber spell Group Acumen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If I ever get it, NO one will know about it.  Will only cast it on myself and if on a raid I'll try to get out of casting range of the main group before I cast hehe, and if in a place where I cant...I wont cast it.  Cause I dont want to see this.<br />

Tank_02 tells you,'PE please'<br />
You begin to cast Primal Essence spell.<br />
Your spell did not take hold.<br />
You tell Tank_02,'Drop Agi please'<br />
Tank_02 tells you,'K'<br />
You begin to cast Primal Essence spell.<br />
Your spell did not take hold.<br />

/sigh<br />
<br />
(BTW, this is a situation descibed by a few of my shammy peers on Veeshan when talking about their hate for this spell.)</div></div><hr />
