<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Persop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">If you were going to pass on one positive piece of advice to new shammies, what would it be? <br />
<br />
For me:<br />
<br />
Always practice your spells at lower levels otherwise its a lot of clicking at later levels (or else get a game pad)<br />
<br />
What positive advice would you pass on?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">make sure you max defence, you will need it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Never be jealous of race or the benifiets they get. The point is to have fun and if its not fun your playing the wrong race or game. Pick what you want cause you like it and its what you envision as a shaman and never look back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hail,<br />
<br />
1.  Read all the stickied threads in every forum found here, whether you feel they apply to you or not.  This is especially true for threads in the Medicine Cabinet.<br />
<br />
2.  The game is 5 years old.  Find a mentor (who plays a Shaman as their main) who is willing to help you with advice in-game as you gain levels.<br />
<br />
3. Buy a mount as soon as you get cannibalize if you can afford it.  <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Learn to both solo and group right from the start.  <br />
<br />
Just because you can solo to 65 doesn't mean you should (advice I wish I had taken myself).<br />
<br />
Take time to learn as many skills as you can while you're young.  It's much harder to raise them later.<br />
<br />
Save your training points till later.  It's much easier to get skill-ups in the beginning and you may want to use those points to boost a reluctant skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>ShamanTukk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Play the game!<br />
<br />
Don't get so dazzled by the lewt and power that you rush by all the things EQ has to offer. Most of the people who've been around this game for a long time will tell you, straight up and un-ashamed, that their best memories are more likely to involve a Staff of the Observers than some Elemental bonker, and a good Fear break than some 2-hour battle with ONE Uber-MOB in (name the expansion). That their groups and their guilds mean more than ANY item, or spell, or whatever. That their favorite players were people who were FUN to be around, whether they were leet-skilled or not.<br />
<br />
IMHO, it's the mad dash to the end-game that has tired so many people of EQ, because the constant struggle between the developers (Verant/Sony) and the high-achievers (power players), to create and conquer a never-ending stream of content, has generated a hostile environment that just ain't a lot of fun.<br />
<br />
Which games should be.<br />
<br />
So, to repeat myself, play the game, and let 65 w/600 AA's and superuberlewt happen when they happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">1.  Don't beg for anything.<br />
2.  Ask higher level shaman for advice ingame<br />
3.  Don't do something just because 95 percent of the people playing the shaman class does it.  For example...Get to 65 first and then do AA.  Play the way you want to play that is most enjoyable to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">1. Understand you are 95% of the time a grouping class. You can solo a little bit but you will get vastly faster experience grouping. If that bothers you, if you want a solo-machine, make something else.<br />
<br />
2. Team with a high dps class now and then to level fast. Mage, Monk, Ranger, that kind of thing.  Don't have to always duo, grouping in real groups is vital, but this helps now and then.<br />
<br />
3. Abjuration will be your toughest skill to raise since it's rarely used.<br />
<br />
4. Raise both 1h blunt and piercing.<br />
<br />
5. Do the canni 2 quest or buy it, the spell is very useful.<br />
<br />
And I very much agree with Mangler's point number 3, in the post above.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for any starting out, bouncing questions off a higher one (and on Rodcet, if I'm on, I'm always open for questions, but do NOT ask for items/money/buffs, ever) is a great way to go. (even cross server, though do realize cross-server tells get lost between zones, so if I, or someone else, doesn't respond, try it again)<br />
<br />
If you're looking for &quot;help starting&quot; as a new character (or even an already experienced character, but new to playing a shaman), you will be MUCH better received if your initial conversation starts with &quot;Hello, Can I ask you a question, please?&quot; (Note: Can replace &quot;Hello&quot; with &quot;Hi&quot;, but if you shorten any other part of it, like &quot;you&quot; or &quot;please&quot;, it will not be very well received)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Otherwise I would say:<br />
<br />
1) Pick Ogre<br />
or<br />
2) Group as much as possible.  Even when its easy to solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Drylar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">advice from a higher level....<br />
1) Ignore what most say, Canni 2 is worth it.<br />
2) Try to avoid mana regen buffs, get used to running wihout and canni'ing. You'll understand later in life why. <br />
3) When asking for ANYTHING... NEVER EVER EVER shorten words to the point of them not being words, or purposeful mispellings. IE sow plz=ignore, can u plz donate some lewt?=ignore, Excuse me, Mr. Kitty sir, would you mind casting spirit of the wolf?=I'll travel a few zones to go buff the guy, and then it'll most likely be a full buff.<br />
4) 2 items to look into getting are a parrying dagger (found on decaying skellies, or vendors near them, Halas usually has some on vendors), and a fishing cleaver (vendor sold, in shar vahl, one of the vendors in the little hallway between the walls going to the palace). look like a dagger in off hand and sword in primary. insta-rogue. couple with /role or /anon, and very very few buff beggars, the ones that do ask are people that know you or cheaters with hack programs.<br />
5) If you wanna say you solo'd X mob, kei and virtue DO NOT COUNT. they aren't your buffs, so you had help killing.<br />
6) Get clickies. Which ones? The ones that make you more effective in a pinch. Keep them on you 'just in case' as the case usualy arrives when you don't have them. IE snare, tash, stun, etc... If you don't know which, ask. Someone will.<br />
7) If you are in a rush, still quest. Quests don't always give the best items, but it does help make more of a story out of the game. Quests also break the monotony of grinding.<br />
8) Even if you solo 99.9% of the time, and don't care to raid, find a good &quot;family&quot; guild early in your career. Stick with them, they'll be new people when you meet, but you'll have a family to fall back on when needed. If you outgrow them, still keep in touch.<br />
9) Don't get mad if you want to solo all the time and see X or Y shaman with really nice gear that you can't get. IF you want it, get into a riad guild, but be prepared for the game aspect to be gone, you will then have a job with set hours, and occasional loot your only payment.<br />
10) Most important of all, if you are in doubt, seek the answer. Either in game by doing a /who all shaman 65 and sending a tell, or coming and posting here, there's usually an answer, and alot of times, good advice to be had as well.<br />
<br />
If you are on the Xev server, feel free to drop me a line. Drylar, Prophet of the Dar Khura. Kitty shaman of the 65th hairball. Following #3 in my post, if your tell includes mispelled words such as &quot;phat&quot; or &quot;lewt&quot; or you shorten please, you, or the like, i'll ignore it. if it's really bad or gets spammy, you go on /ignore. if you're not on xev, i'm at xev.Drylar if you wanna catch me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
im not sure how true this is.. but i know i was kicking myself for only having canni1, and by the time i got around to doing canni2.. i was already at the level for cann3.. so id say even if it IS worse, still try and get the spell.. so you can see for yourself instead of going by what the majority have told you (which is what happened to me :p)<br />
<br />
oh.. and listen to this guy, he knows his stuff :) especially the polite requests part.. i can count on one hand how many times i was asked politely by strangers (friends dont count, heh).. which is, coincidently.. how many people were asked if they would like full buffs along with their sow.. funny how that happens, aint it?</div></div><hr />

Canni 2 is sold now by the Hatem, the Shaman spell vendor in Abysmal Sea (GoD) it costs 12pp. Tell all your Friends/Guilds.<br />

QUOTE]<br />
<br />
I disagree personally on these points.  Shaman are a GREAT soloing class,  95 percent is way off.  Sometimes people can only be online for an hour and a half or so, and these days 15 minute of that is getting out of PoK, 15 minutes getting a group, and not many people will be excited if you have to leave an hour after joining up.<br />
<br />
Solo if you have fun soloing.  Group if you have fun grouping, but try to make sure you spend at least 25 percent doing the one you favor the least, to keep your skills in that area up.<br />
<br />
DIVINATION was a lot harder than abjuration to raise for me (heck I used inner fire up until I received a Talisman at 34, and I kept the AC buffs up until I got my pet, also at 34), and if you fancy exploring, you will need that Invisibility when you finally get it.<br />
<br />
As for my tips, though they've already been stated... DO NOT beg, make friends (since non ldon pickup groups below 60 are a thing of the past), and most of all, READ the medicine cabinet.  Reading the manual alone can cause you to screw up your character SO BAD... Sony's vision of the game compared to how the metagame actually is, is about the same as comparing black and white.<br />
<br />
Oh, and ABOVE ALL, if you need advice, or wish for a res or some help, PLEASE do it politely.  Make the /tell considerably long, do NOT use acronyms, apologize for the inconvenience, and say you would appreciate it if they could spare the time, but you understand if they can't, etc.  Nothing angers higher level people more than &quot;SoW plx&quot; or &quot;Can I hav money?&quot; Or even &quot;What spell lvl is cani4?&quot; Those get filed under the ignoreables, whereas politeness is so rare, it might get you some consideration.  Also, please don't play this game if you are under 16 (unless you are particularly gifted), when you actually start to gain the ability to contemplate how your actions affect others.</div></div><hr />

I enjoyed these days so much that I made a shaman ALT and leveled them to 51 just to occasionally relive the fun.<br />
<br />
At 51:<br />
<br />
JBB is good dps, DogDog can hold aggro if dual wielding and hasted, Kei/Horse keeps the mana bar full if all you are doing is slowing and ocasionally healing the pup.<br />

Cast them on yourself first, so that you know when to refresh.<br />
<br />
Cast them on the MT last, so that you have time to refresh before they wear off.  If no enchanter, this becomes important with haste.<br />
<br />
Enjoy the game in the lower levels, where a Shaman is still a valued class.  You can usually get by being the healer for the whole group, if you limit your buffing.  Our versatility and power pre-lvl 60 is/was one of the things that made this class great.<br />
<br />
Be generous.  As you travel, buff the newbs.  Make a spellset for the newb buffs (sub-40), to save time.  When you see a newer player having problems with a mob, stop and help/heal them.  <br />
<br />
Post 60, we become less valuable.  Learn to enjoy dungeon crawling.  Droga, Veksar, and AC become your new zones.  Pay for your 61-65 spells by living in these zones.<br />
<br />
Get a VP key, if you want to want to add to your places to go.<br />
<br />
If soloing get's boring, and you really like the game, start a second account a 2-box a SK/Shaman combo.  Hopefully, you made a Troll or an Ogre Shaman, so you can make your SK the same race and both enjoy the same city.<br />
<br />
Evil Shammies kick butt. <br />
<br />
You don't have to be a member of &quot;uber guild 01&quot; to enjoy this game.  Join a guild that is strong enough for you to attain your epic, but isn't so overwhelmed with raiding that you lose the perspective of having fun.  Yeah, they're still out there.  Fewer of them now, but still there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Try grouping or duoing with different players--do not be locked into a single model for play.<br />
<br />
When you group with an unusual class grouping or new players, start with something you can handle pretty easily to get a feel for how good you are.<br />
<br />
SHaman stack OK in a single group at certain levels. With cleric and druid demand high for their better healing, shaman stack pretty well on healing in areas where slow is not mitigated too much. Between two of you, several mobs can get slowed and rooted or off-tanked prety quick, and combined, your heals can keep most folks alive if they can step out of range of a slowed mob or tank.  Shaman can even off-tank slowed mobs in many zones.<br />
<br />
Learn how to pull as soon as possible using stalking probe, root, debuffs, and slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Take your time. By this, I mean the following:<br />
<br />
1. Enjoy yourself. Take the time to explore some old world zones, and don't rush to get to 65. Enjoy each level, and enjoy the zones you play in and the people you meet. <br />
<br />
2. Be polite! Buff folks who ask, and make some friends. When you ask a question of someone, be polite and courteous, and flaunt your command of the English language (ie. no &quot;plz&quot; or &quot;thx&quot; crap). When you leave a group, find a replacement. Just show simple, common courtesy to folks. A good reputation is invaluable.<br />
<br />
3. Work your skills up. This is long, boring and tedious, but it will serve you well in your older days. Yes, this means standing in a place where you won't bother folks with cast spam and casting that spell over and over and over and over ...<br />
<br />
4. Cannibalize. Some folks here have suggested you purchase a mount ASAP, but I'd really rather see you spend the 9k on good, serviceable gear that will last. Learn the art (yes, art!!) of the canni-dance.<br />
<br />
5. Don't purchase/quest gear just to have it. Money will be tight for many seasons, so when you purchase a piece of gear, make sure it is something that will last. HP/AC, STA, WIS. Learn it, tattoo it on your arm.<br />
<br />
6. Read the Crucible every single day. Read the Medicine Cabinet. Read the Equipment gear check threads. Read, read, read.<br />

Best piece of advice I can give ya.  Sure not ALL of the brillant minds on this board are there, and you still get great info here on the site that you forgot to ask about in game, but if you ever want a shaman question answered fast and accurately while ingame, that's the place to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Skip all that above crap! Buy my shaman :-p<br />
<br />
just kidding, seriously though. This is what made EQ enjoyable to me.<br />
<br />
1) quest. Do quests for gear and avoid the bazaar. Yes, having uberitem001 woudl be nice, but getting that paw yourself or that testimate of vaneer, or even sneaking into KC and asking to loot some nodrop gear is much more fun then farming cash for gear. This brings me to point 2.<br />
<br />
2) dont worry about gear. It will come in time, just have fun and level up.<br />
<br />
3) Group often. Its fun and will make you friends, you MUST have friends in a mmorpg, especially for raids and epic quests. Find a guild with said friends.<br />
<br />
4) Dont get mad. Its a game, if your not having fun, take a break, see the sun. I know too many people addicted to this game who can't handle it. (I even know some people who physically cry when they have problems)<br />
<br />
6) Never ever ever ever ever let a game come between you and your job/girlfriend/school/friends. Just dont<br />
<br />
7) Sometimes the best xp zones, arn't the best zones. Travel around, try new things and zones. See that great content you spend money for.<br />
<br />
9) Smack bandel for me. God damn kill stealing barbie!<br />
<br />
10) sneak from halas to freeport just once before level 10.<br />
<br />
and finally<br />
<br />
11) make sure to get summoned but every high end mob you fight and be proud of it :-)</div></div><hr />

It's also embarassing. When you get high enough level remember the number 1924 - that's the hit you take when you trigger CAN V. Also remember, mobs find you tastier when you're at a Low HP level. That's bad too.</div></div><hr />

Then I realized I wasn't playing a shaman, I was playing a rogue (DPS on that REIF rivaled alot of rogues at that level) with kickass spells.  I didn't even bother slowing (/gasp!) mobs of buffing myself (double /gasp!) because I never got below 75% life.<br />
<br />
I gave the fungi to my 48 SK (where it has rotted since) and vowed to never get KEI again.  I used to click it off when I got it in groups with chanters.  I learned to truly how to play a shaman.  Cannidance, mana management, taking turns letting pet tank, etc.<br />
<br />
There is NOTHING worse than being in a group and the pally tank or cleric healer says &quot;be right back guys, need KEI&quot; then runs off for 25 minutes.  Was in a pickup group on my SK the other day and a SHAMAN did this.  I was embarrassed for her =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>stanislao</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Those are my pieces of advice thinking that you are looking to get to 65 with many AAs and stuff.<br />
<br />
- Keep your defense maxed.<br />
- Group mainly to make friends / get fast experience / learn how to do your job.<br />
- Solo to keep your melee skills up or to get drops that you need.<br />
- If you want to do tradeskills hunt in areas for your level that have drops you may need later. Even if you have to hold em in a mule bank for many levels. It's a waste of time kill greenie just to get tradeskills up.<br />
- Keep your defense maxed.<br />
- Keep every melee skill up.<br />
- Once you get close to cann5 try to get equipment that add HP and stamina. Your goal is to be able to use it self buffed without get low hp aggro.<br />
- Dont waste AA points in stats. Just get run speed 3 and hp regen3.<br />
- Get everything you need to get Cann5 first.<br />
- Your 1 point bash can interrupt spells and freeze the mob for a second. <br />
- Keep your defense maxed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And looking at common mistakes:<br />
<br />
- Learn how to manage aggro when in a group. Don't ping pong mobs wasting clerics mana on you. <br />
- If the cleric in group don't get it... Explain to use fast heals until the mob is slowed. Then it's ok to complete heal.<br />
- If you want to melee when grouping hit the mob from the back to avoid getting riposte on you.<br />
- If you use your pet while grouping try to sick it on the mob from the back.<br />
- Don't melee the mob and then say that you need to meditate.<br />
- In group don't waste mana using dots that will just do damage for just few ticks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Enjoy the journey and take your time.  There are people who are in such a rush to get to the end-game that they completely skip Paw, Guk, SolA/B, Dalnir,  Kaesora and go the easy route of Powerleveling Caverns--&gt;LOIO--&gt;OT--&gt;&lt;insert easy brain-dead zone here&gt;. Thesedays I'm sure the dungeons I mentioned are probably empty but go there anyway. Make a run from Halas to WFP when you get sow and see how far you get :) Odds are you won't make it past NK but it's sure as hell fun trying. <br />
<br />
Do the totemic quests even though you can buy better at the bazaar. Ah I still remember getting killed over and over in Unrest trying to get those barbed bones! But when I finally got them I was so excited. *Note* This is sad, I just looked at www.eqshaman.com and don't see the guide for totemic quests anymore :( Those are still some of the early memories that stand out for me because it forced me to travel to Unrest, Najena, Permafrost and other zones that I might have otherwise skipped.<br />
<br />
And finally, take the long boat ride in OOT from FP to Faydark and just soak it all in.<br />
<br />
I bought this game in early 2000 and am still 3 steps away from my Epic and there is still so much to see. No rush for me  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Be Nice!<br />
<br />
Being nice is more important than anything else both in game and out.<br />
<br />
You have the ability to have a real positive impact on the emotional well being of real people.  This is more important than any power you may wield in the game.<br />
<br />
At the end of a game session ask yourself &quot;did I help other folks have a good time?&quot;  If you can answer &quot;yes,&quot;  then you had a successful round of gaming regardless what experience or loot you may have gotten.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Freecare Spiritwise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Dont play everquest anymore and go to find a girl friend ;-)<br />
<br />
That doesn't take into account having a wife / girlfriend that plays, or the fact that there's lots of cute single women that play EQ. I know lots of couples that play, and some that have even met on EQ. My wife has a 65 BL, and we have great fun playing together. EQ doesn't have to be at the expense of your social life, and if it is, then maybe you shouldn't be playing.<br />
<br />
My advice for a new shaman:<br />
<br />
-- Don't be a druman! Wisdom is nice, but hitpoints &gt; All.<br />
<br />
-- Don't be afraid to solo. We have a lot to offer in groups, but for most shaman, soloing is the best way to get a full spell book.<br />
<br />
-- Don't listen to the negativity about shaman. Sure we have our limitations, but we are still a great class.<br />
<br />
-- As others have stated, don't get too wrapped up in progression / gear / flags. I believe that skill &gt; gear, and there's still great fun to be had even if you're not PoTime flagged. I've watched the high end game burn out half the people I know, while I'm still having fun.<br />
<br />
-- Get a mentor. Somebody who knows the shaman class inside and out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Ghobster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">If you think you're going to play hard core, pick a different class.  Shamans are useless in the high end game.  otherwise, they're fun until you hit that wall!<br />
<br />
Shamans can't be hardcore? Why not?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>HordainPrima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Because there is the unfortunate few who haven't yet realized that there is no wall.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Esquel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Make a Beastlord instead, but if you absolutely have to be a shaman (for raiding purposes) choose Ogre.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Moglyzok Moogleman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">One thing that might not have been stated yet but I'm gonna be the broken record and emphasize one point I think is almost the most important : MAKE FRIENDS!!!  No matter who they are, trust me a good friend on EQ can be one of the best things about it, hell even a newbie asking for a bit of help, then taking whoever it is under your wing so to speak can be quite fun. Having fun is very important, but having friends makes it fun, trust me my character hunted in Crystal Caverns way back when that was the place to be, and quite frankly it was horrible.  No one to send tells to except my brother, dieing would be a nightmare, etc... So if there is one thing you want to know more than anything its to make some friends, they will help you at any time and friends are just fun to hang out with and maybe grind some exp, even it if sucks, it will be better than soloing for hours talking to no one...</div></div><hr />
