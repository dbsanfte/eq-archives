<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tyck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is buried deep in another thread, but I think it is important enough to deserve more visibility.<br />
<br />
We have asked for a long time now &quot;what is our healing role in regard to the other priests?&quot;<br />
<br />
Here, perhaps unintentionally, we can gain some insight into how and why our healing ablities are what they are.  To sum it up, we are ballanced as being 47% of the HP/second healing ability of a Cleric.<br />
<br />
Hey gang,<br />
<br />
Sorry I didn’t post about this earlier. I was waiting for the numbers to be on test server, which I thought was going to be a lot sooner then today, but anyway…<br />
<br />
The new spell parameters should put shaman heals on the same ratio that they were for Planes of Power spells:<br />
<br />
Supernal Light: 2750<br />
Nature’s Infusion: 1750<br />
Tnarg’s Mending: 1300<br />
<br />
Comparatively for HP/Second:<br />
Supernal Light:  100%<br />
Nature’s Infusion: 64%<br />
Tnarg’s Mending: 47%<br />
<br />
With the new Daluda:<br />
<br />
Holy Light: 3275<br />
Sylvan Infusion: 2100<br />
Daluda’s Mending: 1550<br />
<br />
for the same comparative HP/second as the PoP heals:<br />
Supernal Light:  100%<br />
Nature’s Infusion: 64%<br />
Daluda's Mending: 47%<br />
<br />
Likewise, the Quiescence and Breath of Trushar changes should make the HoT balance equal from PoP to Gates between Clerics and Shaman.<br />
<br />
Still looking at the slow mitigation concerns in several gates zones.<br />
<br />
Again, sorry I didn’t get this info out earlier, and for letting the bad mana cost on Breath of Trushar go live.  There’s really no excuse for that blunder.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shoendesae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">So, this means that the small gain that fell short of our 1800hp request was planed based on the 47% ratio the designers orginally came up with for PoP.<br />
<br />
Nice, so they just , what? ~forgot~ to maintain that for GoD? and 3 patches later it finally makes it to test because we cried so loud? <br />
<br />
Hmm, well i guess we can take the slow mitigation is still under review portion as somewhat ~good~ news, unless that's just more ~hey guy! look over here~ speak.<br />
<br />
Either way, big job or not, SOE developers are NOT doing 100% of their job...more like 47% if you ask me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Maintaining a quick healing ratio designed on prior game design parameters will not work. Efficient Complete Heal and group healing is the cleric's domain. For secondary back up healing , i.e., the quick heal line, there is little or no reason for the shaman emergency healing to heal less or to be slower to cast or refresh than the cleric's emergency healing. <br />
<br />
Shaman's healing overall is so ineffective that the only spell that can be used is Tnarg's mending. In GoD encounters, a shaman can be back up healer at best. Thus, the shaman's quick heal is the often if not usually being used on the cleric, or to support a tank until the CH lands. <br />
<br />
While it would be unbalancing for the quick heal to be so efficient that a shaman can chain cast it to take the place of a cleric's better CH efficiency, this balance issue should be dealt with solely through mana efficiency. Thus, give cleric's, druid's, and shaman's quick heal  the same cast and refresh timing and amount healed, but make the mana cost for druids and then shaman be that much higher (the ratios above might work). Everyone is happy--shaman can spot heal to save the cleric, druis or tank, but cannot chain cast the quick heal because of mana efficiency.<br />
<br />
We need enough quick healing power to manage one round of unslowed attack on a cleric. 1550 is not going to do it for GOD. If we cannot keep a cleric alive for one round, we are useless as secondary healers in these Gates of Discord encounters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tyck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Now, checking the numbers to our relative position to Druids only.<br />
<br />
1300 vs 1750<br />
1550 vs 2100<br />
<br />
both give a number of about 74% (74.2 and 73.8)<br />
<br />
Ryan,<br />
    Could you also add Kragg's Mending to the list of spells to review?    <br />
<br />
lvl 58 - 10 second big heals (75% max) - from SoL<br />
Tunare's Renewal (DRU) 2925 hp<br />
Kragg's Mending (SHM) 1950 hp   = 66.6 %  (not 74% !!!)<br />
<br />
If the ratio established above were continued, Kragg's Renewal should be doing 2175 hp. <br />
<br />
Additionally, I think many would like to see a level 64 version of this spell added.  The original spell slot in the DB for it from PoP Beta is still available.<br />
<br />
lvl 64 - 10 second big heals (75% max) - from PoP<br />
Tunare's Renewal (DRU) 4680 hp<br />
Khura's Mending (SHM) 3480 hp   = 74% (proposed)<br />
<br />
fixed typo with name of spells.  Should have been Mending *smack*</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">CH is on it's way out anyway especially in single group situations. It's just simply too slow casting for alot of situations. Even in raid situations we already use Supernal/holy light chains rather than CH chains often times. The pace of the game just doesn't allow 10 second casting spells to be very effective anymore. Personally I could care less about ever getting a CH type upgrade.</div></div><hr />

Why does Sony base new spells &amp; abilities off old content?  I mean, isn't that why warriors were so broken by the time that PoP came around?  If Sony put some real thought into creating content early on instead of half assing everything, they'd avoid most of the complaints...<br />
<br />
Stop basing class balancing off old content and for once, think specifically about the roles of each class going in to new content and what they will need to compete.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
  The problem with that as several people have already posted, is that clerics do not use cheal in GoD and to be honest even on raids cheal is going away. In GoD clerics are using SL until they can get HL. And if druids and shamans have the exact same spell (the efficiency dosent matter ) then clerics lose any advantage we have as a specialist class. As many of the shaman hear know I am not against shaman improvements, I have even made several posts here with suggestions; However the truth is that clerics can only do 1 thing and that is heal, while I am not against improvements to the other priests, I do however feel that shaman asking to have the same healing spells as a cleric is way beyond reasonable. Once again remeber in GoD I am using HL, and threw out a excpedtion I may cast one group heal, for 99.5% of the time i only use single tgt elixir's and light. So what do you think would be the result of shaman having the exact same healng power as a cleric?<br />
(and when you answer this remeber clerics are only using 2 spells  in GoD 1 is a HoT and the 2nd is the quick heal your asking for) And do not use the rezz BS, we all know that clerics do not get groups for thier ability to rezz. We get groups due to the fact we are the best healers, and in GoD that heal is SL / HL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">i don't think any of us are actually asking for the same fast heal that cleric's get.  most of us aren't even asking for the same quick heal that druids get.  what we are asking for is something similar to a druid's though.<br />
<br />
and like your argument about rez, for god, most shamans are saying that slow should not be a reason why they are denied a better heal more on par with druids since slow matters so little in many of those zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Pinot Noir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If our heal is enough at 47% of Cleric, our slow mitigation should follow this rule.<br />
Our slow reduces Mobs hits untill 25%.(without mitigation).<br />
So..mitigation rate should keep greater than 70.7%.<br />
<br />
75% x 70.7% = 53%.... it means that mobs hit 47%.<br />
<br />
if mitigation rate is under 70%, healing rate should be changed.<br />
<br />
if our heal with slow will be equal as druid heal (64%),<br />
mitigation rate should keep greater than 35.4%.<br />
<br />
75% x 35.4% =26.6%  it means that mobs hit 73.4%<br />
<br />
47%heal is 73.4% of 64% heal so.<br />
<br />
Probably they used these stupid calcuration.<br />
<br />
But in my opinion, they are only playing with numbers.<br />
Because it does not count any casting time of our slow and debuff.<br />
<br />
As our fighting time gets shorter and mobs hit harder per time, <br />
these formula and mitigation rate become useless and meanless.<br />
Because our debuff casting time will become bigger hazard.<br />
<br />
conclusion; mitigation rate should be bigger than 50% or more,<br />
otherwise we need 0 sec unresistable slow..  :p <br />
<br />
Of course we have another supplemental option of heal, HoT...<br />
We cast HoT on MT before debuff, but it is too weak.<br />
Common debuff procedure (malos &amp; Turgur) takes 8sec (5 + 3)<br />
Within 8 sec Druid can cast heal twice .. it means 1750x2 (even Nature's Infusion), our great HoT can heal 840 hp.<br />
(I gave up to compare with cleric... you know the reason why...)<br />
<br />
Our new slow might change this situation (if this spell can land on the mobs easily...) , but that spelll is not easy to get (it is rare and ND)<br />
And I never bet against such a stupid gamble that the first slow always lands on mobs. <br />
<br />
If my post seems to be very impolite to Dev team, it is against my will.<br />
If everyone feel so, I will delete it.<br />
This post is only suggestion and my opinion, I never criticize anyone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This isn't a detailed, planned change (as should have been done with GOD came out in the first place).  This is a quick-fix change.  Ryan, or whoever, chose a sensible path to make sure that the changes were sane that did not require a whole lot of testing/balancing.  Makes sense to me.<br />
<br />
The followup would be to do a more complete evaluation, and possibly try out some different solutions on test.<br />
<br />
I endorse Tyck's analysis for the 75% CH's, btw.  Our current percentage heal is 100% useless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">our percentage heal should be usless. Its a level 58 spell ...<br />
<br />
At the time we get KM its a solid spell and pretty much just meant to hold us over till we get Torpor or Quiescence. Frankly i dont think will ever see a upgrade to it. We heal with HoT's and Blasting, i feel this is the &quot;vision&quot; SoE has come up with us. I feel they simply split up cleric healing and made us the HoT kings and the druids the Direct Heal queens. Infact this is what we asked. Now we have to get used to the changes and accept the draw backs to being this kind of a healer.<br />
<br />
Mind you that doesnt mean that our HoT shouldnt be better or blast heal, but i think one should come at the problem with this understanding.</div></div><hr />

I have to agree with a statement like this, solely based on the fact that we don't bring anything else to the table in the high end game.  Something has to be done, and if healing is what it is than lets do it.  I'm ready to be effective.</div></div><hr />

I stand by my words. We are not designed to have big direct heals. The way we heal is with HoT's and blast healing, even if you cant get BoT i feel this is pretty obvious that its how SoE wants it and for a more direct point, its what us as a shaman asked for. It might not be what YOU asked for or SHE asked for or I asked for , but it was the majority and we got it. <br />
<br />
Frankly i dont have a problem with this. I feel if we did have a big direct heal then we would be stuck int he same place druid are. Not really wanted for much else then to be a replacement cleric. Im sorry my friends, but i hate healing, its a boring and mind numbing task and was not why i rolled a shaman. Ill do it if i have to, but please forgive me if im not jumping out of my seat and screaming in support of a new CHeal. :(<br />

<br />
I'm one of the 'radicals', and even I never said give us cleric heals. In an ideal EQ, where the priests were redesigned to be more like plate tanks interchangability, yeah - they'd all be able to heal in any group, and they'd all have equal ress (or nearly equal). But working with EQ such as it is now, we need better heals closer or equal to druids, but no more.</div></div><hr />

Actualy i think it should be MORE if anything cause of how we heal. We heal with HoT's which is alot harder to deal with then a Direct Heal IMHO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">So why is healing balanced 100%, 64%, 47%?<br />
<br />
Which one of the plate tanks is 47% as effective tanking as a warrior? I really want to know so I avoid getting one as my MT on accident.<br />
<br />
I don't know about 47%, but the other plate tanks in GoD are not wanted much any more, because they can't tank as well as warriors. SKs are often relegated to pullers, and paladins are even worse off. Even 10kHP+ paladins are struggling to get trials groups.<br />
<br />
The problem is mostly in GoD - the trials in particular have become a search for the ideal group of:<br />
<br />
Warrior, cleric, enchanter, FD puller, backup healer (druid/cleric) + one other (dps preferred).<br />
<br />
You can do trials with other configurations, but that combination seems to be the desired ideal, and several classes are relegated to the last spot, paladins and shamans among them. It's further complicated in that you'll want an evaccer/snarer there too if possible.<br />
<br />
Shamans can replace an enchanter if we're lucky, and if the group is willing to go in without a mezzer.<br />
<br />
But GoD has taken us back to the days of the holy trinity, and then some.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1300 vs 1750<br />
1550 vs 2100<br />
<br />
both give a number of about 74% (74.2 and 73.8)<br />
<br />
Ryan,<br />
    Could you also add Kragg's Mending to the list of spells to review?    <br />
<br />
lvl 58 - 10 second big heals (75% max) - from SoL<br />
Tunare's Renewal (DRU) 2925 hp<br />
Kragg's Mending (SHM) 1950 hp   = 66.6 %  (not 74% !!!)<br />
<br />
If the ratio established above were continued, Kragg's Renewal should be doing 2175 hp. <br />
<br />
Additionally, I think many would like to see a level 64 version of this spell added.  The original spell slot in the DB for it from PoP Beta is still available.<br />
<br />
lvl 64 - 10 second big heals (75% max) - from PoP<br />
Tunare's Renewal (DRU) 4680 hp<br />
Khura's Mending (SHM) 3480 hp   = 74% (proposed)<br />
<br />
fixed typo with name of spells.  Should have been Mending *smack*<br />
<br />
You are on to something.  I started another thread before I saw this post.<br />
<br />
The 10 second &quot;complete&quot; heals should certainly follow the same &quot;rules&quot; as the other heals.  If that were to be the case our &quot;complete&quot; heal should be healing 3525 points of damage on a 10 second cast.<br />
<br />
What level this happens at really has little importance, simply that we DONT have it and by all rights SHOULD.</div></div><hr />

Clerics freely admit that the CH is outdated in today's 30 sec encounters. Between all that complaints about not having Invis and how expensive reagents are, Clerics will gladly hand the reigns of the CH chain to anyone that will take them. Upgrading this spell will only place your Bear butt on the chain gang.</div></div><hr />

Not that hard to understand why shaman dps/healing has become such an issue in short fights.</div></div><hr />

Maybe.  But I doubt it.<br />
<br />
There is no way a 3500 pt heal will ever replace a 7500 pt heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">A 3500 pt heal... maybe not... but 2 shamans in the rotation at the same time frame... both casting 3500 pt heals... could.

Sounds like you do Luclin type mobs.<br />

For now. :) I'm hoping to build up a lot of DKP by the time we're on mobs from whom I want loot. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I appreciate your comments.  I too am at the &quot;happy&quot; place with my Shaman.  Mid 50's.  At this level, in the content I play, I feel very important and needed.<br />
<br />
All of the conversation about the failure of Shaman is focused on post 65 content.  Elemental Planes, Time, GoD.<br />
<br />
I can safely say that up until that content, Shaman is without a doubt one of the most enjoyable and rewarding classes in the game.  Sure there are some minor annoyances, but boy it is FUN to play a mid 50's Shaman.<br />
<br />
The people complaining here want that feeling back.  The FUN.  I am behind them because I don't want it to go away as I advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Yeah, Prototypes, Rumblecrush, Vindi, Xanamech, that level. <br />
I just mentioned that because you will soon notice that shaman healing on rampage tanks will get pretty tricky. When mobs start to rampage for 2-3k a hit, you will face a tough time healing that with Tnarg's mending.<br />
<br />
So long<br />
Nirtox</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">I completely believe that, and I support the efforts of those further along than I am who are highlighting these issues. <br />
<br />
I've grouped in Tactics, and had only one foray into GoD so far, and a few hard LDoNs. No way I can do more there than just keep Q on the puller/dpser, and tnarg the healer if under attack.<br />
<br />
Even at this point, I have to tell people in some groups, if I am the only healer, that they get Q on the pull, but they don't get a heal until the mob gets slowed, since I can't out-heal unslowed mob dps, so don't expect the heal until the slow lands.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Popu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">As much as everyone may hate this, I think SOE screwed themselves balance wise on this expansion by not raising the level cap.<br />
<br />
Level caps suck for the grind, but it also gives them room to add upgrades to the spell lines. Maybe think by using the content itself to limit progression it's the same thing. Fortunately I am in a high end guild on my server so my chances are better than most, but I'm not holding my breath.  <br />
<br />
There are just too many players out there where it will be a long time if ever for them to see any of the new spells because they do not have the time or inclination to participate in raids to at least acquire Elemental gear.</div></div><hr />
