<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i never understood how come so much gear was MNK DRU BST.  perhaps Sony wanted to try and pull one over on us and say that BST was really a monk / druid cross.  but i thought it sucked that some of that gear i really wanted.<br />
<br />
this is worse.  seems all the stuff that was RNG ROG SHM has now got a BER added onto the end of it.<br />
<br />
and really, most of that gear after lvl 51 is not even an upgrade till after 61.  <br />
<br />
now i just wonder if they get FA and a slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">um, okay.  What does being a chain class have to do with getting FA and slow?  There are cloth, plate, leather and chain classes that can slow.<br />

----------------------------<br />
- Please note that many items will now show as being usable by berserkers. This does not necessarily mean the items will be equippable by berserkers when Gates of Discord launches.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Elira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No offence and all.. but it seems to me that most items (barring class specific ones) are broken down into either class archtypes (priest, pure caster, melee) or by armor type (chain, plate, leather, etc). it sounds to me like the berserker is going to be a chain class. so hating them because they're a chain class means you have to hate rogues and rangers also.. right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">From looking at Lucy they get Snare, Stun, and Dot procs from summoned weapons.  Not sure how it works but those utilities  + some dps sound like a fun class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Actually a benefit is that there will be another class that will be willing to buy your cast off armor that is RNG, ROG, SHM &amp; BER.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i never understood how come so much gear was MNK DRU BST.<br />
<br />
Because Sony made them a leather class working off the 3/4 melee, 1/4 caster paradigm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">deleted post...  didn't have my coffee yet and was getting snippy.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">They wear chain so you hate them?  They are going to be wearing chain, thus they are going to steal all our abilities and replace us in groups?  And what was that blurb about armor after 51 not being an upgrade until 61?<br />
<br />
I think people are running out of things to cry about on this boards and are starting to just make **** up.  This thread shouldnt even exist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Five plate classes.<br />
Four silk classes.<br />
Three leather classes.<br />
And now a fourth chain class.<br />
<br />
I see no problems.  Except that it appears all the other chain classes are DPS.  This is obvious discrimination and we should get backstab or dual wield!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grimdreg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">More chain classes may mean more chain stuff coming out of the new expansion, which is always cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">interesting logic there bonestomper.<br />
<br />
BER = CHAIN<br />
therefore<br />
BER = SHAMAN that can out melee you!<br />
<br />
sammy.......slappy........SAMSONITE!!! I was WAY OFF!<br />
<br />
may I suggest a cup of sleepytime tea perhaps?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Ya, chain patterns drop so much they rot constantly.  I just don't know what I would do if they added another silk or leather class...lord knows that stuff never gets destroyed. *insert eyeroll here*</div></div><hr />

So....do you hate the people who are posting on this thread because they're smarter than you, or do you think that we all hate you because you're more educated than us?   :confused: <br />
<br />
<br />
Also:  Bwahaha.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">no, i hate myself for making a reference that i only understood.  coupled with the fact that it used the word &quot;hate&quot; in it; and i was to stupid to realize the emotions that that would bring out on this board.<br />
<br />
but i have to admit i guess i also hate myself because i am not smart enough to see how the fact that i happened to make a few errors, makes other people on this thread smater than me.<br />
<br />
perhaps they have not made an error in judgement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Yhakfiend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">If the damage output is high enough, I may have to make one on my 3rd account (currently rogue) to play with my Shaman and Warrior.  <br />
<br />
GG me for hoarding all of my old chain armor and unused warrior 2-handers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Berserkers will not be able to outmelee a Shaman, because we all know that our slow has the effect of slowing time... besides, we have CHA buffs  that make us even more unstoppable.<br />
<br />
Rejoice!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I think it is incredibly stupid to introduce a new melee class.  <br />
<br />
That it's one wearing chain gear sucks, because I don't want any competition at all if possible.  :)<br />
<br />
Anyway, if melee balance hadnt been so screwed for the last 1+, then maybe, but as they are still tinkering with warriors it seems incredibly nutty to me.</div></div><hr />

Because CHA makes your spells land better :)</div></div><hr />

Bah thats nothing  a night of drinking wont solve.  Oh wait, thats the wrong direction....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">LOL, at least the IQ drain on this board is significantly less than on the SOE boards.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Figureing our elemental drop rate for chain is about 13% right now, I dont want another chain class to compete with to get gear.</div></div><hr />

To be fair, it is a pretty obscure reference.  I've personally only seen Tombstone and that line certainly didn't stick with me.  I imagine most of the other people who posted don't recognize it either.</div></div><hr />
