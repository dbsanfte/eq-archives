I spend on average 6 hours per day killing emp(or ph)/blood(or ph) and I have gotten about 2K pp from corpses and no...not one...not just malo or torpor I so desperately wanted that didn't drop......NOT A SINGLE SHAMAN SPELL HAS DROPPED...LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What is your level Sekin ? cause when we killed Emp, he gated once in the middle of his room and we got jumped by skels, maybe it was because of pets or members jumping in the room too, I don t really know<br />
<br />
But do you have some problems killing Emp and his low life gate ?<br />
<br />
Thx for those who answered with a congrats ;)</div></div><hr />

Two main things to know about the Emp...<br />
<br />
1) Pulling with a non damaging spell, otherwise he'll summon you and it's over.  Note that using a high dispell is the best bet since his damage shield is a huge pain.<br />
<br />
2) Keep him in front of the coffin where Blood skelly spawns.  He won't gate if he's close enough to his spawn spot.<br />
<br />
And Gratz :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Matdowns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The easiest thing I do to pull emp is to put Bane of Nife on his pet.  That gets it out of the way and he still doesn't summon you.  I tried camping him, but it was taking forever so I decided to go for 65 to get Q.  Good luck with him<br />
