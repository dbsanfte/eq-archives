<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>xilsharn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">If you haven't gotten this spell yet --<br />
<br />
do.<br />
<br />
I was lucky enough to get this spell for my 44 shaman, and it is game-changing.  Just the plat I save on buying KEI alone is astounding.  I am never, ever, EVER out of mana.  Canni canni canni, stoi, canni canni canni, wash rinse repeat.<br />
<br />
It is a beautiful thing.  I also use it in duos in the DLs, healing my monk or paladin partner over time while I continue to dot, buff, canni, crowd control, whatever.   <br />
<br />
It is, in my relatively brief stint as a shaman, the best spell in my inventory, and certainly the most useful.<br />
<br />
If you don't plan on getting the spell, rethink your decision.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This is advice to get Stoicism Spell, and a walk through. It is not too hard to figure out without a walk through--Hint: The mobs you have to kill are very close to the underwater quest giver, but are in a different zone. After two weeks of being broken, this spell was fixed on Drinal. Thanks SoE for fixing it before the full patch.<br />
<br />
(1) Get it. Wow. Awesome. Game-changing, primarily in allowing Shaman to work hard to develop more mana without KEI. (This is a gimped version of celestial heal, slows attack (33 off unbuffed) and movement (100 off unbuffed), but with Cannibalization is really excellent for Shaman--paladins and clerics have much better heal over time spells.)<br />
<br />
(2) How to get it: <br />
<br />
(a) Gunthak, point south of lighthouse, impassive sea spirit gives quest. (It is on the way, and worth starting right).<br />
<br />
(b) Along the right of the Gunthak Beach is a Cavern. Beach has nasty mix of live and undead, and many level 50s die from trains of greens here. Go slow, use invis, dont train and expect to swim away. Inside Cavern, all are live mobs-invis works well. Take right turns through cavern system and then through open indoor seaside of Gunthak to Dulak Harbor, find and kill drunken pirates for an empty flask. This may take a while. Drunken pirates are to the right. Watch aggro and trains here. There are a couple of corners to fight from here, and invis is your friend, so a pet is difficult. It helps to have a nice group that can plow through a lot of pirates fast, since it often takes 30-50 pirates.<br />
<br />
(c) Gunthak: Turn in empty flask to impassive sea spirit to get stone (giant and did not fit in any container).<br />
<br />
(d) Gunthak: Med, whistle for pet, buff and get ready to fight. Turn in stone to impassive sea spirit to have him call Flotsam and Jetsam spirits who drop no-drop  Piece of Flotsam and Piece of Jetsam. Tuen these into Impassive Sea Spirit for Stoicism Spell.<br />
<br />
Good luck and enjoy, fellow shaman.<br />

Anyway went back to Dulak expecting to spend another 6 hours in the zone to get the flask again, but as luck would have it, the first pirate I killed dropped the flask !

I really understand now what shamans have said about Torpor being a game changing spell!<br />

For all the 44+ shamans out there - if you haven't got this, I'd heartily recommend doing so. Also, the guides on this site were plenty good enough for me to do it, it's pretty straightforward.</div></div><hr />

Well, my judgement says they were very easy at 56, so you should be able to solo them at 45. However, I would take a melee friend, or a higher level along with you to make sure, and let us know how you get on!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Found a good spot, at 50, to hunt the drunken pirates. Loc is 204, -62. One spawns just outside a hut, 2 in the hut with the open door. I was able to park a pet about 2 feet out from the large wooden wall and pull to there. 2 roamers pass by, but surprisingly did not agro (they will come within a few yards of you). My first fight agro'ed an engineer from behind the wall because I tried to stay too close to the wall. Fighting a few feet out kept it from agro'ing. Not sure if I was lucky or they've raised the drop rate, 3rd drunk dropped the bottle. Now if the NPC will just show up...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The Pirates become very easy after the mid 50's, as you can single pull the houses that they spawn in. Often the houses hold more than 4 spawns, which hit for just under 100 and can be annoying for even higher level shamans. But since you can extract the pirates alone in the mid-high 50's the bottle is a much easier thing to obtain.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When you do the quest Be sure and hail the spirit before each and every turn in  Apparently the spirit is quite forgetfull, and will forget what steps you have already completed. Before you turn in the flask, hail the spirit.  Before you turn in the heavy stone, hail the sea spirit.  Before you turn in the parts of flotsam and jetsom Hail the sea spirit.  <br />
<br />
I made the mistake of not hailing when turing in parts of flotsom and jetsom, and the spirit ate them.  So while the quest is working, it is a little buggy.  I had to go BACK to Dulak and camp for another 4 hours before I got another flask.  After than I was very carefull to hail.<br />
<br />
great spell.</div></div><hr />

The shaman right after me, there was a line of like 5 shamans, handed his flask to his dog because it was right on top of the elemental.

Sounds like you got my luck bro<br />
been hunting here last 3 days ( 3 hours per day) killing drunken pirates. I know a guild shm who's first 3 kills got one and another shm was after the flask, one my first day hunting and he got one within 15 min's of looking.<br />
just got on tonight for 1.5 hours and nothing....kinda geting pissed at it now. even been offering 100pp for looting rights.<br />

<br />
So I logged on Friday night, gets my kei, empties me pouches at da bank and runs to Dulak Harbor, I sets up in my favorite spot in the southwest corner of town....<br />
<br />
I check the first house, no drunken pirate spawn around, so I runs to second house....targets the mob and hits him with a slow, running back to my corner....as I pass the first house i agro the drunken pirate who must have spawned while I was next door, so he comes along too<br />
<br />
I kill both pirates and loot....lo and behold.....BOTH of them had emtpy flasks.....so after killing over a hundred pirates I ended up with a rotting flask (cept for that 56 shammie who wandered into the zone to begin his hunt for the first time and got to loot my spare...<br />
<br />
The only thing that could have increased the irony would have been a GM giving me a tell while looting, but hey...maybe they will catch up to me in May</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Maybe they increased the drop rate?<br />
<br />
I got mine two days ago and it took maybe 45 mins to get mine. I killed about 7 or 8 pirates before it dropped.<br />
<br />
Good trick to seeing if a room has a pirate or not (as they sometime hide behind a door or wall where you can't see them from the street) is to use your old asidious vision spell on a mob you can see inside the hut. Then just simply target the pirate and pull out with slow.<br />
<br />
Made it easier since whenever you get too close to the door you get some low blues/greens aggroing which are just a nuisance. So this lets ya stand back and watch or even med in a safe spot while you wait for a pirate to repsawn looking through the eyes of his roomate.<br />

now for those that havent done it, an easy way to get your flask is cast invis on zone in, when you get to the first row of houses walk behind them till you get to the still behind i think its the 3rd house.<br />
this is your pull spot. you will rarly if ever grab agro being here...<br />
buff up, do not pull your pet out(this requires a jbb) cast invis on yourself go target your pirate of choice come back to your pull spot then pull with slow<br />
<br />
your boy might take up to 20 secs to path to you but only once in 4 hours did i get an add....<br />
<br />
jbb to death on arival<br />
<br />
invis and repeat. when you have that entire row of houses clear of pirates(only kill pirates no point unless your with xp group or someting for others) goto the second dock. there are 2 pirates on that row one can be pulled from dock same way one can be pulled from right next to dock.. at 53 i was able to chain kill these guys and kill the last one near the docks before the first repoped, i would throw on invis and sit at his spawn point<br />

He turned it in, got the correct rock, spawned Flotsam &amp; Jetsam, killed them, looted their pieces, turned them in and got...JACK!<br />
<br />
We stayed on two more hours hoping someone would answer a petition, but to no avail.  He wants to do it again tomorrow night, but since we were able to spawn the elementals, I'm afraid there's a different bug than what was previously described here and I'd rather not waste my time until they've fixed it.<br />
<br />
Has anyone else had this problem?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Barans</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">I was able to complete this quest last night (3/19/03) with no problems.  Myself (lvl 50)and a Ranger (lvl 55) friend of mine ran over to Dulak and we got the Empty Flask on the second Drunken Pirate we pulled.<br />
<br />
Rest of the quest was a peice of cake.  As posted earlier be sure to HAIL the Impassive spirit before each hand in...that is what I did and I did not have any issues at all...was pure clockwork.<br />
<br />
After getting the spell I was then able to head over to Jaggedpine and solo the poachers a bit more to ding over to 51!<br />
<br />
Very cool spell indeed. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Jianna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">After talking to my brother on the phone this morning, he is thinking he MAY have given the pieces of flotsam and jetsam to his pet rather than the sea spirit.  We'll be going after the drunks again tonight, I guess.<br />

I am an avid quester.  <br />
Hints for questing: <br />
1. Con the quest npc, you may have done something to lower your faction making it impossible to do the quest without raising your faction first<br />
2. If you have some way to raise your faction (i.e. enchanters alliance spell line, druid wolf form in the old world, etc.) use it for every quest, no matter how good your faction is<br />
3. Always hail the quest npc.  <br />
4. Humor them and go through the conversation with them anyway.  <br />
5. When handing in quest items, be sure to check the name at the top of the trade box (it could be the familiar, pet or npc behind/beside you that you've targeted).  <br />
6. Right click each item in the trade box to be sure you're handing in the correct items.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">well took a friend last night to Dulak to show him where the Drunken Pirates are. He did even better than me! On the 4th pull he got his empty flask.<br />
<br />
Bad news is when he went to hand it in the elemental just ate it. He hailed him, went through the text, handed it in and natta! :(<br />
<br />
5 mins later another shaman came up and did it and it worked for him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Tyrfing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">I love this spell, it is a beautiful thing with Canni.  The quest is working on Quellious but you have to be careful.  First time I got a flask I handed it to the spirit after hailing it and not saying the quest text.  So he ate it.  Second time I handed in the flotsam and jetsom pieces to my puppy.  :o   Believe me, you could hear the howls of agony.   So to be sure the third time I parked the puppy near the entrance when handing in the flask and told him to get lost after I killed flotsam and jetsom.  I also hailed the sea spirit at every step and it worked like a charm.  <br />
