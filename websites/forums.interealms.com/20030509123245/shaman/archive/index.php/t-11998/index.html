No one will oppose the big brother ability of the new found spell once they have had a taste of its true power.  After they have been subdued, I install a puppet goverment to keep the threat of Stoicism a reality if more training continues by informing other shaman and other players of our power.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm a shaman, so I'm not trying to harm my own class, but &quot;being fair&quot; should be applied equally, and griefing others because you've found a loophole in a game, is really not something to be proud of.  When this bug is fixed (and it's clearly a bug), remember posts and discussions like these, and try not to wonder why this is suddenly a group only spell (if it comes to that).<br />

I won't wonder why it was fixed.  If I wanted to pay 20 RL dollars for this spell (which I won't do) I would enjoy it while it lasted and not be surprised at a fix.  That's what separates me from most enchanters - they've lost all sense of game balance and think its only fair that they get 500+ dps pets and 20 minute aa's.</div></div><hr />

What a broad and unfair generalization.  I know several enchanters that are dissapointed in the impact the test changes may make on their lives without having ever been to BoT dire charming things for obscene experience returns.  Are they upset because the option to abuse the rules to their benefit has been removed?  No.  They are concerned about what the changes mean to them in the myriad hunting grounds that have nothing to do with the planes, and the impact on their ability to contribute to groups short of sitting on their tushes handing out clarity and haste.  Something I would think we shaman can empathize with.<br />
<br />
Regardless, &quot;most enchanters&quot; aren't of a level where abuse is even an option.  Try to keep a little perspective and decorum, please.<br />

Writing off the majority of enchanters as newbies (because I'm confident there are more enchanters without dire charm than with it), just because they are still hunting in the high end Velious / Luclin zones or in planes like disease or innovation is also a broad and unfair generalization.

Have you taken a look at the enchanter board?  Regardless of whether they're of appropriate level to charm 500+ DPS pets, at least 90% of them rationalize it and see nothing wrong with pets of this caliber.  I'll reiterate:  Enchanters as a whole (meaning the majority of them, and its not a slim majority either) have lost all sense of balance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">You can click it off, but those bards who are running with selos kiting crap around only take a few seconds to be beaten into the ground by mobs. Most people have no idea what stoi is, still, and a person with stoicism cast on them would likely have to look at their buff list and take a moment to realise what had snared and slowed them. This is easily enough time to kill someone.<br />
<br />
And frankly I would grief with this spell, but only in extreme situations where morons keep trying to kite and keep losing control and training the zone.<br />
<br />
<br />
And as far as the enchanter thing... I Totally agree that Enchanters have lost ALL sense of balance, and they are way out of control. Its funny, because today I was talking to a fellow guildy shaman, and he told me that one time a friend let him KEI for 3 hours in nexus. He earned 15000 platinum. Do the math. That's almost 90 platinum a MINUTE.<br />
<br />
So enchanters have unlimited money.<br />
Then enchanters slow with 93% efficiency Shamans can.<br />
Then enchanters have the best Crowd Control in the game.<br />
Then enchanters have 500+ DPS pets.<br />
Then enchanters have respectable DPS spells even without pets.<br />
<br />
This is not a &quot;BUUF SHAMNZ PLEZZ&quot; post. In fact excluding Enchanters I think the game has reached almost a perfect level of class balance (while monks and a few other classes need a booster or two). But the masses of enchanters are spoiled. VI doesn't realize it, and even worse the players dont realize it, because they take it for granted.</div></div><hr />

As for the enchanter charm nerf.<br />
<br />
My hot box is a (Now) Level 65 enchanter. My shaman is level 62 still. (With 180ish AA)<br />
<br />
Sure charm is massivly over powered. You want to know the balance to it? Deaths. So many deaths that my shaman can just laugh. Deaths to the enchanter. Deaths to the group. Deaths to half the zone. All the time learning what does and doesnt work. <br />
<br />
Shaman have beem ignored since Velious because One of our brothers soloed a dragon. Before anyone else. And Talked about it. We were overpowered.<br />
<br />
Right? They didnt see that it was the pinnicle of the class. Against a specific target and certain situations had to happen. They didnt see that he failed I think 2 times before succeeding. All they saw was the end.<br />
<br />
Enchanters are getting the same shaft now. Do you really want enchanters to have thier gameplay for all levels ruined because of the scream of Nerf nerf nerf by people who have not walked a mile in thier shoes.<br />
<br />
 If the xp penelty goes in. then Chanters will have no real choice to charm in groups or solo. Groups wont let them for xp, cause teh pet will be taking alot of it. And solo. Well what is the point. You see lots of people Dire charm soloing don't you? No.. Why?  Cause pets taking the xp sucks. <br />
<br />
You can avoid the nerf by jumping through Even more hoops. And the stupid exploits that some chanters are doing will not be affected by the nerf. This whole Idea sucks. <br />
<br />
And before somone accuses me of just wanting the spell to stay the same so I can exploit it. That is utter crap. Enchanters have been able to charm for 4 years. To take the enemy and make him fight for you, at great risk. The only differance between now and 4 years ago is people are so tired of the game they will seek to tear it down to make them feel better about playing it still.  <br />
<br />
At level 12 4 years ago Pana charmed a snake in black burrow. She could kill three snakes. And while it was charmed outdamage any tank in the game at that time.  And Sometimes She would charm and die 3 seconds later when charm broke and had two snakes on her. <br />
<br />
All the nerf is going to do is ruin the fun of the non Hardcore people and Force the hardcore to jump through and extra step. And maybe pick targets a little differntly. It is a stupid stuipd thing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">The difference is that PoP exp mobs hit 5 times harder than their sov/sol counterparts, but don't have 5 times the hitpoints.  Enchanters will now have to spend 40 minutes soloing an aa, rather than 20.  Other classes have to spend 2 hours.  This isn't something I'm making up - test server enchanters (and other charmers) report that the exp nerf is about 50%, netting them roughly half the exp as pre-nerf.  They'll still have no trouble soloing rune / pattern / mold droppers.</div></div><hr />

Haha what a ridiculous argument. In one kill you make back the exp from death and then some. yes, the risk is high. But the amount of experience that it yields FAR outweighs that which is lost through deaths.</div></div><hr />

It's frighteningly close to what's possible. A guildmate brags after spending an hour in the nexus or pok about banking 7-10k from casting kei. Hit the hot travel junctions during prime time (be it US, Europe or Asia) and you have a flock of sheep waiting to be fleeced.</div></div><hr />
