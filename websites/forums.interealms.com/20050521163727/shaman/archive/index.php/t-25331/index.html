<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Halybuton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I recently got Sol Ro flagged (finally)  and have maybe about 4 hours play time 6 days a week and most times all day sundays ( I work Mon through Sat) and unless my guild is raiding I tend tofind  /lfg to be quite disappointing since most other shammans on my seerver have already shot up to max level ( I am way behind on the times lvl and aa wise)<br />
<br />
the items on my magelo are current (click on my sig to see what I got) and by no means are what most would consider ubah or L337 I think the most ubah item I have  on my char is my 1.5.  I currently have 75 aa to my name that part of my magelo isnt  updated as of yet.  I have MGB RC1 and a few others i thougth were important and some misc aa stuff  for my char  but tahts about it like i said my  time on EQ is not unlimited so I am way behind<br />
<br />
anyways back to teh point of this thread<br />
<br />
where can i go  to solo when I'm /lfg in my current state of my shamanistic existance?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Balkamp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">NC murkgliders perhaps. Boring, slow exps, decent chance at loot.<br />
<br />
PoP zones like Torment, Tactics, deeper in PoI. I've been finding these emptier recently &amp; a good place to waste a few hours. Loot is pretty dismal, but exps aren't too bad.<br />
<br />
You're missing mana preservation &amp; DoT damage focii though. That is going to leave you gasping for mana... The difference is HUGE as far as downtime/exps per hour once you acquire those.<br />
<br />
I'd recc. hanging out in WoS &amp; MPG... LFG there. Exps are going to absolutely fly once you get hooked up with even a trio. Many good gear upgrades in those zones for you too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>WaringMcMarrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">/Shudder Xp sucks in WoS as far as I am concerend if you want better xp you should head of to The ruined City of Dranik there is a decent amout of named camps there and the xp is decent though I Hear MPG beats it. I also hear that there is plenty of rottage in MPG that can be picked up from time to time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">much MPG rottage that you could prolly pick up... the shoulders rott so often we give them to pets. the rings rot constantly too... both would be nice upgrades for you.<br />
the only problem is, i am not so sure you can handle PG solo.  some encounters i can barely slide through with just self buffs on.  mobs break root, and melee like trucks on low AC shaman =(<br />
<br />
there are several solo places in WoS, NC, RCoD, and several other zones.  check a few threads down in this forum.<br />
<br />
you said you just got sol ro flagged, i would try to grab a monk or SK and group there.  problem is all pulls outside zone in roamers are coming in twos (they aren't that tough anymore though...)<br />
<br />
golums in pov aren't horrid but your best xp will come from grouping in OoW imo.  depending on your flags of course.  (soloing vext could be an option for you /shrug.  big walkthrough on that posted somewhere in the level forums.)<br />
<br />
edit- you are powater flagged but not pofire flagged?  check in the medicin cabinet.  griz have an AWSOME write up on soloing pow.  xp there is doable and prolly the best you are going to get solo imo.  get a hammer of justice at least, it makes a huge differance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>pugger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Heya haly whats crackin :P<br />
<br />
Solo solo solo lets see....well thats about all I do lately. Theres plenty of pop stuff a shaman can easily solo at that lvl...not superb exp or good loot though.<br />
<br />
My spots<br />
OOW (exp so so, loot pretty good...good tribute stuff and chance at rare zone drops plus discordant or slugs or treans if you into the aug thing + faction if you still workin on that and if you havent even touched it get to factionin foo! Some nice foci up to 70 you can get and the ac on the stuff aint bad either)<br />
Bloodfields<br />
....just outside the first area from zone in....all trash dont summon an easy root rot fest...i tend to go outside that little courtyard area and hang a sharp right and theres this little corner back there where you can kill stuff all day....most the mobs roam around in a square here so you dont even have to pull much. Snake named is the snake that roams around here....theres also supposedely an ukun around there somewhere thats named but after a few days of campin there i couldnt get any named to pop. Also right around the corner if you follow the left wall youll see a stone guy standing just past a snakelady....keep him killed 2 for more tribute drops.<br />
Nobles<br />
.....murks in the pit are pretty cake and can get aug stuff off em but no faction :( so I didnt do em to much.<br />
.....ukun packmaster camp is a very easy solo camp...keep him rooted and ques on yourself and the dots a twistin. If you got a druid there or some other means of breakin up the pixxt named guy do that as well and now you got 2 named your killing<br />
......ridgerunner camp....look this guy up hes not all that tough if you do him right..summoner as all names in this zone are but like the pack keep ques on yourslef and with your epic for trouble you should be fine.<br />
.....battleleader camp....this one plum sucks...one mob 20 min timer and he summons fast so you need some backup healin but hes one of the oow quest piece droppers so you might spend some time there unless lucky to get it elsewhere<br />
<br />
Rcod I dont think you can solo the named. All trash if you can get it single you should be able to solo...dont think any of it summons..simple old root rot but with confined areas since theirs lots of roamers. Dont suggest the named solo since they hit harder then the prev two listed zones and they what I call fast summoners. Instead of every 6 seconds or whatever they summon like every 2. With more aa's and a good druid with ya it can be done you gonna be playin ping pong back and forth till you get him down.<br />
<br />
Wos<br />
....screw wos...that zone just plum sucks i think...but I have gone around the east murk tunnels....the murks there a bit tougher then ones in nc cause im pretty sure they summon but I was able to make the loop without dieing....which if you die you SOL...start lookin for a summons because the freaks see invis. Think ivu too but dont qoute me on that as I quickly decided this zone was for trainin gimps.<br />
<br />
Or just hit up ds and run around slaughtering greens and raking in augs and slugs and stuff while gettin faction. I would do whichever of these I could find while /lfg MPG/RIFTS for 3 to 4 hours at a time. Anyway shoot me a tell if you have a question bout named...ive solo'd most that can be solo'd and 2 or 3 boxed the ones with a little more oomph for that last month and got most of em down.<br />
<br />
And oh yeah if you a bit crazy you can solo vxed...takes some getting used to but It keeps your reflexes sharp :P (bring a rezzer and park outside if you plan on doin though as it will take a bit to get their run speed and timing down. Best way is a druid for snare and new harmony...can pull and root rot all day long and exp is bout the same as tables solo in fire I think. Loot mostly sucks but rarely you get a nice ft ...mask? i think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Halybuton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">kewl thanks for all the advice guys I'll have to print up all this so I dont forget it.<br />
<br />
Pugger-- Dude they will let anyone in here now a days geeze and i thought peeps likeyou  were sent over the the Rangers to make them feel ubah once they beat ya down and not get killed lol seriously though bro thaks for yer advice though I did go into the murk caves in WoS  with a group didnt have a chanter for the most part during the 6 hours i was there and  my roots kept getting broke by  our nukers since we didnt have a snarer through out most of my time there soi just plane gave up on it  (sorry but  I tend to be stingy with my mana when no chanter is around and canni was starting to annoy even me (though my spec Alteration is up to the 180's now  :D  ) ) and I  decided I needed to work onreg xp somewhere in that cave so I'm currently about 31% away from lvl 68.  I gotlucky last night as soon as i logged on put up lfg after a failed BoT group to help some friends out cuase  our mix (which is usually pretty good) seemed to be rezzing moe than keeling, and got asked to do a WoS group and we headed to teh Murk Caves ( and yes pugger they see through IVU )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shlob</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I dont reccoment soloing only for soloing....sure were good at it but dont do it as fast as would like. i suggest LFG for 10mins then if nothing MAKE A GROUP!!! i dont ever lfg more then 10 mins i go make a group takes about 10mins max and your exping all night. once again solo when you can find or make a group or if you have little time on but if you have like 2+ hours then i strongly suggest making a group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>pugger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I just hate most groups...since it seems their sole purpose is to find new and inventive ways to get me killed. The druid I hang out with tries rooting all inc mobs on me and I try and viru paralysis it right back on him. So usually just toss up lfg for the zones I wanna be in (mpg/rifts) then go solo while I wait since if I die while soloing I dont have to want to hate anyone after for pulling 9 mobs to the group or something. Or a fd'er running close to us with 10 mobs and fd'n then the healer healin the fd........cause that alwayssss seems to happen :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shlob</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">wow what server are you on so i know never to play there..... sounds like you have some ebays or people who do not know how to play there class. if i were you and it was that bad switch servers lol.</div></div><hr />
