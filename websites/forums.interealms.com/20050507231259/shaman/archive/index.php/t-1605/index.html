<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was at casters realm this morning, and they have a big anouncement up that you can now bind in Timorous Deep! This should be great (if it is true) for all of those that still want to be bound there, but changed it for some reason. Anyhow, good luck :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Spraggon-Test</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, if this is the case I'll be heading to the port pots this evening... =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mordrek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Is the dragon guarding the pots always there and is it worth attempting to get past it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tarnil MacDuff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hmm, always wanted to bind there, but now, since I won't have access to kunark or velious, though I do have access to the moon via greater faydark, but I'll never be able to bind up there.  I'm not sure if I want to bind there at all.  <br />
<br />
Anyone else have any opinions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Spraggon-Test</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Unless he's changed he's up right after server comes up for about 3 hours then despawns.  Then he is on a regular timer for dragons to respawn.<br />
<br />
For me on test, this may not be the best of places to bind because of it being down all the time, but I really don't know how often or close Faydedar comes by the pots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I haven't tried it yet but I wouldn't be surprised to find that the actual pot room is unbindable.  Verant can set areas as bindable and not bindable, or any other spell they want to restrict in a certain area.<br />
<br />
Thinking about it for a minute,  I won't bind there.  I'm either KoS in most of the cities or I don't go there.  I just don't see it being worth it anymore to bind there.  I spend 99% of my time in Luclin or Velious so binding at the pots doesn't help me at all, in fact it makes it hard to get where I want to go.  Being bound in the Bazaar/Nexus is much more beneficial for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I am KOS everywhere on mainland except Halas. I'll stay bound in Nexus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Can anyone confirm this?  <br />
<br />
No more stupid postings about the silly dragon.  He's down 99.9% of the time anyhow.  Just don't go there right after the servers come up and you'll be fine.  I used to bind in FV and gate there to use the boat and run to the pot room all the time.  I never once saw Faydedar in probably 100 times I did this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grazar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Went there and bound. <br />
<br />
Yes, i'm KOS in most cities too.  Thank god I have this spell called INVISIBILITY.<br />
<br />
The Nexus?  I can use the Kelethin port and be at the Nexus from the GFay port within 15 minutes.<br />
<br />
Yep, it is far from Velious, but nowadays, you can always find SOME form of resurrection if you die, and again, you're 15 minutes max away from Nexus, then 15 minutes max away from GD.<br />
<br />
BTW: This is almost certainly a bug that they're going to correct soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grizzli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">As of 4pm CST Saturday you can no longer bind in TD *OR* directly at the firepots. I didn't make it there in time. =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I was considering binding in the firepots room until I suddenly thought about that fact I have a friends druid I can use to port me about and all of our guild porters are bound in the bazaar.  If there was a firepot to thrug I would probably bind there, but as is it isnt worth it for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Humbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Confirmed! You CAN bind in TD now. Whether this was intentional or not, I am not sure. Basically when you bind, it gives you 2 messages, one being the normal message (Forgot what it said, something along the lines of you can't use this spell or something) but it then says you are bound here. The catch is, you have to RELOG for the changes to go in. I personally did this 5 minutes ago, bound at the pillars, went into the firepot room, logged, came back and and gated to the pillars to make sure it worked. <br />
<br />
This gets me to alot of cities much easier. With potions pretty easy to make for velious port, my gate hammer and now this, I have it pretty easy to get around now. If I need to goto Luclin I can simply go to the nearest city that's close to a Nexus spire.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gheff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">As of 3:48PST .. it still works<br />
<br />
Went to TD, and casted bind.... First message says you dont develop an affinity .... then second one says you are bound ... checked CHAR and I was .... Clicked on Troll pot .. and gated back .... <br />
<br />
HOWEVER, other melees in party could not be bound in Firepot room......<br />
<br />
Hehe .....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Grizzli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yea, you guys are right. I actually did manage to bind there, I just saw the red writing and assumed I hadn't rebound. =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Spraggon-Test</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Went there and bound in front of the Neriak pot.  Needed to get to someone in GD last night.  Gated to pots, invised, went to Gfay, gave some drake hide legs to some newb enchanter, went up to nexus, down to GD.<br />
<br />
Now I could have taken the boat I suppose, or hoped for finding a port (a lot harder to find on test than on a prod server).<br />
<br />
And until I'm 50+ I plan to hunt mainly in Antonica and Kunark so pots are great for now, most likely nexus later...  Being able to get from neriak to cabilis in two zonings, very nice.<br />
<br />
Expect this to be fixed fairly soon however, definitely a bug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Isnt working for me... about WHERE in the pot room did you manage to bind?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Spraggon-Test</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Asta,<br />
<br />
It will give you two messages, the first says:<br />
<br />
You cannot find an afinity to this place, try a city. (or something like that)<br />
<br />
Next says:<br />
<br />
You are bound to this area.<br />
<br />
<br />
As long as you are getting that second message, you are bound.  If you aren't getting the message, then most likely it has been fixed, however I doubt it on the weekend...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Didn't bind myself (or my Druid) there since I have my own port beeyotch to shuffle me around.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Firepots &gt; nexus<br />
<br />
Instant gates to almost any oldworld city,  to sell, buy, quest. tradeskills.<br />
Instant gates to hard to reach places ...cabalis, halas.<br />
Cabalis is in center of Kunark, 10minute run to any zone on kunark.<br />
3minute or less to your servers Market zone for trading.<br />
Instant gate to ANY druid/wizard on the server (misty, gfay).<br />
Nexus ports never more then 15minutes away if your lazy, 6minutes if you want to run around. <br />
Firepots give you access to 3 nexus gates.<br />
Easy access to underutilized hunting zones for great experience.<br />
<br />
The ONLY downside to firepot portals is no direct velious ports, but your still closer to any druid/wizard for a real velious port, or you can take the nexus-&gt;GD route. <br />
Even if you bind elsewhere, you can't get to velious any easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Gate to Nexus quest item in CT is the perfect compliment!</div></div><hr />

Now... could we make a list of where in each zone you teleport to?<br />
<br />
Halas is between the two guards just after the water at entrance. 'Fairly safe' for a kos high level with levitate and sow up.<br />
<br />
What about Cabilis, Oggok etc? Would hate to pot to Paineel and land in the sk gulid and be stuck without elevator key hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Quies</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Cabby is right by the LOIO zoneline. Far enough away from the guards to not aggro, if they're in the default spots. You need an invis to get out of the city, so just pot in with one anyway. The pots won't break invis.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here is the list from www.eqatlas.com they also have a great map of TD:<br />
<br />
<br />
The room is located at loc -12260, 4665, -277 within Timorous Deep. <br />
<br />
Be careful when you enter here, as there is a dragon-like creature named Faydedar that is very often spied in the area. He is KOS to all, and /con's red to level 51 characters, so be very careful. <br />
<br />
The listing of the pots and where they take you is: <br />
<br />
North Left: (fire on floor) to Grobb (entrance) <br />
North Center: (6 side gray) to Oggok (entrance) <br />
North Right: (6 side tall) to Erudin (near dock) <br />
East Left: (6 side gray) to Neriak Commons (entrance) <br />
East Center: (4 side wood) to Greater Faydark (under Kelethin) <br />
East Right: (6 side rust) to Northern Felwithe (entrance) <br />
South Left: (Brown box) to Halas (near dock) <br />
South Center: (Dark with blue) to East Freeport (on dock) <br />
South Right: (tall gold vase) to Cabilis West (entrance) <br />
West Left: (White marble) to South Kaladim (entrance) <br />
West Center: (Lava Lamp) to Akannon (entrance) <br />
West Right: (torch stand) to Rivervale (entrance)</div></div><hr />

the wizard spell is, so i cant see any reason why these should be different</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">For me the pot room is a big deal because i play on a pvp server. Lot of my time i spend cruising about looking for trouble. Being bound in pot room makes that alot easier. On the occassions that i die in pvp its easier to cr too.<br />
<br />
I can get to Luclin via Gfay spire.<br />
I can get to Kunark with OT hammer (well once i get to borrow the puppet strings).<br />
I can get to Velious with Thurg gate potions.<br />
<br />
Nexus really isnt an option for me since i play 90% on a computer that cant handle Luclin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Lemiak Purdyun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">OT captain I believe is uncharm able now my enchanter friend tried with Dictate and it didnt work :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Takk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">As a person that has bound to the smoke pots orginally, it is definitely nice at times... by the way unlike ports  ya can go into a zone invis which is why I can travel to kunark fairly easily without port (Cabrius is one of the cities that you can go to). Most times, you don't have to worry about being KOS because ya come right next to the zone of the city away from other MOB or guards.... Also if ya are friendly to the dorf in  Thurg.. then ya can easily make the thurg potion for a port there....<br />
  So the question is do you want to wait 15 mins to 5 locations or a few miniutes to 12 location (13 if you have the thurg potion) plus being able to get to a wizard spiral within 5 mins for a trip to luclin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">GOod point about the thurg gate potion.  Gotta be some compensation for the ****ing alchemy hose we took on that one.  <br />
<br />
As for the OT hammer thing, to quote Abashi A.K.A. Gordon Wrinn:<br />
&quot;Let's not think of it as the people who came later getting hurt, but rather the people who came earlier getting lucky&quot;</div></div><hr />

If you are really worried just position yourself next to your favorite non-KOS pot and when you get a big hit, ya click at the pot.... (Yes ya can survive a few hits naked .... It was only when I was a dope and stood to see what was hitting me that I died).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Even if you get caught in a death loop and end up with like 30 corpses before your three brain cells click together and you yank your cord on your modem, it's not the end of the world.  <br />
<br />
Simply bribe a cleric to go and rez them all.  Might wanna take a break from EQ for a couple hours, and then do this tho.  It would just take time and money and a little coordination.  Or a cleric friend perhaps.  <br />
<br />
I've wanted to see a real live Faydedar, but never have encountered him in MANY times of going to the pots.  It would be a rare rare occasion to see him, and kinda exciting!  I wonder if he can be soloed . . . . <br />
With kick ass resist gear of course . . . he's only a 32k mob.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If a Faydedar death loop is a concern for you, this might be an option.  I'm not sure how many kills in MM it would take to get from bottomed out faction to non-KOS though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This hasn't happened since the days of release of Kunark.<br />
<br />
I have been bound at the Pots since the 2nd day of Kunark and I have only died to Fay on 4 occasions. This was all in the early 50's and when the zone was repopping for boat problems several times a day.<br />
<br />
He is non-existant now. YES, I have been in the room on server-ups on numerous occasions and he simply does not bother the room. I have specifically gone looking for him and he is nowhere to be found.<br />
He is a red herring in my book, a story to scare little shaman children.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Eoin MacManus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">When the &quot;natural&quot; Faydedar does spawn (once in a blue moon), he goes near the firepot room, but we're talking near in terms of the whole zone.

To those of you who aren't sure if you want your bind here or not, try it first.  If you don't like it at least you have that option once they nerf it back.</div></div><hr />

Think hard here: If they ever put a kitty city gate potion in THIS will be the place to be. Thurg via vapors, old world via firepots and Luclin via gate potion. <br />
<br />
Dare I say it, but this would actually be, well, FUN! No more 200pp ports/tls. <br />

I was worried about porting to the wood elf city since I've hunted in PoG but even Kelethin was safe.  I haven't tried Felwithe yet. Where does the Cabilis port put you?  I know I can zone invis and I'm just wondering if it's worth it to try.  If all the locations are 'safe', maybe the KOS cities would be useful as well.  I know Halas wouldn't be safe if you're KOS there.  You get placed right next to a couple of guards.  I didn't con them however.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think Kelethin puts you near one of the lifts on the path, but out of aggro range of any guard.<br />
<br />
Felwithe puts you on the little grassy area before the bridge, so unless you're KOS to the city guards (not a PoG faction), it's safe.<br />
<br />
Cabilis drops you right at the LOIO zoneline. Invis and go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>sinladar orchammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Bound there last night.   I was highly disappointed to miss it the first go through.  Bind is going to the back of the spell book now.<br />
<br />
We just need to get a kitty gate potion and shaman can take over the worlds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">All the pots are useful, ESPECIALLY the evil city pots!  <br />
<br />
Neriak potion puts you in a rather bad place unless you have invis, tho not directly in aggro range of anything . . . but you do have invis so that's not an issue.  However, it's a short run from there to lavastorm and solb.  Also a short run to EC and WC.  <br />
<br />
Freeport pot puts you on the docks, fairly safe place even if you are kos.  From there you can hit Ro, WFP, EC, or even take the boat to OOT if you have business there.  <br />
<br />
Erudin pot puts you at the docks in between guards, they dont see invis tho, not much does in that city.   Good access to the Hole and luclin spires.  <br />
<br />
Cabilis port puts you next to the zone to LOIO, it's a safe zone in spot, and you can stand there without invis and not be aggroed.  Great access to kunark really.  LOIO is pretty central to everything.  And if you're going to Seb, just invis up and hike to Swamp of No Hope on the other side of East Cab.  SoNH --&gt; TT --&gt; OS. <br />
<br />
Kaladim puts you very near a well traveled druid ring, from which you can often get a port.  <br />
<br />
Felwithe is nice cause it's a short zone and short run away from a spires.  Klethelin port is actually further from the spires.  <br />
<br />
Grobb is great!  It takes you to Inny swamp fast as hell and you can hit Guk if you have business there.  Always nice to hit Guk, grab an EE bag and go hit EC and sell it eh?  They sell so fast . . . prolly have it sold just in time to go check the spawn again.  <br />
<br />
Ogguk port is also really handy for when your guild goes to PHEAR after demis or Cazic or whatever.  Also ideal for getting to CT zone hunting groups in a hurry.<br />
<br />
Riverdale is great for a quick bank and fastest access to a druid ring.  You get set down by the zone to Misty, so once you zone in, just take a few steps and zone again to Misty.  Instant drood access.<br />
<br />
Akanon . . . erm . . . well you get to harrass the gnomes!  Haha, stock up the larder as it may go heehee.  They taste like papaya you know!  Um . . . access to MM for dire wolf killin or brownie pharmin for baking recipes.  Come to think of it too . . the brownie guards are kinda good exp.  They don't pop often enuf tho. <br />
<br />
Halas . . . well it's home for many of us, and you can buy any herbs you need at the drop of a hat in a city with vendors that like you.  For the evils . . . it's good access to Permafrost for exping in the basement.  That can easily be done solo btw, and is quite good exp.  I've soloed there on many an occasion.  I'm not sure what level is the cut off for single pulling stuff here, but around 57+ will be fine for solo here i think.  Lower if you're more skilled.  The guards you port in by are green cons to a lvl 60, but the zone is across a small lake if you need to use it to escape them.  I doubt if they see invis, but I don't know if they do for sure.  If yer swimmin skill is ok, i'd give it a shot.  <br />

The only places I don't have fast access to now are velious and luclin.  But those are still fairly fast, at least as fast as they were before actually if you count time spent waiting for a pad to activate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Eoin MacManus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">It still chaps my ass that there's no pot for Qeynos. If the Erudites really want to be isolated from the rest of the world, they should switch cities with the Qeynosians.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Berserker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">I have been bound at the pots from the begining.<br />

BIND NOW!!!!!<br />
<br />
If you change your mind then you can bind somewhere else.  <br />
<br />
I have been in that room prob 1,000 times and never even seen faydear. <br />
<br />
You will never ever ever feel bad, and there is a port directly to gfaydark so you can run to a nexus portal in 5 min.<br />
<br />
The only bad thing is that its a laggy zone because of boats going in and out and sometimes I get disconnected but have felt that being bound there is the best thing I ever did in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Eoin: &quot;It still chaps my ass that there's no pot for Qeynos.&quot;<br />
<br />
As one of many 180 alchemists here, I think we can whip up a balm or something for that chapping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Felwithe is nice cause it's a short zone and short run away from a spires. Klethelin port is actually further from the spires.<br />
Actually just turn north and run 1000feet and you hit the spires, don't follow the friggen road it takes forever. Less then a minute run.<br />
<br />
Grobb is great! It takes you to Inny swamp fast as hell and you can hit Guk if you have business there. Always nice to hit Guk, grab an EE bag and go hit EC and sell it eh? They sell so fast . . . prolly have it sold just in time to go check the spawn again. <br />
<br />
Shhhhh....I made over 20k selling froglok crowns.<br />
<br />
What chaps my ass, is the shear volume of people going through here now. I am getting buff and invis requests up the wazhoo from complete strangers. <br />
This use to be such a nice secluded place with only 3 people bound there</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Mirabilis Dictu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">If you're bound someplace exotic, like I am (PoM), you might not want to change your bind point just yet.  Planes of Power promises more ports and easier travel, and it's just a few months away :)<br />
