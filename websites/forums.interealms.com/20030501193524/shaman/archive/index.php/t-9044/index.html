<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've just been to see the second film in the trilogy, and what can I say... It is great.<br />
<br />
I'll not spoil it for anyone that's not read the books. <br />
<br />
It doesn't follow the books quite as closely as the first one did, but it didn't make any difference to me. The effects are stunning, so much so that you just accept the things that you see as actually happening. They are much improved over the first one. Scenes similar to the mines of moria where they looked like computer graphics are much harder to spot. The animation of the creatures is fantastic.<br />
<br />
Well worth seeing.<br />
<br />
Now if only someone would make a series of films about the Wheel of Time saga, or The Enders Game series of books!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rewts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ender's Game would be awesome, but Wheel of Time, bleh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ralahast-BB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Wheel of time would get boring, unless they made like 3 books into 1 movie.. I was bored in those books. <br />
<br />
Speaking of the two towers however, great film. 1 thing though, I was very disapointed in how Faramir was portrayed, if you've read the books, watch the movie and you'll see what I mean, I'm not going to spoil it here. Other than that, I was pleased with it immensly, going to see it again on saturday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cayen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Incredible movie!  <br />
...<br />
<br />
..<br />
<br />
Damn...I can't post anything about the movie, lest I spoil it for those who haven't *GASP* seen it yet.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Incredible movie!<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cayen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ok, since someone already mentioned Faramir...<br />
<br />
Yes, he was slightly rewritten...folks who have read the book and seen the flick will understand what Im hinting at.<br />
<br />
However, go back and read the character of Faramir...his time in TTT = boring screen time.  I love Tolkien, but he wasn't a film director...judge this as a screenplay, not a book.<br />
<br />
Not a rant, just defending the choice of character rewrite : )<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ralahast-BB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">ffs, faramir is my idol :P oh well, I guess I should have done what I did with the first movie and not come in with high expectations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nuggruk RN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Great Film, enjoyed it, so did the kids, so did the wife, so did my parents..... so I guess it has wide appeal.<br />
<br />
<br />
I was a little disapointed that it varies so widely from the book as written.<br />
<br />
Kind of like watching a film about Moses...... and discovering the film only has 8 commandments.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Plunkk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think The Wheel of Time would make a great series of movies.<br />
<br />
Just gotta remember that the boring parts of people just blabbing, and taking forever to read, could basically just be summed up in a few minutes in a movie.<br />
<br />
I'd rather see them not done at all than done half-assed though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">WoT fan here . . (obviously).<br />
Course i wanna see movies!  <br />
I think Jordan is going to have to get around to (finally) finishing the series before movie rights could ever be talked about.  It might end really poorly and ruin the series for screenplay!  Doubt it tho.  New book out in January!  Assuming that slacker Jordan puts his nose to the grindstone and finishes it!  <br />
<br />
I get to see LoTR2 on Friday.  I'm really looking forward to it.  They don't have a theater on my island so I have to wait until holiday time to see it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I just got back from seeing it. It was well worth the 20+ minutes spent waiting in the freezing cold with no coat to see it. The movie is awesome! And it's funny as well. Seems Gimly is the comedian of the movie ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Slqmdooley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I take every chance I get to throw this tid bit into a conversation - In college I took a 3 credit class on Tolkien - pretty cool huh?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>gump17</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">good movie imho but .....<br />
<br />
it just me or does golem become a  bit to much like jar jar binks in this movie ?  saw a bit more of him than i wanted to other than that was great.  <br />
<br />
the orc running with the olympic torch was kinda funny too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Valrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Gollum != Jar Jar Binks.  Jar Jar was put in purely for the snot nosed little kids.  Gollum was very well done, and if you've read the books he's almost spot-on.  As for WoT, I've read the books like 6+ times each.  I love 'em.  I do have to skip several pages at a time when he starts yammering on about the color of some chick's dress, but by and large they're excellent books.  I think they'd make a great movie series.  Shorten some of the battles, take out some of the superfluous stuff (like visiting the Eye of the World...prolly coulda done without that) and it'd be great.  I've heard that Ender's Game was in the works already....<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S.  Anyone notice that Gimli's carrying a Windblade on his back?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Nah, wasn't a windblade. WB has two blades right? This is only a strangely shaped axe. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Guggles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The epic fight scenes in TTT are just not up to snuff in my opinion.  I think they should have used the style the did in Braveheart.  The scenes are too dark and move too fast.  With all the money spent on making armor and weapons they could have done much better.  Gimmli steals the movie show though.  Even Henry V had better battle scenes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">actualy he had 2 axes , one was only 1 bladed , but the other was DEAD ON for a windblade . I even mentioned it to my GF on the way home.<br />
<br />
Looks like someone at SoE saw LOTR 2 before we did ;)<br />
Hell look at EQ in general and its obvious someone was a fan of this series of books</div></div><hr />

<br />
Good movie, but I have to give two thumbs down on the WW1 era ship mines and the olympics.<br />
<br />
Gimli roxxors...:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>raburr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">If you get the extended dvd set for LoTR1 there is a part where they show the making of the armor and weapons for the movie and you will see all of gimli's axes. and yes one is exactly like a Windblade.<br />
Also thy show Legolas' 2 short swords...gorgeous. If your a fan of armor, swords etc and the movies GET THE EXTENDED dvd set!<br />
I spent a good 5 nights just viewing all the special additions plus the 4+ hour rework of the first movie.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Gollum is exactly like the books... he was my favorite part in the movie.  They portrayed his tortured soul perfectly.  The fight between Smeagol and Gollum.  This duality made me feel pity for him even.<br />
<br />
The fight scenes were spot on in my opinion as well.  This is a different medium than that listed above for comparison.  Besides Jackson is not one to copy anothers screen portrayal style.  There was so much in the battles that mirrored the themes of the book that I can see why people have problems with how &quot;dark&quot; the movie is.  Well it is a dark story.<br />
<br />
And I am always hopeful for the Dark Elf Trilogy movies :) I think that series could make a very good fantasy movie series.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Cayen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Just like Hrothgar said, the books were dark...the movie deserves a dark theme.  There is very little Triumph throughout the main body of the book...*cough* no spoilers *cough*...lots of dark stuff.<br />
<br />
<br />
Cayen</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>robert135</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">By FAR my favorite part of the movie, is the end with the Ents (treants)<br />
<br />
<br />
These dudes are way, way bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Falmorn Hawkborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I admit to being a geek.  I've read the books quite a bit, I own a copy of the Silmarillion (epic creation saga, even more wordy than the books), and saw Fellowship enough in the theaters to catch the trailer for TTT.<br />
<br />
I enjoyed TTT immensely (aside from one git who kept shouting &quot;Lord of the Rings!&quot;, as if we didn't know what movie we were going to see).  I actually got chills during two parts:  the opening sequence - no spoilers, but *WOW*; but I can't mention the second because it's a pivotal moment, but Merry and Pippin are involved, and it changes the third characters' POV.  And the audience cheered during another part - Legolas pulls off a move that will have fanboi elf wannabes screaming for something like that in EQ.  Too bad there are already horses in EQ....  :p<br />
<br />
If you aren't certain about it, go for a matinee.<br />
<br />
If you've never seen Fellowship, go out and rent the dang thing, then go see TTT.<br />
<br />
Gollum was done perfectly, even if people in the audience were laughing during his struggles with himself.<br />
<br />
Despite the &quot;creative license&quot;, I can't think of anyone who could have done a better job.  Chris Carter?  Bleh.  Spielberg?  It would have turned into schmaltz PDQ.  Maybe DeMille could have done it, if he'd been alive today.<br />
<br />
The story was well told, and yes, TTT is a dark book; just reflect that this is effectively the trilogys' Empire Strikes Back, and anticipate the amazingness that will be Return of the King.<br />
<br />
I want to see the extended version of TTT; only ten months to go, la la la....<br />
<br />
Fal</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Spielberg would have had to find a way to write in a subplot about Fredo's struggles living in a single-parent home and not really having a very good relationship with the father who has abandoned him and is a relentless alcoholic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Drachen183</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Now they just need to make the Sword of Truth series into a trilogy!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Just got back from this movie.  One thing to say...<br />
<br />
Wow....just Wow.  Best movie i have seen in a LONG TIME.  The part where Legolas slides down the stairs(its in the preview, dont worry :)) is just SO FREAKING TIGHT.  A couple other moves he pulled off just had me amazed too.  This movie was absolutely fantastic.  I didnt like the rewrite of Faramir though...Just like Boromir in the last movie, he was such a jackass.  He's tight in the books though.  <br />
<br />
All in all, this movie is amazing, and go see it, NOW</div></div><hr />

With any luck this wont be true.  The Empire Strikes Back is far and away the best movie of the Star War's trilogy, and the Return of the Jedi the worst(The new ones DON'T EXIST in my eyes - worst movies ever).  <br />
<br />
Hopefully the Return of the King will be the best, though i dont see how it could be better then this one.  The editting crew has their work cut out for them to be sure.</div></div><hr />
