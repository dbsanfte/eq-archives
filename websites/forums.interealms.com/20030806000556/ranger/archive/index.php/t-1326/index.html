<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Czarevich</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">/ooc A little story I posted about a segment of Trueshot bow quest on the RP story section of my guild's board(Faydwer's Brethren, Bertoxx).<br />
<br />
Knock, knock, knock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who is it?&quot; A raspy voice emanates from within room.<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Czarevich, I am a Ranger of Faydark's Champions, under Maesyn Trueshot.  Who are you?&quot;  The young ranger stands in the hallway, outside an inn door in the city of Freeport.  He looks back and forth down the hall, awaiting a response.<br />
<br />
&quot;A ranger, huh?  Come in,&quot;  the man replies.<br />
<br />
As the door unlocks and starts to open, Czarevich repeats his inquiry, &quot;Who are you?  Are you Jyle Windshot?&quot;<br />
<br />
The door flies open and a hand grabs him and pulls him into the room.  The man slams the door and wheels on the ranger.  Czarevich's hand goes to his claws, hanging on his belt.  The man stares at him exasperated, &quot;Shhhhhh....don't say my name in the hall!&quot;<br />
<br />
Czarevich feels uneasy, and keeps his hand ready but does not draw his weapon.  The man seems agitated, and perhaps a little crazy, but not dangerous.  &quot;Why not?  Are you him, then?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I am Jyle.  Why do you think I am hiding in this room?  They cannot know I am here.&quot;  The man walks back to the corner of the room, and leans against a small table.  He seems to calm a little.  &quot;what is it you need, Czarevich?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who is they?...Why are you hiding?  I don't understand what is going on?&quot;  Czarevich walks around to face Jyle, his hand relaxing away from his weapon, but still keeping a safe distance.<br />
<br />
The man, seeming serene and distracted by his own thoughts now, waves a dismissive hand at the ranger.  &quot;Nothing for you to worry about, young elf.  You have travelled far to see me, what is your need?  How is Maesyn these days?&quot;<br />
<br />
Czarevich shakes his head.  &quot;Stay to the task, ignore this man's innane ramblings,&quot; he thinks to himself.  &quot;The Master is well,&quot; he replies, &quot;and it is he who has sent me to you.  I quest to gather materials for the famed Trueshot bow.  I understand you may have some Treant wood that is used in its construction.  I am in need of that wood, do you have it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmmph, Treant, huh?  Wood?  Yes, I have some of that.  You need it for the Trueshot bow, do you?  A fine instrument, that bow, fine indeed.  Only crafted by Master Bowyers, with scarce materials.  Which is why you have travelled so far to get some wood from me, correct?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is true.  May I have some of the wood?  It is very important to me, and to Faydark's Champions.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll tell you what.  I have nothing to do in here but read and wait till the time is right for me to leave this room again.  Besides entertaining visitors, which are few and far between.  The lighting in here is horrible, and I go through lanterns like dwarves through ale trying to read in this pathetic light.  If you bring me a few lanterns, I will give you some Treant wood.  What do you say?&quot;  The man eyes Czarevich a little wildly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sir, I really need that wood, and time is of the essence.  What is I gave you some money to buy a lantern, and then you could give me the wood right way?&quot;  Czarevich asks.<br />
<br />
The man gets visibly agitated, and his voice begins to raise.  &quot;Have you been listening to me at all, BOY, I CAN&quot;T LEAVE THIS ROOM OR THEY WILL FIND ME!  BRING ME A LANTERN IF YOU WANT SOME OF THE WOOD!&quot;<br />
<br />
Czarevich steps back, surprised at the man's outburst.  &quot;Fine, relax, sir.  I will get you some lanterns.  Please, just calm down.  Wait here, I will be back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Czarevich turns quickly and heads for the door.  The man, already quieted, calls after him, &quot;Just some small ones will do, nothing fancy.&quot;  But Czarevich leaves without heeding his call.  He is down the stairs, and out the inn to the street with a rangers speed and agility.<br />
<br />
He finally finds a shop selling small lanterns, and tells the merchant, &quot;Give me as many as you have...fill this crate, and my backpack.&quot;  The merchant eyes him strangely, but accepts his coin nonetheless.<br />
<br />
About an hour later he is back in the room with Jyle, giving him the lanterns.  &quot;Thank you, thank you.  This will be great.  Here is the Treant wood, good luck and tell Maesyn I said hello.&quot;<br />
<br />
Czarevichs accepts the wood, putting it carefully in his bag.  &quot;I will, enjoy your reading.&quot;  Czarevich sneaks out of the room while the man looks over his lanterns, ignoring the young ranger's good wishes.  He is happy to go.  &quot;That man is insane,&quot; he thinks as he makes his way to the docks.</div></div><hr />
