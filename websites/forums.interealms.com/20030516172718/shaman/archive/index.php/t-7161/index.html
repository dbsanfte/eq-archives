<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Having run into a lev 30-something epic-wielding shaman on Bristlebane some time ago (ages ago, now), I find myself hoping that our epic quest will be adjusted to use these quest flags that PoP has introduced.   It would be nice to be able to flag a character as having done a particular step and no longer rely on simple faction level to determine whether the next step would bear fruit.<br />
<br />
The final spirit wouldn't give you the Spear unless you had flags for turning in the stuff for <br />
- Talking to spirits in Freeport<br />
- Completing Tests of Patience, Wisdom, Might.<br />
- Reports to Spirit<br />
- Ghiosk's books to Spirit<br />
- Scale to Kirn<br />
- Ring to Neh<br />
- Neh's Diary to Spirit<br />
<br />
I'd almost say &quot;Tear to Rak&quot; also, but of everything we do on our quest, the Tear is truly a pain to acquire.  I think MQing the Tear is one of the community-building things that EQ promotes.<br />
<br />
Not so sure I care that they do some of the steps in order (Ghiosk's books before Reports, etc) but it would serve to put a halt to many Shaman-bots just repeating the test of Wisdom for faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Or perhaps a level check for the final turn in, like the druid/ranger epic.<br />
<br />
Or, perhaps you get something from the spirit after turning in neh's diary that you must turn in to rak along with the tear. <br />
<br />
Although to tell you the truth, a level 30 could be dragged all the way through the hole for Kirn. Or left to wait on the starting ledge until the raid party was at Kirn, and then CoH'd in. So Kirn really isn't the roadblock for a level cap - the Tear is, as it requires level 46 to enter the Plane of Fear.<br />
<br />
I think a level check at the final turn-in is the way to go - with a caveat - if you fail, he returns the scale. Let's be nice :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Blackdust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">FYI ~ The EQ gods have fixed this. I have a friend that I MQed the tear with and the Spirit in EJ pond at the scale. He had max True Spirit just like you should have, but he was only level 47. I believe its been fixed so that you must be 50 or 51 to turn in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's a shame the dog ate the scale. PoF is such a pain in the ass. I wish they'd just return the item and let you come back when you're the right level, since it's so arbitrary and not mentioned in any of the documents/quest hints.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Aye, do something to prevent wholesale cheating, but give whichever item it is back!<br />
<br />
One of the things I like best about our quest is that it's something a shaman can do in stages throughout their life!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sarania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I did all the way up through the shield of falsehood at 24 with a 27 necro friend. it was pretty easy. Gems made the Test of Patience go alot quicker and less boring</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">lol test of patience boring?<br />
<br />
i was too busy being paranoid about the lvl 44 sharks swiming past my ass</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sarania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Here's the little secret Invis vs animals</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Invis vs animals dropped on me twice, and I died twice.<br />
<br />
My third try, I took about 20 of my best friends out there and we tracked Abe.<br />
<br />
I hate that part of the epic, more so than any other part...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thantu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I miss when our Charm was actually worthwhile.  Those sharks made insane pets.  Oh, and Happy Birthday, Harvyst.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thanks, Thantu :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Keldain Silvermyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Invis to Animals didn't work for me... Every time a spirit popped, while waiting for Abe, a killer shark popped too... first round, one druid with me with a decent fear animal (because it came right at me every time a spirit came active) was of no use...shark gone for less than 10 seconds.<br />
<br />
I died on this first attempt (I was level 47 at this time. lol!). Next attempt, took FOUR druids with me. :) Sure enough, WHILE I WAS INVIS vs ANIMALS(!!!) a spirit would pop, and a killer shark with it...and immediately the shark would start wailing on me. My wife's druid was high enough to have Repel Animal, and would get it stuck, and the shark would disappear long enough to do the talking to the spirit, or just listen (depending on which one). When the spirit would despawn, no sharks... When Abe popped, it took TWO Repel Animal casts to get shark to leave. At any time a spirit was up, the druids had FOUR killer sharks on track... only one or none when no spirits.<br />
<br />
Now, I don't know if they've changed those sharks, but invis vs animals, and invis, were both utterly WORTHLESS, as they seemed to see through both...My poor shammy arse has the bite-marks to prove it. Invis vs Animals was fine against the REGULAR sharks, but not the Killer Sharks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I had no trouble with the Test of Patience, and maybe I just got lucky.  Did it solo around level 30 ~ didn't see a killer shark once :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Keldain Silvermyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yeah...that's what a lot of people tell me, but plenty of druids, and a cleric (who rezzed me...Thanks!) were witness that it CAN go the way it happened to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Aracane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Blackdust,<br />
Is MQ ing the tear a working option available atm ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Last I heard, it was.<br />
<br />
I saw it working on 10/24.<br />
<br />
But that was two patches ago.</div></div><hr />
