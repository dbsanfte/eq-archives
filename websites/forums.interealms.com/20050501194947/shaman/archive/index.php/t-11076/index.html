<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>a11e</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been experimenting with my level 24 shaman and I find I am really missing the ability to stun.  <br />
<br />
I often 2 box with my 24 necro and find that pet tanking and DOTs work wonderfully.  Problems arise when I pull wizard type casters.  They do so much damage in a short time, that I find my DOTs won't work fast enough.<br />
<br />
Is there a strategy for fast nuking caster types?  Root parking isn't a viable strategy when you pull a couple casters.  I would appreciate any suggestions you might have to overcome this situation.  Hopefully, it doesn't involve unrealistic resists.  Level 24 shaman don't have 100+ for all resists.  <br />
<br />
Maybe the best strategy is to merely avoid caster types in the first place?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jikuliz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would really think about finding non caster mobs at that lvl. I do really really well in LOIO as it is mostly deserted now, and the mobs die really really fast. I made all of lvl 24 in a couple hours, i just Slow on pull, Envenomed breath Tainted breath, disempower melee repeat pull again. Caster mobs root, nuke, and generally screw up my days ) Other decent zones to try are Marus Seru, South Karana....they have alot of non casting mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">its not much, but screaming terror is a stun, pretty fast cast time as well. Just have to re-sic pet.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>VeldamirVZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Or get a tank!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">your best bet is to snare and fear the mobs, which will not only go easier on your mana, but when you do get to those casters, it won't really matter since they can't do anything when they're feared.  just keep the snare and the fear on them for the full duration and you should be set.  screaming terror is one option, but it's primarily used to split groups of mobs, rather than as an effective means of stopping mob spell casting.  fear is by far and large the best option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>sir0die</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">get ya a moonstone ring with extended range II, then cast on them when you are at your max spell casting range, it should be out of range of the mobs spell casting range. espicially if you are rooting it.<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Sadly, when I pull casters with my duo, I find that I just have to run them out of mana.  I keep my resists over 100 and just outlast them.  It's much more mana-intensive than melees, but it works.  My ranger has a stun proc and dogdog bashes, but neither of those can be done on command, of course.<br />
<br />
At your levels, casters can be deadly if you are solo.  A necro can fear to keep casters from casting, his pet bashes, and screaming terror works as well.  Keep your resists up, or just fight melees.<br />
<br />
Casters are everyone's bane, they can nuke like crazy and still hit as hard as a warrior mob.  They just have fewer hp, but when you start fighting CH'ing clerics, that will be little consolation.  Nothing worse than taking a 10k hp mob down to 1% and having all that work go down the drain...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Grab yourself a Spear of Mortification or a Howling Harpoon and haste yourself before you go in.  Make sure to buff your dex.  If you're lucky you will proc stun at just the right moment before that nuke goes off to kill you!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Snare and fear are a good combination - if it's feared it's not casting at you. <br />
<br />
But so far everyone has missed the obvious solution - nuke! If your dot's aren't fast enough, nuke the little caster buggers down. At lower levels the caster mobs still have few enough HP that it's possible to nuke them down relatively quickly with a couple of nukers. At L 24 both shamand and necros get a good new nuke spell. Sure, you're not wizards, but frost strike and shock of poison are NOT bad nukes. If you're in a spot where you have to fight an occasional caster while exp'ing, just nuke them down. <br />
<br />
If you're in a spot where you have to fight LOTS of casters while exp'ing, go exp someplace else. You are correct that shamans are not ideally equipped for fighting caster mobs, and that will only get worse as you level. Shamans excel against melee mobs, so why fight that when you're trying to exp?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Aye , farm up some Stun lariats for puppy ( or buy if cant) get a howling harpoon or naother stun weapon and learn to use your shield/bash , well assuming your not a iksar or kitty (?) .<br />
<br />
Belive it or not , the correctly times slam can result in ALOT of interupts , no where near that of a cleric or warrior ( found that out hard way in PvP :( ) but itll be enough to block them frequently enough to make it worth it. I still can interupt giants in BoT , but at that level its more of a prayer then a timed skill,But it happens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Question: when pets proc spells, such as the stun from the GHL, what are the resist rates?  I ask because my 49 pet is level 30-something, and if I'm fighting 55+ Gorangas for example, does he have any chance of getting the stun to stick?<br />
<br />
This is more a question of experience, basically, do you see your dogdog stunning mobs 20 levels higher than he is?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Codlugarthia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">When fighting caster gnolls in Jaggedpine I pull with the fast poison DOT (EB or Bane Of Nife) and nuke the hell out of them with my best DD spell.<br />
If the type of mobs resist some nukes, I pull them with resist debuff and nuke right ahead.<br />
<br />
The faster they die the less damage they can do.  And since casters tend to have low hp this tactics often works.<br />
<br />
Also, I don't use bear form when fighting casters so i can bash them (I'm a troll).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yes casters are truly the bane of shamans.<br />
<br />
Bastards keep rolling against me on runes!  Wth!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I found after Dogdog came along taking casters became 10X easier with simple tactic.  Send Dogdog in to take the first hit.  Soon as Dogdog hits your nukes should be landing directly.  I personally like to hit them with one our few rain spells first as they have a nice 6 sec DD component that hits the target a couple of times.  Then I just go all out with my nukes and see who gets to win.  By sending in your pet the total damage the caster can put out is spread out between you two.  Oh and make sure that silly dog is Taunting like he should in those cases.</div></div><hr />
