Says its gonna make it better for all classes, but doesnt say anything on slowability/mitagation.  Guess spell drop increase is about it for us.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nobody can say for sure, the devs haven't given any details on what the retune really will be.  I'd venture it's either very extensive (moving from trials for groups to raids for guilds to control progression) or pretty lame (lowering DPS and raising hp)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>korask shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If Vxed and Tipt became a guild raid thing i think I'd be so happy i jump out the window.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Personally I like the way the sewers and smith are setup. Single grou option for those that aren't in a big guild or miss the guild raid and guild version so you don't have to get the guild threw one group at a time, if that. Something like that for tipt/vxed would be great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>korask shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The problem with god is they took challenge, and instead made it tedium.  Groups one by one to flag everyone is NOT fun.  Po Justice was tolerable because it was a single instance, but basing all of god upon these crapped up trials is what makes the expansion a waste of time.  most people play the game to raid at this point in day... not to do the same thing over and over to get 1 person flagged so that you can DO IT AGAIN WEE...  They need to crap out this entire group thing and make at most 1 damn trial and it should be fast paced like trials were with obvious goals and endings... not the dull snoozefest trash clearing with the OMG CAN WE SURVIVE 10 nuclear weapons going off at once finale.<br />
<br />
My hope is finally some people quitting gave them a bite in the ass and it makes my game more enjoyable for it.  I have fun playing EQ still... but I hope to stand at the entry to time soon... and soon gates will be where we look.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zethrir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">* Experience has been increased in several zones.<br />
* Natimbi, Qinimi, Barindu, Riwwi, and Ferubi should be tuned more appropriately for their intended level ranges.<br />
* NPCs will no longer hit for max damage as often. Knights in particular should find it easier to tank mobs they previously had difficulty with.. <br />
<br />
If they made these 5 zones more attractive to the BoT crowd as alternative experience zones then I would be happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>lightus_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I like vxed and tipt, i like you have to try over and over again in order to make it, what I dont like is if they turn GoD in Karnors castle version 3 (BoT was version2)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Natimbi, Qinimi, Barindu, Riwwi, and Ferubi are for the most part deserted.  I think changing them to be more viable for the BoT crowd would be good. I don't think the typical non 'uber' BoT player would have the patience to complete all the trails (which appear to not be changing) to get to vxed, tipt, Kod'Taz, etc, so this wouldn't effect those who have progressed atleast alittle through GoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">We would like to thank all of the folks on the Test Server who have been helping with the re-working of the encounters and we hope that you enjoy the changes when they go live in the very near future. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I like Tipt, it has a bit of variety. It has a mini named to start with, it a clear destination to clear the way to, it has the riddler, it takes a little skill to pull, but it's not so hard that you need an expert. The only thing I dislike is that the named at the end is so tough a well geared (10k+) knight can't tank it and you pretty much need a backup healer (though shaman can do this). I've seen groups take 2 clerics for this trial, for just the one mob.<br />
<br />
I hate Vxed. Without an enchanter it's a 4 hour (or more) slog to kill the 100 mobs. Then you can clear all the way to the final room and find that your puller can't quite split the mobs, and you wipe on an add. I have done this with and without enchanters and it's doable without, but the difference is mindblowing.<br />
<br />
These trials are hard, I like that. I like a challenge. I don't mind that there's not a raid alternative like there is for the smith event, though it does make it harder to get some guildies through (either particular classes, or low play time, or muppets). 2 trials like this is fine. Ikkinz trials are a different matter...</div></div><hr />

They screwed it up hardcore a patch or two back with mobs being able to cast 6 1k hitting pets..*** is that? Drastic changes are needed for all classes for interest to continue in it. Sk's,Pally's,Monks,Shamans, and mages all need something they can bring to the table in this expansion. The only way they can is if they are completely geared in time gear can they even do anything. <br />
<br />
Vxed/Tipt are hard but hell just getting to the zone in of Ikiz &gt; then beating end mob in Tipt half the time. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">yes Vxed for one is way too long. Not tough, just long. Tipt is kinda fun really but a little on the long side as well. GETTING to the Ikk trials is just dumb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I had a more fundamental problem.  Brenlo's response to the shaman was that GoD was being retuned.  However, the fact that it's retuned does not address the fundamental game changes that make shaman obsolete.<br />
<br />
The only possible change that could make shaman more attractive is for them to double the hp of every mob in GoD so that fights approach 1 minute.  That would make slow useful again, and also make our DoTs useful.<br />
<br />
I fail to see, in any short fight situation, how any other retuning of the game can address our inability to heal spikes of dps, our lack of mana regen in short active fights, our lack of dps in short fight situations, or the fact that fully 1/3 of our spell book is related to worthless stat buffs.<br />
<br />
Somehow I don't think they're going to address that though.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ubex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">While GOD may be ( IS )  stacked against Shaman utility, The larger is is that the shaman has very little utility in the higher end of EQ.  Sure, raids do need 2-3 Shaman for debuffing which we still do better than other classes.  But the fact remains that for most other encounters Enchanterd and Beastlords serve as well and bring more to the group.  I want an ability that makes me a class of choice again like at lvl 20s to low 60's.<br />
<br />
I have friend that are Beastlords and very good players but I resent that Sony apears to want to replace the shaman with the Beastloard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Someone find Chutoi the prize, please?<br />
<br />
I don't think they understand the issues well enough to address the problem, either.  Merge the shaman and bst class (in some balanced manner) and call it a day, plzktks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">If the dps spikes are lowered, we'll be more able to heal there.  <br />
<br />
That's one significant way where a probable content change will address some issues.  <br />
<br />
I betcha they are lowering immunities too, and if the GoD slow is more common, people will land their slows faster and feel better about themselves.  <br />
<br />
I understand some degree of cynicism, but let's be reasonable here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Gart, unfortunately that's on the average again.  If the mobs hit for max less often, that doesn't mean that they won't ever have 2 rounds of max hits--it's a random number generator.  Shaman cannot handle burst dps at the moment.  Do you really think that we should be able to heal as long as the random number generator works in our favor?<br />
<br />
Yes, we'll be 'more' able to heal, but it's really NOT a solution.  We're still dependent on luck to get us through, and that's not appropriate for 'balance.'<br />
<br />
Chutoi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Just reduce Vxed total kills to say around 60 - 75.  100 is a bit much, especially if you don't have a charmed pet (might I add that I've never used a charmed pet in here before).  Tipt is perfect the way it's at right now I'd say.  It's not guaranteed that you will pass it your first time through, it's long enough that you know you are in for a long fight, and it's hard enough that you know that you have to be on your toes the entire time.<br />
<br />
Personally I haven't done Ikk trial 1 since I passed it the first time, but 2 and 3 are easily done with a cleric and shaman healing now, as long as your tank is decent (last time our mage died on the 2nd trial at 11%.. which is when he is hittable, and me and the cleric, kept a warrior, pally and bard alive till the 2nd priest wiped us at 1%).<br />
<br />
on the other hand, i've spent alot of time duoing with my ranger in Riwwi so it kinda sucks that I missed out on alot of exp while doing that.  But, my server is pretty much empty either way so it might not make a difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Probably the mobs will hit for less and the fights will last a bit longer to allow us to do our damage. We'll see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">MOB dps changes will primarily be aimed at enchanters I assume, to reduce the dps their charmed pets crank out. Mobs live longer, hit for less, sort of balance us... I guess. This in turn, will require a massive rebalance of every zone, since it appears they were designed with charmed pets in mind as the way to win. So, yay on longer trials, or something like that.<br />
<br />
However, theres still no compelling reason to bring a shaman on the trials.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I've spent a fair bit of non-raiding time the last week or two working on the BiC quest in Qinimi and Riwwi (I recently got a new computer, which has allowed me to duo again) and I have to say that once mobs there are slowed they are stupidly easy. You can heal with Q and still have most of your mana (90%) at the end of the fight. Plus the agro ranges of a lot of the mobs is very small, so pulling isnt too hard. Shaman should be able to act as main healers in these zones without too many problems I would think. The main issue of course is that the xp is not very good.<br />
<br />
These zones are pretty much deserted except for the odd person doing quests or passing through to trials. I think increasing the xp modifier would be a good thing it the sense that it might make the zones more attractive to casual players. The only thing that concerns me is that if hunting here is seen as a viable option, we might have people hunting in the corridor leading from Qinimi to Barindu, causing see invis mobs to pop. If that happens you can see that CR runs to trials could become &quot;interesting&quot; ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">However, theres still no compelling reason to bring a shaman on the trials.<br />
<br />
I dont want a &quot;compelling&quot; reason. I want there to be equality in the reasoning for chosing any class. Yes a warrior is best, but a Pally or SK should be good enough too. Yes clerics and druids are best, but shaman should be able to cover heals too. Yes a wizard is best caster DPS, and rogue is best melee, but Mages and Necros and Monks and Zerkers need to be close enough to choose.<br />
<br />
What I DONT want to see is SHAMAN become required. I DONT want to see ANY class sitting there going &quot;Please Please Pick Me!&quot;. Thats the crux of it.</div></div><hr />
