<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grokii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was in Charsis about a year ago working on my cudgel quest and I ended up teaming with a ranger that had downloaded a map he saw link on a thread in Allakazahms that had every named spawn, every pit fall, and every ground spawn for the master key.<br />
<br />
I'm about to head back for my epic 1.5 goo drops and going to try to get my master key.  Before I bug a guildmate or two into coming down to help me I was wondering if anyone had this map or has better searching skills then I have.  I tried eq-toolbox/mapfiend and found nothing.  I tried searching allakazhams and found nothing.<br />
<br />
On the subject of mapfiend... isn't there supposed to be multiple versions of maps?  I can only find one map for each area and it normally sucks.  I must not be using the webpage right, but I can't figure it out.  In the past I hear eq-toolbox was an alternitive to mapfiend, but now the two are the same page.  Is there another site out there for ingame maps I could try?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">the mapfiend maps have been excellent for me almost always.  I've supplemented several with named spawn locations from messageboards, but that's about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grokii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The only one they have is only the zone.  I was hoping for all the extra little spawn locations and such.  I've found .jpgs with all the information I want.. it's just such a bear to use the system ingame to put all the locations and such.<br />
<br />
I guess I'll just go 'old school' and print out a map for when I need to go.  I spent about an hour or so googling for it and found nothing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, one problem with mapping spawn locations for HS is that the named don't just have one loc each.  On any spawn that can be a named, any named for that wing can appear.  You can't camp &quot;Embalming Fluid&quot;, you just camp a named location, and take whatever named pops up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">BTW, for the epic goo drops, head to the southmost end of the zone, that's where I've seen the most of the right kind of slime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grokii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I was unaware that some spawns were variable like that.  I think some spawns are static like the illusion erudite mask spawn though.<br />
<br />
Lastly, I had read I should go to the south wing for the goo, but I had planned on just wandering.  Thanks for the tip for the higher chance of spawn in the deep south.  I'll give it a try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>KB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Just finished cudgel quest with a friend a couple of months ago, and he got his epic drops in the same place as the cudgel drops. We just set up camp in a corner I went and pulled all I could see, he ae slowed then we nuked/tapped let the pets loose. Was good times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Greflin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Actualy there are spots in each wing where a named will spawn other than the boss spots. The first door once inside the north wing forinstance holds a named mob. It's on a longer spawn timer but it's either a spec or a goo. The other spawn spots for any mob can spawn a named that is true. But there are static named spots still.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Don't think you understood me.  Spawn points don't move.  The named that spawn on each spot aren't fixed.  The goo and spec that can spawn in that room can also spawn at any other named spot in the north wing.  There are 4 places for north wing named, iirc, one in each room.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Not an in game map but a great walkthrough of the quest, and a good map. I did it ages ago, it's neat to have the master key:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grokii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I ran accross that page a couple times while Googling Karshak.  Very nice write up.   : )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Cronikk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Me and an SK buddy basically cleared the south wing over and over to get the skulls needed for the cudgel quest. During this session (3 hours tops?), I got what I needed and, as a bonus, the goo drops too.<br />
<br />
With regards to the 'variable named spawn' argument, I was under the impression that the wing bosses were a consistent spawn - all others spaen points could produce random named.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>spiritsofding</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">why dont u update that hs writeup ??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">This thread reminded me that I've been &quot;planning&quot; on going and getting the HS master key for ages, and never got around to it. So last night, I took my ranger twink and myself back to Charasis and started carving away.<br />
<br />
I was surprised to find how many mobs in there are still light blue at lvl 70. With 70 ranger/70 shaman its certainly not hard in there, but dogdog died several times, and there are a couple of rooms where you WILL get 4-6 mobs coming at once--I can't see any way of avoiding it. I was also surprised to re-discover that there is some gear dropping in there that is still at least minimally marketable.<br />
<br />
Crawl time was about 5 hours, from initial ZI to final key combine. Would have been quicker, but the boss mob in the second wing (Procurator?) refused to spawn for me--had to go through 4 PHs before he popped. First boss was already up when I zoned in or I probably wouldn't have even started the crawl. Third boss popped after 1 PH. <br />
<br />
Sathir wasn't up, so I didn't get a chance to see if I could solo/duo her, but otherwise, it was a fun evening. Nice way to blow off some steam.<br />
<br />
And btw, there's a nice walkthrough for the key quest on EQExpert (though I'm not a fan of that site).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I didn't mean it to sound like that was my write up.. lol.. I meant to say &quot;I did the master key quest ages ago, and I used this map/page done by someone else&quot;.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the misunderstanding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>KB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Pet pull Dru and she is easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Shm can just pull the whole room.  Gear trivializes that whole crowd.  I did two regular Morti Golems and two Fabled Morti Golems together myself, before looting either of my new spell haste items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>KB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I like to avoid extra work where at all possible.</div></div><hr />
