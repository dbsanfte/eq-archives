<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">K, Why are people saying they would do different things &quot;maybe if you had a horse you would....&quot;  but so far there have been a couple situations that  I have read over that people say the horse would make a difference in tactics.<br />
<br />
Example 1:<br />
reading about soloing Lozi someone said &quot;Summon horse, slow, drop dots, root, dismiss horse, use rabid bear&quot;  Question, why would you need the horse?  you are a shaman no?  If you are going to root rot, why not root rot and stay from melee?<br />
<br />
Example 2:<br />
Borgax says in the Thread &quot;which would you use in your secondary hand&quot;<br />
&quot;Maybe if you had a horse, and the modifier went beyond our maxxed out skill (don't know if it does or not)...but I think I'd still use the Wurms&quot;<br />
<br />
so what is up with horses?  do you not med while sitting on them or why would having a horse make a diff as to what shield you would use?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">While on a horse, you med while standing if you're not moving and not auto-attacking.   You can cast and use right-click items while medding. <br />
<br />
If you're outdoors and plan to be root-rotting or JBB'ing, etc. the horse allows you to meditate the whole time without sitting.<br />
<br />
In example 2, the one shield had a +med modifier- the point was that if you're medding while standing, and the +med modifier would help you, maybe that shield is more valuable.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wargbearjumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You've got it a little backwards Bigguss...  while on horseback you are medding anytime you are not attacking or not casting... you are medding while you move because you are seated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm pretty sure that while you're moving, you're not medding.  I've tested it myself, and I believe it's the popular consensus as well.<br />
<br />
To be super clear:<br />
<br />
If you are on a horse, not moving, and not auto-attacking... you are medding.  You can med while casting and you can med while right-clicking... as long as you're not moving.<br />
<br />
If you are moving, you're not medding.<br />
<br />
If you are auto-attacking, you're not medding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">So effectively a horse is a good soloing tool is what I'm reading here?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yup.  A horse and a JBB is an especially outstanding combo.   Pull with JBB, root, DoT, JBB until root breaks, reapply root, JBB until root breaks, repeat.  <br />
<br />
By the end of the fight, you'll have medded back most (if not all) of the mana used on roots and DoTs, while doing continual damage.  :)</div></div><hr />

Hope joo sell thet regen chestplate soon :)  <br />
<br />
Horse &amp; JBB just rock,  solo or exp group.<br />
No siting to regain mana == JBB constantly.<br />
<br />
If joo no have da little JBB den da horse is not<br />
very usefull.<br />
<br />
A normal situation wid horse &amp; jbb &amp; warrior partner:<br />
<br />
Last night (lots of nights) mez go to work killing guards in<br />
Katta with mez warrior partner.<br />
<br />
a) Mez pull with slow<br />
b) Run back to kill spot<br />
c) JBB constantly while Warrior tries to maintain agro.<br />
d) Pet Helps out.<br />
e) When current target near death start over at a)<br />
<br />
I chain pulled like this doing all the buffing, healing and such for 1 hour 45 mins before suffering any down time.  I had to stop for about 3 mins after regen, krag, and shroude all droped at the same time.  Then I continued to chian pull untill I quit for the night 2 hours 15 mins latter.  At 59 I fill a blue in about 85 mins and my 59 human warrior is getting a blue in 65.  *grins*<br />
<br />
(9kp Horse) == (3 X 70kp Fungi Tunic) in this situation.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">IF you have a horse, the trick is to TURN OFF HORSE MODELS!!<br />
Once that is done, you won't be bothered with a horse head in your face, irregular start up/stop speeds, or slow ass glue-factory horse speed cause u didn't blow an assload of money on it. <br />
You simply sow yourself, stack the horse buff on top of it, and go your merry way at SOW speed, not horse speed.  Scale of Wolf also stacks and is the speed that you travel at while buffed thusly.  <br />
<br />
I love my horse when hunting in CT.  In that zone it is a REAL hazard to be caught sitting at any time.  Mobs unslowed can waste you in seconds from almost 4k hps to nuthin.  I put on the horse buff and gain tons of mana while clickin my spear, clickin my bracer, or just standing there deciding what to do next.  <br />
<br />
You CAN turn around in a circle, or pivot if you will, while on a horse without losing the mana gain.  This is nice, since I am never really still, always lookin around for the next danger.  <br />
<br />
Oh, last point. . . go ahead and try to root/rot Lodi.  You'll learn a hard lesson swiftly.  <br />
He SUMMONS!<br />
I've only had a chance to solo Lodi once and I blew it by forgetting to time my own slows.  If I get another chance, I'm also gonna slap a potion DS on myself.  An extra 33dmg/hit (with bp buff) should really help wear him down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Baludien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Good answers, I've been wondering about this myself, and have been saving up for a horse. However, I have a question as well. If you are being beaten on, are you still medding? Can you pull with turgur and just tank it while jbbing and still get the med bonus, or do you have to root and back up?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">/target Baludien  /yes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I guess it depends whether getting beaten backwards counts as 'moving'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">When I solo I tank all the time... no root rot.  The horse still has its amazing impact on mana regen despite the constant pounding.<br />
<br />
I do get pushed around some but it does not appear so bad as to make much of a differance on horse meditate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Course, you have to make sure you have autoattack off while you are tanking it.   I know I normally leave it on for the one hit and chance at proc (REIF) between JBBs.  Would gladly give up the extra 40dmg on average though I think :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Uthgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I am buying a horse. :)<br />

Does it matter which horse i get or will the cheapest do?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Joo are going to turn horse model off so horse will have no impact on run speed.<br />
<br />
Get the cheepest one or close.   Vanity compelled me to get a black horse wich was a little more expensive then the tan horse but any Nag will do the job....  7 to 9 kp or so depending on charisma.<br />
<br />
Ogres look so cool on da big black horse.<br />
<br />
As a barb I might be tempted to get the a white nag.<br />
<br />
Even if joo not have da model on others will and will gripe about it on raids.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">If you turn off the horse model, you get the following.<br />
<br />
1) Medding while moving.<br />
<br />
2) Double medding while sitting down (don't always work, use insta clicks to refresh your client side mana bar)<br />
<br />
3) can be buffed with sow, selos, etc<br />
<br />
4) no augmentation of speed from horse alone<br />
<br />
This is good if you have a cheap horse and wants the ability to med fast, but it kinda sucks if you have a good horse since you don't get the speed.<br />
<br />
I bought my twink a 100k horse, he makes Boinshar seem slow =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I am still not convinced that the med part works with the models off, but I will try it again since you guys seem positive that it does.  <br />

How is Bearform affected with models on/off?  Would this solve the raid whining issues?  What about shrink potions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Horse rocks in CT.. never have to sit = never getting sitting aggro.. trying to talk my groups cleric into getting one for just that purpose heh. I originally picked up my horse on a whim cause I thought it would rock to be rid of cannidancing in outdoors zones.. it does.. but the horse is just as useful in groups for getting rid of the sit-aggro thing too heh. I love my rescued from the glue factory horse pokey.. even if I never see him =p</div></div><hr />

The medding thing isn't something I use that often.  I don't hunt outdoors much at all.  CT and ME constitute the sum of my outdoor hunting activity.  Maiden Eye very rarely, and mostly when my necro friend wants to duo there.  We two can keep a steady stream of gorangas comin with only breaks being to refresh buffs.  Me with my canni5 and him with his necro lich, we always have plenty of mana.  The horse helps of course, since I never sit down cept to swap spells.</div></div><hr />

I bought a horse, I have horse models off, I have Luclin Troll models off, I cast Regrow to spend some Mana from full and my Mana  bar does not increase while standing just as if I didn't have a horse and was standing.<br />
<br />
Sure this works?<br />
<br />
Tried SoW then Horse, Horse then SoW, no SoW, etc...my Mana bar is still one bubble from full and its been like 10 minutes.<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
<br />
Tried all of the above again, this time with New Troll models ON and Horse off. Same results.</div></div><hr />

Running around in a circle...for about 9 minutes, no movement on the Blue bar.<br />

Strange, you all seem so sure this works.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Gothlips</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">If you someone a horse without horse graphics on, while standing up you are not medding, you still have to sit down, so there is no benfit from having a horse if you don't have the graphic on. Secondly, if you shrink yourself while on a horse, you will lose the bouncing horse head in your view.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Thual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">while standing up you are not medding, you still have to sit down, so there is no benfit from having a horse if you don't have the graphic on<br />
<br />
That is wrong, while on a horse and standing (with horse graphics off) you med as if you were sitting, as long as you do not have auto attack on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I bought a horse yesterday and tested this myself. I used up all my mana, and timed how long it took to get back to 4 bubbles. All Luclin models were turned off.<br />
<br />
No horse, sitting: 7 mins<br />
Horse, standing: 7 mins<br />
No horse, canni dancing: 4 mins<br />
<br />
I also confirmed to my satisfaction (but I don't have any figures) that you don't med if you have the horse buff up, but are walking/running.<br />
<br />
Also note that having the horse buff up prevents you from getting the sitting regeneration rate. Sothe most efficient way to recover during downtime is to sit/cannidance with no horse. But during combat, when you can't sit, horses help a lot.<br />
<br />
The next thing I will test, when I get time, is whether you can manually attack on a horse without losing the med advantage. It just doesn't feel right, when soloing, to just stand there and let the mob hit me without poking it back (I don't have a JBB).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I just bought my horse yesterday and I can also confirm that you do indeed gain mana on a horse with models off as if you were medding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Thual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">So the most efficient way to recover during downtime is to sit/cannidance with no horse<br />
<br />
Don't agree at all. <br />
<br />
Granted by standing (on a horse) your HP regeneration rate has dropped, but you still regenerate at your standing level and can still cast Cann while standing + medding.<br />
<br />
As a level 53 Troll I am losing 6hp/tick while standing, but I am gaining mana at my sitting rate AND still doing Cann while standing. I am recovering mana MUCH faster than I could with Canni-dance (with the extra 6hp/tick)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I didn't mean recover solely mana, I meant recover generally. Cannibalising doesn't &quot;recover&quot; in that sense, it merely converts hp to mana - you still have to regenerate those hp.<br />
<br />
With a horse, you get sitting mana + standing hp regen.<br />
Sitting down, no horse, you get sitting mana + sitting hp regen.<br />
<br />
I agree that if all you want is mana back fast, cannibalizing madly while on a horse is the best way, but you end up with less hp than if you had cannidanced with no horse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I guess the confusion arose from my use of the term &quot;efficient&quot; - means different things to different people :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Here's my opinon about horses, having now owned one for a couple of days. This is just my opinoins, not fact, YMMV and all that.<br />
<br />
Soloing - Can't see the horse helping me much. I don't have a JBB, so to get the med advantage from the horse I need to just stand there doing nothing, while my pet and DoTs work on the mob, and the mob works on me. It just feels wrong, I've got an epic poker, I should be poking things with it! I haven't done any firm tests but soloing mature wurms in skyfire didn't feel any better with a horse.<br />
<br />
Grouping - Maybe this is down to my grouping style, but Dobbin kicks arse. Had a group in the Grey last night, I was pulling, often multiples. Managed to slow mobs, park adds, keep groupmates hasted and buffed. The only times we stopped was when the other casters went low on mana. I don't think the horse is a *massive* advantage in this situation, but more of a convenience thing - because I never have to sit, it's much easier to manage the agro and keep the mobs where we want them. Also I have to cannibalize a lot less - and that means less tedious button pushing.<br />
<br />
All in all, a good buy. Shame I spent half my JBB fund on it, but no one wanted to sell me a JBB for 20k anyway!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">/nog Grippa<br />
<br />
Horse much more effective with JBB then without.<br />
<br />
Horse without JBB and solo is not much different from root<br />
rot except joo dog can help and joo take damage.<br />
<br />
The guud news Grippa is that you can get most of the cash out of your horse when you find a JBB for sale.  Just go sell it :).  The loss is not nice but that 8 or 9k did not do you much guud just sitting in the bank. <br />
