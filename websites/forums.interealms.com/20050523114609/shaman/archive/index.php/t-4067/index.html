Mana cap. That's right, mana cap. Can you say it? MANA CAP!<br />
<br />
FF summary of caster issues:<br />
- No more focus items.<br />
- No more caster balancing.<br />
- FT15 cap.<br />
- Mana cap.<br />

The gross incompetence of the monkey coders at VI never ceases to amaze me.</div></div><hr />

My resists are where I want them to be, mana will be capped, who cares about 15FT when you have Canni V.<br />
<br />
So basically I'll just be after pure HP items, along with everyone else.<br />
<br />
So in the end game, out of all the stats, you will max them all excpet for HP.<br />

<br />
Gee, if it's that easy, maybe you should cease gracing us on these message boards and go out and write your own MMORPG. Just whip one up, it must be trivial. Even the monkey coders at VI were able to make the most popular and successful  role playing game of all time. Someone as genius as you shouldn't have any trouble at all. <br />
<br />
Forgive the sarcasm, I'm just pretty fed up with forum going dimwits who don't know squat about game developing mouthing off about how incompetent game developers are. It seems the more comically addicted someone is to a game ( see Fires of Heaven ) the more they criticize, insult and berate the developers of the game. It's just bizarre. If you don't like the game, then don't play it. If you like it, then the developers must have done something right - so why accusations of &quot;gross incompetence&quot;?<br />
<br />
Just because there is a feature in the game that you do not like (the supposed mana cap) does mean they are incompetent. Since it takes more work to code something than to not code something, a logical person can only assume that IF this feature exists, it exists for a reason. Maybe that reason will change in the future, maybe it will not. <br />

No one said no more focus items.<br />
No one has said that caster balancing is done.<br />
FT cap 15 has always been in place (although it was broken).<br />
There isn't any proof of a Mana cap other than a flame on the FoH board.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">EQ = D&amp;D Barbie.  I have always found it kind of funny that everything in high-end EQ is designed towards getting better equipment to increase your stats, while at the same time most stats do very, very little to increase your effectiveness after a certain point (HP and weapon ratios/effects being the most notable exceptions).<br />
<br />
Items are mostly just for prestige and playing dress-up.  EQ is a lot more like Statbuilder than most people would care to admit.  Not that I mind, I am right there playing D&amp;D Barbie with everyone else.<br />
<br />
This has changed a little with the proliferation of items with effects, but there is only so far you can go with core game system that was designed around a warrior with creafted and a pair of yaks being the ultimate force.  <br />
<br />
Presumably, EQ2 will be a lot more scaleable, so they can actually give people pellets that continually make them more and more powerful the longer they push the button.  They just didn't expect EQ to grow this much, I think.</div></div><hr />

I was about to post this, but then decided it was futile... and then I read Vorpatril, who had been reading my mind, lol.<br />
<br />
It's sooo easy to point fingers when you have no clue what compromises the developers were forced to make, what other factors were being considered, what last-minute design changes were foisted on the implementors.<br />
<br />
At least while you're writing your own MMPORG you won't be playing EQ, since it obviously sucks I assume you'll be cancelling your account immediately.</div></div><hr />

<br />
EQ reminds me of the Y2K situation. Apparently there was a ton of new code, written on a lot of older code. Now the old code wasn't 'bad' it's just that they original writers of said code didn't plan on some of the things yet to come.<br />
<br />
I honestly wonder how many of the old and orignal code writers are still employed. (By VI)</div></div><hr />

Well with 2 or 3 of the right upgrades I'll hit the mana cap.<br />
 <br />
<br />
Unless you haven't been updating your profile your a bit more than 2 or 3 of the right upgrades away from the mana cap. If they found the right number your a hair over 500 raw mana away from the cap which would be a min of 4 items if they where all 125 mana items upgrading 0 mana slots. Since you only have 3 slots with out any mana on them already and you guys aren't into VT either so there are very few mana items over 100 outside of vt I'd say your more like 6-8 maybe even 10 item upgrades away from hitting the cap.<br />
<br />
I'm not to worried about the mana cap personally since my preference is towards hps anyway i highly doubt I'll ever get anywhere near the cap they seem to have found. I doubt most shaman will either, jenadar and a 1 or 2 others may but most of us won't.</div></div><hr />

Damn OK you got me :) 4 or 5 then.<br />
<br />
I'd say your more like 6-8 maybe even 10 item upgrades away from hitting the cap. <br />
<br />
You'd be right if we were just talking about NToV items, but really we are talking about VT.<br />
<br />
We aren't into VT yet, but we are damn close, as are you guys I would think, so when I say 'right' upgrades I mean VT stuff really.<br />
<br />
I'm not to worried about the mana cap personally since my preference is towards hps anyway i highly doubt I'll ever get anywhere near the cap they seem to have found.<br />
<br />
For myself I'l worry about it when/if it comes.  There is a bigger issue than my personal gear here though.<br />
<br />
At least 4 of our casters are above the hard mana cap already, without VT items.  Where is their character development from here?  3 out of the 4 are Int casters, the only avenue for upgrades it leaves is HP.  Out of 20? stats, the only one left for pure casters to improve upon is HP? that blows.<br />
<br />
Everyone like to see their toon get better, be it levels, tradeskills, AA, equipment or skills etc.  if you remove one of the goals for advancement you remove the motivation to log in for some people.  I know I like to see Fulaq get that little bit better over time, if I was going into VT knowing that no loot that dropped there, would in any significant way improve my character I'd be pissed.<br />
<br />
They need to remove the cap.</div></div><hr />

VAK *sigh* I forgot, all must follow Zorlac or they are deemed to be ass kissers of Verant. Maybe you could have Sunmoon or Thantu put that up top, so all new people know too. Wouldn't want them to go around thinking that it's okay to have differing opinions or anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I personally think it's weak that in a game that's supposed to provide continual advancement, it is possible to &quot;max out&quot; all applicable abilities... and that this has neither been identified (players had to find it themselves) nor dealt with.<br />
<br />
I have a larger problem with the whole idea that the game mechanics needs to be a secret- the whole &quot;for roleplaying reasons&quot; is a load of crap.   It's one thing to say &quot;We don't have a consistent rule system that we're comfortable releasing&quot; - it's another to say &quot;It's for roleplaying reasons- we're purists that way!&quot; then implement widescale No Drop, a searchable bazaar window, a global /tell system, and a million other obviously non-roleplaying things.  <br />
<br />
One other tidbit I found interesting in that thread is the speculation that there is a cap on resists that is lower than people think.   That would certainly help me make gear decisions- has anyone heard of this?<br />
<br />
I'm agreeing more and more with Zorlac... is that one of the seven signs?  :)</div></div><hr />

When, in reality, it seems people are more just tired of his little act then disagreeing with what he says. <br />

/gesture VI<br />
<br />
To those who don't seem to get it, lemme lay it out for you. AC is capped. Resists are capped (and low, I might add.) All stats are capped. In the end, it was mana and HP that people had to look forward to getting more of. Those were the, assumably, cap-free variables. There's just no reason to put one on either. It's senseless.<br />
<br />
It just takes another part of the game for high end folks and puts it in the 'pointless' hole.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Krytog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">1) The complaint over the mana cap is just another whine that VI is out to get me, wa wa wa. It's a game. It should have limits to attempt to ensure some sembelance of balance.  At the point your are equipped with gear where you even come close you will have C3 and mana regen stuff out the wazoo.<br />
<br />
2) As for the sending back your sandwich because you got mayonaise. I would recomend going to a different sandwich shop because the patrons here are quite tired of hearing about it.<br />
<br />
<br />
On a more serious note it really isn't that big of a deal. Thats a pretty deep mana pool and a while to recover it. You must really enjoy sitting on your arse. If you really want a super uber unbeatable character create one in a table top RPG. Give him whatever you can dream of and sit and stare at the paper and enjoy yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Fulaq:  I have read the thread at FoH, and I stand by my statement.  A couple of high level wizards took off various amounts of +mana gear and noticed that their % stayed at 100, or dipped to 92 with various combinations.  <br />
<br />
Nowhere did I see anything that said &quot;I tried to cast a 500 mana spell and I could only cast it 9 times before going OOM when I clearly should have 5200mana points.&quot;<br />
<br />
There could be several hypotheses for the behaviour, but they latched onto one and ran with it.  As I said, improper testing.  <br />
<br />
It would be easy enough to disprove my idea (that the problem is with the UI).  But for now, no one has, so it's equally valid.</div></div><hr />

What a lame analogy.  They made the ham sandwich to your order, of course it should be what you asked for.  EQ is not made to your order.  A better comparison would be you complaining that the trash cans on the streets in your town are too small, and lobbying the city council to have them replaced with bigger ones at a substantial expense.  It's pretty obvious that the current ones are too small in some situations, but most of the time they work ok.  You might succeed in convincing them and you might not, but you're going to have to justify the expense in terms of the benefits to everyone in the city, not just state that because you pay your taxes you &quot;deserve&quot; bigger trash cans.<br />
<br />
Personally, I hope VI doesn't spend a whole hell of a lot of time raising a cap that isn't going to mean squat to the VAST majority of the players of the game.  Although I agree that this should at least have been DOCUMENTED so people didn't waste a lot of time acquiring what are essentially useless items.<br />

There will definitely be more focus items coming out.  Future items and current items will have focus effects added to them.  <br />
<br />
Caster Balancing is continuing and will continue for a very long time.  They're moving on to Priest balancing right now but that does not mean they will not revisit caster balancing.<br />

People saying VI is not done with the promissed upgrades with focus items, here is the newsflash. They are not done true,  too bad it will take them nearly 2 years to even think about it again. How long they promissed class balancing? I see.<br />
<br />
Let's see. It was clear at the FF that most of the team is busy on PoP. Meaning, PoP is priority UNO. There won't be any major game changes before it's released (that's why we getting groovy new particle effects, AKA bones and eyecandy). If people doubt me, then why is still the emperor kill exploit ingame? Team has no time to fix it and it's deep in the code.<br />
<br />
Then PoP is released. Unfinished. Yes despite them promissing heaven, it will be unfinished, broken, Luclin version 2.0. Then the team goes back on focus items and balancing ... no wait, they go back fixing PoP and then work on what didn't made the PoP schedule. Then 8-9 months passed PoP's release they might actually think about fixing casters and filling out their promisses about focus items. That's only about 1.5 years from now. Enjoy.<br />
<br />
Oh and with new mana pool cap, ODS just became the numero uno shoulder item in the game for casters. Yeah that 50 AC, 4000 HP item is crap compared to it.<br />

Why should a shaman care?  The people this really hurts are the very high end casters.  As a shaman it is easy to play off a small mana pool as a non-issue because shaman mana regen is insane.<br />
<br />
Can a wizard get by with a maxed mana pool and skill kill things well? sure.  But, this cap was hidden from the player base.  It is a nerf that, maybe, was always there, and shouldnt be.  What is the point of getting high mana items if they do nothing for you?  This needs to be fixed...they might as well put a cap on hp for warriors.<br />

Exactly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Few points:<br />
<br />
1.  You don't have to be an expert at something to recognize incompetence.<br />
<br />
2.  Messed up game mechanics affect everyone (especially in an environment that requires teamwork.)  The perfect example is Complete Heal- one bad decision made 3+ years ago that dictates the flow of much of the game.<br />
<br />
3.  While the idea of mana caps certainly stinks; the idea that we have to figure out ourselves that the implied game mechanics are actually incorrect due to some kind of hard-code hack, and that this is the general state of things and not the exception; stinks even more.<br />
<br />
4.  Just because EQ is the best game in town doesn't mean that by choosing to play it you cheerfully accept all of the flaws that come with it.  If the only car in the world was a Yugo, that doesn't mean I have to avoid complaining about the lack of legroom in a Yugo... or walk.  I play the game because it's the best out there, but I can still feel indignation over incompetence or philosophical differences.<br />
<br />
5.  Ever notice I get more wordy on each point?  :)</div></div><hr />

Never understood telling people not to whine though. Freedom of speech , freedom if you want to read the post or not. <br />
<br />
  As for eq its never ever going to be perfect and i highly doubt its ever going to be close to perfect. Like a baseball game i used to play. They would release it , than patch a few times to fix some bugs than it was on to the next installment of the game with the previous one's never being finished. This went on til they finally released a version that was so buggy (football too) and crappy that they finally killed the game. But it was a nice 7 or 8 year run. Going to be the same thing with EQ, the bottom line is its always going to be more important to them to get the next expansion out and keep people hooked that it is to totally fix what they have currently. While we all keep paying and playing it wont change. <br />
      Best we can hope for if we see something screwed up enough to try and get it fixed but never hold your breath. Why you think there are plans or eq2? Eq is going to die someday and they need something for us to go to. Till than keep the cash register cha chinging and plug some holes form time to time. Anyway my point is nothing wrong for people who want to complain about it and nothing wrong with people who want to leave it alone really. Fight the good fight if you feel up to it , its your X amount of dollars per month being spent.</div></div><hr />

Verant cant say it to them, but I can. Dont have fun anymore? Dont see a perspective in-game? Nothing thrilling you anymore? Leave the game behind you and search for new challenges. There are limits to every game, at some point a game is played out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think the balancing will be an ongoing process and unlikely ever to be &quot;finished&quot;. <br />
<br />
This from VI: http://eq.castersrealm.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=4446<br />
<br />
Alan was kind enough to pull together a list of Fan Faire threads, and I wanted to clear up a few things that seem to be propagating as our answers that might be a little bit off. <br />
<br />
Someone asked about the status of caster balancing and the Dev team said they were pretty much done with that, though we might see a few tweaks. <br />
<br />
This answer may have came from one of two places - Ryan's answer in the Developers/Producers panel was specifically addressing 'sweeping changes' with respect to INT casters alone. <br />
<br />
He ventured a guess that the largest of the changes may have already happened at this point, but he definitely didn't say that he was positive. <br />
<br />
He also included that more tweaks would be coming over time, and that caster balance in general was far from over, and was more of an ongoing process. <br />
<br />
My personal answer, from a few assorted conversations with people, was that when I get to play my wizard these days, I feel much more valuable and balanced than I ever have in the past, and that I wouldn't at all be disappointed if my class stayed the way it was for a while. <br />
<br />
The official answer remains the same: Caster Balance is definitely not over. Not by a longshot. <br />
<br />
Zorlac makes some good points, as usual, but, also as usual, you have to recognize his view point is one-eyed.</div></div><hr />

Items not effected by the mana limits are spells such as C3.<br />

&quot;I'm just pretty fed up with forum going dimwits who don't know squat about game developing mouthing off about how incompetent game developers are.&quot;<br />

There are a lot of video game industry veterans that play this game.  My guild alone has had between 8-12 people that are currently involved with games at some level.  Ranged from programmers to VP of Product Development to QA to level designers to buyers from EB.  I'm pushing 17 years in the video game industry myself.

Not true. Mail of the Void from Vyzrasoemthing the Cursed, IIRC 100 HP plus a built in 200HP effect when worn, so it gives 300 HP. More of these will be coming in PoP. I bet for mana too, since this is the only way VI can fix their archaic code and &quot;remove&quot; the 127 HP/Mana limitation from items.</div></div><hr />

If only that where true. The bp is a right click effect not an innate effect and the effect doesn't stack with focus. There are very few if any items out there with innate effects other than haste, attack, hp and mana regen.<br />
<br />
The only ones i can think of off hand have been changed. White dragon helm used to have an innate resist magic effect, gone and just raised the mr on the helm up to compensate. The cloak of thorns used to have an innate dmg shield, Changed to a different spell i beleive and a right click.<br />
<br />
It should be possible to do what you described but they seem to have some problems in practice so not sure if they are actually going to do that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Keep in mind.. this is INNATE Mana... your own pool.  This is just the combination of.....<br />
<br />
 Level+Wisdom (or Int)+Mana Raising Items= Hard Mana Pool Which can't exceed 4164<br />
<br />
Effects like KEI, and + Mana Potions can actually exceed the Cap and go above it, but that's all.<br />
<br />
Manaburn is a lovely way to test this.<br />

<br />
Zorlac, yes, currently you could get more mana or hp from a slot if that slot has an effect (which I see as a spell).  Until they remove the 125 limits, as you mentioned, that would be the max at each slot.<br />
<br />
Ohh and inventory items (such as 125 hp/mana food *cough*) would add to that making it an even 2500 hp/mana that you could gain from these slots.  So, in theory, they are shorting us 1100 mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">This discussion troubles me in another way as well, tho I'm not sure I'm reading it right. Here's the best post, by Lewick:<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Your base mana is the sum of the formulas for intelligence to 200 and from 201 to 255. <br />
<br />
For Intelligence up to 200: <br />
<br />
(Level * 2) + (Intel * Level * 0.2) <br />
<br />
For Intelligence from 201 to 255: <br />
<br />
(Level * 2) + ((Intel - 200) * Level * 0.1) <br />
<br />
Then add the two numbers together (if over 200 INT). <br />
<br />
The result for a level 60 caster with 255 intelligence is 2850. This is an approximate because I'm not 100% sure on the accuracy of the 0.1 modifier. It could very well be 0.11 or something dumb like that. <br />
<br />
Then if you add the research done by Neuro, the number he came up with for the per-item cap was 1388. This is very close to 50% of the base mana calculation. This leads me to believe that item mana can't be more than 50% of your base mana. <br />
<br />
A level 1 can test this. A level 1 wizard with 100 int should have a mana pool of 22. If you put on +11 worth of mana items, you should see the mana bar at 66%. If you put on more than that it should still read 66%. Test with lower level characters, since the margin of error is so much smaller with the smaller mana pool. <br />
<br />
This also leads me to believe that if they do a stat revisitation in PoP and allow players to go over 255 in a stat, it will increase your base mana pool and therefore increase your +mana item space. <br />
<br />
I believe it all holds pretty true though. The 5000 mana gathering spell is a good tell-tale. Right now I don't believe you can get over 5000 mana. The best I can tell, you can get up to 4238 + buffs. I believe the closest that a class can get is wizards with their familiar (which I think is applied AFTER everything is calculated.)<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
So, he seems to say that the 1388 cap on plus raw mana from items exists as a subordinate of his base mana, around 50 percent. Does that mean that it's scalable? That if you have less than 255 wis or int that it is lower? So, if I have 230 wis, in fact, I can only get, say, 1000 mana from plus mana items? This might DRASTICALLY redefine how I have to think about gear. That 100 mana item might be worthless if my wis is too low. Yikes, can this be true!?!?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">I dont think the new UI should be the bases for any definative study until they work out the bugs and call it finished.  <br />
<br />
I would say that if there are indead caps to mana and hp this game is in big trouble.  For 2 years the only way VI has been able to expand content for the high lvl people was but upping MoB hps, attacks and spells.  That meant that the PC needed increased hp and mana to be able to kill these MoBs.  If you take away the ability to increase you character they will no longer be able to simply increase the hps and melee stats of new MoBs to the new content.<br />
<br />
PoP would not have new encounters with new types of MoBs, just the same old MoBs with different skins.  One of the biggest problems that VI has had was making the MoBs dynamic and interesting to interact with.  Take away the variety and you have nothing but a new place to explore and no real motivtion to do anything or continue playing for that matter.<br />
<br />
I wouldnt get to concerend however until I se some move proof.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">Proof other than the UI anomoly exists.<br />
<br />
ShowEq: 4164 maximum mana<br />
<br />
Manaburn: results seem to support the conjectured approximate 4250 number, factoring in the theoretical cap (using seq numbers) to be 4664 (base mana + plus mana items + KEI + familiar + shm potion). <br />
<br />
All three point to the same thing in the same range, around 4200.<br />
<br />
Too many people who are too knowledgable about game mechanics see the exact same thing for this to be just a UI bug. Something is definitely up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Tain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Everything has had a cap from day one, except for HP.  People are unhappy because they didn't know about it?  Eh... VI has never been one for full disclosure, I don't know why this is coming as a surprise.  It's not like ordering a ham sandwich with mayo and not getting your mayo.  It's like ordering a ham sandwich and getting 6 ounces of ham instead of the 8 you'd like.  <br />
I do find it funny that VI is accused of bad programming when it looks more like a design decision to me.  Bad desinging, sure you can go with that.  But I don't really see how these numbers point to programming flaws.  127 point limitation on items is obvious.  32k HP limits on the old MOBs was obvious.  ~4200 mana?   No mathematical reason I can see.  So it was a decision made by someone.  It might have been a bad decision, but at least put the blame in the right place, not in shoddy programming.<br />
<br />
Now I can't wait to see the other side of it.  If they remove the mana cap you're going to have many of the same people complaining that Manaburn is even more overpowered because wizards don't have any cap.<br />
<br />
I'd like no mana cap, really.  Of course I'm not anywhere close to it now, but it'd still be nice for the classes who need large mana pools because they can't generate their own mana infinitely.  I simply don't take it as a personal affront that there's a mana cap in place.  There's a cap for everything else in the game, why this is such a crippling blow to people who aren't anywhere close to the cap anyway is mind boggling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Tain, you're right on all counts except for one thing, so I'll repost my question:<br />
<br />
Lewick: &quot;This leads me to believe that item mana can't be more than 50% of your base mana.&quot;<br />
<br />
Me: &quot;So, he seems to say that the 1388 cap on plus raw mana from items exists as a subordinate of his base mana, around 50 percent. Does that mean that it's scalable?

<br />
This affects everyone, if true. And I'd personally like to know if the 10 wis 25 mana band of the arisen cultist I often wear actually has more value than a 100 mana ring, per se, if my wisdom is too low and I'm at my &quot;mana item pool&quot; cap. If this is the case, it's not just about 4164 mana my friend.</div></div><hr />
