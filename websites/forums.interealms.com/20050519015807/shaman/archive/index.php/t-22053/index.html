<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all.  I find it odd that so many posts on the crucible deal with issues that are really overall content balancing.  Now, I am one of the first to agree that Everquest could really be a lot better, especially with the advent of the instanced zone and the huge potential that opens up.<br />
<br />
But, be that as if may I still thinking we (shaman) are barking up the wrong tree on a lot of our issues or just presenting it poorly. <br />
<br />
It seems to me that, although I don't always agree with the somewhat negative and attacking posts on this board, the developers have a pretty good idea of Shaman dissatisfaction.  I suppose even the ranting and raving has served its purpose.  Brenlo is (finally) doing a fairly good job of posting comments on the various class boards and has promised to bring some of the points to the attention of people who have the power to affect changes.  Let's hope that is the case.<br />
<br />
I do though, have a feeling based on my 5 years playing this game and watching Verant/Sony tune the game, that they will not re-tool any one class nor will they make radical changes.  Their methodology so far is to make tweeking changes here and there when one class was unable to get an experience group because of the dual reasons of not having the tools to contribute in a meaningful way and player perception of the value of the class in an experience group.<br />
<br />
Content balancing is not easy nor is class balancing.  Someone on these boards mentioned the monocromatic vision of many posters and I agree 100%.  Shaman balancing is not as easy as saying that because our slows are mitigated 40% that our healing should be increased 40%.  That ignores Sony's issue of content balancing.<br />
<br />
Healing: It is my strong opinion that Sony does not want to provide shaman with the healing tools to be a primary healer in newer more difficult content.  Shaman healing spells speak for themselves on this point.  But instead of just throwing out random #'s (like in the polls), what we really are asking for is to be able to have a cleric or DRUID be a main healer and for us to be able to spot heal to a degree that the content is still balanced and we are able to provide enough utility and damage outside of that healing to be balanced as a class.  There is no magic number until Sony decides what to do with Druids, IMHO.<br />
<br />
Damage:  I think that it is easier to balance healing from a overall content standpoint prior to balancing shaman direct damage (if appropriate) - and I guess I need to expand on that. If shaman healing is pumped up significantly then we may be class balanced without any changes to DPS.  My only comment here is that the casting duration of our direct damage spells is too long for a utility class who is casting malos and slow on every mob and doing all the other shaman things as well.<br />
<br />
I respectfully submit that our wish list should start with items that are not related very much to content balance nor class balance to a large degree.  These items which unless I am sadly mistaken would be simple to fix, not overpowering and are the right thing to do.  We need to totally separate the below items from content and class balance to get a possible quick fix, then push Sony to re-tune healing (which it appears they are doing) and lastly to take a last look at shaman class balance which includes utility and direct and indirect DPS.<br />
<br />
1) Make ancient canny non-ancient since it is a class defining spell unlike the simple upgrades of other classes.  It's like wizard's having a very low level harvest and then making the next upgrade ancient.  It just makes very little sense.  A far more reasonable ancient spell for Shaman would be a better slow - maybe 5% better than the non-ancient GoD slow or with a long duration or both.<br />
<br />
2) Increase the duration of FA (and champion) and provide a wear's off message.<br />
<br />
3) Make puppy able to duel wield without weapons or give us a spell to summon the weapons.<br />
<br />
4) Figure out how to provide out of group shrink with confirmation.<br />
<br />
5) Adjust Rabid bear (and upgrades) to be worth purchasing by tuning it against the damage output that we can put out via spells.  That's all most of us Shaman want.<br />
<br />
Please feel free to comment and if I left out stuff I apologize.<br />
<br />
Respectfully yours,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">So in other words, we should throw in the towel, and accept the fact that we are now a thoroughly gimped class and go for the minor items that qualify as more of an annoyance factor because you think we have a better chance of getting them?  <br />
<br />
How about no.  <br />
<br />
They screwed us, they can darn well UNscrew us or they can pretty much count on massive defections from the game.  I think it's that simple.  Not to mention your interpretations of balance seem substantially different from the rest of the shaman.  Literally, not one item from your list would be a drop in the bucket for achieving any kind of parity with the rest of the classes.<br />

<br />
yea it would be nice, but it would change too much of the game, as the developers have said before.  That won't happen...<br />
<br />
And /agree Chutoi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">75% Slow is one of the main contributors to the Shaman class being broken at present.<br />
<br />
Anyone who wants to add to it certainly won't win any brownie points here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Change it to an ancient Velium Strike, that's pretty much what clerics got with their Ancient. =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Bullseye Raccoo - ancient dots and nukes are perfect.  Stuff you might use, but not your class-defining ability.<br />
<br />
Would they have the balls to put in Ancient Complete Heal?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I was working Tactics with a cleric, warrior, ranger, shadowknight, enchanter. We were taking down Diakus and Gindans who range up to level 68 red con mobs. Tnargs at 1300 hits was absolutely useless for keeping someone up for a round as secondary healer. Even with IH IV and healing aa's Tnargs is pretty useless.  Tnargs should base heal for 2000. <br />
<br />
With respect to DPS, with spell casting haste Bane really is not terrible. If they just fixed the poison dot aggro, we would be set. Stacking Bane and Blood of Saryrn after malo/turgurs = dead shaman. <br />
<br />
In addition, cut cast time on Velium Strike to 5 secs. <br />
<br />
These three changes would solve class issues without taking anything away from druids and clerics. <br />
<br />
I totally disagree with the first post -- something needs to be done to fix the broken quick heal of shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you look around everything that's being said Shaman are really not asking for much.<br />
<br />
Up Tnargs to 1800. Dauluda's to 2000 or so. Not even a cleric or druid would think that's too much.<br />
<br />
Drop cast time on our cold based nukes to something reasonable. 5 secs would work. Even keep Velium Strike at it's low 925 dmg. But make our new 1200 dmg nuke from OoW 5 seconds too. This won't turn us into DPS kings but it will let us contribute a bit more at the very least.<br />
<br />
Do something about slow mitigation. An AA that can bypass mitigation may be a lot to ask but at the very least we'd at least like to see a significant advantage for a Shaman slowing over other slowing classes. At the very least Re-calculate the way mobs mitigate slow we keep the same the 5% and 10% difference. I view this more as something that needs to be fixed rather than upgraded. <br />
<br />
Buffs... adding in the % modifiers is a step in the right direction. The one thing all of us really want and need is a change to FA. Preferably a group version or longer duration. It's utterly mind boggling how powerful SoE percieves this spell to be. they don't want to give us a group version because it could be MGBed. I'm wondering if they know VoQ can be MGBed and how much power it adds to a raid... really! Even if we can't get a group version we ask that they at least give it a 30 min duration. FA wheels are not fun. <br />
<br />
Balance of Nihil is a nice upgrade (after much fighting to get it upgraded) but having it overwriting Turgurs which has a longer duration is a problem. A lot of people ask for Nihil to be 74.99% so it doesn't overwrite but why not just give it the same duration as Turgurs? It is supposed to be a complete upgrade after all. (One that comes 14 levels later) being an upgrade that helps us secure our position as the top slowers it should be available to all. My only hope is that GoD spells will be made droppable after OoW goes live. Sure they'll be an arm and a leg in Bazaar but at least it gives others an opportunity to get it rather than be forced to spend hours and hours in GoD zones. <br />
<br />
Most everything I said is just a recapping what has been said by many people on these boards for a while now. Look at them. If all these changes took place they'd be a significant help to all Shamans and would in no way come close to being over powering or should cause envy from other classes (with the exception of some deserved attention)<br />
<br />
That's why we're all getting so frustrated. It's because most of what we're asking are relatively small changes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">A fix to Rabid Bear?  Yeah that will solve all our balancing problems ...<br />
<br />
Purdy we are not asking for the world, we are asking for the upgrades we SHOULD have received long long ago.  Dot aggro is a bug in my opinion, we should not have to scream for it to be fixed.  We are a healing class, we shouldn't have to scream for a decent heal.  We are primary slowers,  and we shouldn't have to scream for an upgrade in that area (they finally fixed some of the issues thank you SoE).<br />
<br />
They are listening to us, Rytan is looking at our patch heals yet again from what I hear.  Now if he will only look at the rest of our problems :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Rytan has 'been looking' at our heals for a year or more.  I don't know why people think this is any different.<br />

There is a reason for Balance and Turgurs to overwrite each other.  It doesn't come up often, but it does come up!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">oooh.. good point Chutoi, didn't even think of that. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">While I see where Purdy is coming from, I have to respectfully disagree as well. There are conten problems to be sure, but I think the CORE of our problem is the 100/70/47 ratio of healing, and our complete lack of any DPS utility to make up for it in recent expansions. Heck the Cleric PET is better than ours. Thing has like a 3X proc modifier or something. <br />
<br />
I want to see a reasonable ratio on the Fast Heals of the 3 priest classes, and, if we are to remain at the bottom, I want a fast DPS upgrade to make up for it. Content adjustment can only go so far at this point. Mudflation has totally made it impossible to balance the game based on content. The discrepency between the lvl 65 with 200 AA Raider and the lvl 65 with 200 AA Non-raider is too large. I guess thats why I keep pushing for AA as a balanceing tool, its just too hard to design 2 &quot;sets&quot; of content.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ubex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Our lack of decent stackability on most raids points out the importance Sony places on our Debuff/Slow role.  Being one of 5+ shaman on raids not assigned to debuff is rather disapointing!  We need another contribution besides debuffing.

<br />
Wait just one minute there.<br />
<br />
You act like the fact that Shaman can Heal is a crime.  It's a crime for us to be able to fulfill the role of a priest?<br />
<br />
Just because we can heal should in no way invalidate a druid or cleric.  They still have just as much opportunity to get a group as we do.  They each bring different things to the table.<br />
<br />
Once again, we go back to the &quot;what if all 3 priests healed the same&quot;.<br />
<br />
Druids would still bring ports / evacs to the table.<br />
<br />
Clerics would still bring the ultimate get out of jail card . . . Rez.<br />
<br />
<br />
Even if we healed the exact same as Clerics, a Cleric would STILL have significant advantages over us.  Druids *might* have a little wiggle room to complain, but man, I dunno.  Ports + Mana regen?  Thats pretty freakin good!</div></div><hr />

<br />
And /agree Chutoi<br />
<br />
BTW, 5% of a 40% slowed mob =2% hardly content unbalancing for a ancient spell.  And the peeps who get ancients are hardly zerging normal LDON's - which are already unbalanced.  The ultimate bosses in xyz most difficult zone would be re-tuned for the 2%.<br />
<br />
And after carefully re-reading my post and knowing that I all I said about healing is that druids need to be tuned before we are - no where did I say or infer that the current ratio of cleric/druid/shaman healing is fine.  No where did I say that druids are going to be set at close to clerics, but I will bet anyone $20 bucks that druids will see better heals fairly soon.  When that happens Shaman should be balanced as I mentioned against the re-tuned Druid.  What that # is? Give me a break, all is just speculation.  Is it a 2k spot heal? is is 1800?  All speculation.  My 2c was that we should be re-tuned to be able to support a re-tuned Druid without losing all our DPS doing so.<br />
<br />
<br />
Purdy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I would like those 5 changes certainly but don't do much for shaman balance.<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
Gosh, I continue to re-read my post (as others should please) I never said Shaman healing was fine. I never said Shaman DPS was fine.  I merely mentioned that there are immediate fixes that should really be done prior to class balancing.  And when the healing balancing was done (including Shaman), then Sony should look at Shaman class balance and adjust dps/utility accordingly.<br />
<br />
The entire focus of my post is to point out the I believe that Sony over 5 years has shown a distinct pattern of doing things.  They usually adjust purely stupid things (like hybrid penalty) relatively quickly when they finally decide to listen (relatively being very subjective, lol) but take their time on class balance where they think they are the experts (like making necro's more user friendly in groups).<br />
<br />
Best to pick your fights carefully rather than throwing everything in at once which can not possibly all be implimented in a rapid manner.<br />
<br />
Purdy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Purdy -- I'd be satisfied with either implementation or a rapid manner, but expect neither.  <br />
<br />
&quot;As it stands I can already slow/heal in almost all content up to Sewer trials.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kiebler -- Ah, but not all of us are quite so uber.  I don't say that your situation isn't very real for you, but that doesn't make it very real for everyone.<br />
<br />
Further, it sidesteps a big problem -- that no matter what you CAN do or think you can do, that doesn't address the perceptions of others.  Which is very important when they are the ones doing the group invites, not you.  Regardless of whether you can squeak by or roar by content, frankly, replacing you with a chanter or a beastlord would almost always make a lot more sense.<br />
<br />
So even when you're at your best, that's fairly irrelevant unless all the chanters and beastlords have gone to bed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kiebler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I hate to say it, but you have to balance the top against the bottom,<br />
otherwise you risk trivializing the entire game besides the high end content.   <br />
<br />
If they implemented modifiers to restrict the effectiveness of our heals in lower content (Sewers on down) I could see the argument for a bump in our healing abilities.  Its when we start pushing out clerics and druids that it gets messy.  <br />
<br />
They can modify experience on a whim, not sure why they couldnt modify a spells effectiveness.</div></div><hr />
