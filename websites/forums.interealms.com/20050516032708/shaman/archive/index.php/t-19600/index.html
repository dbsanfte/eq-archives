<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>LostSK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I did a search and read some info about doing a KVM setup.  I thought this might be an ideal setup. A question though, could I setup some macros for say my shaman that heal my main and I can call those macros from the other character?  So I am on the computer with the tank, and I want my shaman to heal the tank, is there a way to pass a keystroke to the other computer through the KVM or somthing? Or do I have to switch between the 2 computers quickly using the kvm?<br />
<br />
Thanks guys<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Makelike</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Regarding the hardware aspect of this setup, macros would do no good as the KVM switch will only send keystrokes/video to and from one system at a time. Now your issue sounds more like something one of the external macro programs would cover. You would run the program to catch keyphrases or certain criteria regarding the tank that would set off a specific macro on the shaman. I dont know the &quot;legal&quot; implications of using say EQMacro in the game. Although using a macro program to catch say keyphrases or criteria to initiate a macro might be a warning or bannable offence. This assumption might be way off base as I havent dealt with macro programs in game and how GM's deal with their use.</div></div><hr />
