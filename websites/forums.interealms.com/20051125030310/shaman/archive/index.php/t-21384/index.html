<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was thinking:<br />
<br />
HOW can that city be SO pristine and well maintained with literally thousands of super-powered heroes and thugs duking it out constantly with everything from siesmic powers, gravity control, earthquakes, telekinesis hurtling around cars, trucks, and forklifts - fire control, invulnerable stone goliaths being thrown into the sides of buildings, dudes with super-strength tearing steel i-beams out of warehouses and using 'em as baseball bats, etc. <br />
<br />
HOW can that city still LOOK so good ??? What sort of repair crew and staff does Paragon city employ, and who sees the repair-bills for the contractors? What are the property taxes and insurance rates for Paragon City offices and homes? How about maintenance taxes for citizens? <br />
<br />
No wonder there's so much crime. Folks are unemployed from upkeep of taxes and are forced into a life of crime with gangs/criminals that in turn swell the ranks of the superheroes trying to fight them, that in turn hikes up property taxes for repair bills ... <br />
<br />
EGADS!</div></div><hr />
