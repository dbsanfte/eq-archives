<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tiran Icemaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Wow, lol been a while.  I quit eq for a bit and deleted all my chars =/ I have been back for a while and have a 42 monk, im wanting to spend no more than 2k per item  i will list the items i have  already, tell me if you have any suggestions or upgrades:<br />
<br />
Spine Chill Spear<br />
Charred Guardian Shield<br />
And that one spear that can go in your range slot(+5 wis)?<br />
Totemic Helm<br />
Kunzar Cloak</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ditch the Charred Shield for a CLAY Guardian Shield. Use Charred Shield when grouping.<br />
Arctic Wyvern Mask<br />
(2) 6AC/65HP rings....Velium Fire Wedding Rings <br />
<br />
Rygorr is good twink armor (any pieces, pretty cheap)<br />
You might want to invest in a big pummeling stick (2 hander)<br />
Drakkel Ice Grinder, Staff of Living Sands, something like that<br />
<br />
Tattered Mantle (shoulder)<br />
Ivory Collar from Chardok (neck)<br />
Forest Loops are pretty cheap, if you're a Barb then go for Ivory imbued earrings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Velarius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I disagree...<br />
<br />
Shield Sarnak Battleshield over Clay ANY TIME !!!<br />
<br />
Mask, go for Crystal Spider Eyes ac 8 wis 3 int 3 mana 35 hp 35<br />
<br />
Rings Shadel Bandit Ring and or Velium Fire Wedding rings<br />
<br />
Earrings.... DITCH the imbued crap and Forest loops... get Black Sapphire Electrum Earrings... will serve you much more than the imbued<br />
<br />
Get a Howling Harpoon and a Beetle Stinger for ranged, maybe switch to Goranga when solo tanking... hehe<br />
<br />
Don't waste pp on the twohanders... almost all shamans I know don't use two handers, unless its the REALLY Ubah ones... hehe<br />
<br />
Yes Rygorr is good twink armor, but so is Jarsath Scale from KC, I helped a level 17 friend Shaman of mine to get a full suit in KC, its rather easy, cause It almost always get to rot...<br />
<br />
Just my 2 BD's :)<br />
<br />
Regards and best wishes,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">How much are SBS running these days ?  They are more than 2K on my server. He stated that he didn't want to spend more than 2K on any item. <br />
Prices will vary server to server...I gave some examples of low end inexpensive twink items. There are better items but, the one I listed are fairly cheap and easy to obtain. <br />
<br />
And I use a 2 hander all the time when I solo. Since I don't have the epic or a REIF, two hander is gonna give me the best damage output. I lay the serious smackdown on mobs with Togor's, Haste, my pet, and my Ice Grinder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Velarius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I am very well aware of the price range he was given... :)<br />
<br />
Sarnak Battle Shield should hardly be more than 2k tops on any server now, besides the REALLY new ones... (servers that is)<br />
<br />
All this considered Sarnak Battle Shield will prolly be the most expensive... and if can manage to get his hands on the Jarsath he'll have eccess pp to spend anyway :)<br />
<br />
Regards,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">This the same Tiran Icemaw who used to make those freaky spaz posts about uber trades he made?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thalarctos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Save soem pp and get a rune etched icewurm fang (4k mb?) and a haste item if you can.  I loved that thing when I was doing 1-45.  For a shield, how about a bladestopper?  I've never heard anyone suggest this, but I like mine.  Got it for 1k, 25ac 50hps 15sta.  I use my SBS for resists, but that's my day to day shield.<br />
<br />
I'd really suggest getting some form of mana preservation item.  You only need 1-2 to start.  Some affliction focus effects would be nice too probably, but I wouldn't give up too much for them considering the pre-49 DoT's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ok ok , Didn't come here to start an argument, I just gave my opinion and you are free to disagree with it if you choose. No harm no foul, after all we are ALL Shaman here, right ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
IM FAMOUS!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gothmog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">What level II focus items are out there that are relatively easy/cheap to acquire, and useful for a new shaman?  If you're going to start a new shaman, I'd think that focus items would be one of the best purchases you could make.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Might want to state here how much you plan to solo/tank and how much you think you'll group.  I'm a sit-on-my-ass shaman (have a full time warr partner, so not a surprise) so getting a haste item seems pretty silly.<br />
<br />
I agree, nab up a SBS - starting to see em for 1.5k on zev.  Still wearing jbone arms, the 18 ac made my warrior bud drool for a while...  Oh, and arctic wyvern armor has been CHEAP lately, lots of folks taking up tailoring?  Anyway, you can probably fill out some slots with that for under 2 g's a pop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>eepjr24</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Gothmog,<br />
<br />
BA Medallion is the one I use. Not the greatest stats, but saves 10 percent maan on almost everything I cast until I hit 44. YMMV, me being a lowly 37 shammy now, but I likes it.<br />
<br />
Amberfox, 37 Shammy<br />
Oblivions Door</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">if you're on a tight budget, get clay shield. the resists of SBS are way way overrated, and it's only at like lvl 55+ that the 5 stamina will start giving more hp than the 50 of the clay shield. only reason i got one was because someone was selling it dirt cheap and it looks a bit cooler than clay shield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tiran Icemaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Umm i will prolly solo a LOT past 45, because grouping gets kindof boring, but earlier than that i wont. but 1-18 will go by fast i wont use spells much just kindof beat it down ith my spear.<br />
<br />
Right now im kindof in a situation, i dont know what i should get for legs... JB is too costly for a twinky(for me) and Gatorscale leggins... bleh mez no like leather!</div></div><hr />
