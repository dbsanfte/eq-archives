<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Badz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am a 52 shaman and hunted a little in pick up groups at the PoJ exit.  I now have a regular trio of 52 shaman, 52 warrior and 53 ranger.  Neither the warrior nor the ranger have been to the Planes.  Is the PoJ exit still the best place to go?  I remember getting wiped several times becuase of adds and was wondering if there was another place better suited in the Planes for this trio.<br />
<br />
We have been hunting in Dulak and really like it but wanted to try a Planes area.  Is this trio too low for a Planes area?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's possible but only in PoJ and exp would be a little slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cosik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Most of the tier 1 planes ya would need to flesh out that group to get a good camp going with good exp.  From what I have seen a group like that would do really well for exp and loot in Dulak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sancha Delnocha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Get a cleric and you can EASILY do PoI, PoD and PoN, don't listen to these guys they are too old.  My shaman is 51 and she can do all those zones with no problems.<br />
  BUT your warrior will need some HP!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cosik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">By flesh out the group I did mean for them to get a cleric.  But with just what they have they could do the tougher boats in dulak because they don't have to deal with the big damage output of the tier 1 mobs.  :p</div></div><hr />
