<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You did? Why would your starting faction be different than all other Barbarians?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm sure of my apprehensive/KOS/KOS beginnings.  Perhaps you killed a few giants, FJ?<br />
<br />
Just about everybody has this same faction to begin with.  The only difference I know is that some Rallos Zek worshippers are not KOS to the giants in the beginning.  I know Troll Zek warriors are almost accepted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">dwarves hate giants and dragons hate giants.<br />
Now if u think about it shouldn't dwarves and dragons be allied?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">No idea how it happened, but I distinctly remember walking through Kael the first time, with the giants just apprehensive.  I had been hunting before I went to Kael, but not dorfs or dragons.  And now that I think about it, I had good dorf faction because of killing orcs before I went to Thurdigan</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Chaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">FinalJustice: Killing orcs only raises your faction with Frostone Dwarfs.  That faction is only in Crystal Caverns.  Before the patch if you bearformed as a froglok shaman your factions would match the ones you're describing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">As A Cazic-Thule worshipping leezard, I started off apprehensive to the dwarfs and dubious to Giants. As wehn I first arrived in Velious at 35, I was able to walk right up to the Giant Scouts and hail them. They would tell me to &quot;keep moving little one, this place is not safe&quot; or something like that. At that point I hadn't killed a single Giant or Wolf.</div></div><hr />
