<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Banana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone play a cleric alt before? im thinking of starting one but am wondering if they are going to be a fun / nice class to play. I have a 65 shaman and would be totally stopping the shaman to play the cleric. I am looking to get the cleric to 65. Currently I have full donals, a dawnfire morningstar and a OOIV</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">How much fun do you think stopping the baseball game where you play first base and hitting yourself constantly on the foot with a hammer?  Cleric raiding consists of knowing where in the CH mix they are, counting to X and hitting the button with the /gu and CH in it.  As far as boring raid jobs go, clerics have one of the worst in the bunch.  They're still about the only class that has a real problem soloing and once they get up in the levels, spend the rest of their careers getting rezz tells and collecting money for peridots.<br />
<br />
Many classes two-box a cleric, but you won't find very many people who dropped their main to level a cleric up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have a cleric alt from neccessity and two boxing. But fun? God know. Cleric has got to be the most boring class to play excluding melee classes ( I can't stand to play melees ). They are very useful to have around and nice to have if your two boxing but I can't ever imagine playing one as a main character.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>greyfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have a 60 cleric on another account that was my main.  I started a 2nd account and played around with a druid and ranger before settling in on my shaman.  He's 43 now and I used the cleric to PL him with buffs and rezzes.  Unless you have a steady group that you play with, it's a pretty mindless role to play.  There solo abilities are awful, even with my shaman buffing him (quickness, nimble, deftness)  cleric with hammer of divinity, yaulpV (maxed offense/defense).  I'm currently 2 boxing drunken pirates in Dulak and it's faster to just cast 2 Judgements than to bother with melee.<br />
<br />
That said, from your post it appears you won't be 2 boxing.  If your starting a new toon and are interested in the fun factor of the character, let me say this about the cleric:<br />
<br />
For the most part,<br />
You'll never be the puller<br />
You'll never be the tank<br />
You'll cast HP/AC buffs and heal<br />
You'll never effectively solo anything<br />
<br />
It is fun to land a heal and save the group from a wipe, and that will happen.  <br />
Rezzes offer a 'good feeling' when your able to help someone out of a bad jam.<br />
Tossing random heals on people will make you a lot of friends<br />
<br />
Allows you to watch a good movie while you play EQ<br />
You can fold laundry while playing EQ<br />
You can let the dog out while playing EQ<br />
Bio breaks don't usually require telling the group :)<br />
I'm just kidding, but you definitely can find yourself playing 'backseat' in a group.<br />
<br />
It all depends on what your looking to do.  If you want to melee, play a war/mnk/rog/rng/sk<br />
<br />
If you wanna cast, play a wiz/mag<br />
<br />
Not sure if plat is a factor, but if you don't want to spend a ton of money on spells, play a monk.<br />
<br />
I love the solo ability of the shaman.  It's something I can never do (atm) as a cleric.  I enjoy having a pet that doesn't depop after the mob is dead.  <br />
<br />
I hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fethanin_ECI</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">a cleric playing &quot;backseat&quot; in a group, I'd be worried :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>greyfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">'Backseat' - Meaning your not up in melee range of the mob.  You sit back and wait for someone to pull something and you heal as needed.  <br />
<br />
Was it that hard to understand what I was saying?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kyntanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I had a druid main when my guild asked me to make a cleric, I got her to 61 geared her up and bring her to raids.  I play my shaman to have fun.<br />
<br />
Clerics can be fun, I think it is all in what you want to do.  Being a main cleric is more entertaining than being the back up cleric for sure. But like I said, I play my shaman to have fun, I currently got her to 60 and am looking forward to some AA's flagging and 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shubert TZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I play a monk as a main and i kinda wish my shammy was my main or even a cleric.  At least you can get an exp group... =(</div></div><hr />
