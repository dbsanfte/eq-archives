<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hiya folks.  I am a grouping shaman through and through, but lately I have been working too much and I don't have enought time to group.  I simply hate joining a group only to leave in an hour.<br />
<br />
So I decided I will try my hand at soloing for exp.  I am a troll (but follow CZ because I didn't know any better).  I am just about to ding 44 (we're talking half a blue) I am pretty damn twinked, I have canni II and Stoicism (got them both solo.  This should tell you how twinked I am  ;) ) and I have a JBB, fungi, and a horse of course (though I can't use the JBB for a bit.)<br />
<br />
I heard many good things about CoM, but I have yet to step foot in this zone, and I like to have a good amount of info before I start anything.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any tips on where in this zone I should start hunting?  <br />
How do I get to that spot safely, and what do I pull?<br />
Any dangers to look out for (i.e. mobs that are underconned, wanderers, traps, etc.)?<br />
Anything I am missing?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Deathadder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've been soloing in City of Mist since 46.  I don't really recommend it at 44.  At 46, you can handle the bridge without a problem if you can get the first 2 mobs at the entrance single pulled.<br />
<br />
I've found that if you press yourself all the way over to the far wall and keep hitting whatever spell you use to pull (I use slow), until you see it start to cast.  Up until then you get the cannot see your target message.  Most of the time I was able to get the first mob to come by himself.  Then med up and get the second one.<br />
<br />
They're on a fifteen minute re-spawn timer so after those two, you can get the other two using slow or root, sometimes you'll get both of them, just get ready to zone out at a moment's notice.  <br />
<br />
At 46, the only mobs that popped that I had real trouble with were Vapor Golems and Rambling Fanatics and sometimes Aberrants.  Not too bad if you only get one, but if you get two, it's best that you zone.  Once you get to 49, soloing becomes a snap with E-Bolt.  You also get 1-2% per kill with the modifier, it's pretty sweet.<br />
<br />
At 50, I moved into the Temple area, and found it pretty easy to keep that area clear if you time the spawns.  51 now with 2 AA's and still getting 1 to 1 1/2% AA per kill DB and a little less LB.  Hardly any danger from adds, and the zoneline is close from pretty much anywhere in CoM.  Overall, I highly recommend this zone and plan on spending alot of time here mastering the different rooms.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ermanarich</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't hunt CoM much but when we were hunting in there yesterday we tried pulling the mob that is next to Lord Rak, don't recall her name, but normally we can attack her and he won't assist. We thought it was a fluke the first time we did it but it happened on the second pull also.  When attacking her he started knocking the snot out of us.  Finally our Paladin pacified him and we were able to pull her.  Anyone else run into this or has it always been that way?  We have pulled her before when in the zone and not had him assist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Preecher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I did CoM in the 40's, but mostly in the Front CY and Stables. If you take a look at my Magelo, the neck item I have came from the Castle in CoM, and of course the Spear I use had alot to do with CoM too. And like you say you are, I am a mad twink and do stuff that I really have no buisiness trying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">After you zone in, there are two mobs located on either side before the bridge. [I was soloing here in my late 40s/early 50s]  I do not know what their resist rate is, but at the time, I had no issues with them.  Most likely you will aggro both of them, so you will need to root-park or be able to handle two mobs.<br />
<br />
Once you kill these two, there are three mobs beyond the gate.  I was able to single pull these mobs with slow.  Undead do not flee on low health, but there are &quot;living&quot; mobs now in CoM, so you might need to root them down to avoid trains.<br />
<br />
Once you clear this area, you have two choices: left or right.  To the right is the Temple, and the temple is a nice area to camp for xp. [This was the case before the revamp.]  Once you enter the temple area, you will see two strips of land separated by a waterfall.  I suggest you make camp on the left most ( one closest to you as you enter the area ).  There will be a mob at the end of it.  Just kill this mob, and this will become your pull spot [ Before the revamp, this was a safe area to camp - no mobs, no roamers - you could afk here to your heart's content. ]  For the temple itself, there are two entrances to it and stairs that climb up to two sets of mobs.  Inside the temple, you can open the door and poke your head into the hallway, and you should aggro a mob.  Pull that mob back to your camp.  Once he is dead, there are two more mobs for you to kill in that hallway.  I was able to single pull these mobs as well when I was there.  After the hallway is cleared, you will see three mobs on platforms.  Most of the time, I had adds when I pulled these.  Be ready to root-pull or whatever you are accustomed to.  Also, there are two doors - one on the left and one on the right as well as two doors off the hallway that lead to upstairs.  If you need the idol for your epic piece, the room you are looking for is down the stairs, left door.  It is a ground spawn, and there are mobs in the room.  Named mobs can spawn here as well as the Captain of the Guard.  The captain drops A Stone Key for the castle.<br />
<br />
Now, if you turned left from the gate, there are two places for you.  First is the courtyard, and second is the Stables.  I never camped the Stables.  I was lucky and got my book when someone ooc'ed they dropped.<br />
<br />
I never bothered camping the courtyard either.  I usually just invis'ed past them to get to the u-turn or gazebos.<br />
<br />
If you find that the xp is getting thin at the Temple, make your way to the U-Turn.  This is past the Goo-House.  The Goo-House has decent xp there now, and a few names can spawn there.  I recently PL'ed my rogue in CoM.  Back to the U-Turn.  There is two sets of mobs that you can pull here, and I think I was able to single pull them at 51.  I leveled to 53 at this area.  Once you hit 53, you should be able to single pull the gazebos ( just past the u-turn, at the castle ).  The gazebos are nice xp at 53, but it tends to be short lived once you make 54.<br />
<br />
Depending on gear and stuff, you should be able to gain one level an hour - at least I did when I was playing in CoM.  CoM is a great zone, and it is hardly camped.  If you enjoy peace and quiet, CoM is the place for you.  Be warned, if you die, expect for you to have a long CR - hardest part is to find a cleric.  Also, CoM is flagged as a city, so you as well as melee classes can bind there.</div></div><hr />
