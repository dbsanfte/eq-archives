<br />
Honestly, I wouldn't take it personally.  Some people can be exemplary guildmates but just not well suited for being an officer.  <br />
<br />
Take myself for example.  I've been in my guild for 3 years, I'm the shaman advocate, I have decent playtime, I'm pretty knowledgeable about mobs, classes and all things EQ.  I'm also hot tempered, sarcastic and impatient.  <br />
<br />
Officers need endless patience and people skills to be effective.  If you aren't an officer in your guild, you could still ask for additional responsibilities like raid leader or recruiting contact.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>peleg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">First off, I would ask why for more details than &quot;not good enough&quot;.  He/she should be able and willing to give you this information as constructive criticism.  If the GL is not willing to give any additional information, I personally would consider whether or not the guild was a good fit (I know it wouldn't be for me, as communication is a key factor in guild success IMO).<br />
<br />
Once they explain why you were turned down, if you're still interested, try and improve upon those areas, show em you're serious, and in six months apply again.<br />
<br />
Ultimately it comes down to what you want to do in your guild.  If you are dead set on being a Guild Officer and they're not gonna promote you, its probably time to do some thinking.<br />
<br />
Just my $.02 though...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tiorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">First off ask yourself why do I want to have the title of guild leader?<br />
<br />
You can be a guild leader without the title.<br />
<br />
Group with lower levels and help them get stuff for their epic.<br />
Organize ldon groups.<br />
When someone says in guild chat I'm lfg, invite them in.<br />
<br />
Get known as a doer in your guild, as someone who is helpful - and you will be a GUILD LEADER.<br />
<br />
<br />
No one in my guild considers me a guild leader - but I do.</div></div><hr />

What I mean is:  If they say you aren't good enough, then ask them to give you a couple of things you could improve on.  Then, ask them how THEY would improve on those things.  Everyone loves to be asked their opinion.  <br />
<br />
This approach prevents both sides from getting defensive, and shows off a whole bunch of good traits about you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The question is patince, in order to be an officer you need INFANITE patince, you have to put up with new apps who think they deserve the world, old members who think they deserve the world, you have to get bitched at and try to calm down other guilds which you beat to a spawn, ever log on and wonder &quot;Hmm I wonder what raid we have planned today&quot; WRONG, you can't get into that experince group then wait for a leader to call organize, you have to go out and check spawns, see what the other raids are killing, and again make sure you are not going to arrive to see your mob being killed. Your the one that has to make the decisions about &quot;Whether we should bend the rules to take the mob or let the other guild who has been trying for hours wipe once more&quot; (Either way you will get bitched at by your members), but worst of all is you have to listen to your fellow officers bitch at each other for hours on end, each thinking they are above the rules, because they are &quot;OFFICERS!!!&quot; when really you have the same, if not less chance at loot.<br />
<br />
You really have to ask yourself if you wan't to be an officer, do you want to get kicked in the teeth everyday by people you consider friends? <br />
<br />
If you think becoming an officer is gonna make your EQ experince more enjoyable you are most definatly WRONG.</div></div><hr />

Maybe you don't want to be a guild officer with someone who acts towards you like that anyway. I mean think about it, is this the kind of person who you think you could have a 2 way conversation with?<br />
<br />
He sounds pretty full of himself to me.<br />
<br />
If thats the way he said it.<br />
<br />
And of course what is he basing this statement on? When someone makes a general statement like that, you have a right to ask for a specific so that you can have clarity.<br />
<br />
From clarity you can make the best decesion for you.<br />
<br />
But trust me Guild Officer is no cake walk, it is a second JOB in your real LIFE. Well lets just say - be careful what you hope for, you just might get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Some people don't have, or don't show, the personality/responsibility to be an officer.<br />
<br />
I was an officer in the guild I was in before my current guild.  I didn't ask anyone to make me an officer, I was asked to be an officer.  I became one because I wanted to, because I acted responsibly and took a leadership position whenever it was possible.  I mediated instead of inflaming arguments.  Etc., etc.<br />
<br />
There were others who were officers with me who should not have been officers, they'd just been in the guild a long time.  There was one fellow in the guild who demanded that we make him an officer on a couple of occasions, even though he exhibited no leadership qualities.  When he wasn't officerized, he made an ultimatum, that he had to be officer or he'd quit.  /guildremove is what he got after a good chunk of conversation.   :p<br />
<br />
Officering blows.  You have to present a good face to the guild, talk to other guilds about interactions with your or their assinine members who've trained/KSed each other.  You have to make hard decisions on the direction of the guild, who gets what loot (or what DKP system you'll use), rein in 14 year olds who don't know any better and 35 year olds who should know better.  There's a whole bunch of other **** that's annoying about it too, but I don't feel like going into all of it.<br />
<br />
Due to my experience as an officer in my last guild, I don't think I'd ever want to become one again.  If I was asked to be one, and I had enough time, I probably would, but I purposefully do not present myself in a way that'd make other people want me to be an officer.  It's nicer (for me) to let my mouth and emotions run in whatever manner they normally would**, rather than having to deal with petty problems from stupid jerks (which I probably am myself on occasion  :D ) whenever I log onto my video game to relax and get away from the world.<br />
<br />
Read this paragraph if you skimmed the rest  ;) <br />
What's my point?  Before you do something rash like let this event get under your skin and end up leaving the guild after a big argument/tantrum, critically examine your behavior online, and compare it to that of the officers that you think are good leaders.  Then, if you think that you do deserve to the an officer and that you're being treated unfairly, do what you gotta do.  On the other hand, if you're a jackass, this'll just reinforce any decision to leave the guild because you're not getting what you want.  Hehe.<br />
<br />
**note:  This could sound like I run around being a big piece of ****, but I'm really not that big of an *******</div></div><hr />

Hail,<br />
<br />
Lots of people have given you good information so far.<br />
I have been an officer in two excellent guilds, and I'm very much enjoying a brief respite right now completely untagged. <br />
<br />
There are good officers and bad officers, just like players.  Bad officers can hurt a guild in SO many ways &amp; yet the guild keeps them as such for just as many unfathomable reasons, much like many organizations IRL.<br />
<br />
To directly answer your question, I would also ask in what ways you could improve &amp; seek the advice of others who know you better than we do here.  I would also ask if your leader thought promotion would be a possibility in a few months if you did show enough improvement.  Definitely ask yourself why being an officer is important to you.  You don't need the rank to be a leader.  You can do more for your guild with your actions than any title will give you.  People ambitiously aspiring for promotion generally weren't the type I was eager to promote most of the time, though there are always exceptions.<br />
<br />
Things I specifically looked for when considering promotion candidates.<br />
1) Seflessness.<br />
2) Dedication.<br />
3) Playtime (both total hours per week and specific to the time of day).<br />
4) Diplomacy.<br />
5) Level-headedness<br />
6) Demonstrated raid Leadership ability/knowledge.<br />
7) Player Skill/Knowledge.<br />
<br />
I've voted against officer candidates for any of the first 6 reasons on more than one occasion.  I have advocated promoting someone who did not have #6 but was obviously making strides &amp; had terrific qualities that the guild needed in other areas.  Not every officer has to be a good raid leader, but it certainly helps.  This isn't as important in a family/social guild, where traits 1 &amp; 4 may be more important.<br />
<br />
Take a good hard look at yourself.  Are you looking for an officer position to allow you to do more to help the guild, to become part of the 'inner circle' (which can sometimes just be a smaller bitchfest circle :p ), to make loot decisions, influence policy, or something else entirely?  Why was it important enough to you to directly ask your leader (which sort of put him on the spot).  I didn't care for the answer he gave as you have relayed it btw.<br />
<br />
I would also echo that not every skilled player needs to be an officer.  Otherwise you would have too many Chiefs and not enough Indians, and raids can be stalled while 40 members wait for 20 officers to make some basic decisions.<br />
<br />
Being a guild officer is ALOT of extra work, usually involves a HUGE amount of your time (preventing you from getting exp or pursuing personal goals whatsoever most of the time) both in and out of game, and oftentimes isn't very rewarding by any usual measurable standard.  If the intrinsic enjoyment value of leading a group of people is something you are after though, a guild officer position can fulfill that when other opportunities IRL may not be available to you.  Most of the time though, being an officer can just be an exercise in herding cats.  :D <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">From the perspective of a guildleader, I will tell you I do not promote officers lightly. The main reason for this being, I do not want people having the ability to invite people into my guild unless I know I can trust them to use their best judgement and follow our recruitment rules.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I have been an officer and a guild leader. Promoting officers isn't just down to how long you've been in the guild, though, Frekkels had a good list.<br />
<br />
In my old guild, we only really considered officers when we needed to, when there was an obvious lack in coverage.<br />
<br />
Play time, availability and people skills are a strong factor of what I'd look for in an officer. Keeping your cool in any situation.<br />
<br />
It may be that you're a fine guild member, but not what the leader wants in an officer right now. It may be he's happy with the number of officers he already has.<br />
<br />
Being an officer or a guild leader is a thankless task. I worked hard for the guild, tried my hardest. I wasn't a great leader, but I did my best, but it's very stressful, and in the end it was making my EQ playing less fun.<br />
<br />
But, if you really want to help, are willing to spend a lot of time doing officer things, and think you have the right skills, chat to the guild leader about it again, and try to work out what the problem is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Kidding aside, as it's been stated here you probably don't really want to be an officer. You'll get whined at, you'll get bitched at, and it will happen on and off the whole time you're on.<br />
<br />
What I want to know is, did they really say &quot;you aren't good enough&quot; or are you paraphrasing? It looks like you paraphrased, I can't imagine a gl could be bad enough to state it like that and keep a guild beneath them for any length of time.</div></div><hr />

/agree with that statement!<br />
<br />
So over the officer thing.  3/4 of the role is dealing with he said/she said crap.  The only thing worse would be the role of GL... never been in that role, but its gotta be the mother of all nightmares!  Although on the other hand, you do get to penetrate the inner sanctum of the officer boards on your message board and read all the juicy gossip.  :p <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Valdak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Firist, I commend you for your desire to help your guild.  I would also say that the fact that you are not an officer is does not stop you from being a guiding force in your guild.  I have been a officer in a previous guild and found it to be more trouble than it was worth.  In my current guild I am not an officer and enjoy the roll I play.  I am respected for my accommplishments, and for the help I provide my guildmates and others and that is all I could wish for.  I do not need to be running all over the map inviting new members and attending additional officers meetings, I help because I want to, not because it is expected as an officer.  While being an officer is a worthwhile desire, it is not for everyone, and by the same token not every guild is worthy of the people that desire to be officers.  As other posters have said, see if you can determine the reason your GL said what he did and if the answer is not satisfactory maybe you should examine your guild and decide if you and they are actually a good match.</div></div><hr />

That's me too!  Back in my Magestorm days, I put together when of the most effective and unbeatable guilds there was.

Hail,<br />
As a follow-up, trust as Steelbear mentioned is also very important, which I would definitely include in my list.  As an officer I generally had full access to guild vaults and numerous player accounts (so many I had to have a special notebook for them).  <br />
<br />
You CAN influence the guild.  Your ideas CAN get implemented.  Use private messages (out of game) or e-mails to existing officers.  Find out IG who would really be receptive to such stuff, because not everyone is.  The leader's inbox is probably overflowing w/ all sorts of stuff so he might not be your best 'suggestion sounding board'. There are plenty of people who are ready to complain when things go wrong.  Be one of the few who instead of whining makes good suggestions.  Be part of the solution!  Saving your suggestions for e-mail or Private messages prevents it from being lost in /raid spam or from getting ignored by officers who are busy w/ IG stuff.<br />
<br />
I had a few regular members in my last guild that I actively sought out their counsel, and I was their conduit to the Officer forums.  They'd give me a suggestion via Private Message, I'd examine it and if I thought it wasn't worth pursuing I'd thank them for their input and tell them why I didn't think it would work.  Sometimes that would lead to a back-and-forth PM discussion that ended up with a more workable idea.  Either way, GOOD ideas would make it to the officer forum for discussion.  On several occasions this ended up changing guild policy on certain matters - and it would have never happened w/o that member's PM'd suggestion.  In a few other cases it saved a potentially huge fiasco from getting out of control &amp; prevented drama (drama=bad).  By the way, a few of them ended up becoming officers eventually - it was just a matter of spots opening up &amp; their inputs over time almost automatically put them on short-list.<br />
<br />
Raid Leadership ability is important, as is the ability to take criticism w/o getting hostile about it.  But you can still make a huge difference in your guild even without leading raids.  I can sympathize with your wanting to be &quot;in the loop&quot; for how decisions are made.  Your raid leader is obviously sensitive to how busy a shaman can be, which isn't always the case.  When I am leading raids, I can be an awesome shaman or a decent raidleader, but rarely can I ever manage to do both at the same time.  Usually I will put myself in a backup slowing position &amp; just do MGB Fot7 when I'm leading more than 5 groups.  If I try to do everything as the lead shaman while also leading the raid, the raid progress generally slows WAY down.  <br />
<br />
If it makes you feel any better, I purposely steered several excellent players AWAY from being officers when they showed interest.  Mainly because the inner circle politics itself can be very exhausting in addition to all the other work involved.  I didn't want these people who I depended on during raids to get wrapped up in officer things and eventually leave the guild over a matter non-officers had no clue about.  Kind of a &quot;what you don't know can't hurt you&quot; thing... The irony here is that's exactly what happened to me recently.  I left over a dispute over moral issues in leadership that had nothing to do with (or was visible to) any of the regular members.  Integrity&gt;guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>jhaelx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Sorry to hear about your dispute. Regarding what you said, this guy also gave the same reason of steering me from officership because he said it would burn me out, and I was a valued player. But at the time when this was said, I felt like this was an insult. 'Hey we don't want you to be on officership but keep on doing your job'. Well your post confirms that his intentions weren't sinister. But I think i reacted badly at the time. <br />
<br />
These posts has given me a little insight in terms of that being in a raiding guild, most likely for the position of an officership you are needing leadership qualities. However I am still interested in being an officer and therefore may follow some of the ideas some of you have given me which I appreciate your input.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Hey Frekk, come join RoD, we only have half the shaman of Emarr and seem to continue trying to corner the market :P  lol  (good thing shammies can do DPS now with Bane in addition to Spiritcall... you should see the insane push of dozens of puppy power :D)<br />
<br />
<br />
   As for the officer thing... I was an officer and nearly the guild leader in my last guild (leader by title wasn't on that much, and pretty much anything I ever said happened without contradiction).   That guild fell apart as people left for the top end game, and now I just got done with probie in a new guild.<br />
<br />
<br />
   I must say that finally being a non-officer again is quite relaxing.  I have a LOT less stress in RL and am having to remind myself that there is no need to check the boards every moment that I have free time.   The lack of dozens of tells while online is also an IMMENSE relief, my AA's nearly doubled in the last month from what they were at PoP's release.<br />
<br />
<br />
  Being an officer does push you in MANY ways and can be very rewarding in the fact you get to know people far better.   But do NOT rush into it if you have any goals in RL or exp/quest areas :P</div></div><hr />

As buffing classes actually have WORK to do between the fights, I noticed the overwhelming Majority of Guild Officers were non-buffing Melees back in the day.    <br />

Dont miss it myself.  Will prob never be one again.<br />

Being part of the &quot;little people&quot; is very liberating.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>howjan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">These posts has given me a little insight in terms of that being in a raiding guild, most likely for the position of an officership you are needing leadership qualities. However I am still interested in being an officer and therefore may follow some of the ideas some of you have given me which I appreciate your input.<br />
<br />
Being a leader has very little to do with your /guildstatus.  If you want the title for the sake of having the title, good luck.  Your actions gain you respect, when you have that...officer status doesn't matter.<br />
<br />
Now the qualities of leadership, that's an entirly different discussion altogether.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Glimugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I'll add something here. I've been an officer in the two guilds I've been in and was co-guildleader in my current guild until I got deployed for this crap. <br />
<br />
Being an officer in a guild doesn't get you any perks. It DOES make you very unpopular with everyone at different times, (if your being an active officer.) Log in to /tell hell and do that for an hour, then maybe you can go xp or something. Yeah, you hear all the he said, she said, I saw soandso do this and I'll tell you, What a damn pita it is. You hear all the whining about I want help with this, we should do that, waaaaaah.<br />
<br />
If you DO want to be an officer, consider this: Officers are promoted, leaders just are. Do you want to be a leader or an officer? If you want to be a leader, start helping people, organize some raids, demonstrate that you know the game, your class, their class (not to the point of being obnoxious), and just generally start exhibiting leadership traits. People will naturally start gravitating towards you and looking to you when leadership is needed. Too many people in this game WANT people to get things ready for them to do instead of finding something to do. I found that most of the sheep expect officers to be their activity coordinator as a primary function. Oh yeah, thats sooo much fun.<br />
<br />
Someone likened being an officer to herding a bunch of cats, that is so close to being correct its almost not funny. It has decreased my enjoyment of the game monumentally because it adds so many things you are expected to do, be, handle and then factor in that you MIGHT want to kill something sometime, yeah right. <br />
<br />
Be a leader, decline officership and continue to enjoy the game. There is the happy medium. Its too easy to gather a following if you always have something to do. If you are an officer, they just expect stuff from you and you hardly get to have any fun.<br />
<br />
Ok, longwinded and way more than 2cp worth, but there ya go.</div></div><hr />
