<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nolani Silvermoonbow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was just curious, how many of you will be switching to the new Lucin character model?  I kind of like the new batch of screen shots.  The Female Wood Elf looks decent, not as cute as the current one, but then wearing the helm I wear, what difference does it make *bleah*  Only 3 weeks till decision time...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Meiamour</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I will probably move Kirena to that. <br />
<br />
Question if you move one character do you have to move all?<br />
<br />
I haven't seen the High Elf female yet nor have I seen the Erudin female so I cna not make the choices for them as of yet.<br />
<br />
But yes Kirena will be moved to the new model. I like the look of the armor.....does this mean no more leather look for the druids? :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Helek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">*I think*   You can upgrade account, but i think you will choose the way to play when you start the game.<br />
<br />
btw.. hi elf females  *gag* not impressive in the last screen shots.<br />
<br />
but i heard they are planning to do some changes.. it was an early on screen shot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Meiamour</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well I can't have that now can I.<br />
<br />
Gag indeed ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Abash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">In all liklihood I will be going to the new model..<br />
<br />
What I am still unsure of, is if your current face is updated to a particular new face, or if you choose any of the new faces when you switch?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Helek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Does this mean i get to upgrade too?<br />
<br />
purty please?<br />
<br />
Ill buy dinner tonite...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Meiamour</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">hehe begging Helek? It is so you ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I haven't seen any Erudite faces so I dont know yet. And if I dont what will those people see as my face? Something they don't even recognize and I did not choose probably. A default conversion face. Will have to see how the new Erudian models go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Aseid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I believe I'll be switching over to the new models. I like the way the new woodelves look.  Also, unless anything has changed, If someone chooses to have the new models displayed, they will see your character with the new model characteristics, even if you don't choose to upgrade to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Fallanthas Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I will be going with the new models.  Just time for a change.<br />
<br />
<br />
The last I heard, you would have the opportunity to choose a new face for your character (i.e. not a default conversion).<br />
<br />
Also, remember that the new models are designed to use expressions all the time.  Almost all the screenshots we see are faces in a static mode, which doesn't make em all that attractive.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think they did a pretty decent rework of the barb female in the last round, though.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT:  I also seem to recall that your choice was how you viewed other characters, not how they viewed you.  An on/off switch.  If that is still true, you won't be affecting what other characters see by choosing the new models or old models, and it will be a global choice, much like whether you now choose to see velious textures or not.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Drolgin Steingrinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Unless they really screw up with the dwarf models, I'll be going with the new.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Moebeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Absolutely.<br />
<br />
And it is a graphic setting just like any other that can be turned on and off from what I understand.   It will probably require a zone or re-log to take effect though.</div></div><hr />
