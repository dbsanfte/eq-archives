Yep - I read the rules.</div></div><hr />

Looking forward to the merge actually.  Will be odd not being on MT anymore though.  From what I've read so far, our servers seem to be a pretty good match.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rekcim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Emarr is a great server.  I have been on it since june '99.  I have a 65 shaman, but my mains are a paladin/chanter/necro.  There isn't much tension on the server at this time and everyone is pretty friendly.  The uber guilds are pretty much invisible, raiding the high end 24/7.  <br />
<br />
It is getting tougher to find pickup groups since wow/eq2 hit. It will be nice to bump the population up a bit and get some people /lfg.  Our guild is doing time now(just started), so I wonder how the rotations will work out.  Having low populations can be nice, but its not good in the long run or for classes that can't solo well.<br />
<br />
  Its not like E-marr has different zones etc..  Its just the name you click on to log in.  Like Bon Jovi said, Its all the same, only the names have changed.  It will however be cool to see new people, hear new ideas and follow new guilds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>FafnerMorell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Wow - I'll be on a server with a shaman celeberity - wooot!<br />
The server merger will be a huge change for all to adjust to, but I'm sure after awhile, it will seem like home again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>FafnerMorell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Also, I don't recall coming across any Gloriana's on MT (I'm sure someone has that name, but most likely not with very much time played) - so your name is probably safe.<br />
<br />
MT's msg forums are, for better or worse, generally pretty active (although a change in boards during the WoW/EQ2 exodus has left them a shell of their former-selves).<br />
<br />
http://host1.userunfriendly.com/~morell/forums/<br />
<br />
While I don't know other servers, I'd say that MT tends to hold shaman in pretty high regard, and the shaman community tend to know each other by name &amp; rep (although a lot of folks I know more by their msg brd posting than by grouping with them - but that's probably cause my play time sucks &lt;grin&gt;).<br />
<br />
The surviving high-end guilds (Reviction, Triune, Altruistic Valorians, Primal Evolution, Discordians) have a lot of top-nock shaman (Grish - man with the too-big sig, Isazo, Astraall, Alchem, Brihanna, Bosx, Killerdog, Koz, Butosz, Naad, Tokiem Tokinbear, and a score of others who I'm neglecting to mention out of laziness).<br />
<br />
Back before WoW/EQ, Reviction would typically have 6 shaman per raid. Now we tend to average 3 (at least when I'm on - RL has been busy lately). I'd hazard a guess that other guilds have seem a similar hit. But we're getting by and having fun!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Purbs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Another Morell Shammy here (Purbok), I hope the merge goes well, should be a good time :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>The Judge, Alchem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Wow - I'll be on a server with a shaman celeberity - wooot! <br />
<br />
<br />
What, being with an infamous Ahole isn't enough for you?? :)<br />
<br />
MT Shaman here, Alchem's the name.  450 AA, Time/Qvic - 5 years played.  Not sure how I feel about the merge yet myself.  Hope to meet some other very class defining Shaman like MT has.</div></div><hr />

Geez, I was hoping to keep from airing the Qvic drama in of polite company &lt;grin&gt; - next thing you know, the Crucible's going to be filled with posts like &quot;Who runs your sewers, baby? The wolf-man, that's who!&quot; and other such nonsense &lt;double grin&gt;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The wolf man? Ha, I can't wait :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Zazra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">next thing you know, the Crucible's going to be filled with posts like &quot;Who runs your sewers, baby? The wolf-man, that's who!&quot; and other such nonsense Gawd I hope not.  I s`pose it's too much to hope that those rants will just stay on the old MT forums, huh?:( <br />
<br />
Zazra Gabor here very excited about meeting some cool new people on EM.  Always looking for other shaman to share strats and comiserate on single buffing 71 people that keep running in and out of range!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Looks like a nice spread comin over to join us on Emarr.  You can NEVER have too many shaman IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>ColtraneRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Great old friend of mine movelogged there with his guild from RZ when the pvp servers merged. Look for Shimm and Echo of Destruction. Alot of good good old days friends in there, along with Court of the Crosswinds too. I miss a great deal of those guys. You are in good hands Glori.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>FafnerMorell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Just in case folks are interested in seeing a bit about MT, I have a web site up with a Morell-Thule Tribute movie - please give it a try at:<br />
<br />
www.flyinguineapig.com/mt_trib/about.html<br />
<br />
Be sure to turn your sound on. Kind of dull without it.<br />
<br />
If you have any problems with viewing the movie, please let me know a bit about what went wrong - what browser you were using, and if you have Microsoft Windows Media Player installed. I've tried it on a few different systems, but there's always some bugs lurking.<br />
<br />
This is definitely a team effort - with a lot of different folks and guilds on MT coming together to provide the screenshots used. Of the contributors, at least 3 of the 7 or so were shaman (hey, if I'm posting this on a shaman board, I might as well tie the class into it somehow &lt;grin&gt;).<br />
<br />
Enjoy - if you like, make a posting in the Guestbook.</div></div><hr />
