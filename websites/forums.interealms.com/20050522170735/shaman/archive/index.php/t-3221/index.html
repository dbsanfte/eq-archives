<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kariina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It was Eldrig the Old in Skyfire. I actually pulled Eldrig without knowing that he summons. It was a very close fight in that my gear is not that good. Only jbb and inky bp, but the obs mana savings helped a lot. no epic.<br />
<br />
Is Eldrig the easiest 50+ summoning mob to solo? his damage output seems low, hits for about 150-160 but spends a lot of time trying to dispell me.<br />
<br />
i probably do not want to try Eldrig again until i get better gear since i think i got lucky a few times during the fight. What other mobs that summon can i do pre-torpor and pre-epic?<br />

<br />
I tried to solo level 59 iksar monk epic raptor in TT it was do ubling for 261, slowed but naturally faster attacking.. Warrior wouldn't let me ): So i had to bane of taunt (nife) it to keep aggro (:<br />
<br />
I R TANK!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Corrupted SF is weaksauce but he summons. Dunno tho, those SF nameds are pretty easy too. Really, 99 percent of shaman solo by tanking so it's never an issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Maybe 99% of shamans on here or on your servers solo by tanking...<br />
I've been TOLD by people that I'm doing it wrong by getting up in the mob's face :)<br />
Most shamans on The Rathe seem to be playing it the druid way.  I've had people gawk at how I have such a &quot;high&quot; (low by the standards here) AC and such a &quot;low&quot; (dangerously high by the standards here) wis. And then I've invited them to watch me solo.  And they go nuts because I barely lose a bubble of health during the fight.  Then they ask me why that works.  Of course, none of them had ever heard of The Crucible.  The best quote I remember was &quot;I really learned a lot watching you.  I'm off to EC to pick up some AC gear&quot;<br />
<br />
and...um... I wanna know what is everyone's favorite pre-60 mob to solo? *not trying to hijack thread*<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>humburto</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I soloed the construct of sathir in Karnor's at 54 with JBB but no epic. I thought it was easy once I got slow to land. Just let pet chew on it enough to build aggro then I used JBB and ebolt while occasional heal for pet. It was very easy to keep aggro off me since I was on a horse too. I have failed many times though and zoned when slow doesnt stick first cast :(.</div></div><hr />

There are plenty of tank shamans out there on The Rathe too.   Although my ac and hp are still not where I would like them to be, the people I group with know that I am quite capable of holding a mob when needed, and it's generally my job to play with any adds, since we usually hang out without a chanter.  <br />
<br />
On the reverse side of the coin, when playing my alt monkie girl, I have grouped with a few shamans who spent the last four-five fights sitting there meleeing, and then tell me they don't have the mana for a sow or a heal.  <br />
<br />
I love to play tank, but not ever at the expense of my primary job, which is to keep my melee folks in working order...we all know they become defective without a full set of buffs.  :)<br />
<br />
Balance is a good thing.<br />
