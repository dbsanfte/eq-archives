<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am currently holding onto 3 banked AA points and still undicided which path to take next.<br />
<br />
My guild is a tad weird in that none and I mean NONE of the shamans in the guild bother with MGB :) This includes our lead shaman who is also our GL hehe<br />
<br />
I have the following AA skills atm :<br />
<br />
Run3, Regen3, SCM3, CanniV, SCR3, SCM, RC1, SC1, VP1, QB1.<br />
<br />
Been toying with the idea of going either ND, CA/LR, or finish QB2 (I have the wicked bone atlatl)<br />
<br />
Why CA/LR cause I have been dying quite a bit lately slowing in RZ raids so those misses will come in handy and maybe worth more than the 300+ hp I will get from ND3.<br />
<br />
I dunno. Any ideas/opinions?<br />
<br />
Much thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I was working on CA and ND until the other day when my guild did a raid and we ran into the same issue.  <br />
<br />
So now I have begun to work towards MGB.  Somebody has got to do it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you raid a lot, mgb is nice.  I raid about 2% of my total playtime, and I find MGB handy.  QB2 is definitely worth getting (cuts torpor / q down to 4.5 + atlatl is around 3.3).  Those would be the first 2 I'd work on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you raid enough that your guild is on Rallos Zek, then you really should get MGB.  I couldn't live without it, but my guild also usually only has 1 or 2 shamans on a night.  I guess if your guild has like 8, you can do without.<br />
<br />
After MGB, or if you decide to skip it, I would get the following in this order:<br />
<br />
QB2<br />
ND3<br />
CA3<br />
LR5<br />
CS3<br />
ID5.<br />
<br />
I have 221 AA atm and have all of these AAs, and if I had to respend them, that is the order I'd do it in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the feedback so far.<br />
<br />
Well we have 2 official raids a week but also co-raid with a sister guild and this is mainly over the weekend.<br />
<br />
On a given co-op raid there are like 8 to 10 lvl 65 shamans with nearly all the shamans in our sister guild having MGB.<br />
<br />
On our guild raids we always have at least 4 lvl 65 shamans and none have MGB. In fact all encourage not to bother with it. I told you we are a bit weird :)<br />
<br />
Ok so still many advise getting ND before CA/LR? But do QB2 first? That's just 3 AAs away and shouldn't take me long once I get my Emp/VT key done. Haven't done much serious exping in the last 6 weeks. Probably about 6 to 7 hours total. The rest has been raiding or getting  the key pieces.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for the opinions and sharing your experience about your AA skills.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Actually, I personally would worry about how many people you tend to buff using Focus.  If you and the other shamans don't mind focusing more than a group.. then hell, don't get MGB.  i personally didn't have it a priority either..until I realized that casting boar and focus on six groups was teh suck.  I ended up getting it around my 35th AA instead of the 80th from what I had planned.  <br />
<br />
Really, the 250 total hps from ND3 was very much worth it IMO.  I would get this first.  More hps to canni from.  Then after that, i would work on your CA/LR5.  This is by far, what I consider to be the BEST AA out there... next to canni5 that is.  I can't praise LR5 enough.  In fact, I was in your same boat.  I was spending alot of time getting my ass handed to me by mobs in the elementals.  My problem wasn't that I was running out of mana.. it was that I was running out of hps.  When I got LR5, my deaths and near deaths went down by alot.  I am at 141 AAs... and still don't have QB2 yet..although I do have the Nightcrawler legs which give a 30% beneficial haste on them.  I'm not too worried about a quicker casting Q right now...soon but I'm more worried about finishing my defensive AAs and the healing ones.<br />
<br />
Right now, me and my guilds shamans are planning on running to kael and attempt to kill the Statue with 4 - 6 of us, to see how difficult it is.. and to see if that shaman was full of **** (which most of us believe anyways).  When we do this, the plan right now is for me to be the MT and the one that is applying the poison nukes.  And why did they pick me when I'm the lowest AC overall member and one of the lower hps ones... it's because I'm the only one that has trained the defensive AAs CS3 and I'm up to ID2 right now.  Ask any higher level tank if these AAs make a difference to him.  In my guild, you can tell the difference between those that have them, and those that don't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Go QB2,<br />
Then, if you raid a lot, RC2,<br />
If you don't raid that much, start on ND or CA or some healing AAs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
   I understand the benefits of MGB occasionally, but there is no added POWER from that AA, it just lets you be a bit lazy.<br />
<br />
   If you get Tnarg to regularly heal for 2 to 4K (full healing AA and ornate sleeves), Q to cast in hald the time and last longer, and can outtank most any MA for a pre-luclin guild... that is power :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't get this way of thinking.  CS lowers the damage you get meleed for right?  CS3 knocks 10 percent off what you would have gotten hit for, off of every swing.  In a way this is adding 10 percent to whatever your hitpoints are (assuming melee only).  If you are raid buffed at 5800, CS3 is adding 580 hp to your max.  Yes it is a situational 580 hp, but as much as shaman obsess over HP, I would think this is desireable.  ID5 just adds more, so I don't understand why so many people don't see the point.  If theres no point in CS and ID then, to me, theres no point in increasing your HP at all, once you get past around 3500hp.<br />

wow, you lasted pretty long, on our first pull a few days ago I was a bit too close, took the 3k AE, somehow was on the top of his rampage without even starting to cast anything, he ramapaged between the 2nd and 3rd wave of his AE , 3 hits for over 1500 and I was down before he was done being pulled<br />
<br />
<br />
CA3/LR5 are very nice against xp mobs and such, and seem to help, though I never parsed anything, but when gods decide to start swinging at you it doesn't really matter (except saryrn maybe)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">CS3 knocks 10 percent off what you would have gotten hit for, off of every swing.<br />
<br />
That's not how CS works.  It averages out that you get hit for less dmg in the long run, but max hit with CS3 and with no CS at all on any given mob is still the same.<br />
<br />
I seem to recall reading on the Warrior boards that parsing shows that having full CA3/CR3/LR5/ID5 gets total dmg taken down about 10% in the long run.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">hmm, question now is:  Is ND3 worth it for the 250ish hps you get?  Mobs hit for 500+ in PoP and the 250 hps doesnt seem like it'll save your life.<br />
<br />
Is ND3 worth it?  or skip it and get CA3/LR5?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The power of MGB comes from having multiple MGB buffers on every raid.  When you are after targets that are contested, it goes to the first group that can mobilize, buff, and engage.  MGB focus, MGB boar, MGB virtue, Mgb Quelious, MGB Vallons and engage the mob.  <br />
<br />
I have personaly done raids where we buffed in this manner while the mob was being pulled to camp.  The puller didnt even wait for buffs, just went to fetch while we buffed and as fast as he could get it to us we were fighting.<br />

I am torn between ND and CA/LR next myself...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">looks like everyone has the same problem. I have the &quot;basics&quot; done, can5, mgb, nd3, and got some &quot;clickies&quot;, SC, VP1, RC2.<br />
Now I'm torn between QB3, SCR3+M and CA/LR, all of which seem to be appealing, but not too effective in the first level (what speaks against &quot;spreading it&quot;).  Any suggestions what's the most usefull?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">shamuofxev...<br />
<br />
I would go with SCR3 &amp; SCRM.<br />
<br />
Having Torpor / Q extended is a significant improvement to your mana production efficiency and allows you more time between Q for other tasks.  I see this as a fairly easy call.</div></div><hr />

/agree<br />
not to mention the benefit of reducing the number of buff refresh casts you need to make, especially with our haste.  Mana savings on casting one less round of focus/stam/PE whatever and at least half a dozen fewer haste rounds is noticable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">QB2 first.<br />
<br />
ND3 doesn't just add life-saving HP. It also adds mana-conversion HP, and adds more buffer for using Canni V safely.<br />
<br />
CA3/LR5 doesn't just mean less damage. It also means fewer stuns, and it means spells get interrupted less often when you're getting swung at.<br />
<br />
CS3/ID5 only means less damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Wasn't able to peak at your gear since magelo isn't working for me right now but if your up to the point of attempting RZ with your guild I'm gonna assume that your at atleast 5k+hps buffed. If thats the case I'd recommend doing with ca/lr over ND. The hps from ND are nice when your lower hps and need the hps to give you comfortable room for Cann v. But you should already be beyond that point and I'm gonna say that CA/LR is going to do more for you trying to survive than a couple hundred hps will considering all it takes is 1 more missed hit and you'll have save more dmg with ca/lr than ND would have given ya.<br />
<br />
Personally I love MGB it was one of the first aa's I got after getting cann v out of the way. At the time my guild was learning AoW and we had no other shaman with the skill and we didn't have another for a long time.<br />
<br />
For shaman is it required? Naw probably not. I can buff a large group of people easily enough even after a res. Is it handy to have in some situations where time is really tight and when it isn't it makes life easier for me since we usually only have at most 3 shaman on a raid and often times just 1 or 2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I also can't see your gear but I can say that the extra HP from ND will help you always.  CA/LR only helps you when you are getting hit.<br />
<br />
The returns from ND just get better as your gear gets better.  Extra HPs keep you alive through AE damage, which CA/LR cannot.  More HP from ND makes it faster to get up and running after a rez, being able to use canni5, with no buffs while mobs are in camp with no low health agro.  I would go for ND or QB2, first then you can decide if you want to do CA/LR or something else.<br />
<br />
You may or may not have read the thread a while back on my impressions of CA/LR.  I guess I would just say I wish the difference was at least a little bit more pronounced for 27aa spent.  <br />
<br />
For reference, I fall just short of 6000 hp raidbuffed, and some middling 1200s ac.<br />
<br />
[edit:]<br />
I just looked at your magelo and with 2400 hp unbuffed, I would definately do ND first if I was in your shoes.  Good luck :)<br />
<br />
the link in your sig seems messed up, but this works.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Thanks for all the replies and opinions and shared experiences.<br />
<br />
Yes Henora, I definitely followed your post on CA/LR AA  effect. I am thinking this skill probably helps more on a person with lower AC as AC is not a factor in calculating the misses based on this AA, or am I mistaken?<br />
<br />
I saw the post Shamam made about AC softcap and having 1020AC or 1300AC did not make a difference against PoP mobs. The thinking being that the softcap against PoP mobs is probably in the 1400s.<br />
<br />
Is 2400+ unbuffed that bad? :) Yeah my gear is not that good and still using a Tizmak sleeve lol. Sucks to x-fer server but I don't regret it one bit. But got all the parts for Bloodmetal earring and a guildy will combine it for me and should be getting me Emp key which is a pretty nice ring too so those 2 items should boost my hp up by at least 50 to 60 hp.<br />
<br />
Oh and Langdragoran, why is RC2 good to  get before ND/CA/LR? I am not having too much problems removing curses dots etc atm with RC1. But dying fast from getting whacked :)<br />
<br />
And gotta love SCRM. Topor regularly does 2100 heals for me.<br />
<br />
<br />
PS thanks for the headsup on my sig Henora. Noticed that I reversed the profile/view and made the change. Think it works now :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I wouldn't say 2400 is that bad, but it's certainly far below my comfort area.  My guild will never do Rallos Zek, he is quite out of our league but my hp is about 1000 more than yours.  I remember when my HP was much less and the convenience of being able to canni5 with no buffs and stuff like that is pretty nice.<br />
<br />
Really aren't doing too bad, for having transfered servers!  I'm sure your gear will come up fast and it's another reason why ND is a good choice, as I said before it is unique in that it's returns just get better as your gear does.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, you asked for opinions, there is mine.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">/agree<br />

<br />
One question - does SCRM buff extension work with clicky items? I just got the SA BP with clicky SLTW, would that be extended?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>blakkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">AA tends to produce three basic things:<br />
<br />
1) Additonal stats<br />
2) Focus effects<br />
3) Spell effects <br />
<br />
In 1) I lump together things like ND 3 which gives hitpoints, MC3 which gives &quot;flowing thought&quot;, and things like increased mitigation, which effectively raise AC, or soft cap ac. <br />
<br />
in 2) These are often things you can get with items, of course AA often adds to these, thus making them better. <br />
<br />
in 3) we get things like Can 5, spirit call, VP, effects that give us added oomph to our spell lines.<br />
<br />
In evaluating the payoff for an AA line I examine the pp cost to get the same effect in gear, when possible. <br />
<br />
An example is ND3.  This is really a nice AA for most shaman. It gives you 10% increase in geared hitpoints and stamina buffs.  For me that was about 375 extra hitpoints.   In order to improve my gear to the degree at which I can get that many more hitpoints I would have to spend 100's of thousands of pp, or spend months raiding.  12 AA points seems cheap for what I recieved.<br />
<br />
Another example is can 5. what this did for my impending carpal tunnel syndrome is priceless. I have not sat to med in months. This skill essentially cost 17 AA, because mc 3 would have been very low on my purchase list, and is worth every minute spent collecting points. <br />
<br />
Spirit call.. I spent 4 aa's to get a 3000 point mana free dot every 12 minutes.. And its a blast.  Good points spent here as well. <br />
<br />
MC 3 for non shaman may be more valuable.. I mean how much does a droppable FT III items sell for?  100k?  12 points doesnt look so bad compared to farming 100 k, and if you get 100 k in the same time you can have the item and MC 3....<br />
<br />
Just evaluate what the AA does, what it adds to you, and how much items with similar effects would cost. <br />
<br />
<br />
Examples of 1</div></div><hr />

If you slow a mob, it swings every 4 seconds or so.  3 second Q can be cast inbetween swings.  You don't even need to channel.  Also, if you don't manage to get it timed right, you only have 1 swing to channel through, not 2.  It's incredibly easier to channel Q through 1 round of attacks but channelling through 2 is really tough.  Shaman rely so much on Torpor and Q for our healing.  We need to be able to land our spells, and quick buff makes Q much easier to land.</div></div><hr />
