<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xhosa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I checked the slow list and it shows the MB to be immune to slow. Does it give an immune message or is he just very hard to slow to an extent that is not worth trying ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">on the chart, immune means it gives the message.  Unslowable means that you can't count on him being slowed because of resists.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm hearing way too many people saying that he is currently slowable. Any Shaman tried slow him recently ?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: fixed typo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">last time I faught him he was not slowable, and returned Target is immune to slow message.  His melee isn't the problem anyways, it's the AEs and spiders that'll kill ya</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">yeah he's immune</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>eci_shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you even have the time to slow the MB, then your raid isn't really going very well :P  This mob is supposed to be dead within a minute or so, otherwise your raid will be...   don't bother slowing, only malosinia and then help nuke....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">An open raid on Karana took Behemoth out Thursday morning at 5 a.m. EST ... it took a lot longer than a minute to kill him, and we had 12 groups with an average level of 63. Took probably 2-3 minutes, tops, though that AE of his is nasty. I don't particularly like being thrown through the air like a rag doll either, heh. He is not slowable, he popped an immune message to the 65 shaman (raid leader, incidentally) who just HAD to try and slow him. It is definitely the spiders you have to watch out for, little snots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Oh, cool, you did manage to kill it then? Grats on the Tactics flag :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I dont slowing would do much good if it was possible. His other attacks are so strong anyway so his melee output is just a drop in the ocean.<br />
<br />
My guild have 2 kills out of 3 attempts on him. First time we got him to 9% before wipe. Last time the fight was over in less than a minute with about 100ppl in zone, whereof 30 were on spider cc team.<br />
<br />
So as a shaman, if youre not on CC team, just fast-heal your melees or nuke him silly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yep, Behemoth hit the ground dead (rather ungracefully I might add, heh) in a useless scrap of metal. The really interesting part ... my entire group wiped save for me. I apparently was the only one with sense enough to try and stay away from his AE. And I'm a Barbarian, imagine *me* having sense. *shakes head* ... at any rate, nope, we didn't manage to get Tactics flagged. Someone (unnamed and unknown, there's a nearly serverwide manhunt for him, heh) trained the NPC we needed to hail for the flag and killed him somehow. While I find this rather funny (yep, in a raid with an average level of 63, people are still noobish enough to train) and look forward to trying Behemoth again in a couple days, others didn't ... *grin* ... I'll be back in POI in a couple of days. *shrug* ... glutton for punishment? Maybe. There are some in my guild who call me the Rubbermaid Shaman. Let's just say I earned it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Lor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">the npc can be knocked out by the spiders, so if your cc teams dropped the ball before the flagger could be trained out and mem-blurred, he could very well have fallen to the spiders. Mayhap no need for a manhunt, just overexcited folks not doing their jobs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ROFL ... I didn't care particularly about getting flagged, I'm exp-flagged for that zone already. It was enough to see Behemoth hit the ground and take notes for when our guild starts a raid to take him out. And aye, he was trained with spiders. Twenty two, I believe the last count was. IMO, no need for a manhunt, but the other 70 people on that raid, and their friends, don't exactly agree with me. *shrug* ... dunno. I am just waiting to make another attempt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If your raid has time to consdier slowing MB you probably need more DPS.<br />
<br />
Slowing of spiders is important, slowing MB isnt (not that you can anyway)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>korask shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">This is one of my favorite pop fights.  Learning to beat him with 30s as guild new to the encounter without the propper dps to drop him in under 3 mins or without the chanters to mez the spiders/people to devote to killing them makes this one of the funnest fights ive ever done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If your raid has time to consdier slowing MB you probably need more DPS.<br />
<br />
Too true.  Slowing MB is so *not* the issue...You'll get a client message that he's immune anyway.<br />
<br />
Either he's dead in 30 seconds or not...</div></div><hr />
