<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>TwoBrew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I'm level 42 and decided I would try to get that last push of cash to get my Iksar BP...<br />
<br />
Headed to Rathe Mountains to fight some HG's. When I get there, I join up with an inept mage who died twice because he decided to be puller when I told him specifically that I would do it...over and over.<br />
<br />
Then all of a sudden...2 groups came in. 2 teams of 2 druids.<br />
<br />
With them quad kiting/tracking everything in the area, there was NOTHING to hunt. NOTHING. I would see one...running toward it, and around the corner right before I get there jumps a druid and dot's him.<br />
<br />
Several times I would cast my DoT on him and they would start pulling him with snare before mine would finish up...I asked them a couple of times to please look around first and they wouldn't even respond. <br />
<br />
I'm not a vindictive person...but I will say that last night I was wanting to know the tips of the train...I wanted to eliminate at least ONE of the groups there to give all of us others in the zone a chance at a mob! No chance with them there...<br />
<br />
Just thought I'd vent!</div></div><hr />

If you actually pull one and start beating on it - they'll say you pulled it from their &quot;camp&quot; and blast it to death with you standing there getting beat on.

<br />

Enchanters are next.   It's too bad that Flowing thought drops so rarely and stacks with KEI...   it'd be much nicer if there were readily available flowing thought items that did not stack with KEI...   get tired of the 100-200pp per buff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>moosha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There is a very simple response to that.  Don't pay 100-200pp per buff.<br />
<br />
KEI is a massive mana hog (around 900 mana I think?) and it takes a while for a non-shaman class to regain that much mana.  It is beyond me why non-enchanter classes think that they are somehow entitled to this buff.  You didn't pay 10k for the scroll for that chanter and you are not the one that has to sit on your butt and regain that mana.  <br />
<br />
If you don't want to pay for the buff then don't.  I personally can make way more then 100pp soloing in the time the buff lasts so it is a good investment for me.  I pay 100pp and I don't really mind.   What if every newbie in the game ran to you and demanded that you give them group focus?  Would you happily do it?  Would you think that because you have the spell that everyone else is entitled?  Of course not.   Be realistic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The up side of this whole druid problem is at the endgame they aren't all that powerful.  Some DoT's, circle buffs, healing and snare doesn't mean anybody's banging down their doors to group.  You'll find a huge amount of druids hit about level 60 and then kick out to twink an alt, cause they can't quad kite the whole world.</div></div><hr />

Shocked ! Shocked I am ! Shocked I say !<br />
<br />
On slow days I take my 60 Monk to RM and whack everything that moves for an hour or so.  Nothing like fighting 4 HG's at once to make the local droods whine.<br />
<br />
(Of course they DO snare my already beat on Giant, but hey, it's a dr00d - I don't expect much and am never disappointed)</div></div><hr />

If it wasnt such a good way to make money then why did I always see a chanter in nexus, ect KEI'ing for PP.  Fill up a group and bang, with Fennin KEI prices, you got 250pp for mana you will regen in approx 2 min or so.  That sounds like pretty easy money to me.</div></div><hr />

A buddy of mine with a 65 chanter on EMarr makes 6k to 8k an hour just serving up KEI in the Nexus.<br />

Show me a dungeon or tradeskill that will net that much profit in that amount of time consistantly, with no investment other than the players time sitting there, clicking a spell gem, then sitting on their ass for a couple of minutes. Can't. Period.</div></div><hr />

Also,  With dogdog and a few well placed nukes you can easily do the 51% damage to get the kill.  Also, use root to mark you mobs.  Once a druid snares a HG and it doesnt move he/she will get the idea.</div></div><hr />

As for the price of the spell, I think it's ridiculous that people charge 15K for the scroll.  It's a BUFF.

I've never hid the fact that I take great personal pleasure in cutting kite strings, and frankly I've got 0 regrets about dotting the shyte out of a mob thats being quadded and pulling it out. I spent far too much of my EQ youth being run over by ignorant bastards who couldn't give a rats arse about who they got killed while they were kiteing.<br />

I actually, I didn't pay 10k for it since I am a shaman.   Some enchanters have paid as much as 20k for that spell.  The point of my post has not changed and no one has said anything that would make me change my opinion.  <br />
<br />
<br />
If you don't want to pay 100pp for KEI then don't.   There is no tradeskill or spell in the game that will net you that kind of pp per hour.   So what.  You are all jealous that you can't rake in the cash like the chanters.  If you want to make that kind of cash, make an enchanter and level to 60.    I can still slow better and take a hit after doing so.  They cannot.  I'm still happy.  <br />

<br />
That's why I pull with Burst of Flame now, when I go to help young 'uns out.  Always keep Goner hasted;  SoW'd, too, so he can keep up with me.<br />
<br />
My big beef with dr00ds (as opposed to druids, who actually have --gasp-- manners) is when I'm in an out-of-the-way corner, beating on my critter, and they drag their critters (usually with an extra they picked up) right over the top of me.   Root the ones I wanna keep, annull the ones still ticked at the dr00d.  He's welcome to stick around if he really wants that one back.<br />
<br />
If I see a druid nearby while I solo, I make it a point to send them a tell like &quot;Hi, I'm be fighting over here in the corner.  Hollar if ya need Harness or Sta or some such.&quot;  Does 3 things:  (a) prevents the otherwise inevitable post-quad &quot;sorry, didn't know you were there,&quot; (b) paints me as a kindly sort, (c) stakes a claim to at least some of the critters in the area.<br />
<br />
Do I hate druids in general?  Some of my best friends are druids--a few I've met in just this way--but as a whole, I hates them my preciousss.  I hates them forever!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">On Cazic-Thule, enchanters are paying closer to 75k for KEI, so if they recoup their costs by charging, more power to them.  <br />
<br />
That said, you guys must have some blood sucking mercenaries on your servers.  None of the enchanters I ever deal with ask for a set price, only a donation.  I give them 25pp (I'm a cheapskate, I know) and they are more than happy to give it to me again next time I happen by.  This is not to mention the fact that you can wander into KEI (and Aego) MGBs every couple of hours in the Nexus.</div></div><hr />

Especially 100pp ... not saying anyone else shouldn't - that's up to you, but for me, it's just not in the cards.  I get mana back plenty fast for solo'ing as it is, and if not, I'll sit a few seconds to med if inside, or just use horse if outside.<br />
<br />
As for druids, dispell is your friend.  I haven't been to RM in a while, but I used to just charge the HGs headlong as soon as they popped, then whack 'em on the fly and run off with 'em behind me... if the mob's running after ya, most folks will honor that he's yours.<br />
<br />
I also set up at the end of the hill in the back of the zone.  There's a tree back there you can park your dog at, and see at least 6 or 7 spawn points.  2 or 3 on the hill in front of you, another 2 down the side of the hill back towards the entrance, and 2 more in the field off to the right.  Normally, if you're watching, you can see 'em pop and be on 'em before someone relying on tracking alone can get to 'em.<br />
<br />
Don't waste time casting, get it back to camp and then root/slow/dog/dot, whatever, but get it after you first... a second here or there under heavy competition means a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">As a Druid I look at it on an individual basses. A lot of the Farmer type Druids are really alts. As for 60+ Druid playing I can still solo and quad with little problems. I don’t quad as much as I did at lower levels in that I do more with my Guild or Pick up groups since PoP has come out. Though I can solo in some of the PoP zones.<br />
<br />
As far as debuffing MOBs if it results in the Characters Death then a person can be reported to a GM. I’ve only had one person debuff a MOB I was Solo Kiting, but it really made little difference. With SoE I can stay way a head of MOB regardless.</div></div><hr />

So does repeatedly quadding over somebody.  I'm sure you don't do it--by all posts you make here, you seem to be on the ball and polite--but there are folks who just don't give a rodent's rear.<br />
<br />
I've given up petitioning folks like that.   I get quadded over, I'll remind them I'm there.  The 2nd time the person does it is when I'll keep whatever hits me--assuming it's got life enough for me to get xp--and encourage him to go away.  Usually flash of light (and/or annul) (with a quick dance out of agro range) is enough to make the critter run away from me and go back where he belongs.<br />
<br />
And folks who debuff something being solo kited... that's just plain stupid.  They're the same folks who pee on the seats in public stalls to see who they can catch.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Hill giants are garbage. At your level, partner up in Crystal caverns, or on High keep guards. Better exp, and, overall, MUCH better cash.<br />
<br />
You can expect at least 1pp cash per kill in Crystal, with 4pp total, plus gem / velium being average. Can make a few hundred PP quickly at the Geonids. Velium sells decently as well. High Keep guards drop at least 3pp per kill, plus a guaranteeded 4 plat worth of fine steel. They can also drop low gems and research material.<br />
<br />
Hill giants drop from 1 silver to 45pp. Generally, I get more of the 1 silver ones myself. The pain in the rear to compete with the druids (More problems with a herd of beastlords on Saryrn) really makes the hill giants plat per hour far lower than either of the other places.<br />
<br />
As for paying for  KEI... I'll buy it in the nexus, 50pp average. Assuming I have a port lined up for wherever i plan to use it. I'm willing to pay up to 150pp for a maximum extended KEI, however... Extended Enhancement and buff duration AA. If you don't think doubling your mana regen and tacking on a few extra hunded mana for four hours is worth 150pp, well that's your call.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Oh, and if they give you a smart-ass remark when they reply to your polite reminder about being quadded over, /report them.  Don't have to petition them, just a /report.  That way, if they gripe to a GM about you, you have ammo in the report queue showing that you were defending yourself, and that you were playing nice.  And yes, this has proved to be a valid defense.  <br />
<br />
I'd been somewhere for an hour or so, then he moved in and started pulling everything in sight directly over me, making smartass comments about how I shouldn't be &quot;where he's going to quad.&quot;  /report.  3rd time, I annulled the critter closest to him when he quadded over me.  Got the next closest, also.  He ran off in a hurry.  Flashed the other 2 and got them out of my agro range.  Dr00d died a few mins later.  Not happy, he kept sending me nasty messages and threatening to quad over me again and again.  /report again.<br />
<br />
Guide asks me a couple hrs later what had happened.  I explained and pointed to the /reports.  He laughs, thanks me for my time, wishes me good hunting.  Dr00d evidently didn't like the answer, so he eventually gets a GM.  I point to the /reports.<br />

<br />
That should probably read: BE POLITE, BE NICE and keep dispell magic and root loaded. If a quadder trains me once I'll try to discuss it with him. Mistakes happen and I won't go off on someone for one screwup. <br />
<br />
If it happens again I'll either root or discretely dispell part of the kite. It's really not something I like to do (have done it twice in the 3 years I've been playing EQ) but if my only other options are to grin and bear it or move elsewhere I'll defend my turf. Just don't threaten or call him any names ahead of time, otherwise odds are you'll get petitioned. Be polite, ask him not to train you again and if he does just start dispelling w/o any comments. You won't kill anyone  but you'll make life difficult enough that they'll get the message. If they get abusive, then you can petition (not that it will do any good either). <br />

... can't we make an exception for druids? :D<br />
<br />
Some of my best friends are druids. Hell, most of my friends probably have a 50+ druid on their account but I still think it's usually a safe (in the sense of trying to stay alive) assumption that the random quadding drood you run across is an idiot. Sometimes I'm pleasantly surprised but usually they seem to live up to my expectations. <br />
<br />
I don't think I'm alone in that when I do a pickup group (which is rarely) I'm very hesitant to get a druid for one. The odds of running across one who doesn't know how to play a grouping druid is just too great for me to want to take a chance. <br />
<br />
Druids have always had a public relations's problem and the quadders and charm kiters training people in PoP aren't helping.</div></div><hr />

The alt discovering this was my ranger, so I could sneak and sell to the indifferent vendor, not sure who all is indifferent here, tho hubby's erudite necro was.  Over time, it seemed to be a better rate of return than from the 5sp - 45pp HG's.<br />
<br />
The dr00ds can have RM.  As much fun as it is explaining over and over &quot;when I see a giant running at me, I root it - if you don't like that, you shouldn't run them on top of me&quot;... it's not as much fun as having a nice, dr00dless nite.  Not to mention, I've DONE that zone with my druid alt - she exists to make cash to buy my shaman nice things.  It's not in the LEAST bit difficult to run your giants around in a smaller area - but most dr00ds are too stupid and/or lazy to pull that off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Seefar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Hill giants are garbage. At your level, partner up in Crystal caverns, or on High keep guards. Better exp, and, overall, MUCH better cash.  <br />
<br />
I made 800pp in Rathe in about 5 hours.  That's a bit better than 80-100pp per hour per your suggestion in HHK or CC.  Geonids in CC are ALWAYS camped on my server and usually one or two groups waiting when it opens.  HHK is about the same.  <br />
<br />
Sure Rathe is a pain, but can't really be camped the way CC or HHK is.   I got up very early one weekend morning when I couldn't sleep and headed down to Rathe.  With 10-12 people in the zone, there was still some competition, but plenty around to keep me busy.</div></div><hr />

I had to abandon Cobalt Scar for XP grinding because of the dr00ds, and that's a fact.  They were idiots - inconsiderate, arrogant, loot whores who didn't give a damn who they trained or stole a kill from as long as they got the fourth for their quad.<br />
<br />
That doesn't mean I don't have respect for the many druids in my guild who are not dr00ds, and yes, many of them do or did kite (considerately!) in CS back in the day.  But the fact is, there are more badly played, inconsiderate druids than just about any other class I've seen.<br />
<br />
Skamkin, if you want to get all huffy and insulted by my last statement, see ya.  If you want to debate it and claim another class is on the whole ruder and less considerate, go for it.

Goody for you. Go delete your Shaman. You're not worthy of the class anyways. Shaman HELP people. We make them better. Dr00ds do nothing but solo, gank other peoples pulls, and just generally be obnoxious. Of course there are some good people who play DRUID'S, but for the most part the class draws in the socially inept introverted outcasts who have no interpersonal skills or abilities to relate to other living breathing human beings.<br />

In terms of druids, yeah bunch o idiots out there, most of em twinks, heck nowadays it seems monks are the flavor of the month and a new crop of monks just dont follow the same styles nor do they have the same skills as &quot;old school&quot; monks.<br />

My primary hunting partner is a human druid, we are both lvl 62 atm. I have known this druid from day one, she quaded a few times just to know she could do it, but never really liked it. Many of the PoP zones cant be quaded because of chain agro and adds and such.<br />

There are idiots in all classes, and because of the ability to lvl quickly in the first 40 50 lvls probably more idiots are druids than other classes. Wizards are rapidly approaching this point, and probably a few other classes.<br />

Anyways, about Quadders, I avoid RM for cash like the plague.  Just NOT worth it.  Even as a Wizard, I went to Burning woods and smoked giants for gear drops, since they average 40pp each. As a shaman, I do a HHK run, top to bottom, use my swamp rock to go to the hand in Inny Swamp, sell, gate back to wherever I bound.  Top to bottom your looking at about 20 swords, give or take, avg of 80pp per lap, etc..<br />
<br />
If someone is on the 2nd floor I try to avoid kililng their guards unless they are barely managing the noble/bard spawn and then I clear them out of kindness.<br />

Digging too hard for 60 now though.  Making 2 hour groups prior to raids, soloing for 15 minutes after peeing in the middle of the night, whatever it takes.</div></div><hr />

And Skamkin, even though you are probably not reading these boards anymore (thank God), yes there are some anti-druid attitudes here.  But have you actually stopped to read why?

 So does repeatedly quadding over somebody. I'm sure you don't do it--by all posts you make here, you seem to be on the ball and polite--but there are folks who just don't give a rodent's rear.<br />
<br />
No, I don’t quad over people nor have I ever lost my quad group. Mainly because I only quad in certain zones, new Druids to quading are the worse because they don’t understand that MOBs move at different rates, this is where most of the problems lie.<br />

Simple way to deal with droolcups in 10 easy step.<br />
<br />
Remember they are retarded dogs, treat them like it.<br />
<br />
1) When you first enter the area and see one, call them over. Cast bear form and mark your area infront of them, do this over and over(you will need to drink lots of water for this.)<br />
<br />
2) The first time they run you over with a quad, repeat #1<br />
<br />
3) The second time, show them the &quot;newspaper&quot;. Do this by casting annul magic on them(it won't hurt them sadly) and point out the next time they run that clusterf*ck they call a kite over you it will be on the mobs.<br />
<br />
4) Droolcups don't learn quickly, so expect to get ran over again, at this point you should use the &quot;newspaper&quot; but lightly as a warning, annul half their quad.<br />
<br />
5) The Droolcup will bark and growl quite a bit now, this is best handle by /ignore moron, use this for around 20 mins then turn it off so you can hear them again(see #6)<br />
<br />
6) No it hasn't learn yet most likely. So expect them to run a quad over you again, repeat number #4 with stronger warning.<br />
<br />
7)The Droolcup will attempt to bite you now, so have invis and a box of popcorn ready. Enjoy the look of pure panic and hate on the face of it as you invis and stand there laughing as its train beats it into roadkill.<br />
<br />
8) Droolcups are slow and stuipd, so you should attempt to help the one in question to understand what it is doing wrong. After it has attempted to bite you, wait until it gets its mangled corpse or returns form gating within a inch of its sorry life and started quading again. Run around and get atlest 12 mobs of the type it is kitting(can be hard to do, but think about the poor droolcup!). Take this 'Kite' and run it over the top of the Droolcup and make a comment along the lines of  &quot;How did that feel? Yeah I don't like it much ethier&quot;. At this point hopefully the Droolcup has learn and will be more thoughtful of others(esp. you) in the area where it trains... err Quad kites for xp.  but this is not likely.<br />
<br />
9) Time to use the newspaper and make your point firmly.<br />
<br />
Golem Metal Wands never leave home without them, when dealing with droolcups.<br />
<br />
There was a small bug a while ago(It might have been fixed but I doubt it) where if you can get some of your body in the zone wall the server will bug and think that certain effects are casted form a different source(namely the wands). When the Droolcup comes running happily at you about to take its train...err quad over you, bug yourself into the wall, target it and click the wand 3times fast(instant cast pillage enchantments) this should remove its wolf form, sow, SoE ect.. plus a few other buffs(namely its hp buff) stand and watch the train...err quad killing it. remind the droolcup you warn it repeatly.<br />
<br />
10) When the Droolcup returns to get its corpse, repeat steps 1 and 2. but after a repeat of step #2 skip directly to #9<br />
<br />
This works for non-epic'ed wizards and pesky SKs but not nercos or monks fungi kiting. Edit: Also doesn't work on bards swarm kitting, just invite them they will be overjoyed they have a group.<br />
<br />
Remember the only good Druid is a dead one.<br />

On the other hand, thanks for an informative post Gegen.  I too, enjoy grouping with druids and do so on a regular basis.  In fact, both of the last two longish PoP TierII groups I have been in have had druids as main healers and they worked out famously!  Low level druids always have and always will be a pain however.  I think people have the biggest problem with the 1-50 crowd . . . . I know it was that way for me.  Fortunately nowadays I have ways of dealing with this.

<br />
<br />
Not everyone has a problem with me, I am normally a nice helpful guy in game and most poeple when they heard about me getting suspended where stunned. I just have problems with beggers, jerks and morons, they just seem to be rolled into one in most droolcups I have met, there are a few good ones, but those few don't make up for the overwhelming masses.<br />
<br />
1 suspend was form being &quot;abusive&quot; to a druid who just didn't know what: &quot;Sec will refresh those buffs as soon as I finish this IG.&quot;, &quot;Please do NOT steal my kills&quot;, &quot;I don't mind helping you but when I am fighting 2 Gaints already, low on health, I cann't really help you with a 3rd.&quot; &quot;Please don't kite a IG right behind me when I am cann. dancing and have its litte butt buddy fighting my pet.&quot; and my personal fav &quot;Please tell me when you ask for a heal that you have a pissed off gaint rooted out of sight and if you don't, don't bitch when i kill it after it comes out of nowhere and kicks the living **** out of me.&quot;. I when off on the little b*stard after about 2 hours(4 deaths, one of which was at my bind point) of enduring the above.<br />
<br />
1 suspend myself and the drOOd got 'spanked' for seeing who could pull the most of CS on the other(He was KoS, I wasn't. I won so to speak.) (I had my bot cleric camped near by so any innocent by-standers that got caught in the middle got 96% resses and buffed)<br />
<br />
The close banned was for counter training a stuipd shurb humper who had been quading over me and out right training me all day, the GM was giving me the good bye speech when the droolcup(with a server GM in clear sight) ran half the zone over me cursing and tauntin about how he petition and a GM would banned me soon in shouts.<br />
<br />
Those are the only times I have ever been on the wrong side of a GM in close to 3 years of playing. So not everyone has a problem with me, just annoying druids and beggers who don't know better then to step into the arena for a hand out.<br />
<br />
Has far as being a bad bear, I am Inny's own pet bear when pushed to far. (At work right now so when I get home I will see if i can find my old sig pic, has a few good examples of how nice and how evil i can be, including a great shot of me tricking a noob begger into grouping with me and following me into a arena for a hand out, where i bound him and rooted / JBB'ed to death for over a hour everytime he respawned, while everyone in the zone cheered me on.)<br />
<br />
&quot; You know, sometimes people are just rude jerks, and truly are KS'ing you. Sometimes, they just didn't realize they were interfering with you. When you respond like that, it does nothing but add fuel to the fire. &quot;- Cush<br />
<br />
After I ask, beg and warn 3 to 4 times that I am here, please don't train me or steal my kills, Its clear that it isn't a case of &quot;Just didn't realize they where interfering with you.&quot; As far as responding like that, when using a soft voice and respect fails its time to get out the curses and the club they never fail.<br />
<br />
<br />
As far as the people who will scream that using a few members of a class as a base for the whole class is wrong, I agree, However when over 75% of that class are jerks, morons and anti-social retards...It stops being a 'few members'. At this point I have stopped calling the few members of the Druid class that have any class, Druids.<br />
<br />
I have had bad run ins with wizards and necromancers(who after a quick reminder that if they piss me off regen spells and fast heals go form free and happy to give it, to 100pp a shot and whenever I feel like it. seem to have a better attiude.) But most are at the very lest repsectful and in many cases are willing to set up a working partnerships(In areas where there are named spawns on the table that nethier can deal with alone, but can bring down togather when they spawn.) or if nethier then we agree to keep out of each others ways. But I have met maybe 5 decent druids in my time and of those 5 only 1 still plays a Druid.<br />

But maybe I am jaded form the time I spend at IGs outside permafrost getting cash to waste on making potions and working my skills up, where the worst of the droolcups hang out.<br />

But to be fair, looks like you've had trouble with them before.  It seems a HUGE coincidence that it's always been druids.  Not all of them are like that, you know, and as for the first group you spoke of (the alleged 12 grouped druids hunting giants) I didn't see anything wrong with what they were doing.</div></div><hr />

Its not terribly surprising that its almost always entirely dr00ds which are unwilling to compromise or work together in a decent manner. If you could ask VI the following question, I'd garuntee the following answer:<br />
<br />
Q) What is the first class to 20th, 50th, and 60th (now 65) on any -NEW- server thats brought up?<br />
<br />
A) druid<br />
<br />
Yes, they're absolutely wonderfull for twinking melee, and to some extent, caster/priest classes. Yes, a well played druid is actually a damn fine addition to any group/guild.<br />
<br />
The problem is, the nature of the druid class makes it terribly easy to be a worthless piece of sh*t.  A great number of clueless noobs, or just plain inconsiderate asses don't take into account where they're taking their quad (don't even get me started on people who quad kite, just because you -can- doesn't mean you should, frankly its rude unless there's nobody else in zone, did you perhaps think VI made the zone JUST for you?) and who they run past/over.<br />
<br />
Its not hard to see why other folks get sick of it, once gets a polite 'please avoid me', twice gets a polite 'really, don't do that', thrice gets you dead, intentionally, by my hand.<br />
<br />
Don't like it? Then don't kite across me, its really very simple.<br />
<br />
Don't be an ignorant f*cktard and you won't find yourself on the wrong side 'anull magic' and other fun spells.<br />
<br />
Simple no?<br />
<br />
Bottom line: Inconsiderate bastards get whats coming to them in the end.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Thanks to this thread I now hate all shaman and will never port one again with my druid or res one with my cleric. I will delete my shaman as soon as I log on (stripping him of gear first. I may be upset but I am not crazy). I have my druid (note how it is spelled correctly) leveled to 61, my cleric to 56 and my shaman just dinged 29. I wanted to play a shaman and decided to come here for tips on the class and gear. <br />
<br />
Much to my dismay I read this poor excuse for a thread. At first I thought it is just one bitter shammy who had one bad experience. Then when I saw all the childish druid bashing shammys sign in one after another, I decided this is not a place I wish to associate myself with. This is not a class I wish to associate myself with anymore for that matter. <br />
<br />
I almost can't wait for the next shammy to ask me for a 96% res so I can tell them to go away as I do not res shammys. When they ask why I will direct them to this thread. I'm sure I will get flamed for this post but that is ok. I never intend to read any responses as I never wish to return to the shaman crucible after this anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just so you know, my heart pumps purple piss and bleeds for you. You get pissed about one person haveing a bad encounter and overreacting, now look at what YOU are doing. Hypocritical PoS. Just goes to show that your main is a dr00d, very easy to see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Bilei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">I have my druid (note how it is spelled correctly) <br />
Note how we spell it drOOd. That's cuz most of us know the difference between druid and drOOd. Apparently you don't.<br />
Then when I saw all the childish druid bashing shammys sign in one after another<br />
DrOOd bashing, not druid bashing. Big difference. Even the druid boards know the difference between druid and drOOd and they do plenty of drOOd bashing over there.<br />
I will delete my shaman as soon as I log on<br />
Guess you will be deleteing your cleric as well? In fact, go to all the other class boards and post about drOOds. Then we won't have to worry about you being any other class than a druid. <br />
I never intend to read any responses as I never wish to return to the shaman crucible after this anyway. <br />
We all know that trolls always come back in hopes of having started a huge flame fest.  Kinda like criminals who return to the scene of the crime.<br />
When they ask why I will direct them to this thread.<br />
Please also direct them to these threads. Guess you must have missed them in your haste to post how rotten we all are.<br />

As you can see from the responses to your trolling, we don't care to ba associated with you as well. Trolling is not common on this message board and we tend to like it that way. <br />
Good day to all and I am sorry I ever came here.<br />
So are we.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>TwoBrew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">Hey SKamkin...since you're logging your Shaman off for good...if you happen to be on Tunare, can I have your crap? Granted, it's probably worse than what I got, but I'll sell it to a vendor and spend the 28gp's on some fish rolls or something.<br />
<br />
If you're not on Tunare, donate your ph4t 1ewtz to a deserving Shaman before you kill him off. Thanks!</div></div><hr />
