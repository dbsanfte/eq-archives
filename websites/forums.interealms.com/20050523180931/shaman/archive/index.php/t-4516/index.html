<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, need some advice here.  <br />
<br />
I have 3 RL friends who are in my guild, they are the ones that got me hooked on EQ to start with.  I started a month after they did, and I've always been about 10 - 15 levels behind.  Consequently, we only would meet during guild events or in the nexus, etc.<br />
<br />
Now, however, we are all 50+ (I am the lowest at 52) and so find ourselves with more chances to group together for a fun night of exp.  This has always been a goal of mine, and I looked forward to the day when I could group with my friends in some high level dungeons.<br />
<br />
The 'problem' is that one of my friends also plays a shaman.  He played a ranger for the longest time, but his ranger has stalled at 52, while his shaman has turned into his main char over the past month or two, zooming up past the ranger and currently sitting at a blue or 2 until lvl 56.  Obviously, he has been seduced by the power and pure fun of being a shaman :)  And I think its great.  <br />
<br />
The only issue is, Snapdragn is my only character, and so when he brings his shaman to the group it is Shaman, Shaman, Necro, Druid...a bizarre group if there ever was one.  It's a lot of fun, especially since we are all friends.  Both the Necro and the Druid bring a lot to the table if you are imaginative (FD, 93% rez, ghetto mez, tracking, ports and evac, etc).  What do I bring?  DoTs that don't stack very well, an inferior slow, and a weak pet (especially compared to the necro).<br />
<br />
<br />
So...what do you do when you are the #2 shaman in an exp group?  It's like being the 5th person on a double date. :(  The last time we grouped I was main slower until he showed up, then I just kept up HoS, haste, AC buffs, etc.  Still had fun, but it was kinda like having the coach bench you in the middle of the game.  I'm thinking maybe switch over and start pulling for the group.  Your opinions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If it were me and there was enough healing I would start to go on the offensive with DoTs such.  If the other shaman can keep up with everything else I would go for melee and offensive spells.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dia Shan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">When i am one of 2 shaman in group, I go AFK alot, and mooch exp :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Where do you guys usually exp, and what general tactics do you use? Do you kite or fearkite outdoors, root rot, or do dungeons with a fairly traditional tanking strategy (with a shaman or pet tanking)? It's a little hard to answer the question without knowing more about the tactical situation. <br />
<br />
In general, I'd say to (1) not feel bad about your pet. Free damage is free damage, and once he's summoned he's free damage until he dies; (2) heal as needed (3) what's wrong with blasting away? If mobs last long enough, use your dots. If he has Bane of Nife, you're golden using Envenomed Bolt. If he's stuck with Envenomed bolt still, then you can just use nukes. If you have or can get a JBB, just click away. If not, then use mana for it with poison or cold nukes. (3) Malise line - you're looking at a lot of spell damage in that group, so I'd think resist debuffing would be useful if you're not already doing it. Even the small/cheap one can make a big difference. (4) Pulling could be a good choice, but only in outdoor or easily pulled zones. A higher level puller is generally a good choice in hard-to-pull areas, due to level aggro effects. (5) If the mobs live a long time (close to two mins), you can use Plague as well. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Relax a bit, chief.  Per the guys at VI, they have solved DoT stacking, and are testing it now.  You two should be able to group and doube DoT easily now.  Give it a month and see what happens!<br />
<br />
If you don't have a healer, then one of you heals, and the other does damage and slows.  Believe me, 2 shamans can work together without stepping on each other!  :)<br />
<br />

/lfg on<br />
/gate<br />
<br />
Sorry, I'm pretty much holding the group back if I'm not slowing/buffing.<br />
<br />
If they want more healing and have a shaman already, get a cleric or at least a druid for stuns/better DDs/evac's/DS's.<br />
<br />
If they want DPS, get an AM3 ranger, rogue, monk or wizzy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Communication I guess. Talk to other shaman and split the tasks.  Our 2 main jobs are buffing and debuffing, pick which one you want.  Buffing not exactly fun, so maybe you 2 could alternate on buffing/debuffing.  Doesn't matter if his slow is *slightly* better than yours just because of his level, it's still the same spell, and won't significantly affect the speed at which you grind.<br />
<br />
<br />
But if there's one thing thats reassuring about having 2 shamans in one group...  say you get an add or 2, with the twice the slow power, you have much better chances to come out of it alive or not have to zone.  But you 2 also gotta work out who will target what - communication again.<br />
<br />
Other than that, I would suggest dotting.  Our dd's are crap, but our dots are pretty potent.  You could throw in a couple ebolts every fight or something.  Not sure if it causes stacking issues with necro dots, but I know it won't affect all of them.  Just work it out with him so he knows you're gunna be casting ebolt  and he'll probably work with like non-poison related dots instead.  <br />
And I'd continue to let him pull imo, or whoever's highest level in group cuz they can single pull more stuff.  Of course, if you had a druid which you do, you could hunt outdoors, have him harmony and then you could pull easy.<br />
<br />
<br />
That reminds me, whereabouts do you grind nowadays and do you ever add a melee or 2 to the group?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Someone slows/heals<br />
<br />

<br />
or one slows, one heals, and both combined figure out away to do offensive thingys</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Oh, and I can't tell you how LITTLE I care about dots stacking.<br />
<br />
I never dot on raids because frankly I'm too busy debuffing/buffing.<br />
<br />
I never dot in exp groups because I'm too busy debuffing/buffing and because YOU CAN'T MEZ DOTTED MOBS AND MOST MOBS IN EXP SITUATIONS DONT LAST LONG ENOUGH FOR OUR DOTS TO RUN THEIR COURSE. Even in CT, only the brown lizards last 2 minutes against a full group. The LAST thing I want to do is drop my spear dot on a poison raining lizard in CT and then have a higher repop happen yet we can't mez the weak but annoying necro lizzy.<br />
<br />
I dot when soloing tho. Note, stacking is not an issue.<br />
<br />
In summation. Dots impair chanter/bard ability to CC and your MT's ability to pick the right mob to attack. Plus, short of Bane, our second and third best dots (spear and Pox) are too long. You'd do better just to click your bracer, where allowed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I once went to Hate in a single group with just me and a 55 shaman for healing power.  (no cleric/druid etc).  I set him up on cleric duty - he healed the whole night with Chloroblast and JBB'd when there was time.  I slowed and did all the other shaman duties.  Talk to each other and you can make it work so you don't feel too redundant.   Worked well, he said he had a blast.<br />
<br />
On the flip side.  When I was level 58, a friend of mine was level 60 and we grouped together a lot in exp groups.  I felt all useless for like a week until we figured things out.  It actually really upset me at the time, she could do everything better than me!  Finally I got over myself and talked to everyone about it.   We started splitting duties.<br />
<br />
We were doing luclin exploration, she would malo, I would slow.  She would torpor, I would heal with Chloroblast.  She would epic (I didn't have) we would both JBB and Dot as necessary (I didnt have bane or pox).  Dual JBB action isn't too bad in a laid back exp group.  She was also often our puller. :)<br />
<br />
It's all about communication.  Talk to your friend about what things you guys can do best.  For example, at 56 he has access to group regrowth and bane.  So that would come off your list and they would tax his mana.  If you are in a decent exp area where you don't have resist troubles, ask him to bane, and you slow.  Then you can kick on an ebolt.<br />
<br />
It can be done, 2 shaman groups are not necessarily most efficient BUT if you are grouping to hang with your friends and have fun, who cares about powergaming efficiency.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree on both counts. There's always something you can do, but there's always a better choice really. And efficiency should matter to you as well since you're also in the group getting exp. Boredom should as well, since I'd sure as heck hate to be the JBB shaman in a two-shaman group.<br />
<br />
Again, if there's friends involved or something, that's different. But really I would hope no one would be waiting for a big &quot;Okey Dokey&quot; from Team Shaman's Crucible before they group with their friends and that people would be inventive enough to find a good way to divide duties, rergardless. It isn't deep thought to generate &quot;you slow, I'll heal&quot; strats.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mormegil - Did you even read Snaps post?<br />
<br />
:confused: <br />
<br />
He wanted to know what to do as the second (lower level) shaman in an exp group with his friends.   <br />
<br />
I am sure dividing up the spells is something they are already doing.  I don't think there is any shame asking for advice at things like easing of shaman stacking frustrations and boredom when grouping with a friend.<br />
<br />
Sorry my leet &quot;you heal, I'll slow strats&quot; aren't deep enough for you.  :(  I was mostly posting out of sympathy that I know what it is like to be overwhelmed by a higher level shaman's ability, but if you work at it you can make it fun and efficient and not boring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Vurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">But I still love you snap!!! Hey man I'm in the same boat as you, you and I are like the bastard step-children... I was sooo happy that we were at least allowed to be the main shaman in Hate /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Henora: &quot;Did you even read Snap's post?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hmm, I don't think I missed anything.<br />
<br />
The question he asked:<br />
<br />
Snap: &quot;So...what do you do when you are the #2 shaman in an exp group?&quot;<br />
<br />
Him answering his own question:<br />
<br />
&quot;It's like being the 5th person on a double date. The last time we grouped I was main slower until he showed up, then I just kept up HoS, haste, AC buffs, etc. Still had fun, but it was kinda like having the coach bench you in the middle of the game. I'm thinking maybe switch over and start pulling for the group.&quot;<br />
<br />
Drop your standard role and adapt.<br />
<br />
Since there's not a need for two shaman in an exp group, split duties however you and your friends care to. I don't think there's really a right answer, nor are there any surprise ways to split tasks. I'll debuff you nuke/buff. I'll maloXXX you slow. Welcome to raiding :) As for pulling, I guess that depends on where you hunt. Shaman pull fine in OS or KC; lousy in CT, Chardok bank or VL castle. /shrug<br />
<br />
As you divvy up the duties however, realize that it could be worse: I'd rather have two shaman than two enchanters or two clerics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Chukzombi Astrocreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If im grouped with another shaman i either leave the group or i &quot;take over&quot;, meaning i do all the slowing,pulling, healling, dotting, nuking, buffing. If the other guy wants to do this, well then the group is all his and i get exp somewhere else. <br />
<br />
Nothing more boring then being a useless player in an exp group, especially when the exp sucks becuase the other groupmates are pulling too slow or going afk every minute.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Is it just me or are people missing the point of the question? He asked about grouping with friends and what to do as the 2nd/lower lvl shaman. Not being in a pickup group of strangers and having another shaman invited and being demoted. If he wants to hangs with his friends and is asking advice how to work it best why should he leave and find another group? <br />
<br />
<br />
    Anyway dont worry to much about your pet. The 49 isnt doing necro pet damage but its doing damage to help out. Also like someone esle said it depends how fast the mobs are dying. If your pulling big hp mobs and all dotting than use the disease dots. If they are dying quickly than having more higher lvl poison dots dont seem like it would do much good anyway. Keep using vos its doing some damage. I wonder if your worrying about this more than they are. <br />
<br />
   I personally group with a friends 2nd boxed shaman and think he is starting to feel useless with his shaman also do to me getting all my group buffs and his shammy doesnt need do it as much. But heals always stack and he takes care of the pets haste while i haste  his sk and my warrior. He ebolts and i epic and or bon depending whats needed. We are pretty flexable ....<br />
<br />
   Also as someone else said use your nukes if you want. They arent super efficent but they always stack and do damage if you arent fighting resistant mobs. Anyway i understand the problem i have 3 friends who play shaman and we would group at different times. So sometimes i would be the only shaman sometime we'd have a gaggle of em. Its all about sending that tell and finding out who is doing what and split the stuff up. I mean you say their your friends so sure they arent to worried about it long as your not afking 20 minutes at a time and are doing whatcha can do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Bah, two shaman groups can be awesome.  It really depends on where you are and what you are used to pulling.  In your shm/shm/dru/nec grouping the druid should be playing cleric while you and the other shaman BOTH pull and tank.  The nec uses his pet to back you up and rolls some snare/DoTs out.  Can even get the druid on backup root duty.<br />
<br />
I was in a dual shammy group in the grey with a monk and pally for some amazing exp.  No medding, constant pulls and all 4 of us were tanking usually.  When someone needed a break, we just let the caffeinated monk run loose and kept regen on him.<br />
<br />
If you ever find yourself getting bored try switching up how fast mobs come in or your location.  Head to HS or go deep into Chardok, Sebilis, AC, Hole, and anywhere else mobs wont let you sit around. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Just share dots and other tasks according to what state your book/mana pool is in....<br />
<br />
Last time I duoed with a sham, I malo'd/slowed and pox/plagued, he did bane/ebolt and dispells, we both torpor'd each other as needed.  Needless to say we didnt kill mindblowingly quick, but we were pretty much invincible even with non stop pulls and adds.<br />
<br />
Its actually quite good fun, try it some time =)<br />
<br />
As for raids and such, talk to your fellow bears, Dith/Tal/Myself are always nattering away sorting out whos going to do what, and it works wonders.</div></div><hr />

Oh, and I can't tell you how LITTLE I care about dots stacking.<br />
<br />
<br />
DoT stacking is huge.  If they pull if off, it's the best thing they've done for our class in years.  At 60, there's always room for jello and always mana for berto.<br />
<br />
-Barm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Well, as others said - if you're with friends, who cares about wringing every last DPS out of the game?  I'd much rather do a guild xp group than a pickup group - not only is it more fun, but I don't have to worry about the quality of the other players I'm with.  (Not saying pickup groups are trash, just that guildies are a trusted variable already)<br />
<br />
As for two shaman in a group, it's pretty much all been said.  Talk, divvy up what you're doing.  Pets and JBB stack, and are mana free damage...  different dots are stackable.  And if you don't have an enchanter along, might take a look at some little-used spells.  Torrent of Poison (is 55, and Snap is 52, I realize) can be good damage, and stacks.  Blinding a mob won't set it running, like Fear does, if it's engaged - it'll just keep it fighting whatevers nearest, probably pets.<br />
<br />
The only place I've found where it's really, really boring being an extra shaman is someplace like ToV, where every fight is a single MT fight.  An xp group without a FD puller is likely going to have multiple mobs, so there's plenty of room for extra fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Snaps, post your typical group composition.  Aside from slowing or healing or doting we can ghetto CC with root and malXXX.  Load Enstil and MalXXX and epic/Disease parked mobs if you have no chanter/bard.  I find the CC role a lot more fun than slowing and JBBing.</div></div><hr />

A second shaman that talks to you can be alot of fun. We normally have so many duties than splitting them up can make a long night into a night of fun. <br />

that says it all for me right there<br />
<br />
unless im extremly inferior to the others and just heal , i usualy talk to the shaman and split off . ill haste and he str . ill dex and he whatever .. you get the idea. if he has a better slow then its obvious he should be slowing . the rest doesnt matter so much if you ask me . str buff is a str buff . no one is going to be mad that your casting HoS instead of him. if you have a jbb you can help with that. <br />
<br />
another way if you dont have a JBB and have alot of mana is be the finish nuker . throw out one DD a fight if you can, the final blow . its just plain fun to read  &quot; %t has been slain by Litgruv &quot;   ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I am in a large guild with 5 or 6 Oracles in front of me.  Amusingly I am often the only shaman on a HoT or chardok nobles raid..until Uber_shaman_01 shows up and gets CoH'd to the party...at 55 (now 56!)..I suddenly go from hero to zero...so I feel your pain.<br />
<br />
I have discovered several things that make me feel better:<br />
<br />
1:Once you get chloro..I slap it on melee's so they can survive the 10 seconds to CH.<br />
<br />
2: Listening for Malo/Tash I can typically stick my slow in there..which is mighty helpful until uber-bear can get theirs in for 4% more slow..<br />
<br />
3: On that same note..I can stick in insidious decay at any time (it's unresistable..so who cares who casts it?).  Then on the really slow resistant mobs I might be able to get a disease slow in while the big bear gets out his bigger slow.<br />
<br />
4: Buffs/heals/pet..free damage=free damage..:)<br />
<br />
5: Cripple- Some people don't think it does anything..but some mobs just seem to go down a bit faster..hit a bit less efficiently.  I like to think the melee's just like to hear that baddie getting debuffed..do it for melee morale.<br />
<br />
In an experience group, as backup shaman I like to experiment with things I don't use as often..the rain of poison aoe spells are fun as long as you aren't mezzing.  I bring up Rage-type spells and melee with my hammer of scourge.  I try to epic dot the mobs early and count how many ticks I can get in..<br />
<br />
&quot;Getto Mez&quot; (I hate that term).  Be prepared to pull mobs off the other casters..drag it away and root it.  Other shaman slows all the mobs includiing yours. Repeat with each mob until you are dead or they are.<br />
<br />
Raids: Be the support for the SA/Offtank team. They need you more than anyone.<br />
<br />
Heck..even flash of light is an atk debuff..be creative!  In the end you may be hanging out sucking up exp anyway, but shamans are all about that extra percentage of efficiency..a sliver of advantage is an advantage regardless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Thanks for all the posts guys.<br />
<br />
I see 2 results from this thread:<br />
<br />
1) a fair bit of discussion is being generated about dual shaman groups in general and different things to try.<br />
<br />
2) advice for me regarding my specific situation.<br />
<br />
Both are great, and hopefully we can see which point we are discussing.<br />
<br />
re: General Groups - NOT including grouping with my friends, I haven't had that much exp with a 2 shaman group.  But obvious it's possible, and hopefully the other group members will be able to 'think outside the box' and realize that 2 shamans can, if communicating, be quite effective in a group.<br />
<br />
re: My specific group:  It consists of:  54 Necro, 55 Shaman, 55 Druid, and 52 Shaman (Me).  <br />
<br />
Our last adventure (the one that prompted this post) was in The Grey, and we were joined by a couple more friends - 52 Ranger, 51 Beastlord.   Critters were going down *quick*.  With 4 healers (well, 6 if you think a Ranger and Beastlord can heal :) ) there wasn't a lot of need for healing, even with a Ranger for a tank.  And DoTs weren't really needed either.<br />
<br />
There is a lot of good advice about different ways to split duties, etc.  Yes, some of it is pretty common sense but it helps to hear someone else say it. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Last night I did another guild group in the Grey, and I realized why I was feeling a bit let down before.  Last night's group was 49 monk, 52 Rogue, 53 Magician,  56 Paladin and 52 Shaman (Me).   I realized about 20 mins into the group that if I left, the group was breaking up - No healer, no slower = no group.  Wow, what a feeling.  I was working my butt off, healing, slowing, root parking, etc.  And it was extremely satisfying.  <br />
<br />
I guess at lvl 52 I'm starting to get to the stage where I can make a signifigant impact on a group (67% slow, 580pt heal) and in my close group of friends, neither one of those abilities is super-critical.  <br />

My friends, of course, don't give a flying flip about how much I contribute to the group, as long as I don't kill anyone. :)  We don't group up for xp or nice loot - mainly we try to hit a zone we've never been to, or for some bit of a quest.  <br />

Thanks for the input.<br />

Thanks for all the posts guys.<br />

Wow, what a feeling.  I was working my butt off, healing, slowing, root parking, etc.  And it was extremely satisfying.  <br />

tell me this isnt one of the best feelings in the game for a shaman . you hit that regrowth and start slowing and healing . that in itself is great. but then the adds come. you take you massive HP and AC and take that add off the tank and pull him to the side . while getting hammered you root him and go back for another , take it off the tank and while getting hammered from a unslowed beast you root  him away from everyone . i actualy have a hit key called &quot;ghetto mezzed&quot; ;)<br />
<br />
but yea. the groove you fall into and the realization that without you this group would either break up or move at a MUCH slower pace is SOOOO satisfying. the only grip i have is that it seems no one ever realizes the abilities we have. no one realizes how much im doing for the group when im doing that and canna'n like a mad man every chance i have to breathe, neve rletting my health get full cause im always maximizing my mana. oh well. life of a shaman.  im not complaning. keeps the moron out of the class ;)</div></div><hr />

I've been second fiddle shaman almost every night for the past dozen levels or so. What does it for me, is being part of a group that loves to push it. You'll eat a few deaths, but at least you'll die happy :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">&quot;re: My specific group: It consists of: 54 Necro, 55 Shaman, 55 Druid, and 52 Shaman (Me). &quot;<br />
<br />
Likely roles:<br />
1) Primary healer<br />
2) Puller/MT (indoor only, pull with EBOLT), let the 55 shaman buff and heal and slow<br />
3) Ghetto CC, root adds away from group and get them ready using malosi for the 55 shaman to slow, then back off and BU heal/DoT<br />
4) If things are going down faster than a sure thing, then DoT damage will never be fully mana efficient and without the proper gear melee will never outdamage your JBB, AND your JBB at 35 DPS isn't really good enough to earn you your spot in that group, then supliment damage with the mundane stuff, alacrity guest tanks and regrowth the group (especially the necro THEN JBB everything).  This will earn you your keep as you are helping the 55 shaman hold his mana for pulls keeping the pulls faster.  This is really only usefull till the 55 shaman hits 56 and gets group regrowth and celerity or your druid gets a velious BP.</div></div><hr />

That's your problem right there! Seriously... if that group in The Grey can't even kill one poor Ranger or at least make him scream like a girl... you're not working hard enough!<br />
<br />
Making sure there's always a mob there to kill will do one of two things.<br />
1) Make everyone freak out - my favorite (ADD! ZONE ZONE! EVAC! OMG! PST!!!)<br />
2) Run the other poor Shaman out of mana.<br />
And if you want to make things really hectic<br />
3) Let you bust out your ph4t rain spells!<br />
<br />
Also, 96% rezzes are cool. They let you do something stupid.</div></div><hr />

haha amen to that. <br />

   My typical group is a friend of mine 2boxed with his 56 sk main and 50 shaman and me with 58 shaman and 58 warrior. I have my group buffs so i get those out of the way. I think he gets the feeling his shammy isnt doing enough since he doesnt need to buff. Just the fact he can take care of the healing for the most part while i am dealing with the pull and adds and when things start flying i dont have to worry as much about healing him and i can slow and rootpark all the adds and he can concentrate on the killing. He ebolts and i epic now(yay) and bon. I haste our melees and he hastes the pups. Dot stacking will in my eyes be sweet. My friends in guild we hang around together alot and can have 4 shaman around at one time..though usually 3 at the same time but once in awhile 4. Dot stacking going to make things nicer for us all. Heck even in my normal group i will like it if they can do it. There are times were 2 ebolts would work just fine and i wouldn't have to use the mana on bon. <br />
<br />
<br />
   Anyway bottom line is i have fun with my friends regardless of the class make up and we just do what we need to do. Guess i posted twice becuase i feel strongly about if your grouping with friends and having fun can make any combo work for exp.</div></div><hr />

Last night I did another guild group in the Grey, and I realized why I was feeling a bit let down before.  Last night's group was 49 monk, 52 Rogue, 53 Magician,  56 Paladin and 52 Shaman (Me).   I realized about 20 mins into the group that if I left, the group was breaking up - No healer, no slower = no group.  Wow, what a feeling.  I was working my butt off, healing, slowing, root parking, etc.  And it was extremely satisfying.  <br />
<br />
I guess at lvl 52 I'm starting to get to the stage where I can make a signifigant impact on a group (67% slow, 580pt heal) and in my close group of friends, neither one of those abilities is super-critical.  <br />
[/i] <br />
<br />
And that is indeed a great thing, when you fully realize just how much you bring to a group.<br />
<br />
But, you have to keep on guard, and not fall into the rut of thinking that's all you can do...  which leads to questions like your original, about feeling useless because there's another higher level shaman doing all the 'important' stuff.  I think it's a stage we all go through - the important thing is to look at other options we have available, instead of leaving because someone else has 'replaced' you.</div></div><hr />
