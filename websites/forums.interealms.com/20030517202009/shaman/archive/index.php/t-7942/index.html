As you can see, my bracers just plain suck for stats.  However, the effects are just too juicy.  I know that i could theoretically just wear good bracers most of the time, and swap in the JBB when I want to nuke with it, but I think that would be a huge pain in the ass.  I don't use my jbb CONSTANTLY but I use it a lot in exp groups.  Whenever I am too lazy or too late in the fight to nuke I just click it a few times.<br />
<br />
=\</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for bracers, you could get Wolf Callers. AC 16, 2 dex, 7 wis, 20 hp, 15 mana (cast Ultravision). That's better than what you're wearing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I wear an Artificer's Ringmail bracer and a Barbed Rubicite bracer.  I haven't used my JBB in about 2 months I think. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Baz wears the jbb alla time - well, except for maxing out resists on raids.  Even then, will put it back on to nuke the fire based mobs.<br />
<br />
but I am so non-uber it is my best bracer if I wasn't nuking with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I wear one kael bracer and JBB all the time.  If I ever kill drusilla and get my chords, I'll probably take off the kael bracer for the chords unless I'm raiding, it's just too easy to click some free extra damage to not want to wear all the time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Still wear mine a majority of the time because I forget to swap it out when I am not nuking.  I have found myself trying to cast ultravision on the mob from time to time though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bazoom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I use it for all exping, but normally trade it out with a Barbed Rubicite bracer for raiding.<br />

/bow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>TalgurenXev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I wear a supple scale armband and JBB as regular gear.  I even have a barbed rubicite and velious quest rotting in the bank.  I just like the effects.  I like being able to slow while a mob is inbound with the extended range on the supple scale.  I also epic dot and jbb nuke everything as most stuff is dying before a regular dot becomes efficient and our regular nukes are mana hogs for the damage they do.  I alternate in regular nukes when my mana bar is looking too full.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I usually have my JBB and Bracelet of Sense equipped.  I like to keep JBB handy at all times in case something unexpected happens and I need some quick manaless firepower.  When I'm hunting for exp and using dots I'll trade my Coldain Military Wristgard for the Bracelet of Sense and keep the JBB for doing extra damage.  Only if I'm on a raid where I am definitely not going to need to DD, where I'm taking a big beating on a regular basis, or where everything is highly resistant to cold will I switch the Wristguard with the JBB rather than the Bracelet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Still love the JBB.  <br />
<br />
If I'm FOM I'm clicking it.  If there's nothing to kill I nuke my guildmates just to annoy them.<br />
<br />
Oh, and it has to be the visible bracer too...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I was debating selling it the other day, but the benefits of barbed rubicite (about the best I could get), then I can across another one of those fights where the JBB came in real handy again. I might bag it sometime soon since it seems I'm using it less and less often, but I don't think I'll ever sell it. <br />
<br />
The same goes for my other bracer, the Coldain Military Wristguard. Unless I luck across across something with affliction eff. 4, that one isn't going anywhere either. If I had to choose between it and the JBB, I'd wear the Coldain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Wearing JBB and Coldain military bracer in regular configuration, bracelet of sense for resist.  I'm thinking of adding the +15 sta bracelet to replace the VBD bracer in my resist kit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jagara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">never take it off.....the DPS it adds far surpasses a few hit points...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I find JBBing reduces my DPS at this stage of the game... I use nuke spells and Canni back up, I still have more mana than anyone else in the group after doing that and crank out considerably more damage than I would by JBBing.  I have Torpor and a horse, but no Can5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Anos |phattie|</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Use it all the time (exp/solo)..but i swap it out for raids...it is never used cause i have too many other  things to do...healing / dotting / nuking etc etc...<br />
<br />
So it depends on where u are in your game really</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Plodding along at 61 here..<br />
<br />
I shuffle between Wolfcallers, Coldain and JBB depending on mood.<br />
<br />
I use the JBB as 'filling' mainly, when I'm waiting for torpor to catch hp up before canni5 etc, I do most of my damage mainly through bane and the 54 poison nuke or torrent in xp groups.<br />
<br />
JBB is good when I'm in a lazy/social group and actually want to talk and xp ;) I used to use it all the time many moons ago in my pre-torpor days ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I haven't even used mine in a long time - I'm considering selling it.<br />
<br />
I find I can do a lot more damage in an exp group by nuking or dotting (depending where I am fighting of course), or possibly even melee. Between Righteousness, the Cloak of Flames, and VoG, I am probably (I say probably because I haven't parsed it) putting out more damage than clicking the JBB, and (this is the important part) I'm having more fun.<br />
<br />
It just depends on the group. Some groups I pretty much just slow and dot/nuke. Some groups I have to constantly take up the slack healing or something.<br />
<br />
Haven't used it in a long time though... I can't spare the hitpoints really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I still use mine now and again so I always keep it equipped.  Aside from wolfcallers, I haven't had access to a 2nd bracer that I felt was an upgrade.  Once I get Cann5 I might consider dropping it, but not bloody likely.  When you don't have something is when you figure you need it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Hail,<br />
<br />
Thanks for posting this question.<br />
<br />
I've had the JBB for a long time now.  I used to use it ALL the time.  <br />
<br />
Now I'm raiding more.  I finally made Oracle.  I generally don't have 8 seconds to waste on a 263pt dd after the time I've debuffed/slowed the mob before it dies.<br />
<br />
I'd much rather cast Torrent or even Ice Strike.  If the MA has enough aggro capability, I'll toss in Bane.<br />
<br />
Soloing, I'm sure I'll still find it useful. <br />
Now I've finally filled out the critical spells in my book,  (Malo/Torpor) and last night I finally picked up my CMW.<br />
<br />
So I'm debating bagging the JBB and wearing the CMW to complement my Artificer's Bracer for normal wear.  Haven't decided what I'll do for sure.<br />
<br />
JBB has solid resale value, so no harm in holding onto it awhile longer. :D<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I was just thinking about this last night.  I have found myself bagging my JBB more and more lately.<br />
<br />
My bracers selection is JBB, Wolfcallers, Coldain Military Wristguard and Bracelet of Fortitude.  For best stats I go Wolfcallers/Fortitude.  The combo I find myself wearing more often these days is Coldain/Fortitude.  I fight a lot in slow mitigating areas and so the extra duration from the CMW is really nice since I have to use retarded low level slows with short durations.  And the extra ticks on my dots are nice too, since I don't have any of our upgrades, or ancients.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I find the JBB to be entirely too slow on DPS to be using anymore.  A cleric can proc three or four times in the same time it takes me to click that bracer.  A rogue can backstab twice for 1k+ dmg.  A warrior can deal over 1k dmg in pure melee.  My DOG can outdamage that for heaven's sake!<br />
<br />
And the real kicker is this:  I have plenty of mana to toss a Bane, a Torrent, and perhaps another nuke each and every fight.  Bane = 1600 dmg = 6 JBB clicks.  Torrent = avg 1100 dmg = 4 JBB clicks.  Mobs just don't live longer than 5 JBB clicks, so if i resort to using JBB, I cut my DPS in HALF.  Not being a fan of halving my own DPS, i've finally bagged my JBB.<br />
Using Coldain Military Bracer atm for the Ext. Afflic. III effect. <br />
<br />
I'm currently 63.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">JBB pfft</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I still use the JBB now and again.<br />
<br />
I never take off my Coldain Military Bracer as I like having Malo/Slows/Roots last a bit longer.<br />
<br />
Normally I have it equipped and click it now and again.<br />
<br />
I'm finding my Bracelet of Sense is being used for Tradeskill gear(!) or for resists so I may sell it or trade it for a Bracelet of Fortitude.<br />
It is nice to hit 270 Wis in tradeskill gear though!<br />
<br />
When I used to duo with my rogue I'd sit on horse back and click it in between cana's unless I was getting LoM and needed to get more mana to hold taunt.<br />
Dont really duo now that I have PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I use my JBB when soloing but never raiding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I still put mine on in some solo situations, but mostly root n' rot mobs now because they hit too frikkin hard to make going head to head with them efficient.  I have prolly used my JBB more for faction work than exp in the last few months.</div></div><hr />
