<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>TPFKAFaern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This may be pertinent to Kedge and BW only, but I'll relate my two experiences with the new &quot;collision&quot; mechanism.<br />
<br />
Running my Enchanter in BW, ran into a tree and bounced straight back. Well I had numlock on and watched for about 5 seconds (easily amused, albeit for a very short period fo time) as my Enchanter would hit the tree, bounce straight back, then run into said tree only to bounce straight back again.  Hmm interesting.<br />
<br />
PL'ing an alt in Kedge. Now for those who have fought in Kedge you know that the Impalers, Lancers etc will push you back some. So you stick yourself in an 'L' corner and fight there.<br />
<br />
Not anymore.<br />
<br />
Not only would my Bard (current Pl'ee of choice) get bounced off the wall, there was some sort of odd rubber band effect between him and the MOB.<br />
<br />
I got bounced around like a Superball.<br />
<br />
To further complicate things when hit (and not necessarily stunned) I would get turned up to 180 degrees.  Very odd and a definite pain.<br />
<br />
Now my guild is young, but one of our techniques is to stick a warrior in a corner, have the MOB FACE said Warrior and said corner and everyone else beat on the MOBs back. Not sure how this will work with the new DX9 and &quot;collision&quot; detection system.<br />
<br />
Anybody else notice anything unusual?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tebion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">having that 180 degrees issue too<br />
is really fun when you are only shaman on a raid where pulls come from all sides and you always have no idea you are looking when you turn around  :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The pin the Mob in the corner against the tank does not work in a lot of cases any more. Makes it especially fun against mobs with a directed AE that you are trying to avoid hitting the melee at all costs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wynterfyre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I was in N Ro after an adventure with my shaman yesterday evening and I initially couldn't approach the tent with one of the adv merchants. I would walk up, then bounce back, walk up at a slightly different angle then bound back. Did it 3-4 times, then came at it from a completely different angle. Only then was I able to approach close enough to activate the merchant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gabus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">We were having issues corner tanking in BoT on Tuesday. Sure hope that problem is solved by next week. Additionally, we had issues with people on horses (especially drogmors) falling through walls.. and subsequently the world.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I was in PoW by the sharks, and was swimming out of a tunnel surrounded by 2 rocks.  I kept getting bounced back from the rocks like a yo-yo.  I finally had to swim up to the top of the tunnel to get out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Spite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I was in Iceclad last night with my vah shir, and couldn't get up onto the skiff that zones to NRO.

<br />
Oh, and if you're persistent enough, you can swim right through the wall in Hydrotha's Room placing you outside the &quot;normal boundaries&quot; of the zone, and free to swim anywhere, even down to coir's lair!<br />
<br />
Last but not least (I know this works as a barb in almost all zones with models off) shrink yourself twice, face into a wall, and then cast greater bearform and run forwards - instant &quot;fall through the world&quot;. good times in PoTactics :\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Krenk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah, great job on the new test code for EQ2's engine. Love being a PAYING beta tester for SOE.<br />
<br />
Changing to wolf form (bearform or other) has always been a way to view the dungeon areas around oneself by sticking one's head through the dungeon walls. I guess they showed us cheaters eh!<br />
<br />
I'm not logging on anymore. EQ isn't even a game now, it's an experiment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">the getting bounced back thing is really annoying. I don't like the new engine, in part because it took me 3 days to get abck online, but also because of the bounce back thing, the lag etc etc. I'm not playing eq2, and had no desie to beta test it, but those a-holes at sony are making us all beta it anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Piwacket</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I also hat the targeting problem :mad: I am trying to level an alt and cannot target some of the mobs :mad:  It is bad enough that I have to use my son's computer till I can get another video card ( and a new motherboard and more ram) for mine :mad: I like the stars and all, but was it worth it for the problems they are having? NO<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I had a fun one.. I like to bank in oggok, less begs for buffs than pok, and I sometimes find newbs running around and buff them, because they look mostly naked, and don't beg for buffs, just go on their merry way killing those snakes and bats.<br />
<br />
Anyway.. running through oggok hit a tree, and go careening back.. ok no big deal I won't hit the tree anymore.. keep running go through the tunnels, bounce around a bit inside them.. finally running along the cliff towards bank .. my arm touches the wall and it shoots me off into the pond. *** :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">targetting thing sucks also. Couldn't target crap earlier today when i was trying to slaughter mobs that were non agro to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yesterday, I zoned from PoT to PoK via book, took a little step forward and fell through the world. I could see the buildings and so on above me. Judging by the OOCs, quite a lot of other people had a similar problem. I ran around a bit out of curiosity before I gated back out, but it seems that the PoK zone boundaries go a fair bit beyond the bits you can get to normally. :)<br />
<br />
Corner tanking and wall tanking doesn't work so well any more. One mob fell through the map, summoned the tank, then warped back to his start spot and summoned the tank back again (fortunately). We recovered from that one, but it didn't make it easy for us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">heh try gettin diakus to spawn in PoStorms I was tehre last night the ONLY mobs that were not stuck in the walls were the stationary mobs now I know this has always been a minor issue but never have i see ALL non Stationary mobs stuck like this</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Mobs that touch a terrain feature will also sometimes get stuck.  Sometimes, they fix themselves - but sometimes they don't, until they are directly attacked/cast on, in which case they will warp.  Sometimes this warps them where they should be going, and other times they go to someplace more creative.<br />
<br />
For folks familiar with the Xegony encounter, &quot;someplace more creative&quot; means that the AE silence minis can and do mysteriously appear in the middle of the Xeg cleric team, even when &quot;engaged&quot; back where they belong.  It was ... exciting. =)  Pulled a win out of it, somehow, but ... yikes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>GandarrTheletch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Oh, and the zoning in under the world when you have levitate on is fun too!    Late last night had a guild group that wanted to farm mountain trials for stuff and I said I'd be right there, but I only had about 90 minutes cause it was so late.   I ran to the EC camp, ported to Nedaria's, ported to Natimbi .... and was under the world.   Couldn't get back up (i've falllen and I can't get up!) so I just gated back to PoK.<br />
<br />
Ran back to the EC ldon camp, ported to Nedaria, went under the world again!   Had to gate back to PoK version 2.0!   Friend said it was cause of having levitate on, ok no biggie, running out of time quickly but I'll do the run again without levitate on.<br />
<br />
Ran to EC ldon camp.... again .... no levitate on.   Ported to Nedaria's, Natimbi, no prob!   Cast levitate to head to Qinimi, or Bobimbi, or Shoshimi or whatever the heck these new zone names are .... forgot to take off levitate when zoning and managed to go under the world again!  Wheeee, night guys, I'm logging!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kiisekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Besides having the normal fall through the world, lag, and warping bugs I'm also encountering a strange one that I haven't seen mentioned. Random models just won't show up for me. Last night I couldn't see a guild gnome wizard or the female barb shaman spell vendor in PoK, could see other barbs and gnomes. If I managed to target the gnome by clicking on his name in group window I could see the target ring, but still not him. This problem is the worst when KoS mobs are like this (i.e. running through hate invis and being attacked by a rat that I couldn't see at all). I hope I find a fix for this soon... not just inconvenient, dangerous for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Uurgugg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Another fun bug is that if you die to a DoT from a MoB you seem to go into a mini death-loop (only actually die once tho it seems like more) you then have to /q out and in all likelyhood when you get back your corpse will be at your bind-point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The collision stuff sucks, but to tell the truth the new engine is MUCH better than I expected on first use.  Hell, they changed the entire animation system from vertex animation to skin-and-bone, and plugged it into a running world.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Exactly Gard.  Why do we have to be tolerant of SOE's inability to debuf their own coding before it goes live?  Isn't that what we pay our subscriptions for?  If I wanted to beta their new code, I'd have signed up for it instead of wondering where Xeg is going to warp to this time...<br />
<br />
The collision warping, mobs getting caught on the slightest of obstacles, melee push, falling thru the world are among dozens of problems.  Sorry, but I'm sick and tired of delays in raids because &quot;I fell through the world&quot; or &quot;I'm caught the DoT deathloop again.&quot;  or &quot;Where the hell did MobX go? Oh, MOB AT CLERICS&quot; or whatever.  If you have the patience to &quot;tolerate&quot; that crap, play on the test server.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, I've been still able to do this with no problems. Not sure how considering everything else I touch knocks me back.<br />
<br />
I haven't fallen under the world yet but it seems to happen to a guildmate once at least every half hour or so. Being bounced around on raids and having trouble getting up stairs while shrunk is getting extremley annoying.<br />
<br />
Another problem I encountered yesterday which I wasn't sure if it dealed with DX9 or not but I tried taking the boats to Abysmal from both Natimbi and Nedaria and while sitting on the boat waiting for it to leave it would take off and leave me sitting in mid air.</div></div><hr />

Their coding doesn't need to be &quot;debuffed&quot;, it's already weak enough.  Harharhar.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">There are a couple bugs that I've seen, but not mentioned here.  They aren't really related to collision, but seem relevant.<br />
<br />
One is that SKs can FD, still have plenty of health, but die, and find themselves at their bind, with all their equipment and no experience loss.  Its almost like they cast a gate.<br />
<br />
Another is that some people end up looking like Darth Maul when they activate their dark elf masks.  Their face is black with red stripes, while their ears, neck and the rest is the normal Dark Elf blue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I always laugh when people make a big deal out of their $13 and what they think it should buy.  You guys have a really high opinion of what can be done with $13 of subscription money.<br />
<br />
Compared to the high-reliability IT world, a few million dollars a month is peanuts.  And even in that world, the pace of change is so slow that no gamer would put up with it.<br />
<br />
And it's not just testing, it's FIXING the bugs, and testing the fixes, and redesigning when the bugs are due to design problems, and testing the redesign...  we're talking dozens if not hundreds of additional people to get it right.  And each additional person increases the communications overhead, thereby adding less and less to the organization's ability to get real work done (ref: The Mythical Man Month, by Fred Brooks).<br />
<br />
Face it, we pay toy prices and get a toy computer program to play on.  And like a toy, it's not as durable as the real thing.  If it's not worth your $13 a month to you, quit paying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Go laugh in another place Weissblau. If 13$ is just a pack of shi&amp; for you , good for you.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Well on the bright side, im glad im not the only one with this problem.<br />
Does anyone know if Sony is aware of all these issues?  They generally say they are aware of these issues, but i havent heard anything from them as of yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">You know, if it was just $13 one-time, that would be one thing.  But many, many folks have, over time, put out a considerable amount of money on this.  Consider if you started in 2000, you’re looking at 40+ months or roughly $500 to play your toy.  In addition, you’ve likely also put out approximately $200 in expansions, etc.  You’re at $700+ now.  If you had to upgrade your machine at all to play this game (I know I did, a couple of times) you’re probably close to $1,000.  So yeah, for the $700 I’ve paid to play, I do expect them to at least put out a product that isn’t broken.  I always love the “If you don’t like it, leave!” mentality.  So shortsighted: either accept their “fixes” and be (/cough) tolerant, or leave?   Nah, don’t think so.  I’d rather have them fix it and put out a good product, one that works.<br />

/gasp.  If that’s what it takes to do it right, then you do it.  That’s why you have a test server, sort of a continual beta test.  Do you really think it’s unreasonable to ask the programmers to fix people falling through the world, getting into continual deathloops, mobs warping completely across zones, and rubber-banding after a collision?  <br />
<br />
Gee, maybe it is….Hey, I have a Pinto I can sell you.  I know the gas tanks are designed badly and will cause a huge explosion if you’re ever in an accident, but that’s ok, we can be tolerant of that, right?  I mean, can you imagine all the testing, design, and additional people it would take to get it right?  Sure the scope of the hypothetical is vastly different, but the principle is the same.</div></div><hr />

&quot;On a long enough timeline, the survival rate for everyone drops to zero.&quot;<br />

&quot;I apply 'the formula.' A times B times C.  Where A equals the number of cars on the road, B equals the chance of an acident and C equals the cost of the average out of court settlement.<br />
<br />
&quot;If A times B times C is less than the cost of a recall - we don't do one.<br />

<br />
No, YOU do it.  And you WILL go broke.  It's just not economically feasible to produce a bug-free game, period.  $1000 invested over a 4-year game lifetime?  Maybe a lot to you, but in terms of software development costs, it's nothing.<br />
<br />
The Pinto is a PERFECT example of why EQ isn't economically worth making bug free.  When Pintos blow up, THEY KILL PEOPLE.  When EQ crashes, .... um... a few game addicts have to read a book or something.  If EQ killed people when it crashed, IT WOULD NOT EXIST IN ITS CURRENT FORM.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying I'm happy with the state of the game right now by any means.  But they are making things better - even with the hiccups it runs smoother on my Radeon 9600, so I'm willing to live with it on the hope that it will get better.  If you're not, fine.<br />
<br />
If you're staying in the Super 8, don't expect the service of the Ritz.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">No.  I won’t do it.  I’m not in the business of vending software.  They are.  And I don’t think anyone can disagree that they should provide code that should prevent players from repeatedly falling through the world, rubber-banding back to zone in’s, falling into a continual death loop because an AE DoT effect seems to carry with you even after death, or have mobs that can’t climb a hill, get stock on rocks and trees, and warp across zones at will.  A bug-free game?  Heavens, one can only wish.  I just want one that works!  <br />
<br />
I still don’t understand the “it’s cheap, so therefore you should expect a shoddy product!” argument.  That is completely tangential and unrelated to the point of the thread.  The point was, these bugs did not occur before – they shouldn’t be happening now.  If SOE wanted to upgrade the graphics engine, it should have done so without causing so much interference with gameplay.    SOE chose to implement the graphics upgrade, one can only guess at their reasons.  However, having made that decision on their own to implement the graphics upgrade, they should have taken the requisite care to ensure that it was done properly.  That could have been done on the test server to ensure that these bugs were discovered and fixed.  They essentially have free beta testers at their complete convenience. See how simple that logic is?  It has nothing to do with Super 8 motels.  /boggle.<br />
<br />
But great use of the caps lock key.  That was really persuasive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">It's fairly ignorant to come in to a gamer forum and tell them to quit playing if they don't like it.  I guess it's kind of like telling a cronic smoker 'Hey those things will kill you, you should quit'.    A lot of people have invested a lot of time into their characters and guilds and friends etc.   Would it be too much to ask that they not release such buggy code to the general public?   They have a TEST server, why do they never use it?  Why wasn't there more warning about the patch and more information about how to upgrade your system?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Interesting argument going on here, one I would like to sit and watch further but I just don't have the energy.<br />
<br />
The fact of the matter is that SoE decided to upgrade the graphics engine on their own timeline. There was nothing in the current gamestate that appeared fundamentally broken, or at least broken in such a way that only the new engine could rectify. If that had been the case one could almost understand the rush however there doesn't appear to be any reason for this to have been steamrolled out in such an obvious state of disarray. <br />
<br />
Elemental encounters can be quite tricky and require precision from several parties in the raid. They can also lead to messy CR's and long delays in gameplay. It's bad enough to have these happen to you through misfortune while playing, but to have them happen because an encounter that was working before the upgrade no longer works is ludicrous. Warping mobs, multiple spawns out of sequence, falling through the world, etc, etc. are all things that could, and should have been tested thoroughly. Of course, you can't stop bad players from intentionally spawning rings to wipe your guild but we are here to talk about poor coding, not poor gaming in general.<br />
<br />
Weissblau, you are arguing that EQ is cheap and we shouldn't concern ourselves with bugs. You have selected a phrase from Serepi and claimed that to follow it would make SoE broke...... Are you quite sure you understand software development? I do not mean this disrespectfully, I ask because the 'Mythical Man month' has no bearing on this discussion. It is feasible to aim for a bug free game, and it should be one of the four main goals in developing any software program. It is entirely feasible to have a QA team test all scripts and events prior to a release. It's known as regression testing and if it has a name it must be a standard somewhere. It is even more feasible to have a published timeline to your customer so that they would not have such a change thrust upon them.<br />
<br />
All in all your argument that people should leave if they don't like the bugs is entirely in poor taste and unnecessary. You may find the bugs acceptable but come back and let us know if you get round to doing Xegony in her current state and see if the whole experience is just as fun!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">There's no reason at all this DX9 &quot;upgrade&quot; should have been released.  There are CLEARLY things wrong with it.  If they couldn't see there were bugs, then they need to hire QA people who have sight.  Those Braille interfaces the current QA department is using seem not to do the job.<br />
<br />
There was really nothing wrong with the video before the changes.  Some people lagged in certain zones, but you could always cope by turning off effects and lowering the clip pane.  Instead of having a small percentage of people with video problems they have unearthed problems that affect the whole player base.<br />
<br />
Now mobs are warping all over, players are warping all over and everything is a complete mess.  It makes raids almost undoable at times because sometimes you can't corner or pin something since its dimensions cause collision problems.  Try having your tank walk a mob with AE ramp around.  It's not fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Are you quite sure you understand software development? I do not mean this disrespectfully, I ask because the 'Mythical Man month' has no bearing on this discussion. <br />
<br />
Actually I hadn't planned to post back to this thread, but I do want to address this point.  Yes, I'm sure I understand software development quite well, and TMMM does apply here.<br />
<br />
My point, apparently not made well, was that producing a game the scope of Everquest on the existing code base, and specifically making a major change like the graphics engine change, would require an immense team of people working together well to pull it off at a high quality level.  As the difficulty of the project rises, the number of people needed to pull it off well rises exponentially, and the time needed to train all those additional people adds greatly to the cost of the project.  At the size/scope of a project like the new Everquest engine it is already economically impossible to produce the product according to &quot;good&quot; software development principles with a goal of shipping bug-free or nearly bug-free product.  <br />
<br />
So I'm sure they resorted to what they could do - overworking their existing team.   I'm sure they were AWARE that there were bugs, but maintaining two engines in parallel is a LOT of work, and they can't hire additional people due to the ramp-up and training time (TMMM principles apply here).  So they switched over to the new engine as soon as it was practical and are no doubt working like slaves to get it up to the old standards.<br />
<br />
Part of the problem is the lousy code base they were starting from.  I would love the chance to develop a good code base for an MMP, one that is designed from the ground up with fault detection in place.  That would be a worthy project IMO, and it would be nearly unique not only among games but among virtually all large distributed software systems if it was truly bug-free or nearly bug-free :-).  But EQ was like any other game at the time it was developed - undermanned, and with an expected lifespan of about 2 years if they were lucky.  Here we are 4-5 years after and its on its third rewrite.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying it is impossible to write stable code, if that is taken as a goal from day 1.  But the EQ code is so old, unstable, and crufty that I think it's pretty amazing they managed to change such a major piece and keep the game up.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Actually, rereading what you said (Karshak) and thinking it over I kind of agree that the engine should have been held back for a few more weeks, letting the old engine ride with NO enhancements or bug fixes for that time.  There really were no urgent problems (that I know of).  My guess, poor communication between programmers and management, between QA and programmers, and/or between QA and management.  Somebody should have spoken up to derail the change but didn't either due to fear or due to wishful thinking.  However, having been in that boat myself I guess I'm just more tolerant of that kind of mistake than most :-)  But it's ok if I am a little lenient on SOE, the average post on the board more than makes up for that, hehe.</div></div><hr />

I encountered the exact same problem on my laptop.  Both Half Elf and Gnome models just don't show up.  If I log one in (say my 62 half elf bard), then his camera is some static cam over the zone and I can't see.  I can move around (if you look on the map the arrow moves fine) but I can walk through walls.  This is on my laptop, with DX9.0b and latest drivers.<br />
<br />
Turning on the Luclin models for those races fixed it.  I've petitioned and /bugged this a few times, I don't know if it will ever get fixed, I'm sure it will eventually.  Note that on my other two desktop computers I can still see those races without models.  As a matter of fact, I need to check what races I can't see without the Luclin models.  Soon as the server comes up.</div></div><hr />

No more corner pins to avoid aoes (MT gets bounced out of corner by the pushing mob), mobs leashing when getting in contact with the wrong spot on the wall, or MT getting warped to zone in random fashion.  All those old techniques of circle pin for positioning and frequent tank switches are suddenly in again :).</div></div><hr />
