Any suggestions would be great, Oh and another dark race is prefferable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nothenon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not much personal experience with this, but shadowknights seem to make very nice partners.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Iksar Monk.  You'll both have regen, making downtime considerably less; you'll both be Dark, so you can have a field day hosing down Qeynos guards; and Monk/Shaman make an excellent combo.  Shaman: stat buffs, regen, haste, slow, DoT; Monk: killing machine.  No contest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jilariz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Troll SK or Iksar Monk.  SK would be the absolute most versatile, Monk would be the most effective under the right (a lot of things qualify) circumstances.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Waredan Borealis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I am playing right now with a 57 Shaman and 56 Paladin. Great combo for undead. I can hold down most all duo exp spots.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You have to be evil to hose Qeynos guards? ah man i been doing it all wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Grouping with my ranger pal has proven VERY beneficial, but we didn't really start till our 50s.  He puts out insane damage, and can tank quite nicely, plus we can both heal to some extent.   Also, his having a TOlan Bp allows him more mobility than most melee.  he and I can go into planes duo, and deep in Hole, since he has a way out at the end of the night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I would say start a Troll SK.  Means you both start out in the same place, you have the same faction etc and an SK is arguably the best duo partner depending on what you wanna do (snare in dungeons is the nuts).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Alminah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yup, yup... make your friend go troll SK :)<br />
<br />
An SK is my favourite duo partner because our duo is more versatile than most others, and it works just as good at level 9 as at level 60.<br />
<br />
We can do fast flowing exp (not as fast as with the monk, but with a good 2hander SKs have pretty nice dam output)<br />
<br />
We can do bigger mobs (SKs can tank nearly as well as a warrior, and if things go rough he can FD just like a monk while I gate away - at 60 they have 2 FD spells to switch between so it's not like they have to wait 15sec for next try if first fails for a spellcaster)<br />
<br />
We can do strange mobs which isn't really viable with the others (SKs get snare and fear, they also get undead lull and some other goodies you don't need everyday, but comes in handy every here and there when you're out exploring the world)<br />
<br />
<br />
SKs have what the shaman lack, and vice versa, so the 2 classes complement each other perfectly. Only thing we miss in between us two are port and... hmm... I don't know what else ;) <br />
<br />
<br />
Plus... you both get to be trolls!<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I agree, Troll all the way baby. Or Ogre SK (pronounced &quot;Oger Shaddernite&quot;) if you want to look really big and dumb, as opposed to green and sexy.<br />
<br />
If you want to be really different, female oger shaddernite.<br />
<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shenlon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The only other option to what has been told here (both SK and monk make _GREAT_ partners) is a rog.  With you tanking the mob slowed (root aggro) and the rog goin off on a mobs backside (no riposte dmg to worry about, good backstabs) you can take a lot of things down QUICK, specially once rog is epiced.  That's the other nice thing about shm + rog, both the epics are easy (2 easiest IMO), while monk's actual EPIC fights aren't that much harder, getting the robes is a real bitch...and then the pipes  /shudder.  My monk is lvl 56 and was my main before I started a shm and I can tell you that monk + shm works well for efficiency.  SK has one of the hardest epics in the game.  Just some more food for thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Acutally, I NEVER epic with a rogue partner but only because that's 10 secs I could have JBB'd and lets face it, rooted, rotted and rogued = Dead Dead Dead ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
But I agree, Rogue partner is pretty frikkin amazing too, you just have to tank for them.  Sk's rock as well if you want a real tank and a monk would probably fall somewhere in the middle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Hermana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">My first year in EQ I was partnered almost daily with another shaman (both of us 50 most of that time) and I loved it.<br />
<br />
My last two years in EQ I was partnered with a Paladin and though I have friends of every class I have duo'ed with, that is the best combination.   But this, of course, is a Paladin at a higher level.<br />
<br />
Shaman can invis=Paladin invis undead<br />
Shaman can torpor=Paladin celestial healing<br />
Shaman can DoT=Paladin can stun/DD undead<br />
Shaman can buff=Paladin stack on those buffs (hp/ac)<br />
Shaman can root=Paladin roots (in case of adds)<br />
Shaman can get aggro=Paladin taunt (something a monk does not have)<br />
Shaman can die=Paladin can res<br />
<br />
Just to name a few reasons why I love a Paladin partner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'm biased towards having to say Paladin, because if they're well-played Paladins and Shaman can be virtually unstoppable--albeit until the Paladin gets a good weapon (Argent Protector, Epic, Narandi's Lance or some nice 2-hander out of CT or what have you) your damage output is going to be slow. <br />
<br />
In my opinion, tell your friend to play what they think they'll enjoy the most, not what's more efficient to play with a Shaman. EQ is about having fun. If I played for efficiency, I wouldn't be playing a Paladin. I play a Paladin because I adore the versatility of being a tank that can also heal and save both yours and the raid's ass if things go wrong. I've tried practically every other class to 20 and i haven't had as much fun with them as I did with a Paladin. If I wasn't having fun with Kryss here, I'd strip him down and use his equipment to make enough money to twink some other class and play them as my main. Besides, you can partner a Shaman with any other class and they'll tear through MoBs. <br />
<br />
Tell your friend to try out all the different races and classes that appeal to them and pick whichever one they think they can stand playing continuously, even when you're not there, over the next who knows how long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">As a troll shaman, you already have snare (if you follow Inny).   SHort duration, but stops runners dead in dungeons.<br />
<br />
Lots of classes work well with the shaman.  But when looking for the best combo, keep in mind that our strength is our absurdly powerful melee defense (slow, heals, buffs) and our weakness is comparably weak offense.<br />
<br />
Now think what EQ gives you xp for.  Hint: offense<br />
<br />
Your idea partner will have a lot of O.  Rogues have the most O, but that means you are the tank, which is ideal after torpor, but you lose a lot of canni mana before torpor.  Next offensive choice is the monk.  Ding ding.  In addition to being the #2 damage dealer, Monks are the #1 xp tank in the game, hands-down AND cheap to equip AND they have the #1 utility skill that you lack, FD.<br />
<br />
1-60, over a broad array of circumstances, monk just cannot be beat because they tank so well and kill so fast.<br />
<br />
My next choice would be a well-played necro, with your health regen spells they have insane mana regen and they do very very good damage and have a huge array of utility spells (mez! fd! heals! and much much more!  not available in any store! order now!)<br />
<br />
After monk and necro, rangers are like monk-lite with spells (though at the very high end they do comparable damage), then you get pallies and sks, where you give up significant damage and a little bit of tanking but gain a wide array of nice spells.  Mages are also not to be overlooked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Umgrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">My vote goes fer SK if yer pal wants to be eevil.<br />
If he can stand bein good, then prolly pally.<br />
<br />
The lower levels will be tuff with either, but as you go up in levels, the melee weapons available to SK/Pal are nuts.<br />
I partner with a 60 pally (roommate) alot, and we rip things up.<br />
<br />
Bards aren't bad when they hit 60 too.<br />
<br />
Heck any melee/hybrid would do good.<br />
<br />
One thing tho, till you get shrink you will be limited on where you can go (no small dungeons).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Monk</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Zabi Bbuzzin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I have a roommate rog that is great to partner with, i mostly tank unless lom and then i slow and he tanks it while i heal/canni.  Although the dam is not as high while he tanks it is still very significant amount of damage.  <br />
monks are great also as far as my exp goes with them, but a 60 rog can assasinate a lot of kills in chardok and recently found out, efreeti camp.  most of the time i dont even slow the mobs that are assable, i just give the rog avatar and root it.   <br />
it is also nice to see the rog inc message and then right after the message &quot;You gain party experience!&quot;.  Boom 32k dam and free exp.<br />
Cant say much about the hybrids as i havnt had much exp duoing with those classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Shenlon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">another plus to having a rog is that you can buy/sell anywhere</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Naarlina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Well, if your planning on playing out through till 60 there is one thing you're partner really should have if you want to try some of the big targets....FD<br />
<br />
Thus, SK or Monk (I've done both, they both work well, each having advantages over the other.  Bottom line, which would be more fun for the Shaman partner.  Personally I prefer monk because it's much easier to 2 box with the instant FD, rather than having to cast it)<br />
<br />
Paladin's make great shaman partners, but sucky pullers in zones where you need FD (western wastes is the prime example of this).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I would suggest  that any tank or a well played necro or bard is a good partner.  One thing to consider is that you will want to level up at about the same speed.  Now that being said, there are times in your shammy life (35-40ish) when you want to solo to max your defense and to build your playing skills up.  And just other times when only one of you is playing and soloing your shammy post 50 is a good thing! So, choosing a partner without much or any exp penalty is a good way to go.  With snare necklace human monk is probably the way to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>MuddMW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I two-box my ranger and shaman, works out very well. Their buffs/spells compliment each other's nicely throughout the levels.<br />
slows, reliable snares, couple types of regen later on, etc.<br />
Currently , ranger is 60 (has been a while) and shaman is 57.  With both of their buffs, can add a lot of ac and hps to both, and can get shaman's regen up to around 50/tick.<br />
<br />
When both are 60, cant think of a much better combo for taking things down- shaman can dot, tank and torpor, and ranger can stand back (out of aoe range if mob does aoe) and shoot arrows with AM3 and endless quiver AA skills, doing lots of damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Xatrei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">A good necro is my absolute favorite partner.  Second choice would be a bard, but since you say you prefer dark races, I'd probably go with an ogre SK or an Iksar monk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Cali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">My shaman is growing up with a wizard partner.  Simply because I wanted to try one and they do just fine together.   <br />
<br />
As a cleric I duo with a shaman a LOT.  I leveled up a warrior to 51 with a shaman partner, early RoK.  <br />
<br />
I think any other class only adds to the shaman capabilities.  So have your friend play what they want and I am sure you can make it work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Indoors, the best combo is shaman-SK. You can feign pull plus you have snare (darkness).<br />
<br />
Outdoors, and in many inside camps, there's no better combo than the 60 shaman (w/malo-torpor etc) and 60 ranger with AM3/EQ.<br />
<br />
Mudd: &quot;When both are 60, cant think of a much better combo for taking things down- shaman can dot, tank and torpor, and ranger can stand back (out of aoe range if mob does aoe) and shoot arrows with AM3 and endless quiver AA skills, doing lots of damage.&quot;<br />
<br />
True dat. There's not. You do massive damage to mobs, FAR more than a monk/rogue/wizzy with just about NO aggro. <br />
<br />
For ****s and grins me and a ranger friend decided to kill dragons in WW. Gratzi us on killing Mazi, Glati, Bratavar, Vitaela etc. He stood out of AE range, I pulled with Malo, slowed, healed myself while juggling clicking insta-clicks to offset dispells, JBB'd, and bam. Dead dragon. <br />
<br />
In FG, we kill shrooms in under 60 seconds. We can keep 3 patches clear, as in waiting for respawns nothing left to pull. That's roughly 17 spawns.<br />
<br />
In case no one noticed, given the right setting (geography) and right positioning (range to use a bow as well as mob not touching a wall), an AM3/EQ ranger with a great bow like a primal will make a 60 rogue with the tunare poker and a mrylo dagger look limp.<br />
<br />
Oh, track and snare is nice~ :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Hyacinth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Shammy &amp; SK are a great duo! My boyfriend &amp; I play a shammy/sk couple &amp; our toons have been partnered for months. We're now levels 50 &amp; 51 &amp; can still get great xp &amp; very very few deaths. <br />
Great combo that is alot of fun to play, also!  :)</div></div><hr />
