<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dargathi</div><div class="date">09-27-2002, 07:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">On may 8th VI added a whole messload of new Trade skills, that I hope to cover here is how to get your fletching to a level where you can make the coveted Blessed Feydark Thunderbolt.<br />
<br />
I am going to assume you have about 30k in cash to spend to get your skill to around 235 ish, the lowest it should be before you attempt your first BFT.<br />
<br />
Fletching skill 0 to 203 can be covered with any Silver tipped arrow, sure they are costly to make, but your skill can and will advance fairly rapidly.<br />
<br />
Skill 203 to 235 can be covered in one of two ways. Either you can buy the componants to make the Mithril Champions Arrows, or you can farm the materials to make Shadow Tipped Acrylia arrows. Both trivial at 255 plus, and so both are an option.<br />
<br />
All info on the mithril Arrows can be found &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_woodelf_cultural.htm&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;<br />
<br />
All Info on the Acrylia Arows canbe found &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_fletching.htm#arrows&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elladan</div><div class="date">09-27-2002, 11:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I do believe that Silver Tipped arrows only takes you to 182?  Somewhere in that region.  After that you have to go to Ceramic Vanes to get to 202.  Also, I believe that Scent of Marr can be purchased off of the same vendor that sells Bat Wings in EC.  Celestrial Solvent can be found on Toxdil (W. Freeport), and the Dwarf in the middle of Dagnor's as well.  There is also a Poison vendor in WK that may sell it (haven't checked him, but I do believe that he normall stocks the same items as the DE and Dwarf).<br />

ShadowHaven is a great spot to pick up most of the bought items, including the Solvent.</div></div><hr />
