<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Didn't know that. Still cannot really tell if it is the mobs increased ac and hps or if the damage, and not just the dps display is off.<br />
<br />
Roomate watched me kill a 50 and a 48 mob at the same time when I was 48 last night and he yelled at me for bitching. Well, I usd th wade through those like butter, now they take longer.<br />
<br />
Best crit last night on the 50-52 ursas in Azshara was like 1009, down from 1600 + the day before.<br />
<br />
We will see, I still fight well, but I need to fight magnificently to compete with the paladin hordes. I have but one unarmored life, they have 3 + and plate.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Melkiah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I noticed a hit with my dps as well, and mobs are taking longer to die than before. not too sure if that's a bad or good thing yet, as honestly the PVE side of the game is a bit on the easy side and could use some toughening up. I'd rather see them do it by tweaking mob difficulty than nerfing pc's. hopefully, any serious nerfs will be corrected/balanced as they are revealed. I think it's still a learning experience for them, so I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The only totem nerf I'm aware of is the 15 second cooldown on the snare totem - which was a good move, honestly.<br />
<br />
Pre-patch, I was able to slap down one of those totems every second, making it impossible for me to NOT be able to escape anything I aggro'ed - as they would either be snared and I could outrun them, or they'd turn and attack the totem, giving me a couple more seconds head start.<br />
<br />
As it is, with 2 points in ghost wolf, shamans ALREADY have a 1 second get out of jail free card.  This one was just a bit overwhelming.<br />
<br />
I can't speak for the rogue nerf, though I partnered with my man's rogue all last night and he was still shredding like crazy, including double crits for 250 each (we're level 30).  Was the nerf just to PvP, higher levels, or did we miss something?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It very well could be the higher ac and hps of mobs since patch, but it just seems like my damage number are too low. I know 1009 sounds like alot, but this is on mobs, on playes that is drastically reduced, I will be alliance fodder if I cannot hit hard, and hit fast.<br />
<br />
When you fight the alliance day after day, you will realize snare totem was not overpowered whatsoever.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Another way you got nerfed (as did all other leather wearing classes), some leather armor items had their AC values decreased. I lost 40+ AC because of it.<br />
<br />
On the flip side though, I did think it odd that I could buy lower level items in the AH that had better AC than some of the items I could make (higher level items in the Expert Leathercrafter levels). Not the case now, at least with some of my gear. Though now I'll have to spend the $$ and time finding all of the components I need for those crafted items just to get back to where I was pre-patch.<br />

I cant believe an ex-monk would say this...heh<br />
<br />
It amazes me that a few relatively minor changes surprise you.  This minor DPS change isnt even in the same ballpark as SoE's monk AC nerfage...<br />
<br />
Also, from what i can tell, the chief difference seems to be due to the AC/HP changes...rogues are still shredding damn decently in PvP, though some of their special attacks seem to be failing a bit more...<br />

play on a pvp server do you? This isn't about who can get to uber_mob_403 with 75 screaming guildmates in EQ, this really only affects me in the pvp realm, I need my dps to survive, my enemies have too many tools to hinder me.<br />

<br />
Well, my EQ accounts are still active, so I woudn't put that &quot;ex-&quot; there just yet :)<br />
<br />
It amazes me that a few relatively minor changes surprise you.<br />
<br />
I am shocked that you are amazed that I am surprised!  :D<br />
<br />
But seriously, it's not the DPS balancing per se that surprises me. It just sounds like Blizzard is only now discovering that the system that they put in place can and will be used in fairly obvious ways to improve your PvE and PvP chances.<br />
<br />
The first lesson in survivability that my Shaman discovered was that he could run through fairly heavily populated areas by simply chain-casting his snare totem on the run. The fact that Blizzard couldn't see the PvP and PvE ramifications of this brings back painful memories of Verant discovering in 1999 that a combination of SOW and snare could be used for kiting (!). Combined with the built-in resist adjustment on the Druids' main magic-based DOT line, Druids could easily take down low reds &quot;with little to no danger to the player&quot;. Imagine that!<br />
<br />
At the time (August 1999), a Verant designer stated in an interview that they had envisioned SOW as a purely travel and escape spell. If they had thought of its combat uses, he said, they would have made it unusable in combat like its higher level versions were. But it was too late to make such a drastic change all of 5 months after the release, so they just nerfed all DOTs. I remember reading the interview and thinking to myself, &quot;Gee, if they didn't see that coming, what else didn't they see and what other basic ability that we thought was 'working as intended' can they nerf on a moment's notice and by hitting something else entirely at that??&quot;<br />
<br />
And that is precisely the feeling that I get reading this patch.<br />
<br />
This minor DPS change isnt even in the same ballpark as SoE's monk AC nerfage...<br />
<br />
The Monk nerf was a complicated and often misunderstood matter. Post-nerf Monks still don't take all that much damage over time -- see Broda's parses here (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=5868). However, the damage that they do take is considerably spikier (due to their high avoidance and low mitigation) than the damage taken by the plate classes. And, as you will recall, the Monk nerf went live weeks before the PoP release, when mobs' ATK and average hit numbers were drastically increased, thus leading to mitigation becoming more important than avoidance. It doesn't help that my Monk can beat 3 PoV Golems in a row with little healing required when the fourth Golem will demolish the lizard before the heals can land. Finally, Luclin era itemization with high HP/high AC ALL/ALL items gave way to PoP+ era archetype-based itemization when plate classes got vastly more AC and, to some extent, HP on their armor. Hence the triple hit that Monks took in late 2002-early 2003 and that they haven't fully recovered from since. But hey, my mostly Bazaar-geared Monk can still tank anything lower than Tier 2 PoP as well as anybody else! :)<br />
<br />
Anyway, back to WoW. MMORPG balance is a complicated matter. Itemization, abilities, talent combinations, PvP vs. PvE balance, group roles, low level vs. high level characters, soloing vs. grouping vs. raiding -- there are all kinds of things that need to be juggled. If Blizzard's designers can't juggle the relatively obvious stuff mentioned in the patch, it makes me wonder how well they will cope with the more complex issues that they will face when the game matures. Not that it will necessarily make the game unplayable any more than it made EQ unplayable, but it is one reason why I will be keeping my EQ accounts active for a while :)</div></div><hr />

Now the download system is in place due to the number of people downloading at once.

Honestly man, i look at those forums and i see so clearly why they are the way they are. If they come in and keep replying they WILL be drawn into a flame war with people and blizzard doesnt want that. I can repsect it. Its not for the same reasons as SoE.<br />
<br />
I just wish there was a seach feature for the forum like on EQlive where you can track the blue text in all the posts. Its like 12 pages of idiosy for 1 or 2 blue posts and maybe 1 or 2 semi intelligent posts after that, they 10 more pages of stupidity.<br />
<br />
Seriously, people need to like get a back up hobby, it would help them a lot when patch issues come and let them see how they are obsessing over something completly stupid. If i cant get on ... oh ****ing well. I go do something else....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Izmalis,<br />

I am all damage, that is it. I should crush things compared to you, yes. However, caught, I am dead, whereas you can heal, immune, heal, and keep on going, it should balance out, yes. If you got a nerf to your multiple lives, would you not be upset? I have seen with my own eyes a 38 paladin take down level 44 rock elementals. Took him a while, but that isa feat I could never do.<br />
<br />
Who knows, might just be tougher mobs.<br />
<br />
Smithing does suck, it just is mine, mine, mine, and mine some more. I have 70 + thorium and truesilver, 140 + mithril sitting in the bank doing nothing, because I have no decent recipes and don't wanna waste it all just to skill up.<br />

But to reply to this negitive rep ... cause this is what i do ... So if you dont care about my reply, your warning is served.<br />
<br />
one sentence into your post and I realized how ****ing ass bitter you still are. I thought WoW was going to cure your cancer, it just migrated it. It isn't eq you hate, its sucking at online games you can't handle. Go ride a bike, with stabilizers.<br />
<br />
<br />
Its funny that you say im bitter. Im having the time of my life in WoW and not to toot my own horn but i think i did my own part if getting this section of the forum going when it was totaly dead.<br />
<br />
I just got done playing from 7 am to 5:30 pm cause i simply couldnt stop, i was having that much fun. That shaman class makes me giddy with delite and thats a accurate description of what i feel like when i play my shaman.<br />
<br />
As far as sucking as games, well i dont play to be good or bad, i play to have fun and if im not having fun i go catch some waves, study, watch tv, read a book, do anything but what im not having fun doing. <br />
<br />
Really the only bitter thing about me and gaming is pathetic losers like yourself that have no testicles and hide behind neg rep'n. Instead of being a real man you hide like a lil 5 year old girl surrounded by icky slimey frogs ( which are peaceful loving creatures ) and try to hurt other people. Well ya cant hurt me like that, you only make me laugh.<br />
<br />
All i can think is maybe i hit a lil too close to home on you on that one eh ? I bet your one of those people that bangs on the enter button pleading with the game to let you in for hours, then run to the forums and vent cause you cant get your way, huh lil pouty puss.  You so cute, like a lil kid. I guess thats why i cant get too mad and can only laugh at you, the kind of laughing that makes you sad inside.<br />
<br />
But hey, barring all that we as a forum can know this one thing. Your too weak to reply to this and show who you are. All you know is how to hide in shadows and throw rocks then duck away. Weak.  mmmm  what a accurate word...   weak, weakness, lacking of spine, void of testicles.<br />
<br />
To me it looks like your the bitter one cause instead of talking to me about what you disagree with me on, you chose to attack me with no face. Mean while im having a hoot talking about the game i love.<br />

Honestly man, i look at those forums and i see so clearly why they are the way they are. If they come in and keep replying they WILL be drawn into a flame war with people and blizzard doesnt want that. I can repsect it. Its not for the same reasons as SoE.<br />
<br />
I just wish there was a seach feature for the forum like on EQlive where you can track the blue text in all the posts. Its like 12 pages of idiosy for 1 or 2 blue posts and maybe 1 or 2 semi intelligent posts after that, they 10 more pages of stupidity.<br />
<br />
Seriously, people need to like get a back up hobby, it would help them a lot when patch issues come and let them see how they are obsessing over something completly stupid. If i cant get on ... oh ****ing well. I go do something else....<br />
<br />
Lit, I agree with most of your points there. Except the one about downlaoding the patchs, I did everything Blizz suggests and still my DL times for WoW are terrible. I know better service is possable, after all EQ does it (Most EQ patchs take me 10 min or so, but Blizz's lil 55 meg patch took me over 3 hours on my 1.5mbs DSL line) The use of the Bit Torrent system is done just to keep them from having to invest in a decent DL server setup.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Luckily it would seem this last patch produced some nice results as far as download options go. They put the most recent patch up on Fileplanet, which, even with their 50+ minute &quot;free download server&quot; delay time is still quicker than Blizz's BT downloader. Even so, I maintain the base montly subscription with them ($7.90) for other reasons, so I got to grab it from their premium servers for when I had to do a reinstall on my wifes machine this past weekend. Screw those incremental patches. I just grabbed the complete 1.21 patch and applied it.<br />
<br />
Hopefully we'll see more download options becoming available in the near future.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Does dual weild suck or what?<br />
I have a hunter and when he dual weilds (has an axe and a sword) even though both skills are maxed for the level he misses a LOT.<br />
I am seriously thinking about gettign rid of one weapon as a hunter i don't melee much if at all anyway :)<br />

<br />
DW has a big miss % added to your weapons, the reason rogues do so much better is we have talents which reduce it by 5%, plus individual weapon talents to further increase odds of hitting, plus talents to increase off hand damage.<br />
<br />
I am at a steady 17-18% miss rate right now fighting even level critters. Special attacks are much lower, evis is actually down to 3% miss rate for me.<br />
<br />
I am unsure if DW is a good thing for a hunter, warrior seems to do okay because of massive attack power anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Its free damage basically. They kept the miss rate high so that shield classes (including warriors here) wouldn't be gimped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I prefer dual wield over 2h any day. Maybe it's just skewed perception, but if/when I have to get involved in PVE melee, things just seem to die faster with DW over 2h. Not to mention my current 1 handers have nicer stats that add to my Agility, thus greatly improve my ranged combat damage prior to the mob coming within melee range.</div></div><hr />

that is not a quote made by me, what the hell are you talking about? You smoking crack or something? Am I missing something?<br />
<br />
Mil<br />
<br />
Your missing something man.  I was replying at first to your reply about the forums, then i moved on to make another rebutle to the rep bump i got.<br />
<br />
Had nothing to do with you mill, sorry if i wasnt clear enough on that mate.</div></div><hr />

Is that what you are looking?  Also, you can click the blue Blizz next to a thread's title and it will take you to the blue text in that thread.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, thnx man, i came across that the other day, actualy right after i made that post. Its not done as well as the EQlive one, but its better then nothing.  But actualy i figured out how to really avoid the whiners, just dont go to general. The calss forums arent that bad, just general is like a whine fest. <br />
<br />
<br />
But yea man, thnx.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Curugul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">DW spec is &quot;fixed&quot; now. I lost 20 something dps off hand and 7-8 mainhand now, I fight like crap in comparison to pre-patch. No way in hell will I beat anything but an injured caster on crack.<br />
<br />
Duel Wield was not changed at all this patch; They fixed a graphical bug which made the offhand DISPLAY more damage than it was actually doing.<br />
<br />
What did change was certain mobs (mainly things like Yeti's/Ogres) which had, oh about ZERO ac pre patch actually have AC.  <br />
<br />
Secondly, many outdoor mobs had their hitpoints increased.  <br />
<br />
I suspect your 'nerfed' rogue was a combination of the two, largely the first.    What mobs were you talking about when you compared the kill speed?<br />

Half the time you get stunned forever and lose.  I'd want them to be changed, just because it's annoying to fight them, but it would take the entire class being changed.</div></div><hr />
