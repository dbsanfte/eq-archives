<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sneed</div><div class="date">04-17-2002, 08:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So last night I was watching Groundhog Day (http://us.imdb.com/Title?0107048) and one of the scenes got me thinking. If you've seen the movie you will probably recall the scene where Bill Murray (http://us.imdb.com/Name?Murray,+Bill) is trying to orchestrate the perfect day with  Andie MacDowell (http://us.imdb.com/Name?MacDowell,+Andie) . However, after one day where he was nearly there and missed, each following attempted ended even shorter of his goal. What brought on the question was at the end of each of Bill's unsuccessful tries Andie slaps him across the face. This got me thinking about my own personal experiences. I cannot think of one time that I have ever been slapped by a female other than my mother. Perhaps women slapping men has just declined over time because our society is changing, or perhaps I've just been fortunate enough not to be smacked :)<br />
<br />
So fellas, have you ever been slapped by a woman other than your mother?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Micheall</div><div class="date">04-17-2002, 08:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, back in my drinking days I was slapped on a number of occasions as the booze loosened my tongue to the point of actually saying what I was thinking.<br />
<br />
Onstage in a few plays when I was acting, part of the show though, not a person really angry at me.<br />
<br />
Maybe once or twice otherwise, but its been a long long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myrea</div><div class="date">04-17-2002, 09:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do you remember in &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; where she asks where guys learn to hit a woman so it feels like your eye is going to explode?<br />
<br />
My first boyfriend in college slapped me like that. I was in the process of questioning his parentage, his manhood, and many other things after I walked into his room and saw him in bed with one of his ROTC &quot;buddies&quot; (female, thank goodnees for small favors). Well, you won't sleep with me so I've got to get it SOMEWHERE.<br />
<br />
The black eye I gave him only lasted for about three days, and his nose wasn't REALLY broken, just dented a little, I think. I do think he and his date remembered the knee to the groin for a very long time. :p And that's nothing compared to what I talked my male gaming buddies OUT of doing to him when they saw the bruise on my face.<br />
<br />
A piece of advice - don't hit me, I only run home crying after I've gotten even, and then some.<br />
<br />
Another piece of advice - DO teach your daughters how to land a good punch. You never know when they will need it.<br />
<br />
Slapping is for wusses.</div></div><hr />

There are a multitude of reasons why someone would get slapped other than treating a women with disrespect. Try not to limit it to just that.</div></div><hr />

I think it had an awesome story line and all of the actors played their character to a T.  I have seen it about 20 times and I will watch it any time it comes on cable.  Great movie.  =)<br />
<br />
I have never been slapped by a woman because I was always taught to treat a woman like a lady.<br />
I DID see a co-worker nearly get his head slapped right off of his neck one time.  He asked a very nice looking young lady at a club if she would like to dance and she said &quot;No thank you.&quot;  He then said to her &quot;I guess a Blow Job is out of the question&quot;.  The smack sound reverberated around the room.  He left right after that and he had finger marks on his face the next day.  What a dummy.<br />

The only thing I could think of would be a misunderstanding, or even a setup. Someone tells her you did or said something that you didn't, she believes them and slaps you before you have a chance to defend yourself. I've seen that kind of thing happen on occasion...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, done right, slapping would injure/hurt more than a punch.  By far.<br />
<br />
One thing is, you do /not/ relax your hand when you slap, use your wrist for additional momentum.<br />
<br />
I've only been slapped once playfully by my girlfriend.  She won't be doing that again after about a two hour talk of why she shouldn't do it.  I think slapping tends to be more demeaning than injury, but that's just me.</div></div><hr />

Must be a paladin thing. Yes, I've been slapped. And slapping in a play counts, especially if you have just stolen your fellow actresses boyfriend for real and she figures this is how she is going to get back at you.... by forgettting her next line 30 times so we have to play the scene again. <br />
<br />
Also got slapped by a guy once, for suggesting that a girl was dancing with me because he wasn't man enough. He SLAPPED me. I think it proved my point.</div></div><hr />

Sorry, gotta call you on that one. Punching is done (if done with proper form) by connecting with the knuckles. Slapping is open-palmed. Knuckles have less surface area, therefore all the impact is being delivered into a smaller area. Aside from that, the hand has a tendency to extend back after impact whereas a punch has the arm behind it and the wrist is less likely to extend<br />
<br />
Now if you're talking about hitting with the butt of your palm, thats a whole other story. But if what you said were true, martial arts instructors would be teaching people the art of the ho-slap instead of punching through boards and concrete.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, hitting with the palm is definitely more damaging.  However, slapping tissue can definitely do a lot more pain.  Remember, breaking through boards and concrete, while coolooking, doesn't reflect how much you can hurt a person.<br />
<br />
Take for instance, an area of the body where the flesh is not very worked out, like some folks' tricep area.  Take a sumo wrestler for example.  I'd be damned if you can punch him hard enough to hurt him (well, there /are/ places you can, such as areas of the rip cage, lower jaw, &quot;sun&quot; spot to name a few).  However, bitch slap him upside the looser parts of the arm enough, you'll have him cringing.  But then again, you're not slapping with the entirety of your hand, you're slapping, in this case, with your fingers for the whipping action.  One should not slap with the palm though.<br />
<br />
And yes, my Wing Chun mentor taught us that.<br />
<br />
&amp;lt;edit&amp;gt;<br />
<br />
ah, I see where I made an error in my post.  The word &quot;injure&quot; does not necessarily translate correctly what I meant.  My bad on that, should just say cause more pain.<br />
<br />
&amp;lt;/edit&amp;gt;</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with Jaraxel, slapping is very demeaning.  It's supposed to be.  It's like putting someone in their place.  I am not endorsing anyone should use it at all, but that is the intent of it as I see it.<br />

As far as a man slapping a woman; this is one of the few things in life that truly angers me.  Under no circumstance is it allowable to do this.  I have never struck a woman, never will, and if I saw anyone doing so I'd go deal it out equally in return.<br />

Before I could try it again a woman I'd never seen before in my life slapped my face so hard my head spun around and I about fell off the chair. <br />

Ok, so, my boyfriend has sex with another woman, and I catch him IN THE ACT. I begin berating him for betraying me, by calling him a son of a female dog with an insuficient male appendage to interest me anyway, only not in such nice words. He slaps me so hard my face bruises within mintues and it feels like my eye is going to explode out of my head. And your stance is that he was perfectly justified because it's the 21st Century (Well 20th when that happened, 1989).<br />
<br />
I have never hit another person unprovoked - meaning unless he or she hit me first, but I WILL finish a fight if I have to. I don't agree that a woman has a right to slap a man for being disrespectful, but I can NOT respect a man who hits a woman who has not hit him first.<br />

It's a strength thing. One slap from him, and I was in pain for days. One slap from me would disappear in a few minutes.</div></div><hr />

You don't need much strength to injure some guy with a knee to the groin. ;) <br />
That's why my dad taught me to go for that. I'm 5'3&quot; if I stretch, and at the time, I weighed 112 lbs. He was 5'11&quot;, former football player and at least 180lbs of pure muscle.<br />
<br />
Even a big man had better be careful who he hits. If you strike someone, you'd better be prepared for them to hit you back and inflict at least an equal amount of injury on you.<br />
<br />
A woman, defending herself against a man who could take you unconscious in two hits is justfied in using enough force to disable that man, as far as I'm concerned.</div></div><hr />

Best bet us to bring your knee up like you are going to, then when the man moves to protect you stomp the instep of his foot with your heel... then sweep his feet out from under, kick, and run like hell. Be careful, he WILL try to grab your foot when you kick.</div></div><hr />

Just because he's &quot;bigger&quot; and &quot;meaner&quot;?  There're certain things I'd never do to a person in terms of injury or moves I've learned in my life, but women beaters, rapists is where I draw the line.  These are things that are reserved for people who dying is too good for them.<br />
<br />
But that's just the traditional teachings surfacing in me again :-)<br />
<br />
&amp;lt;edit&amp;gt;<br />
oh yeah... above does not include woman who started the fight and knows how to handle herself.  And if I ever hit a woman intentionally, I expect someone to hit me /really/ hard...<br />
&amp;lt;/edit&amp;gt;</div></div><hr />
