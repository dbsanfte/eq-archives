<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Blainn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can we just kill her just for the diary without turning in the ring?<br />
or is it triggered by the ring?<br />
<br />
We did this part already and just need the diary(dont ask;-))and would like to skip the Kirn part that we already did. <br />
<br />
Thx!@@!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think you have to turn in the ring, it trigger, also he part of the mage epic to so you probably can't kill him just for the diary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xahra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No.  The way all the epic turn-ins like this work, is the NPC is non-aggro.  You hand in the quest piece and the mob despawns, then respawns immediately, this time with the drop you need.<br />
<br />
For example, if you noticed, when you turned in the icon to High Scale Kirn, his pet disappeared...<br />
<br />
Common procedure is that if you can see Neh with the torch, and there's a mage that needs her, the raid is extended two hours.  Neh is killed, then everyone waits for her respawn so the questing shaman can do his/her turn-in.</div></div><hr />
