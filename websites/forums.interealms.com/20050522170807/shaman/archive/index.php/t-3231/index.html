<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>humburto</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just a question. I recently tried using this (v 2.22 and 2.21 didnt work), but when I got to the server select screen it quit on me after choosing my server. I made sure ALL my eq files are in the same file with eqw, and that is the only suggestion I have had so far. I am running windows xp which was another issue someone brought up. PLMK with any ideas you have.<br />
Thanks<br />

Try searching for eqw :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is 95% likely to be it.  Out of all the people i have helped get eqw to work, this has been the answer every time.<br />
<br />
To clarify:  Open your desktop properties and go to settings.  If your color depth is on 32bit, change to 16, and vice versa.  Your desktop resolution vs eq resolution does not matter.   I have played with all different combinations and they all work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Virdan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have played with all different combinations and they all work. <br />
<br />
Although I bet that running desktop at 800x600, and EQ at 1024x768 would be slightly counterproductive. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">hey humburto, does your eqw skip the patcher when starting up eq?<br />
<br />
make sure your files are all the latest patched versions...or else you could get &quot;You have been disconnected&quot; messages when loading to server/char select screens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>greatmilenko_00</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">most likly if your eqw is skipping the patcher, you need the command the run patcher first. This is what i did, i went to new and added a short cut and added this to it <br />
<br />
C:\unzipped\eqw\eqw.exe &quot;C:\Program Files\EverQuest\EverQuest.exe&quot;<br />
<br />
obviously your might be different it just depends on were stuff is installed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gothlips</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I know this probably isn't the place to ask this, but couldn't find a forum about it anywhere else. How do you use EQW? I downloaded it, unzipped it into my everquest directory, and just ran the program (made sure resolutions were the same). Now when I start the EQW, nothing really happens. It opens up a clear window that I can see desktop through. Am I suppose to then manually start Everquest?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Anomalos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If eqw is working, then when you open it up it'll look identical to EQ, xcept in a window.  First thing will be the license agreement to agree or decline to, and so on.<br />
<br />
http://www.hackersquest.org/boards/viewforum.php?f=12<br />
<br />
Those are the eqw boards.  Good luck.<br />
<br />
P.S.  DON'T unzip eqw into your eq directory.  It will find eqgame.exe on it's own.  Make a directory totally separate.  That has been known to cause problems.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  I just checked the boards and someone's having your exact problem.  Keep on that post, and JSD (just some dude, the guy who wrote eqw) will get to it.  If he doesn't, someone else will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gothlips</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Thanks doll =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>humburto</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I switched my color settings to 16 and it is running better, however, when I get to the password screen I can hit connect (the mouse works fine), but I can't type anything. This is when using v2.21. Earlier I was using 2.22 and i was able to type, but this is when I had all my other problems and it said that I had been disconnected. I have yet to get to the point to deal with that problem again. Thanks for all the help so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>humburto</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I got 2.22 and everything is working, but I don't really know how to use eqw. Is there a thread on how to multi-task. I wasn't able to figure out how to get the mouse out of the eqw box except by pushing alt-ctrl-del to get my task settings and clicking another window. Is there an easier way?<br />
<br />
Also since it is not running the patcher for me would it work to just patch if by running EQ normally?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">You can assign a key to toggle the mouse to/from EQ but I recommend using the ctrl-alt-del combination to get out of EQ and then choosing the eqw task in the task manager and then pushing the &quot;Switch To&quot; button.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sheylock</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">ALT+TAB is such a nice option to switch between windows :) just hold ALT down and press TAB, each press will take you to the next open window.<br />
<br />
Or if your keyboard isn't WAY too old you should find two of those keys with the Windows logo next to your ALT keys. Hitting them will open the START menu, another quick way of getting out of the EQw window.<br />

One press at the wrong time and you are screwed especially if you are playing a game in fullscreen mode that doesnt handle switching back to the desktop very well. Alt+tab works with EQW?</div></div><hr />

Rip the windows keys off...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Sheylock</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I am ALT+TABing all the time to switch between my windows, works like a charm for me. Heard their 'might' be a few problems with Windows XP though, so I am not promising anything :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">There is a problem with alt Tab and windows XP when using EQW, but Just Some Dude has posted an article (http://www.hackersquest.org/boards/viewtopic.php?t=2299)  on how to fix it.<br />
He also plans to fix it in the next version, and he's working on the bug that causes EQW to crash when you use the new  user interface</div></div><hr />
