<br />
My guild has cleared VT about 11-13 times. Not once has Aten dropped a BP MoJ. My question is this.  Has any other guild who is currently clearing VT had the same results or has all the other servers had a MoJ drop? Just curious cause it is actually starting to get annoying as we close on the release of PoP to have not had one drop as of yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tide and Stars both killed emp but not enuf keys yet to do anything in there..<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Vulgarr Disruptor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">One from each of our first four kills, iirc. Then two torches in a row, and 2 Leggings in a row most recently.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Brakums</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">um if my magelo is made up lets meet ingame glovian stupid druid</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Cantiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Thnx for replies guys. Its funny you have had 4 MoJs but no Ageis'. We have 5 shields drop a wristband and a couple of masks and torchs and one pair of LoJs. Some very odd drop rates then.<br />
<br />
Jaradis, i notice you have Floating Rune. I reallllly wish they would have made the Judgement line of armor in the same color lines as the floating rune. My bracer of the silent star matchs perfect.<br />
<br />
For those that don't know the color of these items is like a realy deep purpleish black with red acents to it. Really nice looking IMO.<br />
Judgment items are a green color.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Interesting seeing as your profile says 60 shaman with MoJ.<br />
<br />
Seeing as no shaman were around I guess that means you are not a shaman :) <br />
<br />
Good gear I guess for a non-shaman :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>the dr00d</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">one fact is all you need to know<br />
<br />
1) luclin server has not killed aten ha ra<br />
<br />
but do you really think we would let some unguilded person who isnt a app loot a power source from wraiths to make a VT key, much less loot a MoJ. especially when non of our clr or dru have(since our shams werent at our imaginary AHR kill)<br />
<br />
i have one suggestion for you sir, go find another forum, make another account and make stupid posts there and stop bothering these people<br />

hey dumbass, i meant no other active shamans... i was on the inactive list <br />
<br />
shame on them for not reading your mind:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Chukzombi Astrocreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">If you're going to fake a magelo why do it with items that are extremely rare like brain and ssra shield.<br />
You dont even have a shissar ring  bur you list that crappy 9 ring with dain ring in inv. uh huh. try again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Thing i find funny is the locust lure in his bag in his inventory. Why would a shaman carry around a rogue only weapon?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>DorianBrytestar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">lol, busted so hard...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Cantiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">God, call me frustrated but this is really getting stupid. My guild killed Aten again last night for the 15th or 16th time and CTV guild on terris, killed aten once or twice and she still has not dropped a MoJ. This is really starting to wear on me. I wouldnt stand a chance to get this thing against some of our clerics (Im fine with that, i just want it to drop) but 18 kills on TT and still no BP! grrrrr.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Havanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Wow Jaradis, massive props on your Magelo link. It's the most interesting thing I've seen ever. Very awesome, haha. Nice gear too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Lucann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Triton has had 1 Drop of the Mail</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>CamaenMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">We have killed Aten a lot and have had a grand total of only 2 MoJ’s drop. I guess its just the fact that the number of items on her WIS caster loot table is pretty large and the fact that you only get 1 item per kill. That said, seems the bracer and perhaps the mask have dropped the most off all the judgment items.<br />
