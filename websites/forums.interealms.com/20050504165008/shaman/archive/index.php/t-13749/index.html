<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>uglytobone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is there an upper limit on how much you can be hasted by spells and item effects? If you have 2 haste items do they stack or do you just get the larger of the two haste increases?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can stack one item haste with one spell haste, for a combined maximum of (I think) 100% haste. For this purpose, bard songs count as spell haste. Bard songs may appear to stack if sung after the haste, but this is just to allow the non-haste components to stack. So whilst both buffs are there, you only recieve the best individual haste. The haste from two items does NOT* stack.<br />
<br />
This is all then thrown out the window by a few bard songs and the odd item or self-buff, which WILL stack with another haste spell/song, and can even break the haste cap. The most common example is War Song of the Vah Shir which adds 25% more haste. They are the exceptions to prove the rule :)<br />
<br />
I'm no expert on it though, so someone please correct my mistakes :)<br />
<br />
* I think the eye patch of plunder has a haste effect that does stack. I might be wrong...check Lucy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There is a higher level bard song that can push you over 100%, I just don't know what it's called atm ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Eyepatch of plunder doesnt stack, its just the same as regular old spell haste.<br />
<br />
Its Best item haste (EG an fbss) + Best regular spell haste (EG Swift like the wind) + Best Overhaste (EG Warsong of Vahshir or Rizlona's call of flame) + Special case haste (The only example I can think of being Bow haste from a quiver).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Bow haste from a quiver count as item haste. It's only taken in account in those cases where it's better than the best, 'general usage' haste available from another item. And only for bow usage, of course.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From what i've read quiver haste stack with all other hastes including regular item hastes. Not a ranger but thats the way I understand it.<br />
<br />
As far as special hastes goes I know rangers have an AA that adds attack and haste that from what i've read stacks with everything and is goes above haste cap variety.<br />
<br />
I'm sure if your really interested in either you could pop over to the rangers glade and they'd know =)</div></div><hr />
