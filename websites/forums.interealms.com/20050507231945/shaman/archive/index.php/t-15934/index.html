<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ThatDumbGuy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello, I've been gone for the last six months, so I completely missed Ykesha. Just wondering if there were any good PL spots, as I'm working on an SK atm. If it matters, he is heavily twinked, and right now is level 24. I'm looking to get him up to 43, light blue to me. 65 shaman if it makes a difference. Thanks in advance for your input, and if you have any other non-LoY spots, I'd love to hear them. I did the paludal thing, and he's currently working on miners in CC, as I need the velium anyhow. They give about 4 percent a kill, and are wusses even before the cripple.</div></div><hr />

During my brief stint back to twink a frog I got the frog up to mid 30s in there very fast... and the good thing was there was no competition as it was usually pretty empty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>powderfdb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Start on the beach in Gunthak, as you get higher make your way towards Dulak Harbor, by lvl 40 or so u should be ok to enter Dulak. Took a cleric from 40 to 44 in about 4 days, working with a 61 warrior. Try the boats also great loot with the BDs, words, pp and runes. At 44 you might want to try the lava entrance to Nadox. Just a couple ideas, I just recently tried LoY and the exp is great for lvl 38 and up, plus some good loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Goku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">24 would be too low for loy and the mobs hit hard and fast dont think theres a xp bonus there either</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I took my Warrior out to Gunthak at 38 and have been soloing on the beach for a couple levels there now -- while fully twinked you MIGHT be able to handle it, I'd wait until 30, or just find somewhere else to go since it's pretty far out of the way (I don't mind, since it's just an alt, and if he stays in Gunthak, it doesn't bother me, I'll just stick a gate potion in a shard bank slot when it's time for him to move) and there's almost no loot.<br />
<br />
Dulak's a lot better on the loot side, but requires a couple more levels than Gunthak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">At 24, my SK twink was being PL'd in mons seru then the overthere, at 30 he moved to frontier mountains and at 35 he moved to dreadlands. At 45 i had him in maiden's eye helping me farm shards :P .. and now he's 47 and droga-ing it up :)<br />
<br />
edit - speaking of which .. level 47 is the &quot;target&quot; level to get your 2 box characters now .. he can finally be Q'd !!! .. it makes it so much easier :) .. and FA helps too, especially with the low-ish dps that sk's have at that level</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My alt toon/2box partner for my Shaman is my SK<br />
<br />
FA makes a WORLD of difference to his DPS.</div></div><hr />

I just took an Ogre SK from 30-39 in about 7 hours of real-time in Kaesora. My shaman is only 53, but the buffs are the same since they fixed the level base. I might have been able to take him further by killing the mobs with my shaman when they got below 50%, but I am trying to keep the SK's weapon, offense, and defense skills up as he's made 39 in 2 days, 1 hour, some-odd mins played.<br />
At 39 I went about LoY abit to see what would be the best and found the Gunthak to be OK and Dulak seemed a bit harder with the amount of hit points the mobs have. I might wait until the SK is  41 or so before going to Dulak.<br />
Another good place in the 40 range is CoM. It goes pretty fast until 48 or so before slowing down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>starlite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">take ya sk to hhk and kill guards. slow and criple them with shammy.  Give yer sk alacrity and shlorplast and hos and ur golden...<br />
<br />
fast exp and ave 6pp per mob.<br />
<br />
guaeds on top floor are lvl 32 and of course the nobles on 2nd floor are lvl 40.  In theory u could stay here til 55, bust at lvl 31 ish maybe good idea to switch to solb just to break the teadium</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Haven't looked at the SK spells for LoY, but every class seems to have one MUST HAVE spell there.  Took my pally twink out to get her the spell drop, and managed to scream from 39 to 47 over the weekend.  It helps that there's a good quantity of undead to choose from.  But I wouldn't head here earlier than 35 or so.  It'll take longer to kill those reds than will be worthwhile.  LoY had a good exp chunk per critter, but they DO have some hefty HPs.<br />
<br />
I'd go with Hrothgar and hit guk.  Pally got 39 there, and even solo'ed a bit without the PL'ing.</div></div><hr />
