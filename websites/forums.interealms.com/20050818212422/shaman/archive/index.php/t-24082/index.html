<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Scylding</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was grouping in PoV last night with a Chanter, Monk, Ranger, Cleric and a Paladin. Fighting mostly Crystalline Golems and spiders.  <br />
<br />
This is what I was doing. <br />
Slow, it was only resisted twice in about 2 hours of pulling.  Cast Pox of Bert, and Bane of Nife, Canni some, maybe hit it once with my JBB.  Then depending on mana either a Torrent of Poison or Canni until the fight was over. <br />
<br />
Edit<br />
<br />
More info<br />
<br />
Im lvl 62.  <br />
<br />
The Ranger was snaring, there was no need for CC and we never had more than one more in camp.<br />
<br />
Pox did not run full duration, Bane of never did every time.  It would wear off at about 30% health on the mob.<br />
<br />
I only needed to heal once.<br />
<br />
No VS<br />
<br />
I use the JBB because it's a freeby, and all of my other duties are taken care of.<br />
<br />
Yes I was using Dogdog<br />
<br />
And no i did not root.  see ranger snaring.<br />
<br />
ANd yes I was watching the Apprentice.<br />
<br />
Am I being a effective Shaman?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Did you still have mana?  Did you rebuff your group?  Did you have a pet out?  Did you heal them?  If the answers are Yes, no, no, no then I would say no you were not being effective.<br />
<br />
If you did what you posted and what I posted then the answer is yes you were being effective.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Its a fine line we walk...I try to watch as much of 'The Apprentice' as possible without getting booted from group.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The only thing I see missing is siccing dogdog on the mob. My general routine in a group like that is Malos on incoming IF the mob is hard to Slow without it OR if I have casters in group who will be more effective in nuking with Malos. Otherwise, I skip that step. Then Slow with either Nihil if I know it will be less than 90 seconds of fight, or Turgur's if its gonna be longer. <br />
<br />
Next step is to sic dogdog on. Try to always be behind the mob when you do that, for two reasons: first, it helps to have dogdog pushing TOWARD the tank, rather than away. Second, if you happen to be on a mob that Enrages, being behind will keep dogdog from dying on every pull.<br />
<br />
After that, its really situational: if you dots land well on this type of mob, by all means, drop them on. I almost always hit stuff with Bane, and then Saryrn if the fight will last long enough to make it worth it. Then its either heal or Canni. I hardly ever bother to nuke--shaman nukes are just not worth the effort either in terms of damage done or in efficiency. Plus, I usually find I can fill the time checking buffs: I usually overwrite my own Haste fairly often, just to keep the tanks from bitching about it dropping. I rotate FA on anyone who is doing melee, even the idiot cleric if they want it (although I WILL remember the clerics that tank, and try to avoid grouping with them again--I've died TOO many times because the asshat cleric was so busy meleeing they didn't notice the add come in and start beating on people, or notice that aggro had shifted and I was getting a beatdown, or whatever).<br />
<br />
There's certainly plenty to keep yourself busy most of the time, and the nicest part of being a shaman (if you don't mind being busy) is that you have so many options, all of which count as &quot;productive&quot; use of your time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Scylding</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yes Pet<br />
<br />
Yes rebuff<br />
<br />
I only had the heal once the entire time.  The cleric and the puller where doing there job well.<br />
<br />
And with canni 4 and 5 I could maintain a workable pool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You were doing too much. <br />
<br />
You are supposed to slow the mob, toggle out of EQ to read boards/watch TV/eat and toggle back when you hear the next mob in camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You were doing too much. <br />
<br />
You are supposed to slow the mob, toggle out of EQ to read boards/watch TV/eat and toggle back when you hear the next mob in camp.<br />
<br />
And make sure you have a hotkey setup like:<br />
<br />
/g slow resisstted<br />
<br />
so that when you are late getting back to the group and the mob is half dead you can pretend that you were there the whole time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Were you buffing at all?<br />
When did you cast Pox and on what (rooted/CCed mob or one your party was smoking)?<br />
Did your DoTs run full duration?<br />
Did you heal at all?<br />
Why were you using the JBB?<br />
What level are you?<br />
Do you have VS?<br />
Were you using DogDog?<br />
Were you rooting?<br />
<br />
I used to do some soloing in that area when waiting on my guys.  Using shaman solo DPS I'd kill one every 2 minutes and change.  I hit them with Pox and sometimes it wouldn't run full duration.  Sometimes I'd have to kite or juggle aggro in the ones immune to run speed changes, those fights took longer.  Our pet is a HUGE help in that area, especially if equipped with dual proccing weaps.  Our HoT is helpfull as well.<br />
<br />
Bottom line is you have all the tools to handle that camp and make the cleric obsolete.  We are the kings of trivial content and that content while it may or may not be trivial to you, is trivial due to new content release and your cleric likely wasn't needed if you were going balls out.</div></div><hr />

Too bad we don't have FD, then we could use the Monk's AFK message:<br />
<br />
&quot;Staying down to clear aggro&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh yeah baby, it's Miller Timer for Monks when you see that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Patzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I've spent so many hours in PoV it's not even funny. This is what I do.<br />
<br />
Buff everyone who needs buffing.<br />
Get up dogdog and buff him.<br />
Get on drog<br />
Slow and malo mob.<br />
&lt;&lt;a %t is now slowed&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Once aggro is secured by tank I toss a dot (usually bane of nife). It's nice to throw them on the rooted mobs, tanks just love it when they go to deal with the add and it's already half dead.<br />
<br />
I nuke using my JBB just for the look of me doing something. 8 second cast time gives you time to get up and pee, smoke, make food, get a drink all with the illusion that you're sitting rapt by your screen watching the every move of the mob in camp. Just walk back over and click it every few seconds ...<br />
<br />
The general response from groups is good. I had a group the other day who complimented my playing because they said the last shaman they had kept wasting all his mana dotting and nuking then having to med after each pull. As long you keep the mobs slowed and your players buffed (and alive if you're healing) you're golden. Also, never run out of mana unless you just ubah saved your group by rooting all the mobs and kept the entire group alive after the monks FD didn't work and you end up with four mobs in camp ... even then it's nice to say &quot;FM gtg&quot; right after those fights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">And make sure you have a hotkey setup like:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Forget casting pox, what is that 500 mana for probably 600 damage done, if that?  Use anathema instead.  Of course if MR is a problem, then disease and poison are all you can do, ignore that.<br />
<br />
Sell the JBB and never even think about it again.  Consider that during the 9 seconds that you are tied up in clicking the JBB you could have C4 2 times.  That means that clicking your &quot;free&quot; nuke, it really cost you 162 mana plus it is downright low dps.  JBB was a great thing back in Kunark, but I really think there are much much better/more efficient things we can do with our time when we pass 60.  I mean, anathema will do the damage that JBB did, and it will do it every 6 seconds for 36 seconds.<br />
<br />
Hopefully these comments will be taken as my opinion and nothing more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Scylding</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I see you point about the JBB vs. Cani IV and then casting a nuke maybe with that mana, and  doing a whole lot more damage.<br />
<br />
But parting with my JBB is like throwing out your old dog at the stop light and hoping you'll never see him again.<br />
<br />
But it does make good sense<br />
<br />
/sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Truth?<br />
<br />
Was the MOB slowed? <br />
<br />
Then you did your job.<br />
<br />
MAAAAAYBE a spot heal here or there, but you exist for one reason only - to slow stuff.<br />
<br />
THAT gentle reader is why slow mitigation really grabs me by the short hairs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ragack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">My personal way of looking if I'm doing my job:<br />
<br />
Is everyone still alive and not being left injured?<br />
<br />
Am I constantly casting when not moving?<br />
<br />
Am I able to keep up this mana usage?<br />
<br />
Am I avoiding spending time at FM except on breaks?<br />
<br />
Are the mobs being slowed fast enough?<br />
<br />
Have I got the best buffs I can maintain on the group/pets?<br />
<br />
Are the Adds only hitting the correct people?<br />
<br />
If you can say yes to all of them your doing your job.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Depends on your pull rate, type of mobs, and your role in a group.  Ideally, you want your mana to remain constant.  Starts at 100m, mob inc, malos slow dot nuke, 80m.  Canni continually until next mob.  Mana is hopefully near 100m again.  <br />
<br />
However, using JBB is not smart.   Better off canni'ing for 8 seconds and then casting another dot or nuke.  <br />
<br />
Just remember this:<br />
<br />
&quot;A good shaman never stops casting, ever&quot;.  <br />
<br />
If you stop casting for any reason, chances are you aren't doing enough.  If you are sitting there at FM casting a jbb... you need to be casting a big nuke+rain each mob and then canni back to FM between fights.  JBB is a waste of time.  <br />
<br />
If your cleric/druid in group is saying &quot;OOM&quot; ever, chances are, you need to cut out one nuke and cast Q or a patch heal from time to time.  Or if the ranger is kiting and gets hit to 60%, heal him.  <br />
<br />
How you choose to spend your mana is ultimately up to you.  But your choices should be based on your groups goals.  If the group goal is fast steady pulls, balance healing/dmg/debuffing to maximize your groups kill rate.  But again, if you aren't continually casting something, you aren't a good shaman.</div></div><hr />
