<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So many folks say that multiple shaman just stack up on a raid and are completely useless after you have one 65 there.  I'm sure SOE figured by giving us crappy low level heals, so that 4 of us are needed to heal as well as one druid, that they were then making shaman 4x as needed on a raid!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ggrugnuuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Or they just have 2 or 3 clerics on a raid... so we don't really need to heal much at all.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Man sure am glad people are picking up on sarcasm... was going to be worried people took things too litterally around here.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ggrugnuuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i think i said this in another post, but for some of us slower people, I.E. me, sarcasm could usually be followed up by a  :rolleyes: or ;) or maybe a :p</div></div><hr />
