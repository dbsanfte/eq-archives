<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">By the way, for those not familiar with PVP on the non-PVP servers, be careful about who you right click on.  I visited Tanaris for the first time today, which is a neutral city with vendors/NPCs of both alliance and horde.  Like an idiot I wasn't paying attention and right clicked on what I thought was a (neutral) goblin vendor- turned out it was a gnome and I swung my staff at her.<br />
<br />
So then my mage hikes up his robe and runs for the hills.  I make it out of the city alive but if you attack an enemy NPC your PVP flag is turned on for five minutes.  Not realizing this I walked back into the town and was summarily ganked by a L55 paladin in two swings.  Fortunately the graveyard was only like 20 seconds away so I just went and got coffee until my PVP flag dropped before rezzing myself.<br />
<br />
Moral of the story: be careful what you right click!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>chmodux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">izmalis = I think that can be circumvented by unchecking the at war flag in said neutral city. That prevents you from attacking people on that city's faction.   However I to did that exact same thing in tanarius first time i went there i just took the death to avoid the pvp flag. Which was ineffective as is but it cleared me off the agro list there at least I imagine you were still flagged for attack from the guards since you touched an npc.  Havent had any problems since I unchecked the box.</div></div><hr />

When the gnome vendor leashed I dropped off the guard's aggro list but was still PVP flagged.  I was ganked by a player, not an NPC guard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I like the WoW approach to PvP.  In my guild, we call it consensual PvP - you can choose the time and place to fight.  It's what we prefer as a guild; we left UO because of &quot;non-consenual&quot; PvP, eventually tired of EQ becuase it was one or the other (duels and arenas just aren't the same), liked DAoC and SWG because of how they implemented PvP.<br />
<br />
One thing we've found is games seem to have a hard time being good at both PvP and PvE (player vs environment, or computer).  EQ has great PvE and mediocre PvP.  DAoC has mediocre PvE and good PvP.  SWG had very good PvP, but the game was too buggy.  We have high hopes for WoW and see a good balance (i.e. enjoyable playability)between PVE and PVP so far.<br />
<br />
Like Iz, I learned the hard way you need to know all the rules for &quot;consenting.&quot;  Many of the quests we do require killing opponent NPCs that will trigger your PvP flag.  Many opponent players will hang around these quests hoping some of the questors don't know this rule.  It's all good!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tolgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hey Krup, what guild are you in, and do they have a website?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Doesn't this imply that there's really no such thing as a non-PvP server in WoW?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Doesn't this imply that there's really no such thing as a non-PvP server in WoW?<br />
Correct.  There's no PVP free WoW server.  The true PVP servers offer non-consensual PVP, the regular servers do not.  I've been ganked twice on the regular server and both times I did so by my own actions (accidentally).  <br />
<br />
My only gripe is I wish they'd make it more difficult to accidentally flag yourself for PVP- I hate PVP.  Since it only lasts 5 minutes if you do mess up and since they can't corpse camp you or grief you, it really doesn't bother me that much however.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can they loot anything off you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Nope</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Or better put:  Not yet!<br />
<br />
They are still doing a lot of tuning in the PvP area and are considering some form of looting as a part of the package.</div></div><hr />

This is only for the PVP servers though, right? I haven't heard of anything like this on the non-PVP servers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Not sure Iz - the threads I've read on it didn't make the distinction.  That may be because everyone in the thread assumes PvP server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I hope very much that they'll put in a yes/no box - or an option to give yourself that box, before right-click-PVP.  It's a rude rude surprise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Heh, I got ganked again today on the non-PVP server due to a bug after the latest patch.  I was killing a bear and minding my business when some high level human priest rolled up on a horse- they were named &quot;Dishonorable Compassion&quot; and promptly ganked me in one shot.  I subsequently discovered that the Dishonorable title meant a PVPer that repeatedly ganks low levels.  <br />
<br />
I absolutely did not enable my PVP flag so this is obviously a bug or a hack.  The PVP flag went away after 5 min but I've been paranoid since hehe.  Unless bears are somehow now allied with the Alliance? :p</div></div><hr />
