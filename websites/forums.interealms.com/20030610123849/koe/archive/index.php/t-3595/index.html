<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Anuin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, when a person goes to illusion that model is physically changed, am I correct?  Well one thing that I have noticed is that New velious armors are much more detailed which leave a greater burden on the CPU or Video card.  Now if we were to pass a necro amulet around and turn everyone into skele's then armors wouldn't have to be textured, reducing lag.... I think...<br />

Secondly, if there were no laws, then there would be no crime.  As crime is created when laws are broken....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fanadile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's quite possible honestly but...this probably will not stop lag that is network (internet) based.  Sounds tho it could take a huge burden off your graphics card if you have a PoS card like mine.<br />
<br />
But thro-out this idea there is one forseeable problem:<br />
<br />
Sorry but there is NO WAY IN HELL that I would hand my Amulet of Necropotence to 50 different people on a raid.  Sorry, won't happen! No Way am I gonna lose it cause of some jack*** :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Abash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well as far as whether it would work or not, I do not have the technical knowledge to know if a skelly form is any easier (or to what degree easier) on your puter as armor, but....<br />
<br />
Either way, very cool thought...original ideas are hard to come by..keep it up, Anuin!</div></div><hr />
