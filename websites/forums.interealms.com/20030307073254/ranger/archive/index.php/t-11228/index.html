<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bolanos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I don't like posting on forums, normally people just burn you for no reason at all.  I posted this in castersrealm but think it should be here instead. Instead of complaining about what other's have, perhaps you should give some idea's about what we SHOULD have. I'll give you my 2 cents worth: <br />
<br />
Honestly, I think VI knows they screwed up. I am a ranger, 55 ranger to be exact (I also have a high level Monk, Wizard, and Necro). We, Rangers, can pull agro just by looking at the mob funny and don't have the AC to protect us nor the HP to let us take a couple of hits. But I believe that falls into the ranger area, so verant was correct in that area for us, However, our defensive skills need to be raised, as a light melee we are suppose to be agile. But, VI screwed up on everything else, and their AAXP was sort of a way to fix their screw-up but no one wants to wait till level 59 and lord know how many AAXP points in order to correct Verant's mistake. When Verant made rangers, they designed us not knowing what to make us, so we're part warrior, with nothing good from warriors, and part druid (woodpeople) with nothing good from druids except for sow and snare. So unlike Pallies and SK, we have no Identity of our own (Pally's are holy warriors, thus the good AC and HP but weak attack like warriors, and SK are fallen Pallies). That is why we do not get that special Usefull skill like SK or Pallies. What verant needs to do is look at our class and give us this identity. For example (and this I have taken bits and pieces from other people's post): <br />
<br />
If you think of a ranger, I think of Legolas from LotR, or Robin Hood. Master of the Bow, Master Tracker, Master of the Great Outdoors. VI knows this but won't give us what the class needs, the IDENTITY. <br />
<br />
If we are Master's of the Bow, then either raise our bow cap above warriors or lower the warriors. We should do bow damage that is higher then 30 points per arrow if we hit at all. While we are speaking of hitting at all, if we are master's of the bow then why do we miss, and/or our chances for a hit should increase if we are closer to the MoB. Since we are now speaking of closer, if in RL, I draw a bow and shoot it at someone at point blank range, is the bow going to tell me I'm to close to my target? or am I gonna shoot my arrow through this person? If a mob is rooted, or standing still, shouldn't I still be able to do double damage, either way the MoB is STATIONARY, which is what VI say's is needed for double damage to work, so what's the difference? Why does it tell me your target is to above/below you when I try shooting a MoB, didn't archer's seek high ground for battles? hmmm, ever see Lord of the Rings? How many times did legolas pull out his swords? wasn't it like a ranger, plucking away at every single mob with his bow (honestly, I think Legolas went to Seb and picked up that bow, emm, windsaber I think it's called, cause he was plucking away faster then I could blink) To me, that's a ranger, no need for swords, we're ranger's, range attack for great damage all the time, not for 2 minutes in a 75 minute period of time, that just sucks. <br />
<br />
If we are Master's of Tracking, then when we cap tracking we should be able to track the entire zone (which some believe we can, guess again, we cannot so do not get upset if we tell you not on track, hehe). But Ranger's aren't complaining much on tracking since the last patch which made tracking very nice and enjoyable to use...after they got rid of the bug, hehe. Still, tracking is not a great ability, unlike SK and Pallies, we can't use track in dungeons because we'll just end up at deadends. Once again, the bow will give us that indoor ability to be worth something.  Perhaps a feature on tracking that will let us enter type a name and it will track it for us.<br />
<br />
If we are Master's of the outdoors why can't we have a key like monk's FD that is like a &quot;Ghost&quot; key. Like we are running in an OUTDOOR zone and we hit the key causing us to run Invisible from MoB's, sort of like the rogue's hide and sneak but with FD results? Example, your pulling in an Outdoor zone, you pull more then two mobs, you hit Ghost and it say's you have successfuly blended into your environment, or, you are now one with the forest. You have killed agro, you can then break out of it and repull again. If we are master's of the outdoor's...it just makes sence. The key is making it an Outdoor only thing. When you think of Ranger's, don't you see them as being the kind that can disapear into the woods, like Robin Hood? <br />
<br />
Personally, I think Verant knows that the Ranger Class needs these things to give it their own Identity, like every other class out there. Perhaps then Rangers will actually be wanted in groups, spending 3 hours in Seb oocing for a group every day is not fun at all. I also believe that although Verant knows they need to give the Ranger class these abilities, they WON'T. They won't because they are afraid of giving us what we deserve because all the other classes are going to cry out fowl play, and they aren't going to make a handful happy to piss off the rest of the people. Verant, I hope your reading this, We need our own personality like you gave Pallies and SK. You preach balancing but all classes get new things while Ranger's are still the cousin that no one want's to acknowledge. Make our class what we are, give us the abilities that belong to Ranger's. Either that or rename us. <br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>tdgreer1203</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">To your very long, very compelling, and very true post, I just wanted to say AMEN!!! I send a lot of feedback messages in about the way the rangers of everquest are made, and how we are structured, and I think that if more people would do this, from every server, as often as possible, they would make some changes quick, fast, and in a hurry. I saw one post about a guy wondering why we didn't get porting abilities, and the way he had everything structured in his argument, he was raising a good question. He went down the line showing how these characters were related to this one, and they get porting abilities, but the rangers whom are related to the druids can't port at all. And I think that if we don't get porting, I mean come on, you have to give us something somewhere, and there is plenty of room to give for our characters.</div></div><hr />
