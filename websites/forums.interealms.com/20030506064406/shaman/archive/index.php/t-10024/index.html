<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Durdend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">For all of you wanting to get through these lvls, seriously consider SolA.<br />
<br />
I went there while just a shade in lvl36 and made it to lvl39 in about 6-8 hours.  I was getting 2-4% of a lvl per kill solo on Clockworks.<br />
<br />
I was down in the area where the EXG spawns, which drops the Charred Gaurdian Sheild and the Charred Gaurdian Breastplate (got two sheilds - they aren't lore - which sold in 30 minutes in the Bazaar price around 150pp).  Here are a few tips.<br />
<br />
1)  I had PoP so I bind in the Bazaar so I can always gate back and donate for a KEI (I never solo with out it now - man that crack is ADDICTIVE!).  Take the Neriak portal in PoP to get to Lava, or donate for a port.<br />
<br />
2) Use EQAtlas to find where the EXG camp is.  All casting goblins in SolA see invis, so I fought my way there or just ran for the zone down by the Foreman, then fought my way in from there if I had too (only 3 goblins between the Foreman zoneline and the EXG camp).<br />
<br />
3)  After getting the the EXG camp, I'd get out dogdog if not already out.  If you are KoS (troll or ogre - not sure if iksar start out kos to gnomes or not), buff onthe stairs leading down to the EXG area). NOTE!!!! ALL CLOCKWORKS SEE INVIS!!!!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
4)  Kill the roamer first.  Wait on the steps, eventually on clockwork will wander up the steps - this is the EXG or it's PH (note EXG is COMPLETELY 100% immune to magic - although beneficial spells will stick to it - DS's cast by pesky gnome conjurer's).  Kill the roamer (for the EXG I just tanked and let dogdog and myself melee, starting my heal when down around 70% - that way incase I was interrupted I'd have another shot instead of running for the zone).<br />
<br />
5) After killing the roamer, the next step is the hardest part of the camp.  Splitting the first two clockworks.  Aggro one, you aggro both.  Use pet gaurd me, root one, back up debuff (slow, listless power, Scrouge and Envenom Breath) the one that dogdog is tanking.  Then slow the rooted clockwork, I'd also dot it while dogdog and I were finishing off the first.  I used Winters Roar to speed up killing the first to help spread the spawn out a little.<br />
<br />
6)  The next two spawns are single spawns.  Cake.  One is a clockwork, the other is a gnome (miner - warrior, curator - cleric or conjurer - mage).  Nuke the heck out of the curator and conjurers, I hate them.<br />
<br />
5)  At lvl36 I was able to do these 5 spawns no problem.  I figure anyone with a pet could do them (before repops), and make good exp and some decent money (1gp - 3pp each kill, plus FS weapons and some modules that sell for 1-3pp).<br />
<br />
7)  At lvl39 I can do 9 spawns np before repops (which is 18 minutes in SolA).  Still making at least 2% per kill.  I figured I could hit lvl40, where exp may take a dip and have to move on.  But the exp modifier in SolA is awesome which makes up for alot.<br />
<br />
8)  Being an old world dungeon, the clockworks hit like sissies (around lvl38 I stopped using Listless Power to save mana for nukes/dots/roots).  Also they don't have many hitpoint AT ALL.  About 70% of the hp of the same lvl Velious or Kunark mobs.<br />
<br />
9)  Just be prepared to be hated in Ak'Anon (which is an easy sacrifice in my book).  Been there 3 lvls and still not KoS as a Barbie Shaman - but I am down to Dubious.<br />
<br />
10)  Only vendor close is the Druid out in Lavastorm.  Sell all unwanted FS to her along with the words/runes/modules.<br />
<br />
I hope that helps some of the other soloing shaman out there in the lvl34-39 range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Durdend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Update, at lvl39 about 1 in 10 clockworks are light blue.  All gnomes are still dark blue.  I have a feeling that after I ding to lvl40, the exp is going to start drying up.<br />
<br />
All dark blues are still giving me 2% exp at lvl39, and all light blues are giving 1% (some aren't even giving that).<br />
<br />
But all in all, still a good spot at lvl39.  Made half a level  in about 70 minutes of not so hard fighting (I had about 5 minutes of down time before repops).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>lengis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">the gnomes down there are their own faction.  You can fix it by killing the dogs in sol b though.  At least in the past it was this way.  I would solo through the 30s on gnomes, killing Gabby and the EXG over and over, and then go to sol b in the 40s to fix the faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">They aren't too bad exp higher up.  I did them on my monk until about 44.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
There are faster places, but this was easy exp and usually wasn't camped, so it was just easier to stay there.</div></div><hr />
