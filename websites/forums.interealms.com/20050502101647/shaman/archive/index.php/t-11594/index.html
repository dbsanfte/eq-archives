By the way don't get VP, its utter garbage, resisted way too much, SC is pretty nice though.<br />

Try using malicious decay if you dont want VP resisted alot. i personally have never had VP resisted outside crypt of decay. i love this aa, its only 3 points and it knocks the mob backwards a good bit, roots it and gives you time to fire off a nice heal on yourself if needed when in bad situation. i dont use it as main root, only when my main root is resisted alot or breaks shortly after casting, gives me time to sit and mem sinia and then usually root takes fine. this aa is great, although spending more than the first lvl of points i cant see being very usefull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You might wanna go SCRM.  Even though you really don't care about your buff duration, Torpor and Quiescense work with that.  I went from 1200 HP's to 2100.....   worthwhile?  I think so :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Im in a simillar place.  I have cani5, sc1, vp1, rc1 ... now I am debating between scr and nd for my next set of aa.  After those I will probably do Quick Buff to speed up torpor casts.</div></div><hr />

VP flat out rocks. Someone finally showed a little creativity when creating this AA skill.</div></div><hr />
