<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">With all the talk flying around about AC/hp gear, Wis gear, etc. I was wondering if anyone could point me to a link that details the effect of Stamina on Hps.  I think it would be helpful in deciding if a particular piece of HP gear is better than a +X Sta item.<br />
<br />
<br />
Basically, how many hps does each pt of Sta give at various levels?  If anyone knows the formula I'd appreciate it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't know of a calculator across the levels, but its 3hp per sta at 60. <br />
<br />
:(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I played around with magelo a bit (since it seems to track hit points very accurately) and it looks like the formula (for shamans) for computing additional hp from stamina is pretty simple:<br />
<br />
Each point of additional stamina will give you (level/10)*0.5 hit points.<br />
<br />
At level 10, you get 0.5 hp per additional stamina point.<br />
At level 20, you get 1.0 hp per additional stamina point.<br />
At level 30, you get 1.5 hp per additional stamina point.<br />
At level 40, you get 2.0 hp per additional stamina point.<br />
At level 50, you get 2.5 hp per additional stamina point.<br />
At level 60, you get 3.0 hp per additional stamina point.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps</div></div><hr />

Or you could just say Level/20 for each STA point. :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yep, for Priests its  Level/20.  INT casters is Level/30.  For Warriors its Level/10.  Not sure off hand on Hybrids but its between Priests and Warriors.<br />
<br />
So for a level 60 character, RH (assuming it does the full +50 Sta) gives:<br />
<br />
Warriors: +300 HP<br />
Priest: +150 HP<br />
Caster: +100 HP</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Paerlith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Not a bad buff considering it stacks with everything :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
What started all this:<br />
I know STA items are relativly hard to come by, and I was given a Dragonhide belt (AC 6, +10Sta)  a *long* time ago.  Its been sitting on an alt and I was trying to judge how valuable it would be compared to my current Crystaline Belt, which I'm trying to upgrade.  Looks like a Spider fur is still better, and will stay better even as I level up, but the Dragonhide belt is free.</div></div><hr />
