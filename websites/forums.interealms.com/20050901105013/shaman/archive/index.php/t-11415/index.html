<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zaspacer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We have seen VI/SOE nerf abilities that popped up that were deemed too powerful, but there are MANY such abilities that are regarded as too ingrained in EQ to remove.<br />
<br />
What do YOU think are abilites that fall in this category?<br />
<br />
Here are a few that I think might fall there:<br />
Feign Death<br />
Track<br />
&gt; 50% slow<br />
Complete Heal<br />
Charm<br />
Lull<br />
Long duration massive HP buff<br />
Long duration massive mana regen buff<br />
<br />
Do you agree/disagree?<br />
What would you put on your list?<br />
<br />
In addition here are some aspects of the game that I would say are just &quot;silly&quot;.<br />
<br />
How mob aggro is handled &quot;works&quot; for the game, but it's just silly.<br />
<br />
A mob can be staring right at you and not flinch because your an extra foot away.<br />
A mob you are behind (and so they cannot see you) has the same aggro range as one that is looking directly at you.<br />
<br />
I would also say that mob hp/dps being totally out of whack with players again &quot;works for the game&quot; as is, but is silly.<br />
<br />
And I think mob AI is silly.<br />
<br />
Most of this DOES work for the game that they've made/balanced.<br />
But a lot of it is silly.<br />
<br />

All the warriors in my guild admit it.  It is way too powerful, but again its so integrated into the game now that it could never be changed.<br />
<br />
(there ya go.. offend the warriors)<br />
<br />
Actualy this is useful stuff to think about if you are a game designer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Feign Death<br />
<br />
This probably is too powerful, to be honest.  The mob should not just immediately give up on you...  maybe it should bat you around a few times to see if you really are dead.  Or stick around and chew on your leg for a while.<br />
<br />
Tracking<br />
<br />
You mean that seeing a footprint on the ground in front of you should NOT tell you that Jacob Smith (who you have never met before or even seen) is ahead and to the right?<br />
<br />
I could go on...  I think the bottom line is that yes there are abilities which are extremely powerful in the game and which make little sense in terms of realism or common sense.  Do I think anything should be done about it?  No, not really.  It gives every class something fun to do.  So, grats monks / rangers / druids / enchnters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I agro with FD in a sense...but the biggest reason is that it's like a get out of jail card for people..and I mean mostly monks.  I mean, I don't see SKs or necros ever doing it...but how many times have you seen a stupid ass monk run up to you and then FD and have the six mobs that were chasing him agro to you guys...and the whole time he just lays there until after you are dead and either can /q out to remove agro or just wait till they leave.<br />
<br />
I think that it's good cause in all honestly it's hard to keep yourself from getting 10 mobs on you sometimes without it..but hell, I think that it's used far too much for some way too shady people.<br />
<br />
....makes me wish that I always grouped with a bard with some AE spells...then again, I hate getting asked for buffs with a bard in the group cause nothing ever stacks right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Everquest is a game.  Games have rules.  These rules are what shape the playability of the game and what make the game interesting and entertaining.  Think about chess.  Is the queen overpowered in comparison to the rest of the pieces?  Yes.  If all the pieces had the same power, though, what would you have?  Checkers - A completely different and (in my opinion) less fun game.<br />
<br />
All the things you listed are a part of the game.  So what if they are &quot;silly&quot; and unrealistic?  Realism does not make a game fun.<br />
<br />
If all those things you listed were removed or nerfed, the game would be full of a bunch of impotent, nearly identical classes, which would suck.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kiegar Dar`Grunt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Track is NOT overpowering. As a former Ranger I can say that I rarely ever used track with during my 56 levels. Its a nice thing to have sure, but unless your looking for a specific mob its not that useful. Track has alot of unmentioned bugs that not many people talk about. Alot of times I was right on top of the supposed mob, then about a min. later track would switch and tell me to go a different direction and boom, there it was, 20 ft. away from me.<br />
<br />
Thats a big waste of time. If they nerf track youll never be able to ask a tracker in the zone if soandso is up for your epic or some other quest.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for everything else you said. I hope it was a joke, if not you must be the dumbest person playing this game. Nerfing all that would just straight up end the game.<br />
<br />
I dont think FD should be nerfed either. Jealous shaman's tsk tsk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">FD too powerful?<br />
<br />
Try playing a class that can FD first.<br />
<br />
Nothing worse than FD off a mob, then continue pulling.  Only to find out later you did not lose aggro.  Go over a hill for the next pull and find that you have 4+ mobs running at you.  FD does not always clear aggro.  FD also fails sometimes.  You just fall to the ground.<br />
<br />
Being an SK, you usually have to plan on fizzling FD 3 times, everytime you cast it.  Then after channeling through 3 mobs beating on you, its very discouraging to just fall to the ground and die.<br />
<br />
Saying things are overpowered, is essentially calling for them to be nerfed.  It won't be appreciated by many classes, and I think you did a good job in being fair.  You may actually upset every single class with a post like this.</div></div><hr />

I would put AM in here as terribly overpowered, but Verant in its wisdom screwed up archery so bad that the silly ranjurs are lucky to stick 2 arrows in the mobs  :)</div></div><hr />

The ability to do (roughly) 1500 points of extra damage every 72 minutes doesn't seem that overpowered to me. That's less than a single nuke from a level 60 wizard. Once per 72 minutes.</div></div><hr />

Not totally sure about it, but a SK friend told me he can get an advanced HT every 20 mins or so, with AA abilities. Same with LoH.<br />
But people spending 30+ for AA abilities is far from overpowered (aka AM3).<br />

- Not when the enchanter has a quadding Diaku pet that is hasted. 7% per kill, about 25-35 sec per kill. You do the math. I was grouped with enchanters in Tactics often, by the time slow lands on mob (no need for Malo, just one single slow), it is already at 75-80% life. Only thing beating on it is a hasted, quadding Diaku.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Shade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Yeah, I'd have to agree that FD is vastly overpowered. The simple fact that it allows monks to solo from 60 to 65 in two weeks or less, is clear evidence that it needs to be nerfed. If monks weren't the best soloers in the game, they might have to occasionally group. If you add a monk's superior tanking abilities (behind only Warriors, Paladins, Shadowknights, Rogues, and Rangers) and their elite damage dealing capability (trailing only Rogues, Rangers, and in some cases, Warriors) to a group, every member of that group would benefit from the increased exp. I can't tell you how many potential groups I have seen recently cowering at the zoneline, unwilling to go any further without the power that a monk brings to a group. By giving monks Feign Death and the corresponding ability to solo, SOE is hurting every other player in the game.<br />
<br />
The most damaging aspect of this skill is that it occasionally works, a state that is clearly out of line with a monk's defensive abilities. Clearly, having an ability that might in some way be useful is not in line with VI's vision for monks.<br />
<br />
Please, think of the children. NERF FEIGN DEATH!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>tewdogs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Have to agree with Zorlac on this one, although I thought they nerfed haste on charmed mobs.<br />
The reason is that I firmly believe evey class should be better off when grouped. How does it serve the majority to allow one highly group (and raid) friendly class to solo better than some full groups, and not just yard trash, but several types of named. Risk is of course far greater, but what is death when xp (and bank balance) moves at a stellar rate. <br />
Necros were not allowed to carry on soloing named mobs following the days of guk, manaburn groups were stopped from raping the dragons of kunark, yet chanters were given free reign to dc solo kael for mq armor and now are able to run amok in pop with cod superpets. <br />
We all benefit from xp and spell farming with chanters in our group but I do not see how chanters benefit from doing the same with us. <br />
Bring back some form of the xp penalty to scale when a pet does more than say 75% of damage to a mob. Closer to 100%, the higher the % of xp taken by the pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Spells are too powerful--the ability to do large chunks of damage in no time at all is so unfair!<br />
<br />
Armor's too powerful--Running while wearing plate? Sneaking while wearing chain? <br />
<br />
Special abilities are too powerful--they are an unfair advantage over npcs!<br />
<br />
Fireworks are too powerful--look! they are shiny!<br />
<br />
Weapons are too powerful--look! they are sharp!<br />
<br />
Monks are too powrful--if nobody's got weapons and armor, their HtH cap would be so unbalanced it makes you cry.<br />
<br />
So, everybody should be naked, unable to equip any armor or weapons, and pound on things with their uber hth skill, which is capped at 1.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Overpowered things in the game:<br />
<br />
KEI - I've recently started up a new twink due to the froglok race, and I've also just started buying KEI's with my shaman (L 54). Seeing the culture that has grown up around this overpowered twink spell has really blown my mind. This spell needs to work less well on low level characters. There's no reason L 10 twinks should be able to buy a 3 1/2 hour endless-mana buff. <br />
<br />
CoD - charming huge-DPS very-low-hp mobs for massive exp gain is broken. This applies to any class able to charm L 60+ PoP mobs. <br />
<br />
Swarm Kiting - they need to find a way to stop bard swarm kiting (and yes my main is a bard who has done significant swarm kiting). They pretty much killed it at L 65 by making bard PoP charms have a low level cap, but before about L 62 it's just too powerful/easy/fast, just like CoD is at L 65. <br />
<br />
AE nukes with infinite allowable targets. <br />
<br />
Turgur's insects and feign death are really close to overpowered, in my book, but weakening them any further would require massive overhauls of the affected classes, and maybe of a lot of zones/encounters that were tuned assuming these abilities would work as they do. <br />
<br />
The Defensive warrior AA - but fixing that would definitely require significant warrior rebalancing. <br />
<br />
Druid snare spells, specifically ensare and anything similar with huge durations. Nothing makes a non-summoning mob trivial like an 8 minute snare - not even a 75% slow. <br />
<br />
They've actually fixed a lot of the overpowered stuff recently, such as Harmony, manaburn, etc...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">FD = pause button.  Nobody else gets to pause EQ.  Regardless of whether or not you think it is overpowered for the character, it cannot be denied that it is amazingly powerful for the player.  <br />
<br />
For a number of people (e.g. anyone with responsibility for young children) without FD they can't play at all unless they just want to eat a ton of deaths.  I know that I would pay $100 a month to play on a server with a pause button (it wouldn't even have to have any of the other positive effects that FD has).<br />

A lot of this stuff (defensive, CHs, high % slows) we've gone over to death and back.  It isn't &quot;class envy whining&quot; (at least not from everyone); a lot of people don't like these abilities because they greatly reduce the number of challenging possibilities that the game can present and thus result in a less interesting game.  I think we all know that they aren't going to change at this point of the game.<br />

Anyone who thinks that Everquest is balanced anywhere near as well as chess (a game that an enormous number of brilliant people have been studying intensely for many centuries without one single dominant strategy prevailing) needs to lay off the crack.  It is precisely because chess is so well balanced, yet so open ended, that makes it so compelling.  You will not see another game like that.<br />
<br />
Everquest would be like chess if chess had random rules like &quot;move your bishop 2 squares one turn, then back one square the next, and you automatically win!&quot;  Which is to say that, as a strategic game, EQ is a horrible failure.  This isn't a design failure, however, because that isn't what EQ was designed to be.  EQ was designed to be a statbuilder treadmill linked to a graphical chat room so that people could kill time there instead of watching TV.  And it is very good at that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Slomoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">FD isnt as overpowered as Slow or CH. It serves its purpose to a group much more then it does to the monk itself. Monks die a hell of a lot more often then any other class in a raiding guild. So a FD class can go afk in a group and you cant, is that really that much of a big deal? OMG FD class have the ability to train people. Those things cant be attributed to the ablility but to the tard who is doing it.<br />
<br />
Once again, living in outdoor zones for so long people forget how FD used to be a vital part of dungeon groups and pulling in raids. Nowdays instead of slowass split pulling on raids you get 10 warriors and offtank everything, or get someone to kite stuff. FD pulling came about from very intelligent FD classes who figured out a way to use a ability that helped thier class alone and made it into something that helps many. Bravo to those pioneers. If you have been playing EQ for any amount of time and have made friends in ebough classes you will see that all of them have something to offer to your gaming experience, and most of it is actually good. <br />
<br />
edit: Im sorry, what do rangers do again besides dying on raids to ensure good loot?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">FD = pause button.<br />
<br />
Wanted to debunk this.<br />
<br />
If a Monk succesfully feigns and is THEN hit with a spell, the feign is automatically broken EVEN IF he resists.  If you attempt to use this as a &quot; pause button &quot; and are hit with a spell, you are now, &quot; unpaused.&quot; (Which is why it's nearly impossible to feign off 2+ casters)<br />
<br />
More food for thought. FD works about as often as Sense Heading. Meaning that 9 / 10 you're golden, but it can fail 3 times in a row. (My record is 3, I've heard of 8 with a 200 skill)<br />
<br />
Never mind that roaming creatures can move across a zone and know the INSTANT you got up. (Creatures that &quot; reset &quot; to a spawn point are different)<br />
<br />
If aggro wasn't as poorly treated as it is in EQ, then there wouldn't be a need for clerics to &quot; camp out &quot; or people to /q.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">A person that is Fd'd has to be hit by an AOE spell in order for the creature to realize thay are not &quot;dead&quot;.<br />
This is not an issue unless u are in a zone where mobs have aoe attacks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>tewdogs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Make FD button greyed out when monks etc are within a certain range of pcs. This would help stop the only thing I hate about this skill. That is the ability to train others with impunity.<br />
<br />
Wizard AE died with PoP and I think they deserve their 6k nukes (on blue servers anyway) to give them a few ooh aah moments.<br />
<br />
CH is already couple of k short of healing high end tanks, and clerics are still highly reliant on others for loot/xp.<br />
<br />
Track overpowered... can't agree with that one, because it's situational and several classes have it. Furthermore I think it helps the group and guild more than the individual.<br />
<br />
Warriors may have great mitigation but pallys/sks are better taunters and you don't get killed when you heal and use offensive spells when grouped with them.<br />
<br />
The traditional solo classes are limited by immunity to root/snare, and summon is immediate death when solo in PoP. This relegates these classes to zone in type mobs, except for chanters who bypass these restrictions. Remove summon/root immunity from a few of the more challenging mobs and let us have some enjoyment from pushing our solo abilities to the limit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Well since you asked for it. In pvp this is stuff I think is just a tad out of whack:<br />
<br />
-Instacast 5k+ harmtouches.<br />
-MB, or rather, the instagate after it<br />
-AM3, or rather, archery in general.<br />
-Bard unresistable manadrain song and it not requiring mana to sing.<br />
-Bard resists.<br />
-Bard movement speed/casting.<br />
-Bard everything.<br />
-A shadowknight being able to kill me with drains only. I'm a caster, he's a melee. Sense?<br />
-Paladins, and their accursed crusaders touch.<br />
-PvE resists, in general making spells in PvP useless. Lures (-300) are starting to get resists now. Good luck landing a nonlure.<br />
-Damage shields, making the rogue class near unplayable.<br />
-Instacast items, voiding any offensive dispell attempts (excluding chanters) totally ineffective.<br />
-Pure blood.<br />
<br />
Most of the gripes are with the hybrid classes. Which coincidentally are the classes that have (had) a difficulty finding a stable role in the pve department. <br />
<br />
The list could be made a lot longer, but these are the main ones. Serves me right thinking a game designed for vs environment could be played vs players.</div></div><hr />

When hate was first starting to be done, did you use FD pullers? Was it overpowering when you were recieveing rune etched?<br />
<br />
<br />
I gotta admit, I have alot of envy sometimes of people who kick ass while I am sitting there in burning woods cranked off my ass getting 3 plat per kill, but even this thread kind of makes me feel like whining has taken on a whole new meaning.<br />
<br />
KEI, so what? Is it hurting you that johnny too much money is twinking his pet wizard? Would YOU ever use it? What level do you think people should deserve it? Jeez. I just cant believe selfish ass enchanters charge so much for it. Selfish pigs.<br />

Edited:  Correction... Asta Khaan post was very very good and I totally agree...but most you don't care as Sony doesn't about PvP.  So again, retarded...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">I think that everyone knows that getting hit by a spell interrupts FD.  Nonetheless, you aren't always fighting casters, and mob casting times are significantly less than the 30 seconds it takes to camp (which is interrupted not only by getting hit by a spell, but getting hit by anything), especially considering relog time, resummoning pets or whatever, and the fact that you can't see what is going on while you are at the character select screen and may log back into some unexpected company.<br />
<br />
FD also doesn't work if aliens invade the Earth and destroy your computer just before you reach the FD hotkey.  OMG DEBUNKED!!!<br />
<br />
The point remains that FD is an absolutely massive increase in convenience for the _player_ as distinguished from the character.</div></div><hr />

PLEASE do!<br />
<br />
Great post and I would LOVE to read more.<br />
<br />
(HINT: POST MORE NOW!)<br />
<br />
Across three active threads on this topic, you are the only one to comment in depth on the PvP issue.<br />
<br />
I love the balance discussion.<br />
I love how you break it out solo vs. group(s) PvP situations.<br />
<br />
And data from the PvP game is a HUGE factor.<br />
<br />
The backbone of AI will be based on responding to the actual resources and tactics of players.<br />
Something which only PvP is looking at in real terms now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bard everything.&quot;<br />

<br />
I'd love to hear the breakdown. :)<br />
<br />
&quot;Asta Khaan post was very very good and I totally agree&quot;<br />
- Oukast<br />
<br />
Oukast, I would love to see any comments you might have on the PvP issues as well. Would be great to see a doalogue on it as well.<br />
<br />
I have really, really enjoyed the feedback on this post from all of you.<br />
People debating areas of gameplay and really breaking each issue down to the roots.<br />
<br />
I would STRONGLY suggest anyone interested in this topic in checking out the Graffe and Eqdiva threads I linked in the first post.<br />
Both those threads have really evolved into some incredible discussion as well.<br />
And what's really neat is each board's thread takes on different elements to breakdown.<br />
<br />
Thanks again to all the posters.<br />
GREAT stuff people!</div></div><hr />

SoW is way overpowered!  Think of any other lvl 9 spell or lower that you get asked for at lvl 60 LOL.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Easy, one of the most powerful spells in the game.  <br />
<br />
A level one spell.  Snare.<br />
<br />
Would love to see druids try and do what they do without snare.  I said constantly way back in beta 1 that snare needed to be changed like root so that it had a chance of breaking when damage was done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>NinthSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">Snare can be broken..just DD yourself with the lowest level fire based DD.  About PvP i have a 51 ranger.. and just started to play a shaman because rangers are not really needed at higher levels until AM3/EQ but on Sullon its very very hard if not nearly impossible to get to 59 and 40AA's without a group, which as a good team member is my choice... About overpowering in pvp.. 5k+ HT SK's are overpowering, Deathtouch necros? never actually encountered one of these but necro's have some instant kill feature like SK's, Manaburn Wizzies, Supposedly AM3/EQ rangers..but still took a 65 ranger with AM3/EQ the length of Neth Lair to kill me so i beg to differ.  After that everyone is probably even.. but to be able to one shot kill someone who is the same level is kind of harsh... especially when you lose exp.</div></div><hr />
