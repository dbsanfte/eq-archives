Had 166557 instead of 166552, take another look, much different now :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1. Earrings. It is generally accepted that the racially smithed Imbued ivory earrings are better than forest loops (forest loops sell to vendors for about 300 plat each, so you will be able to pay for the Imbued Ivory ones easy awith change to spare)<br />
<br />
2. Helm. Totemic helm is great....when you are level 30. Presumably you have faction with either Thurgadin or Kael Drakkel - do the helm quest for whichever one it is.<br />
<br />
3. Rings. Get a Shadel Bandit ring and have the best of both worlds<br />
<br />
4. Wrists. That supple scale armband sux the big bikkie. Even a Jarsarth bracer is heaps better. Get Jarjar or just about anything else for that matter. Personally, I would be spending heaps of time grouping in the arena in KD and getting plent of the corroded chain drops<br />
<br />
5. Shoulders. If you like AC, you could solo a tattered mantle, if you like wisdom, solo a sonic wolf hide - that Lizard mantle doesnt cut it<br />
<br />
6. Back. Cloak of the Icebear or even a totemic cloak might be better than this.<br />
<br />
7. Belt. Cant you get some belt stuff from VL?<br />
<br />
8. Legs. Kromriff Military leggings might be marginally better, and are easy, but likeI say, only marginal<br />
<br />
9. Boots. You do have the dire wolf booties dont you?</div></div><hr />

<br />
At Level 51? I don't see how I could reasonably solo Gullerback at Level 55. He can be as high as Level 51 (better hope he doesn't summon you), runs at SoW speed, is basically unslowable, and cannot be rooted or snared. I suppose you might get lucky and be able to kill him by pet kiting for 20 minutes without any adds or your pet dying before you can get back aggro.<br />
<br />
Easiest way I've found to kill him without a Cleric and a good tank is to find a Necromancer and take turns kiting the Necro pet while the other drops on DoTs and tries to get aggro.<br />
<br />
Am I missing something here? Does the Tattered Mantle drop somewhere else?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sorry to be misleading about the tattered mantle - perhaps I underestimate Gullerback. I am lower level that you, and I kind extrapolated that you might be able to take him solo....We dropped him 2 times as a trio of 41 druid, 46 Rogue, 44 Shaman (me), but maybe we got lucky?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I don't know, I might just suck. How did you take him down with that trio? Did it involve kiting him? If so, I can understand how you killed him, but it's not an option for a soloing Shaman since Gullerback runs at SoW speed. Since he really can't be snared, rooted, or slowed, and I don't think Druid/Shaman healing at those levels could keep the Rogue alive while tanking Gullerback, I'm curious as to how you killed him. Also, he might vary more in level than I thought - after one of the higher level versions stunned me a few times (ouch) I've never let him get within melee range since then, so perhaps he is sometimes considerably weaker and I just haven't let him hit me to find out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">our tactic was as follows:<br />
<br />
Drood = sit down and look at book with all wisdom gear on (i.e. poor man's cleric)<br />
<br />
Rogue = pet number 1<br />
<br />
Shaman pet = pet number 2<br />
<br />
Shaman = main tank (a.k.a. the olympic runner)<br />
<br />
Shaman pulls with best debuff and trys to channel a slow thru first hit(s) then Shaman takes off running in a big circle around druid<br />
<br />
Guller will aggro on shaman (they dont like malxxx debuff and togors much) and chase shaman, but should not actually be able to catch you. Rogue and pet run along behind guller chewing his ass off or nipping at his heals<br />
<br />
Guller WILL turn on  Rogue (pet &quot;no taunt&quot;), in which case Rogue starts running in big circles around druid, shamn stops and as Rogue runs past lets rip with another dot. Usually this will be enough to get aggro back on shammy who can then run around again, if not, let the rogue run another lap and then launch another dot and then you WILL get the aggro back...<br />
<br />
<br />
...shaman continues running around druid with pet and rogue chewing Gullerbackside...when Guller aggroes to Rogue repeat as above....<br />
<br />
...Dead Gullerback<br />
<br />
So, the druid is there to keep everyone healed and to read their book heh heh<br />
<br />
It sounds complicated, but it isn't particularly hard really once you have got it down pat (but, yes, we did ALL die the first time we tried it!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hehe, yeah that's exactly what my group did to kill him over and over again: we just kited him around in circles, exchanging aggro. I'm just not sure how well it would work solo since (a) our pet doesn't really do that much damage and (b) I doubt our pet could survive repeated beatings from Gullerback as we tried to get off slow/DoTs to regain aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Smylee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Park pet on a wall somewhere.<br />
Sow him, haste him.<br />
Pull gullerback with insid decay (lvl 54? been a while)<br />
Channel plague.<br />
Run around a bit to let regrowth build you back up in hp, he hits hard.<br />
Almost outrun him, stop, keep trying to cast eb on him til it sticks.<br />
Start running again.<br />
When you can, stop and canni2 a coupla times.<br />
When EB wears off, repeat line 6.<br />
When plague wears off, repeat line 6 with plague.<br />
Run over to pet. <br />
Pet will attack cause he's already beaten on you while you were channeling your first plague.<br />
Run round in circles (all this near a wall so you reduce adds. If you get an add, root it and run away - lazy agro so powa). Woofer will chew on guller. Make sure pet no-taunt thing, and if he by chance draws agro, cool. you can EB him again without getting beaten on.<br />
<br />
If he summons, gate =)<br />
