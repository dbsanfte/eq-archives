<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">nothing real new, i been rootdotting 4 mobs at a time for ages :)<br />
just a change, wish i had snare tho :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If I ever see a shaman quad kiting for anything other than laughs, or to say they can do it, then I will prolly cry.  Just like when I saw a 60 shammy in full wis gear who had like 600 ac.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I didn't quad kite. I quad tanked shrooms in FG. Pull four, slow em all, dot em all and (no not rule them all), nuke them all down with JBB. Been there done that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Yesferatu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">maybe if we had a stronger aoe dot spell.<br />
As it stands now, we're better off casting the poison AOE rain spell than quad dotting.<br />
<br />
Wihtout a snare and dots take too long to be effective.<br />
<br />
It CAN be done, but its a waste of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well, ive known shammys that quad pet-kited HG's in rathe, heh..<br />
<br />
of course he was 49, so it was more for loot anyway(well..i guess all HG killing is for loot anyways :)</div></div><hr />

LMAO. My 55 Enchanter has 689 self-buffed AC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Unless your defense is under 70 or so, I think it's physically impossible to have near 600 AC at level 60 with any sort of gear at all on. Naked at 60 we have like 550ish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have erm . . 545 ac naked.  But that's with max defense.  I've seen plenty of lvl 50+ shamans with close to 600 AC and wearing some JB.  Saw a shaman with JB legs and a few other nice pieces but only 120 defense and thus 670 AC.  <br />
<br />
Idiots who neglect defense skills pay the price.   It's not hard to tell the difference between a good shaman and one whose AC sucks.   People notice when the shaman can't take a hit.  Those of us who know what it's all about have given shamans a reputation for being tougher than the normal caster.  People EXPECT us to be tough.  If you aren't tough tho, this makes your life a lot more difficult and people will think you suck.</div></div><hr />

Maxxed Defense at 200 for quite sometime now....just trained my first point in Dodge at lvl 48 - quite embarrased about it so I threw about 40 pts of training into it.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I used to quad-fear-kite stuff in OT using blind, dots, and our pet :)<br />
<br />
What Landragon said is 100% correct.  I myself have worked very hard on trying to improve the image of shammies on my server.  Whnever I'm in seb, I always make my group let me pull.  I always impress a few groupmates when I pull 3 krup knights and only one of them is slowed, and I only take a bubble of damage before they get mezzed :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>DanninSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">just duel someone that has a blue con pet and let the pet beat on you to train your defense, if you have neglected it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'd been wondering how the heck to get my defence up! I almost always group or duo, and as such rarely find myself aggroing much and even when I do defence goes up soooo slowly. Nearly level 44 now so  its getting important!<br />
<br />
I'll find a friend with a pet and try it out!<br />
<br />
Cheers</div></div><hr />
