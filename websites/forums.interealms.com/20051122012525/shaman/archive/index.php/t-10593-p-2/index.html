<br />
Let me ask you something.  You two keep harping on the term &quot;damage over time&quot; which I agreed was quite clear.  No one is going to dispute with you on the definition of English words here.  We are not kindergarden kids here harping on the meaning of English words.<br />
<br />
However, let's assume everyone reading this board has some form of intelligence and can practise lateral thinking.<br />
<br />
There are two possibilities here:<br />
<br />
(1) SOE keeps using the wrong term &quot;damage over time&quot; spells when they actually meant to include malo, slow and such spells.  <br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
(2) They really only intended to include &quot;DAMAGE over time&quot; spells.<br />
<br />
<br />
The fact that they :<br />
<br />
(1) let it remained that manner for 9 months;<br />
(2) keep introducing new items that also behave in the same manner;<br />
(3) send out mixed signals, e.g. 19 Nov Patch<br />
<br />
which would you conclude?<br />
<br />
In the court of law, do you think judges will play words with you or you think judges would consider the circumstances or evidences of the case?<br />
<br />
Do you conclude that (1) SOE devt. team is a bunch of lazy and insensitive *******s who would leave something so important unattended or that perhaps (2) they have been using the wrong term conveniently?<br />
<br />
Now we have to see whether (1) or (2) is true.<br />
<br />
Assuming if they do not want to change back the affliction foci items, perhaps they can reduce the casting time of Malos and Turgurs?<br />
<br />
For all the supposedly 'improvements' to the game, shamans are now only good for buffing and debuffing in the high end game.  Well ok, since that is what we are good at, for what's worth and for our self-worth, many of us put in lots of efforts and pp to 'enhance' our debuffing capabilities.<br />
<br />
And after 9 months of evidence, we dished out pp and time to get affliction foci items.  What do we get?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sinjuneq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have cancelled my pre-order on the expansion. I will not be buying anymore expansions. SWG coming out and I will certainly be checking it out. If not there, then somewhere else. <br />
<br />
I have played EQ for almost 3 years now and I am tired of this crap! Since PoP came out, shaman have been kicked in the teeth every time we turn around. <br />
<br />
I spent 3 hrs in PoV tonight watching the MA get the hell beat out of him before I could get the mob slowed. Can I be to a group, what I was prior to the last patch? Nope. Might as well call me for buffs and tell me to go on my way! Let the enchanters take the slows now and the druids take the backup heals or hell even main healer with their almost 5k hp heal they have been given. Oh, wait, I forgot, we have been given an alchemy trophy....now that might change my mind....yea right!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wisey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I read this post from another forum and thought it was a good post.....and brought it here.<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
We have taken nerf after nerf in PoP.<br />
<br />
First we start out with useless AAs (save radiant cure)... things like hastened rabidity... NO ONE GETS RABID BEAR. It's a slap in the face for us. Suspend minion was kinda cool till we realized we can't even zone with the pet... Spirit call is a fun toy but that's it. Disease based root... marginally useful.<br />
<br />
Then we find out that they are adding slow mitigation. Our bread and butter... our slow, is being gimped. Not only can we get a single resist and instantly get pounded into a grease spot on the floor, or just have a mob immune, now we can get a &quot;partial&quot; resist. Many of us dealt with this and moved on with life, with minimal grumbling.<br />
<br />
Then we started getting more levels and realized that our precious spectral parchments could be turned in for a single target strength or dexterity buff. None of us will EVER cast this. If a cleric wanted single target dex/str, kunark spells would be more than enough for them. Wasting spectral parchments on this is another slap in the face.<br />
<br />
On top of all of this, in PoP, fights were tuned to be shorter (overall a good idea), but no thought was given to our primary method of damage output in PoP. In fact, rather than give us higher dps but over a shorter time, they gave us a dot that lasts almost twice as long as our last longest dot. Our DoTs are completely broken in PoP... not only are they too much aggro, they are just not worth casting because the mob is dead a few seconds after it lands, and it's just wasted mana. I don't dot mobs in PoP unless I'm soloing.<br />
<br />
Our &quot;massive mana regeneration&quot; is a joke too. Sure, we regen mana faster, but all of our buff mana costs were not only increased, but our buff lengths were shortened!.<br />
<br />
Then we look at our gimped heals. They add better healing to the priest classes, and gimp the one they gave us &quot;because we have slow&quot;, and then proceed to gimp our slow with the slow mitigation nerf, and now this nerf as well.<br />
<br />
Now we get this. They call it &quot;Affliction Efficiency&quot;.. or &quot;Extended Affliction&quot;, yet they don't allow it to apply to Afflictions such as slow, malo, root, mez, etc.<br />
<br />
I speak for probably 95% of the shaman community when I say that we need some changes, and for the better. Suggestions:<br />
<br />
1. Undo this affliction focus nerf, OR<br />
2. Refund us our plat or trade us for items considering the DKP/plat/time cost to get what we have AND add a new line of focus to handle &quot;non-dot affliction&quot;<br />
<br />
I enjoy playing everquest, but without some continuity in your plans for the future, how are players supposed to plan for the future? Should I retire my shaman and make a &lt;insert other class here&gt; or are you going to take something significant away from them too in the near future?<br />
<br />
Gearing up for the high end game isn't as easy as typing /bazaar and searching for items with &lt;stat&gt; on it. It requires guild raids into hard to get places... significant time investments, as well as DKP investments. I personally have spent a long time gearing up my shaman, yet now I'm going to have to look at other options AGAIN. When focus came out, many of us shamans dropped hp/ac gear for focus gear because it really made a difference... yet now it does not.<br />
<br />
This needs to be undone. If you want to nerf charm, limit affliction focus to not work on charm spells.<br />
<br />
All of that said, here's the best reason possible: Your bottom line.<br />
<br />
I and MANY others will not be buying Legacy of Ykesha if we can't get some basic satisfaction in general.<br />
<br />
I hope you'll keep this in mind. Remember, we are the customer, and without us, you don't eat. It might pay to take care of us instead of blow us off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gorck Da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I posted once earlier today, and have read all the posts since then to catch up on this issue. This issue is a big deal to us, and cannot be forgotten until someone addresses this with something more than &quot;Oops, tough crap, cope&quot; (ala Absor). I've seen patch messages where they have addressed issues brought up by druids, bards, etc time and time again, yes I see the shaman class in decline with damn near every patch. <br />
<br />
Absor / Dev Team :<br />
<br />
You need to address these issues NOW please. The shaman community will not sit by and just let you bend us over any more. We have posted again and again about this issue, and this is not the first issue that needed addressing, but this is definitely the one that is going to cost you the most customers.<br />
<br />
1. Recent nerf. Reverse it, correct it, replace our focus items, change our spells, replenish our plat. You have all the control here, you have all the options, choose one and give it to us. This is not unreasonable for what has been done. And damnit, if you wanted to fix DoTs, fix the spells themselves or give us REAL AA that will work for us.<br />
<br />
2. Fix Alchemy. 1/2 the reason I created a shaman was for this cool ability. Then I find out that it's gimped and lame. Your recent attempts at dazzling us with a trophy did not work, and will continue to not work.<br />
<br />
3. Fix our AA. Rabid Bear? Get off the damn crackpipe. Give us something that will help us with what we REALLY do in the endgame. (some of us do actually tank and might use the rabid bear, bad exampe). But, something that would be a LOT more useful is a slow AA, or a Malo AA, or a haste/efficiency AA to affect just those spells. <br />
<br />
4. Spells. Ethereal spells need work. STR/DEX buffs are NOT NOT NOT NOT NOT NOT NOT NOT NOT NOT NOT NOT NOT NOT needed in the damn ethereal tables.<br />
<br />
Realistically, I don't think that most shaman are angry that the change was made, other than it took so long to 'fix' this bug. If the true problem were addressed (all our rebalancing issues have now been nerfed out and we're back to where we were with the Velious patches, no AA that truly enhances our endgame abilities) I think we could all be happy. We were willing to accept the focus working with slow/malo, etc as a workaround and leave it at that. But, now you've castrated our class in the post 50 range again. Sure we can still function at that level, but all the other casters have some sort of edge after they've hit 50 . . . we do not any longer.<br />
<br />
We're not unreasonable (as a whole). We just want what is due us for slogging through 50+levels of work. EVERY other casting class, hell every other class period gets some TRULY beneficial AA or can use a focus item to enhance their endgame performance specifically. We don't have anything but the general Mana Pres, and those are hard enough to come by without fighting over it with every other class. So let's here what you're going to do for us. We want OURS. Stop ignoring this issue, because it will NOT go away, unless you're prepared to lose a fairly decent portion of your gaming community over this issue.<br />

Its pretty dang simple. Detrimental should not mean only damaging spells. Malo, slow, snare, mezz are all things that would be 'detrimental' to a mob and have a duration. If they want to fix this then lower the percentage that these items effect, but don't remove their effects from debuffs.</div></div><hr />

Hmmm, looks like those are detrimental to me according to your beloved Lucy (http://lucy.fnord.net) . <br />
<br />
I raided today and I didn't die once due to this nerf, however, watching BoT giants get to 75% before slow landed due to the extended cast times and then having to cann all that mana back so I could be ready for the next pull made me feel like I could be more useful playing another class and just letting a chanter slow.  I provided no damage whatsoever to help the raid move along faster and it makes me feel semiuseless.<br />
<br />
I almost didn't log on to raid due to this, but after seeing the other 3 of our guild shaman decide to take a break coincidentally along with the nerf, left me to either not log on, and them possibly not raid, or log on and feel like a gimp.  I am loyal to the guild, so I just sucked it up and maloed, slowed, canned and buffed for a few hours. Yay!  No dot's, no nukes, nothing else but malo, slow, cann.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please, explain to me why a player-made item that sells for 15k in the Bazaar should be far better than the best detrimental spell foci from both VT and PoP.  Blaze of the Lightbringer is 20% haste.  So how is it balanced that any unguilded player with a bit of plat can pick up a 33% haste item?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I honestly don't see this as a (major) nerf to the power of a shaman but that really isn't the point. <br />
<br />
This wasn't a balance issue (at least as far as the shaman debuffs were concerned), SoE has as much as admitted that this was aimed at charm kiting and the rest was just a by-product. Which makes it worse in my opinion. The fact that they're quite willing to invalidate 100s of hours of play from some people (not me thankfully) by nerfing an entire line of focus items into uselessness and the only feedback you get is that condoscending little post from Absor is what bothers me. <br />
<br />
The fact that SoE is too lazy to fix their code with a scalpel instead of a chainsaw is what bothers me. <br />
<br />
If they care so little for the time their players have invested in something, what does that tell you about the developers? That's a question everyone will have to answer for themselves but I don't think it bodes well for the future of EQ. If I can't make intelligent choices about things like what class I want to play (see monk nerf) and what equipment I want to buy/quest/raid for because there's a good chance that a few months from now SoE will change the rules, why bother? And I say that as someone who usually agreed with their changes (even if the monk nerf did go overboard).</div></div><hr />

But to try to blame a casual player for not memorizing every<br />

<br />
 I quit EQ before focus items existed and came back post PoP.  Heh I had to ask what this new-fangled KEI thing was.  I saw focus items-cool- and have gotten a few.  Now they are next to worthless in any group situation.  And this is MY FAULT.  No, its not my fault and the sky isn't falling- but SOE's response is almost beyond belief.<br />

I don't care if SoE announced anything. The information politics of those people was bad right from the start. It was always their Vision(TM), that player shouldn't get inside information about in-game mechanics. This is the part which messes with the player base.<br />

For someone who bases his whole arguement on a 9 month old patch message, what part of 'Affliction 4 is now working as intended' didn't you understand? Not that I think that quote is any more meaningful than the original one 9 months ago but that's beside the point. If you're going to base everything on the gospel according to Sony in their patch messages, it's kinda hard to ignore the ones that invalidate your arguement. <br />

Removing the shaman's ability to use affliction focus on debuffs effectively makes them negatively unbalanced in PoP.  And I think you'll find the most vocal bitterness coming from those in middle high-end raiding guilds, those who are not yet able to get the high end focus items from Sol Ro's Tower.  <br />
<br />
The removal of debuffs from affliction focus did not affect me greatly.  I'm just beginning to be of a level where it would have helped.  However, this is just the latest in a trend that I've been seeing.  The high end just isn't appealing to me, as I'm sure it isn't to other shaman.  There are already fewer shaman around than many other classes.  I don't see the point in running off more of the population by making the class less and less useful at the high end.</div></div><hr />

I am pissed at the reduction in power my class has due to the change.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
When are some of you going to realize this is NOT a reduction in power to your class.  This IS a reduction in power to you toon because you chose to base your equipment selection on focus items.  I know shamans it didn't affect because they didn't chase down all the focus items they could.  If you are going to argue for something at least get the argument right.  Quit calling it a class nerf because its not.  That would be one that affects you regardless of the equipment you have on.<br />
<br />
And I can't understand why everyone is thinking it will make them ungroupable either.  When was the last time you heard of a Shaman LFG for very long.  Guess you are mainly upset because you think you are going to be a second choice to a chanter now.  Well all I can say is get over it because there are plenty of classes that have a harder time finding groups.  Stop and think about it do you heard someone shouting for a Warrior.  No they shout for a tank which can be several classes.  Most of them would agree that it would be nice to only have one other class to compete with for a spot in a group.  Then think of all the damage dealing classes they are pretty much interchangeable.  There are certain ones you want more but you will settle others.<br />
<br />
After that is all said I still don't like the change it makes it harder on everyone involved.  A less efficient slower means a less efficient group, which means less xp and/or loot.<br />
<br />
And one last thought.  Its kind of ironic when you think of it.  If people wouldn't have been complaining so much about the classes charm kiting this might have never happened.  So the next time you start complaining about a class being too powerful you should think about how it might eventually affect you.  Especially when it comes to nerfing items that you use yourself.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">OK<br />
I will try to state my position again...try to see it it please?<br />
<br />
My position is based on FACTS<br />
<br />
Lets take the two conflicting patch messages.<br />
<br />
One from June 02 CLEARLY states that Affliction is NOT meant to work with slow-malo....this is indisputable fact...written clearly in black and white.<br />
<br />
The second from Nov 02( this is relevant because there -was- a 6 month period people were still gambling that this bug would not change) This patch states working as intended....One could argue that these effects have ALWAYS worked as intended, since they do work with dots as well. Now, this may be extremely difficult for some to understand, but even though the facts remain that affliction -did- work with slow yet they said working as intended doesn't immediately counter their position that its SHOULDN'T work with slow. The gray area here is that indeed it -is- working as intended on the spells it was intended on, yet its STILL an interpretation by the player, that its suppose to work with slow, since Sony did not say specifically it was suppose to work with slow....ever. Do you get it?<br />
<br />
Sony did not lie to you, you lied to you.<br />
<br />
Im focusing on FACTS once again...just so were on the same page.<br />
<br />
Lets take a step back and just look at the effects themselves...<br />
<br />
Do you honestly think that a shaman with Affliction focus is balanced(meaning equal to) say, a wizard with spell haste and mana pres? I mean the numbers alone should tell you that this was not meant to be.....give me one focus(especially on par with X 3 items) that will give any caster a 33% faster cast on the majority of his spells. In relative power I fail to see how anyone thinks thee focuses are &quot;balanced&quot; with the benefits other classes get from similar focus's.<br />
<br />
Edit:one thing I do agree on this was not fair of Sony....but reality check....life's not fair...and if you dont take the time to become aware of your surroundings...your libel to get burn every once in awhile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Swiftfox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Evel, since you like the dictonary<br />
<br />
Usage: Affliction, Sorrow, Grief, Distress. Affliction and sorrow are terms of wide and general application; grief and distress have reference to particular cases. Affliction is the stronger term. The suffering lies deeper in the soul, and usually arises from some powerful cause, such as the loss of what is most dear -- friends, health, etc. We do not speak of mere sickness or pain as ``an affliction,'' though one who suffers from either is said to be afflicted; but deprivations of every kind, such as deafness, blindness, loss of limbs, etc., are called afflictions, showing that term applies particularly to prolonged sources of suffering. Sorrow and grief are much alike in meaning, but grief is the stronger term of the two, usually denoting poignant mental suffering for some definite cause, as, grief for the death of a dear friend; sorrow is more reflective, and is tinged with regret, as, the misconduct of a child is looked upon with sorrow. Grief is often violent and demonstrative; sorrow deep and brooding. Distress implies extreme suffering, either bodily or mental. In its higher stages, it denotes pain of a restless, agitating kind, and almost always supposes some struggle of mind or body. Affliction is allayed, grief subsides, sorrow is soothed, distress is mitigated.<br />
<br />
Syn: Calamity; sorrow; distress; grief; pain; adversity; misery; wretchedness; misfortune; trouble; hardship<br />
<br />
By definition I think that &quot;affliction&quot; should apply to all &quot;detrimental&quot; spells. But what do I know, I don't work for that particular Evil company.<br />
<br />
 I think the real complaint is about SOE, and they way they treat the people who make their paychecks possible.</div></div><hr />

You are essentially ignoring any sort of constructive argument against this statement again and again...  I remember them saying Affliction would be all detrimental spells as well... they can change thier minds... people here are trying to do that by giving alternatives so thier time spent on aquiring items would not be wasted on spells that they never cast.  I dont see why this is so hard for you to grasp.  But go ahead and take all VI states as scripture... they once firmly stated Alchemy was not broken when it plainly was.</div></div><hr />

Very good point about the definition of affliction...good read. To address your other point though, Im not sure why most everyone is obsessed with this idea that Sony is, for some unknown reason, TRYING to make this game unenjoyable for you. Im actually pretty fascinated with the amount of Sony discontent here....<br />
<br />
Ill give you a nice quote to think about....<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you ever write what you call wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
Meaning its real easy from the cheap seats to sit back and criticize every move Sony makes...but really, if you stop and think about it...they give you a pretty damn complex piece of entertainment for 12$. Now thats total opinion...take it as you will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Swiftfox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Actualy my point was the definition, not the added thought about what &quot;I&quot; think the real problem is.  Sony has made a lot of improvents,  no doubt there. The've also made mistakes and stealth nerfs, compounded with  turning every paying player into a test player Please just port my toon over to test, so at least I'll get a discount. (OOoh like 3 bucks? there's incentive.. /sarcasm off)</div></div><hr />

Atarak ... I imagine since you do research daily to keep up with the changes to your class that you are undoubtably aware of the following:<br />
<br />
1. VI actively states that using the spdat as a source of information is against their policy.<br />
<br />
2. VI has stated that the contents of the spdat file are not to be used to reflect the actual contents of the game.  They have gone so far as to place erroneous data in the spdat file to confuse people.<br />
<br />
3. The spdat &quot;interpreter&quot; you see at Lucy is simply one persons interpretation of the data contained in the spdat file.  What this means is anything you read there is the association that persons &quot;guess&quot; about what the data in the spdat file means rather than a direct association.  Granted, it is generally a pretty good interpretation but it has been wrong in the past and will be wrong in the future.<br />
<br />
4. Since you seem to be very good at interpreting the spdat file and you fully support what is stated on the Lucy site ... I have a quick question for you regarding one of my focus items ..<br />
<br />
Accursed Extension:<br />
Slot Description <br />
1:  Increase Spell Duration by 20% <br />
2:  Limit: Max Level(65) <br />
3:  Limit: Spell Type(Detrimental only) <br />
4:  Limit: Effect(Complete Heal (with duration) excluded) <br />
5:  Limit: Effect(Invunerability excluded) <br />
6:  Limit: Min Duration(24.0 sec) <br />
7:  Limit: Effect(Hitpoints allowed) <br />
<br />
I was just wondering when they were going to enable the usage of my Accursed Extension item for all the cleric spells.  I mean clearly from slot descriptions 4 and 5 this focus item was mean to be used with healing spells coupled of course with the slot 7 description implying that spells which grant HP should be affected.<br />
<br />
Thanks for you time, I know you are horribly busy working out quantum mechanics in your spare time.<br />
<br />

(not counting 14% sales tax) need a few puter upgrades too keep playing.. now lets tally the subscription fees,  (will be a few figureing that out dunno what year/month I started playing now ... ) +$670ish Canadian. Almost $1000 playing a game.. more if you include PC improvements and ISP fee's but that's not going into Sony's pocket. Sure its not much per day but it could be a lot more over time if they keep me as a customer happy. That's the bottom line.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your position is based on facts?  <br />
<br />
What is 9 months of slow, malo, 1 new expansion and many new affliction lvl 4 items affecting slow and malo in the mean time to you?  These are not facts?  You trying to tell us all of us were dreaming in the last 9 months?<br />
<br />
Verant has stated many things before. Why do you neglect things that they said too.  Well, they have often urged players to discover things for ourselves in the game. <br />
<br />
The issue is this: Verant has sent out conflicting signals to us.  Which is more convincing?  A few lines in the last 12 months, or the fact that thousands of players in game in the last 9 months have items that worked for malo, slow, bought 1 expansion, uncover new items that worked for malo and slow too.<br />
<br />
Which evidence is stronger?<br />
<br />
You still don't realise you are silly to waste our time by harping on 2% of what Verant did to tell us that it should not work vs 98% of what they did to convince us that affliction foci items should affect debuff spells too.<br />
<br />
It's not too late to admit it before everyone concludes worst thing about you.  Time to consider all facts yourself and not harp on 2 or 3 sentences given to us by Verant.<br />
<br />
Your case is so weak that either you are not intelligent enough to realise it or you are trying very hard just to defend Verant for other reasons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Um your opinion is based, if we are going by the dictionary, your world view. Your facts are not necessarily THE facts.<br />
<br />
The facts are that as an apologist for Absor, you could probably make money here taking the heat for him, you are stating his opinion based on what corporate marketing are telling him to say. Now where did the word marketing ever equate to the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Look at Zanithar(sp) post on Casters realm enchanter class forum, sorry forgot VI never goes there, and see the real, for the really dumb that was sarcasm, description of how this occurred.<br />
<br />
Saving arse by pretending you are fixing something that isn't broken isn't a fact it is distortion and overriding.<br />
<br />
Now I could get on my high horse but people who say things like the quote above are here to broadcast propaganda not engage in genteel discourse and the venting of anger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">At this point it is very clear that sony does not care. They are taking your money (I say your money because my account is now canceled. This was not due to this nerf, it is due to the fact I have no time to play with my new job). If you are no longer enjoying the game, then stop paying for it. We as a shaman community have voiced complaints, suggestions, and problems. All have gone across deaf ears. Show me 1 thing that Sony has seriously done for the shaman community in the last year that has made a differnce in our desires or gameplay that was not negitive. I belive that Everquest was a great game. It pushed the edge of what games were and what they will be. The next generation of games will be better having seen and learned from everquest's faults and successes. This issue is just proof that the major fault (not all that unknown) of Sony is that they do not know their own product. You will also see that they regard this as a little game and not a money making project. They have no vision. If they had vision they would see that their decisions here effect the next generation of pay to play games. When givin the choice of a new game I will choose not to play a game made by sony based on their practices. I will give the new guy a chance. Hopefully, he will have learned from Sony's mistakes and will think before acting.<br />
<br />
They need to understand that this is a buisness. I think they do not realize that as they repeatedly make decisions to hurt their own buisness.<br />
<br />
Sadly, my account has 6 months left on it. I hope that I still will find time to play as I do love the time I spend playing. I do hate to see people who's fun is ruined though. And I hate to know that I could of been one of those people had I spent the 25kp last weekend.<br />
<br />
To end, if you are not having fun, stop. Play another game. MOO 3 will be out soon, Shadowbane, America's Army. Take a break. See if you really like playing the game. If you don't, at least you will have more beer money :D</div></div><hr />
