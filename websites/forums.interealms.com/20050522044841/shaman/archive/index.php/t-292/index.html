<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Innatook</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Coming up on my first AA point and not sure where to put it. Everyone seems to automatically put into run3. Is it that much better? My wis is 199, i was thinking putting my first point in Wis to break to 200 barrier. Looking for some input. Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Floda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i know for sure it definitely is not worth the time for an AA point to waste in wis right off the bat.<br />
<br />
Maybe after youve gotten 100 of them...<br />
<br />
Run Speed &gt; all, especially if you're a dungeon crawler</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Put 1 point into Run 1 and then go 100% regular xp until level 60.  At most 3 points into Run 3, and that really isn't necessary, run 1 usually is more than enough to let you outrun most mobs indoors.<br />
<br />
No amount of AA skills will make you a better shaman than getting levels will.<br />
<br />
Putting points into Wisdom is a huge waste.  Wisdom is not that important to a shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Razco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ack ! dont use it on Wis ... Run1 .. all the way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Garreth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">first skill you should max is Run, go all the way up to run 3.  This will change how you play in doors, I love it.</div></div><hr />

If you don't do dungeons much yet, you will. Runspeed will help you overcome whatever anxieties you might have going into dungeons in the first place. If not into runspeed than at least put it into a useful stat like stamina or something. Wis is easy to raise with equipment over time, but there's no equipment that will allow you to run faster deep in a dungeon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Run Speed 3, Regen 3, Mental Clarity 3, Cannibalization.<br />
<br />
Of course, if the guild you are in would have requirement for mass group buff, you might want to go for that instead of canni first hehe. But, since you are only level 52 or so, I would recommend that you just finish out this first point, dump it into run speed, then go full on exp to get as high a level as possible as fast as possible. Levels &gt; all.</div></div><hr />
