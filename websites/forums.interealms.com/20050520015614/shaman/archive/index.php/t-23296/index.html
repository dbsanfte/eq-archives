Rytan plays a shaman :rolleyes: . Shaman have pets (not companions). There will be 2 zones in OOW, one of which will not be keyed (ok i made that up). The developers didn't know rangers had MGB AA (i didn't either). Spell aquisition will be like PoP but maybe easier.<br />
<br />
* Topic is 'Please join us tonight (August 24th) at 6pm PDT / 9pm EDT for a live chat with the developers of Everquest! ' <br />
* Set by Brannoc on Wed Aug 25 05:15:53 <br />
<br />
&lt;Brannoc&gt; Welcome to another great House of Commons chat with the developers of Everquest! The topic will be Omens of War so <br />
<br />
please try to ask questions around it. <br />
<br />
&lt;Brannoc&gt; So without further ado we'll start with a brief introduction from the developers, now would be a good time to send those questions. <br />
<br />
&lt;Rytan&gt; Hi everyone, I'm Ryan Barker a senior game designer on EverQuest <br />
<br />
&lt;Rashere&gt; Hey everyone. I'm Travis McGeathy, one of the game designers on EverQuest. <br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; Howdy, I am ALan Crosby also known as Brenlo <br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; and sometimes I go by Hey you <br />
<br />
&lt;Brannoc&gt; *Melisande_Luclin* Are there things in OoW that will be for all levels other than the Task System? <br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; good question <br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; Rytan is thinking up an answer <br />
<br />
&lt;Rytan&gt; The task system is the only content of the expansion that’s geared towards “ALL” levels but it’s very far reaching. The system has a lot of content that causal players are going to be able to enjoy at all levels. <br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; His keyboard is on fire <br />
<br />
&lt;Rytan&gt; The new zones for the expansion are geared for levels 45-70 and generally accessible to all players. There’s only one keyed zone in the expansion. It’s a lot like Velious in that regard. <br />
<br />
&lt;Brannoc&gt; *Subu* What are the plans for continued development of Everquest after OoW is released or will there be a major push for Everquest 2? <br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; We have already planned out the next 18 months of EQ development and have lots planned for the future. EQ and EQ2 will run concurrently and there are no plans to make anyone switch games. We want you to continue to enjoy EQ for years to <br />
<br />
come. <br />
<br />
&lt;Brannoc&gt; (Please remember to focus your questions to the Omens of War expansion when sending to our QT's!) <br />
<br />
&lt;Brannoc&gt; *Pumra* will a level 1 be able to use the task system? <br />
<br />
&lt;Rytan&gt; You actually do have to be at least level 3 to get a task, but with the new tutorial you’re probably going to be level 5 before you even get out of the tutorial. So it’s really available to everyone almost immediately. <br />
<br />
&lt;Brannoc&gt; *Fanon_EMarr* Will we continue to see rune-style spell turn-ins in OoW or will there be a return to the actual dropped spells? In addition, will any spells besides transit-relate be available from vendors at release? <br />
<br />
&lt;Rytan&gt; The spell acquisition system for Omens is going to be a lot like the PoP system, except that you’ll get a different rune for each level set, and you won’t get repeats of the same spell when you turn them in. We don’t plan on having any non-travel spells on vendors at release. <br />
<br />
&lt;Brannoc&gt; *Bigfan* Once OoW goes live, where should I go, or what should I do first? <br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; Where should you go? Whereever you want =) Provided you are of appropriate level. You could start on your epic 2. Do some tasks. Try some of the new tradeskill recipes or start working on the new AAs or levels. Personally, I will be doing a few tasks. <br />
<br />
&lt;Brannoc&gt; *Grizumpy* In OoW is there going to be a wider variety of augments, for some focii that were left out of God, <br />
<br />
Currently there are only a few items that &quot;Extend Dot Duration&quot; and they are all in Planes of Power, Will OoW look to address the lack of certain focus/augs in GoD? <br />
<br />
&lt;Rytan&gt; Augments as well as traditional gear will have the foci available on a number of new pieces of equipment. Omens should offer a greater variety of items available for any foci that you’re looking for. <br />
<br />
&lt;Brannoc&gt; *Auricula* Will OoW have content soloable to level 70 for casual players who are not elemental-equipped. Will there be soloable instanced zones? <br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; We will not be adding any solo instanced features at this time. It is something that we are exploring but would take a tremendous amount of work and is not something we could do rapidly. <br />
<br />
&lt;Brannoc&gt; *MrGnomer* How tough will Magi pets be compared to now and how will current focus work on them? <br />
<br />
&lt;Rytan&gt; Mage pets are getting a solid boost from 66-70. There’s several mages in beta that are from the mage’s tower that have been working with me to help tune the pets for omens. This is also true of the necromancer, beastlord, shadowknight, shaman, and enchanter pets. Current foci will continue to work on the new pets. <br />
<br />
&lt;Brannoc&gt; *Darcreaper_7th* how does the tasks work and what do you get out of it once finished a task <br />
* <br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; Tasks put together a few elements that may require you to kill something, explore an area, or hail a certain NPC. Each time you will have a change of getting one of 3500 different tasks that result in an xp reward and perhaps some cash. <br />
<br />
&lt;Brannoc&gt; *Guest36* How much did input from the players factor in to the content of OOW (AA's, zones, ect.) <br />
<br />
&lt;Rashere&gt; Player input plays an important role in the design of any expansion. For Omens of War in particular, the feedback we received from players during previous expansions played a large role in the overall design of the expansion. <br />
<br />
&lt;Rytan&gt; The players in beta and on test are one of our most valuable resources when creating and tuning content. <br />
<br />
&lt;Rytan&gt; we've got lots of players that we're constantly talking to in regard to all aspects of the game. <br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; In fact, after gathering your feedback the team took many of the designs back to the drawing board and reworked much of the expansion. All thanks to you and your input. <br />
<br />
&lt;Brannoc&gt; *SDKSnowboy* Several rumors have been afloat as to leveling from 65 to 70. Will advancing to level 70 be based purely off of standard XPing, and will there be any Requirements, AA or otherwise, to achieve levels. <br />
<br />
&lt;Rytan&gt; Leveling from 65-70 will be exactly like leveling from 60-65. Traditional experience filling that little yellow and blue bar that you all know and love. <br />
<br />
&lt;Brannoc&gt; *zabab* Are you going to give ranger mgb AA? <br />
<br />
&lt;Rashere&gt; There are no plans at the moment to add Mass Group Buff to the Ranger AA list. <br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; Sorry Rangers <br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;Brannoc&gt; *Sobewiz* will OOW offer &quot;piggy back&quot; into zones that some members or recruits may not be flagged for, much like the Elemental Planes ? <br />
<br />
&lt;Rytan&gt; Yes there’s plans to allow recruits to be added more easily to the locked zone in Omens. I don’t want to go into <br />
<br />
detail as it’s not finalized yet, but it should be big improvement over what you had to do in the past to backflag players in PoP and Gates. <br />
<br />
&lt;Brannoc&gt; *Give_monks_more* The cost of aa's in oow... will they be like PoP or GoD in terms of pricing? Most ppl consider GoD aa's overpriced, and will there be any refund of GoD over priced aa's? <br />
<br />
&lt;Rashere&gt; The cost of AAs in Omens of War is not fixed at the moment, but I’m expecting them to be priced below the level of Gates AAs. I’ll be taking a look at the cost of Gates AAs in the near future and may make adjustments <br />
<br />
&lt;Brannoc&gt; *LoD_Tsar* How much of Omens content will be instanced? <br />
<br />
&lt;Rytan&gt; There’s instanced areas for each of the appropriate level ranges that Omens is set up to support for experience group content in addition to several static zones. There’s also a portion of the raid content that’s instanced as well, along with several static events/raids as well. Really it’s a mix of both types. <br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; Oh and Yes Rashere knows Rangers have MGB. It was his attempt at humor. . . =P <br />
<br />
&lt;Rashere&gt; shoulda added a smiley  <br />
<br />
&lt;Brannoc&gt; *Bahlec* what will the max ft that a char can aquire be? <br />
<br />
&lt;Rashere&gt; The maximum level of Flowing Thought in Omens is still under debate. <br />
<br />
&lt;Brannoc&gt; *strumsor* Hello, all the bards in my guild, myself included, am curious about the new charms in OOW - they seem very powerful. Could you give us a little detail into what the max level for charm is? thanks <br />
<br />
&lt;Rytan&gt; The final level limits for charm aren’t finalized yet, so I can’t tell you what they’ll be at release. They are in review and you can expect to see adjustments to those spells as beta progresses. <br />
<br />
&lt;Brannoc&gt; *Rykzz* What can we expect in OoW for the casual gamer who might not be even close to maxing out his avatar? <br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; Casual gamers will get lots of benefits from the task system. However the content is also very open and available for levels 45 and up. So there will be lots of room for pick up groups and xp groups without the need to raid. Only one <br />
<br />
zone in the expansion even requires a flag, so head on over and enjoy the new content, new items and new AAs. <br />
<br />
&lt;Brannoc&gt; *Nerfme* Are level 51 to 65 tasks going to be in game on release? <br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; We plan to at the moment but things can change. Watch for any announcements as we get closer to launch. <br />
<br />
&lt;Brannoc&gt; *Wemerwena-Quell* based on the negative feedback in the EQforums on everquestlive, will the devs change the class AA's before OOW goes live? <br />
<br />
&lt;Rashere&gt; The AA list on beta currently is a preliminary list that will be tweaked and tuned throughout the beta testing period. <br />
<br />
&lt;Rytan&gt; Again there's a lot of feedback coming from prominent members of the player community that are influencing our decisions as beta progresses. <br />
&lt;Rytan&gt; we're definitely not trying to make this expansion in a vacuum <br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; We also need to evaluate what is best for the game and all classes and not just one class. We do value your feedback on the AAs though and encourage you to continue to submit it. In a constructive manner please. =) <br />
<br />
&lt;Brannoc&gt; *Guest80* Will there be any high level frogs added so us frog levelers can keep up the trend in OoW for getting to 70? <br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; Well, we really would like you to go out and see more of the world than just the Froggie areas. Besides, you must be tired of frog legs by now. <br />
&lt;Rytan&gt; I play a froglock! &gt; <br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; He has warts and everything <br />
<br />
&lt;Brannoc&gt; *tearabite* Will tasks be only part of OoW. Or will the tasks require you to adventure all over Norrath? <br />
<br />
&lt;Rytan&gt; The task system will involved zones all across Norrath. It should give you some new reasons to visit those old zones that you might have been to in a long time. <br />
<br />
&lt;Brannoc&gt; *Saree3* How did you choose the name &quot;Omens of war&quot;? Previous expnasions carried the name of the continent mainly like Velious, Kunark &amp; Luclin. <br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; Well we wanted to sort of take a new direction with the naming conventions. We think you will like the new approach. . . <br />
<br />
&lt;Brannoc&gt; *Computer* How will the new bind/gate system work. It looks like there will be new secondary bind points for casters and melee will be able to gate. Is this correct? <br />
<br />
&lt;Rashere&gt; The Secondary Recall AA will recall the player to a point that is set by use of an item called a Stone of Marking. <br />
<br />
The stone has the same limitations as normal bind affinity. <br />
<br />
&lt;Rashere&gt; In addition, a general AA will allow any class to recall back to a friendly city. That point cannot be changed. <br />
<br />
&lt;Brannoc&gt; *locvz* Can we expect to see more zones similar to Kod`Taz in terms of loot, tradeskills, augments and experience in Omens of War? If so, will it (or they) be locked? How many locked zones are planned for Omens of War? <br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; There will be only 1 zone that requires a flag. Only 1. The rest of the zones will be open and populated with all kinds of fun monsters with great items. <br />
<br />
&lt;Brannoc&gt; *Garbar* Will we be able to BIND in OOW ? not being able to bind anywhere in GOD is a real pain, and everyone i play with dislikes it <br />
<br />
&lt;Rytan&gt; Bindable locations will be less restrictive then they were in Gates. You won’t be able to bind everywhere, but there will be a few locations that you can bind in. <br />
<br />
&lt;Brannoc&gt; *ramsly* hello  how will the epics compare to each other in the upcomming expantion and will the solo epic be worth the effort to get? <br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; We have laid out templates for each epic quest to make sure that each is comparable. No one class will have it easier than another. The epics will also be just as valued from class to class for their stats. I am not sure what you mean by solo epic. If you mean the epic 1.5 then yes it will be worth getting and will be a natural part of the quest progression. <br />
<br />
&lt;Brannoc&gt; *Naika* reguarding epic 2.0....will epic 1.0 be required in order to move on to 2.0? thanks  <br />
<br />
&lt;Rashere&gt; The original epics are not required in order to do the quests for the new ones, but possessing one of the original epics will allow you to skip some of the earlier steps. <br />
<br />
&lt;Brannoc&gt; *Jolo* what level and class characters do the developers of Omens play? <br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; We all play different classes and levels. I, for expample, have a high level Magician, while Rytan has a Bard, Monk and Shaman. Rashere plays with his foot hair. <br />
<br />
&lt;Rashere&gt; My erudite finds your halfling ways disturbing. <br />
<br />
&lt;Brannoc&gt; *Sylvene* What are your favorite pizzas? Anyone do anchovies? :p <br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; I do not do anchovies. I like those new BBQ pizzas. <br />
<br />
&lt;Rashere&gt; Why destroy such a wonderful creation by adding little fish? <br />
<br />
&lt;Rytan&gt; Peperoni Mushroom for the win! <br />
<br />
&lt;Brannoc&gt; For our final question of the night: *Sole9042* The new graphics in OoW look great! Will the new graphics effect anything other than the new content added? <br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; Well not yet is the short answer. Everything we build from now on will look that good or better. We are trying to <br />
<br />
figure out how to best get all of the other zones and monsters done. When we do, they would not be part of an expansion and would be available to all EQ players. <br />
<br />
&lt;Brannoc&gt; (Ok I lied) *naiche* will there be new visible titles before your name associated with OoW AA gain? <br />
<br />
&lt;Rytan&gt; We're working on plans to retrofit the old world areas with the new style art as time allows. <br />
<br />
&lt;Rytan&gt; that was for the one above BTW &gt; <br />
<br />
&lt;Rashere&gt; Omens of War introduces a new feature that allows characters to earn titles through various means and then choose which one they wish to display at any time. <br />
<br />
&lt;Brannoc&gt; And that's it for this one! Thanks for coming everyone, and be sure to join us next time around. If you didn't get your question in, try next time! The logs will be up on http://eq.stratics.com shortly. <br />
<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; Thanks all for coming and chatting with us. Thanks to Stratics and their team for setting this up. <br />
<br />

<br />
How can they do that when they are supposedly coming back to the players to find out where EQ has gone so badly off track?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What an amazing bit of PR fluff.<br />
<br />
They can point to it and say they are communicating. <br />
<br />
But they leave out that it is stritcly moderated. Controlled questioning. With a predesposed softball questioning system.<br />
<br />
I want to know how with only 1 keyed Zone they can give an awnser like :  Yes there’s plans to allow recruits to be added more easily to the locked zone in Omens. I don’t want to go into  <br />
<br />
It is one damn zone right. Of course it had better be a big improvement. <br />
<br />
<br />
I really love the Pet question. Witht his awnser. Mage pets are getting a solid boost from 66-70. There’s several mages in beta that are from the mage’s tower that have been working with me to help tune the pets for omens. This is also true of the necromancer, beastlord, shadowknight, shaman, and enchanter pets. Current foci will continue to work on the new pets.  <br />
<br />
Considering we don't have any Foci to use with our damn mutts. Unless they consider rusty daggers foci. <br />
<br />
And yeah since they have the plans worked out for the next 18 months then why the hell can't we get awnsers to simple questions like. <br />
<br />
What is a shamans role in a  group.<br />
<br />
What is a shamans role in a raid. <br />
<br />
How are they going to counter the complete loss of shaman deseriability in sprint fights that last for 30-45 seconds total. <br />
<br />
Why are our heals pegged to be substandard in every expansion. Especially when the mudflation gap has moved hybrids into healing roles and buffing roles comparable to ours.<br />
<br />
And possibly the most important question of all. <br />
<br />
Tell me exactly how SoE has changed. <br />
<br />
We get the same PR crap we got before Gates. The same stonewalling on previous issues, so they can push a new, unfinished, crap expansion upon us.  And once they finally get the damn thing functioning 6 months down the road there will be a new expansion being worked on that will consume the devs time yet again. But that next time they might wait a whole week before shovelling it down our necks because &quot;They really really really care this time.&quot;<br />
<br />
You have Time for bull**** PR fluff Why they hell don't you have time to awnser some god damn pointed questions.<br />
<br />
God damned hacks<br />

1)  Confirms only one locked zone.<br />
2)  PoP style spell distribution, with turn-ins that won't result in duplicate spells<br />
3)  Tasks usable at level 3+<br />
4)  More binding options than in Gates.<br />

8)  Reassessment of Gates AA costs is &quot;in scope&quot;. <br />
9)  Pets getting a bump<br />
<br />
I think OOW might shape up to be a very good expansion for a lot of dedicated critics of SOE.  We'll see.  The execution is obviously key; they simply can't drop the ball like they did in Gates.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Itzkul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">&quot;PoP style spell distribution, with turn-ins that won't result in duplicate spells&quot;<br />
<br />
Hmmm does this mean that they will not be sold in the bazaar, who is going to sell a spell they do not have in their spell book yet. The only way I can see this working is if you can turn in to an NPC of your choose for class spell. (like pop) Wonder what happens if I have all of my shaman spells and turn in another rune, does he eat it? What would work better is to make the runes droppable and have people sell those instead. I say this because I had to buy most of my pop spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tebion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">if i interpret that right itz, its a combination of pop and god spells, you get runes (but not 1 rune = random 5 spells from your class) which you can trade in at different npcs to get different classe's spells, which you can trade afterwards.<br />
so per spell one separate rune, like in god.<br />
<br />
at least i hope so, then the spells can be bought again, too (though i dont even want to start imagining the price in the beginning, hehe)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">hmm.. maybe they'll make the LDoN pet Foci augument shaman usable again, since our new pet will be effected by it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jormal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I as thinking that it's probably a common rune for each level for all classes and as you turn them in you get flagged as having that spell. It's an small integer value for each level so not much database info.<br />
<br />
If that's the way it works I'm sure there will be plenty of whining when OoW comes out about the spell order, but it's still better than random spells. If the runes are tradable all the better otherwise those that depend on the bazaar for spells are SoL.<br />

I think OOW might shape up to be a very good expansion for a lot of dedicated critics of SOE.  We'll see.  The execution is obviously key; they simply can't drop the ball like they did in Gates.<br />
Agree biggtime here Gart. I am actually optimistic. Although, I HIGHLY doubt the &quot;critics&quot; will be satisfied. New Rope syndrome and all that.<br />
<br />
One thing that I am waiting to see, though, is how they work the AA pricing. One BIG BIG part of AAs that people fail to realize is that they are NOT levels, and do NOT increase in xp-required as you aquire more. I am willing to bet that OoW has XP areas that will make KT (about 2.5 easy AA an hour at lvl 65) look puny. With this in mind, the amount of AAsneeded to get skills MUST go up, or people will sit in zones designed for the &quot;68-70&quot; push and score 5 AA an hour. I think the AAs in Gates are fairly balanced in price. The PoP &quot;standard&quot; is 3-6-9, and the PoP XP &quot;standard&quot; is about 1 aa an hour (for zones like BoT. More in EPs, less in PoD and PoN, etc). The Gates &quot;standard&quot; is 5-10-15, but even regular BoT groups can get nearly 2 aa an hour just XPing in Vxed or Tipt. If there are zones with MORE XP than KT (currently the &quot;best&quot; general area for XP) then a 3-6-9 AA pattern will make them too trivial IMHO.<br />
<br />
<br />
Other than that, I am satisfied that SOE is making an honest effort to FINALLY make the customers a bit more satisfied.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmmm does this mean that they will not be sold in the bazaar, who is going to sell a spell they do not have in their spell book yet. The only way I can see this working is if you can turn in to an NPC of your choose for class spell. (like pop) Wonder what happens if I have all of my shaman spells and turn in another rune, does he eat it? What would work better is to make the runes droppable and have people sell those instead. I say this because I had to buy most of my pop spells.<br />
<br />
There is one easy way I can think of to get duplicates, if it will be allowed. Assuming the spells will be tradeable.</div></div><hr />

I can not seem to find it, but I remember reading somewhere that focus IV effects will still work but at a reduced effect. I could be wrong.. at least it gives you an idea</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">They appear to scale to 70, making them not immediately worthless but making Time/GoD content pretty worthless for me. Why would I want to waste time/points in old content for focus effects which won't be as effective as OoW effects?<br />
<br />
My nice Chronostrum mask will work like an Eterninostrum at level 70 which is annoying as hell since I paid extra points for a nicer focus effect. I'm not spending another DKP on any Time/God focus (clickies still okay!) I've never been a fan of getting loot for &quot;right now&quot; I'm always thinking long term - Time/GoD loot isn't &quot;long term&quot; to me anymore.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see what the melees would say if their nice 41% Time haste items were 31% at level 70. Or if a 12% GoD backstab modifier was 8% at level 70. <br />
<br />
It's hugely punitive to make casters have to update every focus item when the level goes up. Heck, after 2 years since POP came out, I'm JUST NOW where I was focus-wise before the level limit was increased to 65.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Casual gamers will get lots of benefits from the task system. However the content is also very open and available for levels 45 and up. So there will be lots of room for pick up groups and xp groups without the need to raid. Only one zone in the expansion even requires a flag, so head on over and enjoy the new content, new items and new AAs. <br />
<br />
*Nerfme* Are level 51 to 65 tasks going to be in game on release? <br />
<br />
We plan to at the moment but things can change. Watch for any announcements as we get closer to launch. <br />
<br />
So at this point in time they are not even sure if 51-65 will be covered by the Task-system. And what about 65-70?<br />
<br />
I personally dont think &quot;lots of room for pick up groups&quot; sound very tempting. It sounds an awful lot like many people wont be able to do anything in OoW until the perfect-group-minus-one shows up.<br />
<br />
The &quot;brain&quot; that answered the question also made it sound like if you were higher than 45 then you arent casual.<br />
<br />
If you have to have 50-90 % Time+ loot to exp in the OoW zones I dont consider them non-raiding.<br />

So it will be more advantageous if you have the focus items to use the old spells that are boosted than the new spells that are not.

Tasks put together a few elements that may require you to kill something, explore an area, or hail a certain NPC. Each time you will have a change of getting one of 3500 different tasks that result in an xp reward and perhaps some cash.<br />
<br />
<br />
3500 different tasks huh.  Saying that in writing is pretty ballsy given that SoE has a horrible track record on quest implementation.  For any of you excited about this feature, don't hope for too much.  <br />

Wulf, honestly, I respect your opinions and I am also on your side in some regards. I sympathize with the plight of the NON-RAIDER (casual is NOT the correct term, please stop using it. There are many, many casual RAIDERS, I know, because I am one). <br />
<br />
But this type of bitterness is really lame Wulf. Seriously. No one cares who has access to what zones. So you found a couple raiders who were pissy about non-raiders having access to higher zones once. Big FN deal. As I pointed out on another thread, I would bet that 3/4 of the crucible regulars are raiders, and 95% of them DON'T CARE. Use that number as your barometer, ok? Stop insinuating that a couple people acting like asshats means ALL raiders don't give a sh1t about non-raiders. I said it before, MOST didnt even bother to post on the topic, which means MOST dont even care.<br />
<br />
Give it a rest Wulf. You really need to start looking in the mirror to figure out why you arent having as much fun, but stop blaming raiders.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">My problem with current focuses taking a hit is the fact that it will make EP/Time a LOT less attractive.  I don't get to raid often, and we recently made it into EP.  If old focuses take a hit, everyone will want to go to OOW instead to get the new focuses, and all my work flagging will be useless...<br />
<br />
And I'll never see a TA :(<br />
<br />
What makes you think that they dont know what they are doing for OoW? Just wondering?<br />
<br />
Hmm I dunno, maybe the fact that Omens was originally released a couple months after GoD hit, and they were obviously trying to rush it out so people could get 70 and handle GoD without them having to work to retune it.<br />
<br />
Or maybe the fact that they dodge every hard core question like those about focuses and yet STILL harass me with preorder screen over and over and over.<br />
<br />
Or maybe the fact that the CURRENT game is in such a sad state of affairs, and rather than looking at the problems, they are putting their &quot;fixes&quot; all between the levels of 65-70, thereby semi-forcing the populace to purchase this expansion and grind into the levels where things are finally a-okay, or at least close to it... and reinforcing the &quot;Destination, not the journey&quot; concept.<br />
<br />
I'm probably wrong though.  OOW will be released and it will not trivialize PoP, the storyline will be good, the expansion WONT be 95 percent instanced zones, and the gear I worked so hard to attain wont become trivial.  With two weeks left and so many OBVIOUS questions unanswered, and then a chat log like this with incredibly important points such as analyzing a task system for low levels, asking what they like on their pizza, and inquiring about mage pets just doesn't seem to do it for me.  <br />
<br />
I'm SOOO glad that I can make a newbie character and do a &quot;task&quot; at level 5, put anchovies on my pizza, have a boost in my mage pets' powers, watch the entire guild abandon flagging to go grind on epic 2.0, and look forward to a game life span that is both 18 months and &quot;years to come&quot; at the same time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Yeah a huge uproar..<br />
Well, I say this because I truly think the LARGEST single &quot;chunk&quot; of EQ population is &quot;High POP, trying to get KT&quot;, with many in Time, many in EPs, and many on the &quot;verge&quot; of the EPs. I think this is the big demographic that SOE targets, honestly. Look at the recent expansions. Super super high end broken, limited non-raid content. The &quot;Medium Level Raider&quot; is SOEs target audience, I think, and this nerf would HOSE us. I dont care if my Ambiv Crowns focus gets nerfed (well I do, I love it, but its VT, thats QUITE old), but I better not have my new Cord of Potential getting the whack. <br />
<br />
Personally, I think what we will see is a complete overhaul of the focus name system. Instead of &quot;Haste, Speed, Quickening&quot; of Soulsec and Mithranial, they will become new names, with haste being the one to get the +65 nerf, and Speed and Quickening remaining the same. <br />
<br />
It is only 30 bucks. I burn more than that for a decent meal. But I also expect value for the money spent.<br />
Once again Snoww, you have managed to hit the nail DIRECTLY on the head. All this talk of &quot;I'm not buying it, I'm not gonna get fooled again, I'm not giving them more of my money&quot; blah blah is just pessimism talking out of the half empty bottle. SOE doesnt make THAT much off the initial sale of these expansions. You wanna hurt SOE, cancel. You wanna stop giving them money, cancel. Don't form your protest around not buying a 30 dollar box that cost them $25 bucks to produce, then continue to pay month after month. They are laughing all the way tot he bank with that, because if you stay, its LIKELY you will eventually buy the expansion.</div></div><hr />

Yes i may have a chip on my shoulder about SoE not having an alternate path for non raiders but not against raiding itself.<br />

Yep players without the gear will get &quot;raped&quot;(Jentrikens words not mine&quot;)but you remember when BoT was opened up the &quot;majority&quot; of the complaints were the fact that the players let in werent geared for it and were causing problems etc.This is going to happen in OoW whether you like it or not.<br />

i as one of the non-casual raiders (but far from ubah, hehe) can only say: i am glad that that expansion doesnt have a whole set of closed zones at all.<br />
Look, you all think that the raiders want the locked zones stay locked because we are &quot;on our own&quot; there, but thats huge bs. But we invested weeks and weeks of killing for us trivial mobs for backflagging again and again. My guild spent over half a year of backflagging because most of the coreteam servermoved, and once we had enough flagged many left again, etc. etc.. Its a wonder that the guild still exists and that we are high in the progresison-line on aro again. And that is a massive amount of work, for many people (and a very boring work, too). And just seeing this work abandoned is something some might see as a bad thing.<br />
Non-locked zones are no problem, neither the raiders nor the non-raiders spent weeks and months trying super hard encounters or camping or whatever boring **** to enter the zones -&gt; why should there be a problem? There are brainless idiotic trainers in both raiders and non-raiders, as long as scripts cannot be cockblocked by someone thinking &quot;it has a name, it has loot for me&quot; everything is ok.<br />
See velious, it worked there, too.<br />
<br />
This &quot;one zone locked&quot; thing will make it easier for all.<br />
<br />
UNLESS it is right what i heard, that you need a piece from one super high mob in highend god to enter that last zone -&gt; the expansion per se has only locked zone, but you need the complete flagging **** again in god to reach it -&gt; problem is indirectly back (and believe me, that flagging idea destroyed very very many raiding guilds)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">There are of course different versions of Locked.<br />
<br />
Like A big mob that is up that you have to kill to get past.<br />
<br />
Not a key. Not a flag. But a bottleneck all the same.  And Raiders only apply. Unless you can perform a quest to get by it somehow. (Like a part quest part tradeskill and poisen a body of an animal and leave it for the beast to feed on.. (Think KOTAR and the rancor)<br />
<br />
There are lots of progression stifling things that can hamper enjoyment or can enhance it. It depends on the implemntation. And that has been SoE's weak point. They can get a good idea and then drive it into the dirt with piss poor usage of it. (See lack of LDON Varity, Slow Mitagation, Item creation, Singular paths to completion of goals, Backflagging, Quest creation, Monster encounter creations)<br />
<br />
There are soe decent ideas in every facet of EQ. But many many times the potential is never even scratched at. Like the quest for the Books for PoP. Thye have the ability to vary quest dialouge by class or race. But never ever took advantage of this. Singular paths to a goal suck. <br />
<br />
Rescue missions in LDON that do absolutly nothing. With a simple quest interface put into the rescuees thank yous. to send the adventurers to another NPS with a temporary flag to allow another LDON run to be kicked off with different reward scales. <br />
<br />
They need some creativity and Follow through added. And it is sorly lacking because the developers are too damn busy deciding what they can't do rather than what they can.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">I honestly like the progression in Gates. Single groupable content to get to advanced areas. If your not strong enough to complete those trials, you have some more work to do on your character. The problem with Gates is there isnt really any good places for the non-raider to get himself in a position to be effective in Vxed and Tipt. There is a LARGE &quot;gorge&quot; here between whats available if you dont raid, and what you need to reasonably compete in the trials content (yes yes, I know, lesser geared players can get by with skill and wits and etc etc and theres 3 or 4 items here and there etc etc. Lets not open that can of worms, I am generalizing here). <br />
<br />
PoP flagging sucked. No question about it. Without more &quot;back-door&quot; quests it was REALLY horrid. Gates is a bit TOO far up the &quot;Scale&quot; for single-group progression. However, once the non-raiders start getting some new levels and new spells, I imagine you will see LOTS of them in KT on a regular basis. But something similar, perhaps a combination of quests and trials, to gain access to advanced zones, is what I think would work the best.</div></div><hr />

Like A big mob that is up that you have to kill to get past.<br />

Not a key. Not a flag. But a bottleneck all the same.  And Raiders only apply. Unless you can perform a quest to get by it somehow. (Like a part quest part tradeskill and poisen a body of an animal and leave it for the beast to feed on.. (Think KOTAR and the rancor)<br />
<br />
There are lots of progression stifling things that can hamper enjoyment or can enhance it. It depends on the implemntation. And that has been SoE's weak point. They can get a good idea and then drive it into the dirt with piss poor usage of it. (See lack of LDON Varity, Slow Mitagation, Item creation, Singular paths to completion of goals, Backflagging, Quest creation, Monster encounter creations)<br />
<br />
There are soe decent ideas in every facet of EQ. But many many times the potential is never even scratched at. Like the quest for the Books for PoP. Thye have the ability to vary quest dialouge by class or race. But never ever took advantage of this. Singular paths to a goal suck. <br />

I'm a tough crowd usually on posts but this one deserves a big bumpage.  Absolutely right on the money IMHO.<br />

As I said in my last post, Wulfbane, I honestly don't think any of us 'ubers' care if you can go all over the expansion.  More power to you.  If it's an issue, don't train our raid, and we'll be quite happy.<br />
<br />
I think the single largest complaint from the 'ubers' in PoP was that we spent months busting our asses, including backflagging out the wazoo, to get access to the elemental planes and the nice drops therein.  95% of the 'casuals' (that posted) were demading access to the elemental zones with little or no work involved.<br />
<br />
Personally speaking, after I bust my butt and drag a whole guild through something, it would really hack me off to see SoE just open up the zone and say, &quot;Here ya go!  Enjoy!  No more flags!&quot;  Where is our reward for effort, perserverance, and ingenuity?  A month or two (depending on how fast your guild is, of course) of early access?  That's not much of a reward.<br />
<br />
In OoW, everyone starts out on the same page--we all have access to everything.  I've got no problem with that.  It's quite nice--I can group with whoever, whenever!  Groups don't depend on guildmates being available.  It's nice.<br />
<br />
Sure, there are a few downsides--just as there are 'ubers' who are complete asshats, so are there 'casuals' who, through malice or complete incompetence, are just as bad.  Open zones makes it harder to avoid them, but that's the price of not having to bust our butts for access for each and every one of my guildmates.  I consider that more than a fair trade.  (They called it the plane of torment for people having to backflag!)<br />
<br />
So honestly, I doubt many folks will care.  There are a lot of instanced zones/encounters for raids (or so we've been told).  There is one locked zone that supposedly depends on completion of GoD for access.  That's plenty for those raiders who need to be elitist and be by themselves.  The rest of us are a bit more social.  I'm glad everyone can see the expansion.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">How do raiders feel now that with the release of GoD and OoW it appears that raiding as a big percentage of new content is being taken out of the game ?.<br />
<br />
&quot;1 locked zone&quot; != less raiding.<br />
<br />
Did you need a key to get to PoFear in 1999? Nope, but if you zoned there without a raid, GL geting your corpse back. How many keys did we have in Kunark and how long did it take to get them? Trivial, right? And yet Trak was as big a raid target as any back in 2000. Were the mini bosses in UP under lock and key? Nope, but they required a raid in 2001.<br />
<br />
There are many ways to limit player access to a zone. Velious-style faction (dragons guarding port-in locations, hostile cities, etc), for one.  PoHate style &quot;access fees&quot;. Hostile high level content a la the old PoMischief. And so on and so forth.<br />
<br />
Do you feel let down by Sony that there is no obvious progression from Time and the top raid zones in GoD.<br />
<br />
I am unaware of any information from SOE or beta testers that OoW would offer no raid based post-GoD progression.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">1 locked zone, sounds a lot like velious.  and i liked that expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Iknumon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">I suppose for me it's been the quality of the gameplay for a while.<br />
<br />
While I'm not a hardcore raider, I am in a smaller raiding guild that is about to go elemental.  While I enjoy challenges, I also play the game to have some fun.  I find GoD to be just a misery; I end up unhappy every time I go there.  When even traveling to a certain point is an exercise in frustration, when my skillset is of minimal usefulness when I finally do arrive, when certain spells I need for even that minimal usefulness are extremely difficult to obtain, and when recovery from an error is so punitive that it's tempting to just log and forget the whole thing, I wonder what makes me keep playing.  Now I hear that the new expansion simply offers more of the same.<br />
<br />
I know this sounds like whining, and it is.  But I remember having a fantastic time playing Everquest.  Maybe I'm doing something wrong?  Or perhaps I've just topped out on the game; I don't have the patience, skill, gear, time to play, whatever that it takes any longer, and you're all better rid of me.  <br />

I understand this feeling, but hope is around the corner with 5 more levels. I honestly think they released these expansions in the opposite order from their original outline. OoW was probably supposed to be released, then Gates on its heels, because I really think lvl 70 wil make Gates a bit more fun, just because it wont be nearly as fustrating.</div></div><hr />
