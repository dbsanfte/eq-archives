<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hargin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've just restarted Alchemy after leaving it behind (or so I thought) at level 83 many months ago.  A friend told me they can sell their Kilva's potions fairly easily, but I've seen no interest.  Does anyone put them up for sale in the bazaar?  How much do have to charge for them before people actually buy them?<br />
<br />
I'm going to forge ahead with alchemy regardless, but would like to offset the cost if at all possible by selling what I make.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">never sold many myself ..<br />
<br />
but if your looking for a cheep way to raise alchemy <br />
<br />
try hill giants .... hillgiant toes and the leaves sold from gypsies will get you to 120-130 ish skill (i forget)<br />
<br />
the cash you make from the hill giants pays back for the high cost of the leaves<br />
<br />
you can basically break even in the end</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hargin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm there quite a bit, sad to say... might be worth doing.  At 35 PP a pop, wouldn't it still be cheaper to do some other potions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">with all the cash and junk they dropped i broke about even .. and the gypsies merchants were in the zone</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>ZernSaintwinter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i tried to sell some on fin roe server, ended up giving them away. /sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fenora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've tried selling Kilva's in bazaar, haven't sold many at all, maybe 2 10 dose a day on a good day (selling for 320p, cost is 280p). I do sell them to friends tho, for just a smidge above cost. <br />
<br />
As for raising your skill, try doing Titan's Potions (Maliak Leaf, Tri-Fern Leaf), they are only around 11p per attempt and will take your skill to 180. Cheapest way I've found to raise a skill I completely slacked off on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hargin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I figured that would be the case.  I must be a fool raising alchemy while sorely lacking in equip and cash at level 55.  Oh well...  I'm a stubborn sort.   I hear Titans can sell, but can't imagine why other than the novelty factor and some very limited uses.  I'd gladly sell for cost any potion.  Right now I finished Aura of Purity, so am up to 103. I guess I can start Titans?<br />
<br />
Do Gate potions sell at all anymore?  I'm looking for light at the end of the tunnel :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I went from purity to titans myself Hargin, took a day or two off a few weeks ago, went from 73 to 190 alchemy on about 13k.  The only potions I've sold were DS potions to guild for raiding, at cost of course.  I will say it's much easier to get 182 skill and the +10% alch thingie outta grieg's than it is to hit 200.  I think I'm up to 20 or 30pp a combine now, it's just gotten silly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dsalcedo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">On my rangers account I always keep one of the gate potions handy.  Makes it easy to escape from places such as the Hole and I don't have a Tolan's BP yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dread</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The 10 does DS potion sells sometimes.  Maybe 2-3 a week.  I price em at 450 so that I make about 100pp profit each.  <br />
<br />
They are great to give to alts.<br />
<br />
Here is a thought I hadn't considered before.  Make up a big batch and take em to the PoJ trials setup area.  Sell 10 shot potions for 500pp a pop.  I'll bet many trial groups would buy them.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>thunderpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I had an order for 40 ten-dose potions on Xegony. Was in the bazaar at the right place at the right time.<br />
<br />
To make the 400 potions I failed 13 or 14 times at skill 174. Took about an hour and a little over 12kpp to make but got paid 15k for the job.<br />
<br />
I'd never seen any profit out of alchemy before that and I made a few extra potions to try and /trader at 400pp but no sales.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Stonienogg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I keep my trader on 12+ hours a day when i'm not playing, and I can't keep Kilva's Skin of Flame in stock. I make 8-10 10doses every week, sell for 500 each, and usually sell 4+ per buyer so it only takes a couple to clean me out. Definitely my best seller, behind gates sows and shrinks. Haven't sold a single stat potion since they removed the negative effects, dam waster trader space :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Unoeye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I sell the Kilva's Skin of Flame for 425p ea on Mith Mar.  I used to sell a couple a week at least, but other shammies have been under pricing me lately on almost everything so sales have been slow of late.<br />
<br />
I now just put a couple each of useful potions on my vendor at whatever price I think they are worth and let my alts have em if they don't sell by the time I need em.  Screw the price wars :/<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>ludgurorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">take them to trials in POJ and sell them.  people will buy singles there after desperation sets in.</div></div><hr />
