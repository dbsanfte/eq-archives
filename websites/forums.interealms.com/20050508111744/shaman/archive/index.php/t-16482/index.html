<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Thought I'd share my few ldon experiences, its a least good for a laugh :D  I apologise in advance for the length.<br />
First, Miragul's, seemed pretty cool.  Has some atmosphere to it.  I went in with a group of me (shaman), cleric, druid, ranja, warrior and enchanter.  Not an optimal group by any means, but I was only there to slow and damage, so I got out the hammer and went to whacking.  Its been too long since I was able to melee much, sitting on droggy is just so much more a valuable use of my time.  Came up a couple short of the collection total needed at the end, but we got the lesser prize.  Everyone had a great time, and I came out with a really good feeling about this expansion.<br />
<br />
Second, Rujark.  Didnt care for the design nearly as much, kinda bland to me.  Group was me, sk, cleric, enchanter, paladin and ranger.  Was, again, slower.  We entered, the sk ran to the first crossroad and aggro'd at least 6 mobs and ran em back to us.  Enchanter didn't get even a single one mezzed before dying.  I managed to get slows on two of them, which of course aggro'd the whole pack.  Roots would not hold more than a single tick, so it was pretty much lights out for me.  It did take long enough for me to die to let the rest finish off the one or two they were fighting.  I screwed up, I didn't bind outside, so had to be rezzed to get back quick.  Chew a bit, stoicism, GO!  We got through the first few packs of mobs, maybe 20 in total.  At that point, we had 2 of the 29 goblin teeth we needed.   Kept at it, mob after mob falling like trees, we were moving quickly.  Everyone was constantly oom and 3/4 health.  Time was half up, had just over 10 teeth.  Time finally ran out on us with 21 teeth.  We kept going, trying for the lesser, but by now people are really getting aggravated.  It would have been difficult to kill much faster, yet teeth were not dropping.  When kick time came, we had 25 teeth, and one augment had dropped, otherwise nothing.  I've since looked at the maps from eqtoolbox and we were just in front of the last room, unless that room was packed with mobs, there was no way we could have looted 29.  Everything else was dead.  A total loss and 6 disturbed players.  Maybe the worst part is that 2 of yaeth's page 63 left dropped, and I need one for research on canni4.  I asked if I could have one, and the looter sold them to the vendor.  Or at least said they had sold them, the vendor didn't have any.  Their response was, &quot;you should have told me before I sold&quot;, which of course I had done.<br />
<br />
Third, Takish.  Another one I liked.  Grouped with cleric, ranger, monk, bard and warrior.  A rescue mission.  This is the one that let me know what the people who said its so easy are talking about.  Smooth as silk, we had a good time, mission successful, killed named afterwords.<br />
<br />
Fourth, Mistmoore.  Rujark was aggravating because it didn't seem like we would be ALLOWED to win, this one was the kind of unmitigated disaster that drives people away from grouping.  I joined the group simply because they were the first that asked :D (I hate lfg).  I join them, we get mission, head to zone.  Naturally, everyone in the group is anon(which I hate!).  So I ask what buffs they have on right now, what they need, etc...  No response.  Buff up the tank with infusion/talisman of kragg, group sta &amp; billie.  Ask again, what buffs might be needed...  No response.  Ask again, does anyone have proccing weapons, finally get response from paladin.  He links me his weapon.  Great, now what buffs do you need idiot?  At this point, if this was real life, I'd be talking real slllloooooowww like.  How    much    dex   do   you   have   right   now?  Oh, 163 he says.  Dex buff him, and a couple others finally ask for some things.  Okay, done buffing, loading spell set.  Look around a sec, hmmm.  Ask who is healing.  No response.  Ask again, someone says oh, you are.  Okay, no big problem, dont really have the tools for it at 57, but ok.  Ask the necro if he could slow, necro says no, he only has 60% slow.  Says chanter has better.  First time I knew one was a chanter, they never answered when I asked classes.  Chanter says no, shammy slow is 75%, hers isnt as good.  I point out that I cant slow and heal at the same time.  Paladin laughs and says oh I can stay alive, dont worry.  Finally chanter agrees grudginly to slow.  I tell her its just to start till we get a rhythm going, then I could probably take over.<br />
Go inside, mage can't enter.  First time in ldon zone, probably the patcher bug, she's out of it.  After dithering a few minutes, paladin makes a pull, 3 mobs.  No one pacified before, and enchanter is standing there.  No mez, no slow, nothing.  Chain cast superior on the tank until i get aggro on two of them with only one on tank.  Stoicism on me, chanter finally mezzes one and then other.  When all 3 mobs were down I was close to oom, and when scrolling up noticed nothing had been slowed.  Enc contribution: 2 mezzes.  Necro was kind enough to have his pet fight, at least.  Finish clearing that room, enc did pacify before paladin pulled, went smooth for a few, until next room.<br />
Next room, enc pacified, but must have missed *some*, we got at least 4 or 5 of em.  Repeat earlier, stoicism on tank, chain cast superior on tank until they all are chasing me, stoicism on me....   Enc did manage to keep a couple mostly mezzed.  I was healing everyone, every single one of us had aggro from something, went oom about the end of the fight.  Chew....stoicism, ready.  Enchanter thinks pacify lasts forever and doesn't bother to cast it again, we get rest of room.  Enc casts ae mez (oh no!), fails on several and gets aggro.  I spam superior to keep her up, but couldn't cast fast enough.  She dies haven taken half of my mana, but at this point almost nothing is mezzed.  I drop stoicism on everyone taking damage, but am down to 20% myself, so I back out into cleared area to die.<br />
Back in pok, chanter was bound there too.  I tell her meet me at felwith stone, ill sow, well be back up in 3 or 4 minutes.  Wait at stone, wait at stone, wait at stone.....  Enchanter invites druid to party????????  I didn't even bother to tell them that the druid couldn't enter, I'm just shaking my head.  After wasting time, the druid ports the enc.  All in all much slower than simply following me.<br />
I zone into gfay, then lfay then instance, never seeing the druid/enc combo.  I'm not sure where they ported to, but it was quite a while before enc could rejoin.  Meanwhile, I've stripped my corpse but for a single item, have gotten doggie ready, and am back full mana.  Rogue and necro are still in zone and are ready too.  Were just over halfway on time and close to half on total needed, still VERY doable.  Paladin starts to whine and cry about how were gonna loose and all his time will be wasted.  So, I ask the necro if he has his undead pacify up.  I was going to kill some to keep things flowing until group finished getting back.  Necro says whats the spell called?  Ummm, I'm not the necro...  Its called something like calm the dead.  Oh yeah, I have that spell.  At this point, the paladin chimes in again and tells us he's going to go because theres no way we could finish and doesn't want to waste his time.  He didn't mine wasting mine though.  He did stay long enough to do a 75% rez, so it wasnt a total loss.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the length of the last one, had to vent.  All in all it looks like a nice expansion, but they really should look into the drop rate on collection missions, and make sure there are enough in zone to actually complete it.</div></div><hr />

I have yeet to see not enough of the items in the zone. Normally we don't even clear 3/4 of the dungeon and collect them all.<br />
<br />
You probably missed some mobs somewhere if you think you failed because of not enough mobs dropping the items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yep, I've seen the very last mob drop the piece we needed, but I've never cleared the whole dungeon without getting everything.  (btw, we had a ranger and 2 druids tracking to verify we killed everything and it was the last mob to drop the last piece)<br />
