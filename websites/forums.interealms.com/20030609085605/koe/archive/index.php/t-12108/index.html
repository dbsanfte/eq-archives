<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ryptagudn Gobbleguts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Howdy all!<br />
 <br />
Star Wars Galaxies is fast approaching (mid-June, unless another delay occurs) and I've got a spiffy new computer that can run what will obviously be a behemoth piece of software.  Point is, it seems to be a game that caters to both casual and hardcore gamers, and since I'm somewhere in between those classification it seems a good fit for me.  (Besides, who doesn't want to be a Wookie Jedi?)<br />
 <br />
Anyway, I'm looking at giving my money to Sony again in the near future and thought it would be a good thing to reacquaint myself with old friends and allies.  Since this sounds like a game where knowing people with the right skills at the right time is a GOOD thing (the economy is 95% player driven), I was curious if there are people planning on &quot;making the leap.&quot;  I don't know how the servers are set up yet, but I will continue to check in and post any contact information about myself.  (I'm going to TRY to be a race that lets me take a name similar to the troll.)<br />
 <br />

Good to see you stop in old friend, you have been missed a lot. <br />
 <br />
Don't be such a stranger.. <br />
 <br />
For me, I have a lot to accomplish in EQ yet and I think one game is enough for now and I also want to hear how SWG goes before making any firm decision down the road, but stay in touch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bobcats</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hey Keepers, long time eh?<br />
 <br />
Well, I too have been thinking about again giving my money to sony.  I will probably have to wait until SWG comes out because I have been told that Bobcats no longers exists and I really don't want to start over.<br />
 <br />
I have seen someone playing a beta3 version of SWG, and I must say...WOW!  Just the character creation in itself is extremely fun, there is so much control over what your character looks like that you can spend lots of time just doing that :)<br />
 <br />
Later all!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Bob!!!<br />
 <br />
Good to see you stop in.. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Canoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Good to see you bob....<br />
 <br />
If you see this again... send me a pm please....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm still playing Earth &amp; Beyond, but will most likely play Star Wars Galaxies when it comes out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ryptagudn Gobbleguts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The server names are up on the FAQ and I've made the decision to try to hit the Kauri Server.  It's USEast (I'm in Ohio) so it makes sense.  Once everything's running and I've got a character name and such I'll let everyone know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>XunilTlatoani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My guess is that i will try SWG...i've tried everything else thats come along, and I dont see why i wouldnt try this =P</div></div><hr />
