<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>vivala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey Shamans,<br />
<br />
I'm 1 item from getting my emp key in ssra.  I'm also 1/2 an aa from getting the 9 needed for Quick buff 3.  Question:<br />
<br />
Should I still spend the 9 aa on QB3?   My original reason for getting QB3, was the cast time on torpor.  Will the 2 stack?  I don't really understand how the stacking works.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't really recommend QB3, QB2 and a focus item will max your spell haste for torpor / quiesc. It won't go under 3 seconds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Enhancement Haste does not affect Torpor or Quiescence. Therefore, QB3 is the only way to get 3 second Torpor/Quiescence as far as I know. I know I was a bit upset that my Emp ring did not affect Torpor when I got it. Maybe they changed this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">remember, RoS is only a haste 3 item. Right now i have a wicked bone in my range to make up for not having qb3, so fir now im ok with qb2, but i just got keyed for VT and there is more then 1 item i want to replace it with. Basicly its up to you, i personaly dont wanna rely on a item to my spell hastes, but 9 AA is alot, its a tough call thats for sure, but &quot;I&quot; had 9 AA and was done with LR5 ( what im working on ) i would just dump it in there, i mean they all need to get done anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ha, Jing! Your sig quote still makes me laugh :)<br />
<br />
The emp ring has enhancement haste III on it which is limited to buffs.  You might want to look at getting a Haste (quickening/speed etc) of Mithaniel item which affects all beneficial spells (including Torpor/Q).  In addition, Spell Haste focus (Spell Haste III/IV, quickening/haste of Druzzil) items will affect all spells, including torpor/Q.<br />
<br />
With my Cog Encrusted Epaulets from POI and QB 2, my Q casting time will be nearly 3.0 seconds.  Close enough that 9 points would be a lot of points for very little return.<br />
<br />
Should I still spend the 9 aa on QB3? My original reason for getting QB3, was the cast time on torpor. Will the 2 stack? I don't really understand how the stacking works.<br />
<br />
An enhancement haste focus item like the Shissar ring will stack with the Quickbuff AA, with a max limit of 50% of spell casting time.  As a note, the Shissar Ring does not affect Torpor/Q.  You can see by looking at Lucy, that Enhancement Haste only affects spells with a duration equal to or greater than 48 seconds:<br />
<br />
http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=2335&amp;source=Live <br />
<br />
If you're talking about a Haste/Quickening/Speed of Mithaniel item that affects all beneficial spells, using Q as an example, no matter the combination of focus/AA or cleric spell haste, you can't get the casting time lower than 3.0 seconds (50% of 6.0).  This is why I think it's pretty excessive to spend 9 points on QB 3.<br />
<br />
As long as we're talking about stacking:<br />
<br />
Extended enhancement will stack with SCRM, there doesn't appear to be any max duration.  Extended enhancement does not work with Torpor/Q although SCRM does.<br />
<br />
SCM will stack with preservation focus items.<br />
<br />
Preservation focus items do not stack.  If you have an Affliction Efficiency item and a Mana preservation item, depending on the spell cast, the better of the focus items will take precedence.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">QB3 is definitely worth it, but I don't think it is good enough (especially if you have another item) to go higher in the AA list.  I think I got it somewhere in the 80's or 90's, which was good, because I cannot find any spell haste item to save my life (that fits with my gear).  If you're sitting around 40 aa or so, there are a lot more useful things to get first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I would say get QB3 if you are that close.  I sucked it up and did QB1-3 right after I got MGB simply because there was no focus effect that I could get in the foreseeable future.  Now while you may be getting to VT in the near future, that does not guarantee that you will be getting the focus item that you want anytime soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If you are going to VT, then elemental drops are not unrealistic. There are speed of mithaniels which with QB2 takes Torpor/Q down to 3.3 seconds, there are haste of mithaniels which will take you straight to the 50% cap with QB2 (do not pass go, do not spend 9 AA). There are lots and lots of useful ways to spend 9 AA that would not become obsolete with a single gear upgrade a bit down the line. It's one thing if you are Mudcrush and have 570 AA, but normal people in the 30-100 range need to be a bit more practical.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have QB3 and love it. I think the main thing to rember is that no matter what focus items you have. Oneday it &quot;WILL&quot; change.. and what then? Throug out the life of our chars. Thire gear changes. You might have something a day.. week.. or year, but oneday sooner or later you will get something new. And then you lose your focus effect. Where has with the AA onces spent you have it 24/7 no questions asked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>The Antifrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I don't have QB3 yet but I plan on it.  I use a spell haste 4 item in my range slot, which is 15% vs. 20% on the WB atlatl's effect, and I'm not going to give up my shawl for those cog epaulets.  I have QB1 currently but QB2 will take my Quiescence to 3.6 seconds, and .6 second is worth it imo.  Further, since I don't plan on getting MGB, getting the third rank in QB will help with my class title.  Yeah it doesn't mean anything but I want Elder :p  So in essecnce a focus item is a decent substitute for the 9 AAs that QB3 costs, but isn't quite as good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">In my opinion, go for QB3.  It is true that QB2 + focus item will cap you out.  That's nice to save on AAs.  But, something else to keep in mind is that you will forever be locked into using a piece of gear for it's focus effect.  If you are a mere 1 AA away from QB3, free yourself from the need to ever have to roll on a Haste of Mith or other focus item like that again.  You'll have more versatility available to your character.<br />
<br />
For example, my shoulders have some quick buff focus.  They are ok shoulders, but there's other shoulders I'd like to get instead.  As it is, I am torn as to whether I want to put my name in for a slight loot upgrade and lose a good focus effect for a different focus effect.  I'd much rather just have QB3 and not even have to worry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>The Antifrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Actually QB2 + a focus item won't cap you out.  Depending on what focus item it might not even get you too close.. qb2 + a &quot;spell haste&quot; item is 3.6 second torpor/quie.. qb2 + a haste of mithaniel item will get it down to 3.3.  QB3 gets it down to 3.0.</div></div><hr />

The other advantage of the mithaniel line is they work on things that are NOT buffs. Like Tnarg's, or Gate, or summoning your pet.</div></div><hr />

I guess it depends on the peice some what. If your using the cog shoulders or the Bone alta I could definitely see how you might want to upgrade them given the chance. In my case however my haste is more general and is on a really nice peice, Karana's tear. As it is I'm over 200 aa's and I don't have any plans to get QB3 for the forseeable future. My haste item covers ALL my spells so it would take alot more than just qb 3 to replace it and I can max out my buff haste with cleric buff if I wan't altho I've found the stupid refresh bug to be fairly annoying and I think i'd rather have a 3.6 second Q than a 3 second Q since I never get the refresh issue then. Even if your just using the cog shoulders or alta your still loosing the haste off of heals like tnargs and even things like gate if your just relying on QB 3 to replace it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Speed Of Mithaniel/Mithaniel's Quickening = 3.0<br />
<br />
General spell haste is of course wonderful, but particularly looking at Tnarg's Mending, these specialty hastes are a lot better.<br />
<br />
There is also the issue of upgrades, specifically...for most people, THERE AREN'T ANY. The wicked bone atlal may have numerous stat upgrades that a non-VT/Elemental (Which is the vast majority) shamans can get, but the Epaulets? The closest thing out there is the Strength of Elements, and I would wear the Epaulets over the Strength even if the Epaulets had no focus at all.<br />
<br />
If you are looking at VT/E gear, then you are also looking at PoFire/Earth XP, and the considerably easier aquiring of AA (Hell, just last night, a guy dinged solusek's protection twice in the space of a half hour, soloing in Fire), and QB3 is not such a burden to your AA pool, plus you have upgrades. If you don't have a chance to see these zones, you need to take a careful look at what the most intelligent course of action will be.<br />
<br />
I belong to the category of people who will in all likelihood not be seeing a better shoulder than the Epaulets (which I have). While my AA rate has picked up in the last couple of weeks, I'm way behind the curve of people who hit 60 before Luclin, and 9 AA is an enourmous chunk which I am not willing to spend for such a pathetic upgrade in cast time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>The Antifrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Yeah, its absurd that those with access to much faster exp also have access to items which make that exp less needed.  Gogo sony...  When is WoW due out again? :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Getting QB3 or not depends on what kind of gear you expect to ever get.<br />
My guild is in the elemental planes at present.  We haven't done Fennin yet, but we do the charm birds, blinky (shadowstep bird), magmaton, frog, general, and spiderbitz with ease.  We also cruise through VT without any real effort anymore.<br />
<br />
The shoulders I have are about 85hp and about 105 or 115 mana with some quick buff from one of the mini bosses in Sol Ro temple.  They are definately fine shoulders.  But I have no mana preservation focus effect at present.  There's a shoulder off the charm bird in pofire that drops a LOT for us that has something like 115hp and 125 mana and has mana pres 4 on it.  I'd rather have that shoulder than my current one, but if I did that, I'd be losing 20 or 25% of my quick buff.  If I had the QB3 ability, the choice for shoulder slot would be a no brainer.  As it is, because I only have QB2, the choice is actually a tough one for me.  If I replace my shoulder, I need to obtain a new quick buff focus item sometime, or I have to get QB3.<br />
<br />
If you are in a situation that you won't see items from the ele planes or from VT or from tough bosses in POP like MM or Bertox or RZ or whoever, things might be different.  If you already have a quick buff item that you never expect to ever upgrade beyond, then going for QB2 is just fine.  I don't know what the cog shoulder is that was mentioned, though.  Is it better than Strength of the Elements shoulder with it's 100hp?  If you had QB3 trained, you wouldn't have to think about getting one or the other based on this particular focus effect.  It would purely be about the stats.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would rate them as comparable to Strength of the Elements with no questing involved (easy 2-3 group kill).  I'm still wearing them :)<br />

<br />
You'd still be missing out then. Any haste item I've seen that will effect Q/torpor which is the buff most people care about hasting will also haste at least all other benificial spells. Most importantly that includes things like tnargs and heck even gate. It also includes a variety of other spells like imbues, summons(including pets). While obviously not every is going to have a benificial spell haste item or a spell haste item it is something most people look for. QB3 cost 9 points and only covers a small part of things, really only 1 spell that we care about.<br />
<br />
As I said it depends. I personally stopped at qb2 long before I got my earring but I know I didn't want to spend 9 aa's on something that would eventually be mostly useless for me. As it is now I have my earring and it's 18% haste on everything so qb3 would buy me a whole 7% or a whole .4 seconds on torpor. Sorry i'll spend my aa's elsewhere even at 205 aa's currently there are more useful things to buy.</div></div><hr />
