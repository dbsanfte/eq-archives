<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all, I thought I would throw out a few tidbits since I really don't think that the developers truly understand shaman roles in newer content experience group nor in raiding.  Hopefully the developers can somehow read this.  Applies to higher content only and assumes that future content is geared to the quicker fights we see in the GOD expansion.<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Experience Groups:<br />
<br />
1) I am happy with the low magic resistance of the mobs in GOD, and I find only about 5% resist slow after malos.  Since I believe partial slows are here to stay to balance content, the only real issue I have is that  partial slows narrow the shaman slowing advantage vs the classes we compete against to get into experience groups.  Which is fine if we bring a similar overall benefit to the group. (more on that later).<br />
<br />
2)  Since most of the folks here believe that typical GOD expedition fights last 25-40 seconds (and my parses support that) a hard working shaman who is casting malos on incoming (when possible) and slowing has about 20 seconds on average to do something else in the fight assuming no slowing resists which thank goodness are rare.  Now the number one thing without a doubt (unless there  are 3 healers in the group) is watching the groups health for fast spot heals.  A shaman has to think pretty hard whether to nuke or not in most cases unless the group is playing it very safe and the slow casting nukes sure don't help that decision making. <br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Abilities shaman have but are not particularly useful in GOD but I am certain that we are being balanced against.<br />
<br />
1) What to do with adds when the group has no crowd control?  Shaman have no time to play ghetto parkers as they could in prior content since they have to malos and slow the first mob and can't usually get agro (nor want to,lol) on an unslowed 2nd mob.<br />
<br />
2) DOT's are worthless in newer content - period end of story. unfortunately. <br />
<br />
3) Shaman haste is rarely used in harder content unless enchanter haste expires.  I just point this out in case the developers are balancing us with our haste in mind (which is reasonable but might be overstated).<br />
<br />
4) Free damage such as our pet AA and epic dot have such long casting times that their use is marginal or nill in newer content.  I love my puppies but their duration in these fast fights is about 15-20 seconds not the 1 minute potential they have.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
HEALING<br />
<br />
1) Although I applaud the upcoming increases in regeneration and Q, I think that perhaps the developers are thinking that this will balance our healing woes.  I respectfully suggest that in higher content experience groups the shaman Q's the main assist prior to mob engagement when he/she is at 100%.  A shaman also spot Q's other members who just need to be topped off and Q themselves to regain mana after canny5.  All these occurrances overheal.  I'm not saying that it is bad, just that (and I'm just going to throw a number out) only 50% of the healing is applied.  <br />
<br />
2) Regen is good for the cannying shaman and necros without crack and to automatically top off heal people who are 95%ish after fights (maybe top off).<br />
<br />
3) I personally have no issue with you scaling our healing with clerics.  Since it is pretty obvious that Sony intends only 2 classes to be able to be primary healers in new content, I respectfully suggest that druids spot heals be pumped up considerably since there is no way that any druid I know could possibly function as a primary healer in a tipt or vxed group without running short of mana constantly unless he/she had full shaman support (which would eliminate all shaman dps).<br />
<br />
4) I have found in my groups that the clerics are constantly running short of mana relative to the other mana using classes. I have also found that the total healing contribution of a shaman who is working hard with Q and spot heals (as outlined above) is less than 10% of a clerics and that is with the cleric casting no elixers.  I am happy to parse fights to prove this.  Again, I personally am fine with this duty as long as we are balanced against the classes we are lobbying against to get into experience groups - beastlords and enchanters.<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
NUKES<br />
<br />
1) There are no poison nuke focus items to my knowledge except for maybe one in GOD (discordant poison).  Therefore, the well equipped shaman who choses poison nukes is capped at 20% on his/her ID4 item.  Cold damage focus items are available up to 30% (not counting time which goes to 35%), but I personally have found the resist rates much higher than poison and the slow casting just doesn't cut it in short fights.  It is long overdue to lower casting time on our nukes unless you (the developer) feel that overall shaman direct and indirect damage is overpowering and I find that hard to believe.  I also think it is overdue to rethink the damage on our nukes.  <br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Class Balance vs other slowing classes <br />
 <br />
1) Enchanters are very difficult to balance vs shaman and beastlords because of their situational charm damage.  There are instances where the enchanter pet is not only used as the main assist but outdamages all other party members.  If the developers don't know this they are not paying attention.  Now that being said, it takes a skillful enchanter to regular (non dire) charm mobs and not die horrible deaths.  Risk vs reward.  When an enchanter is not charming and when enchanter crack and haste can be purchased I believe that both shaman and beastlords contribute more to a group unless the content requires crowd control (again situational).<br />
<br />
2) Shaman and beastlords are easier to look at and figure out if they are balanced, but it has been my experience that beastlords require an enchanter to tash to fulfill their slowing roll in higher content.  Therefore they are a bit situational as a primary slower also.  I am probably a minority in the Crucible forums in that I feel that a competent well equiped and high aa shaman is a match for a beastlord in an experience group including GOD content with the exception of being a bit light on direct damage.<br />
<br />
3) It is therefore my observation that both beastlords and enchanters are better situationally in an experience group than shaman.  I'm fine with that if the content is balanced where shaman are occasionally situationally prefered as well - but I don't think that is ever the case in newer content.  With so many of shaman tools being unused (see above),  with low dps (whether direct or indirect) and no real contribution to the safety of the party besides spot heals and buffer HOT's the shaman is a utility class without a lot of punch (for the lack of a better word).<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Raids:<br />
<br />
This will be short.  Anything more than two hard working shaman on a raid you have stacking issues.  The roll for the 3rd, 4th, etc. shaman is spam healing on tanks during boss fights, situational spot healing for party members and nukes.  Our slow casting nukes rarely are fast enough to land on ANY clearing mobs.  The 3rd, 4th, etc shaman are doing exactly the same job as the druids (outside of those who may be forced into ch rotations).  Druids do spot healing and nuking better.  End of story.<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Solution:<br />
<br />
I think Shaman are a good class that just need a little tweeking to be &quot;balanced&quot; in fast fight situations.  I have been playing EQ since early 1999 and I have seen the uproar that specific class changes have caused.  I am very aware that the developers do not want to make controversial changes to any one class.<br />
<br />
None of my suggested fixes will unbalance content in my humble opinion, nor will it cost enchanters or beastlords to be unwanted in experience groups.  It will allow the excess raid shaman to be closer in efficency to their druid counterpoints who are doing exactly the same job.  All in all, it will let shaman fight and heal to their &quot;paper&quot; potential.<br />
<br />
I am not saying that I or other shaman are happy with FA duration or the out of group shrink issue, but these are my best shots at IMMEDIATE fixes that are appropriate for the shaman class. And these fixed are needed now, not with the next expansion.<br />
<br />
1) Reduce casting times on our nukes and provide appropriate poison focus items. Also look into cold nuke resist rates. Increasing damage is perhaps warranted, but hopefully I have outlined that reducing casting times are needed more.  My suggestion is 25% casting time reduction applied across the board to all shaman DD spells.<br />
<br />
2) Reduce casting times on our fast heals.  Heals are similar to nukes in that a shaman is forced because we are a slowing and utility class to make fast decisions.  If the developers don't want shaman to heal closer to clerics (which I am fine with) at least give us the opportunity to quickly spot heal. My suggestion again is 25% reduction in casting time.<br />
<br />
3) Because the shaman GOD canny spell is unfortunately ancient and will not be seen by most of the shaman population, I suggest looking at canny4 and doubling its potency and doubling its recast time.  The net effect is the same but the shaman is able to react quicker to other situations (described above) by not having to canny so often and carpal tunnel is reduced.<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Let me help you out with the next patch message: <br />
 <br />
&quot;Also reduced casting time on certain shaman heals and direct damage spells&quot;<br />
<br />
Respectfully yours,<br />
