<br />
What we need is for the epic 1.5 to be a multi slot item. wrist/hands/head etc something like that so we can have use for it for a long time to come.<br />
<br />
There is no way SoE can justify to me why clerics get a shield for their epic and we get a primary slot item. Clerics replaced their epic from their primary slot a long time ago. Just look at the Cleric only Zek hammer, it is clearing much better than the epic. They also summon hammers that they can use for combat. CLEARLY clerics wouldn't care if their primary was their epic.<br />
<br />
CLEARLY it makes a huge difference to shaman to be able to use the epic in a different slot. Casuals can still equip both epics for the look/utility. Raiders with TA can equip it somewhere else and get the most out of their shaman w/o resorting to stuipd bard guis :)<br />
<br />
Make the epics a multi-slot item or at least put it in a slot that's not such a hindrance. Or just make TA inventory clickable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just make the epic clickable from inventory, if anything.<br />
<br />
Edit: Let's think about it. Everyone can get this epic, but 90% of the Shamans won't ever see a TA. In theory, the epic 1.5 should remain like it is and since only those who have a TA will(probably) ever see the epic 2.0 make the 2.0 inventory clickable.<br />
<br />
The TA is just a class item, it shouldn't be made any better than it is by making it inventory clickable imo. The epic on the other hand, should be an item that can be used forever.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have to agree.  Cleric item is like an 80ac shield and then bascially the same stats as the shaman item.  As a shaman I would much rather have a nice 80ac secondary item with all the stats than a melee item that i wont use<br />

I know I wouldn't equip it in my secondary slot either. Make the 2.0 inventory equippable and it's fine imo. The 1.5 looks like it is the epic for casual players and casual players don't wield TAs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There is no way SoE can justify to me why clerics get a shield for their epic<br />
<br />
Well I could just as easilly say &quot;there's no way Sony can justify clerics having a better rez then us when we are the ones that talk to spirits.&quot;  If you set yourself up not to look objectively at something, then of course no one can justify anything to you.  You might as well have just said &quot;I'm jealous that clerics get a secondary item and I don't, so I'm not even going to try being objective and logicical when I try to justify why it's unfair&quot;:<br />
<br />
Just look at the Cleric only Zek hammer, it is clearing much better than the epic<br />
The 1.5 epics are designed all types of players, not just raiders.  Your guild might not raid regularly to get the flags, gear, and skills needed to take down Zek, but that doesn't necessarily mean they aren't capable of coming together to help you with your epic fights.  Beyond that, the key weapon you should be comparing isn't their old epic.  Every class has weapons that are better than their old epics.  However, not every class has a summoned hammer which procs fifty times a second.  That summoned hammer is better than most, if not all, cleric weapons in the game (for meleeing), and it's certainly better than anything attainable by a family guild.<br />
<br />
They also summon hammers that they can use for combat. CLEARLY clerics wouldn't care if their primary was their epic<br />
<br />
Now see, if one of my class's spell lines gave me the ability to summon a weapon in my primary slot, &quot;CLEARLY&quot; I would care that I couldn't use my spell and my hard-earned epic at the same time.  If our epic was secondary but equiping it meant you couldn't have a pet up, I'd sure as hell be pissed.  Yes dogdog's 30 or 40 DPS is ass in the larger scheme of things, but that's still 30 or 40 DPS that I can help add to a group, which may just give us that extra bit of killing speed needed to finish an LDoN on time.  Plus, dogdog is key for a lot of the soloing I do.  Same deal with clerics: when the clock is running out I've seen clerics jump in and start meleeing with their summoned hammer to save the adventure.  And for them the hammer is even more necessary for soloing than dodgdog is for us (root rot isn't really an effective option for them).<br />
<br />
So yeah, it actually seems pretty obvious to me how SoE can justify giving only one class in the game a secondary epic, when that is the only class in the game with a spell line that summons a uniquely useful primary weapon.<br />
<br />
Of course, SoE could have preserved the clerics' ability to melee while still giving them a primary, if they just gave them a new spell along with their epic.  The spell would summon a hammer with the stats of the epic, but with a proc that's the same as their summoned hammer's.  Or they could have the proc be almost the same, but also make it give you a buff that provides the focus effect from the epic.  Clerics would still have to play the bard game if they wanted to use the right-click, but since they'd be getting a new epic and an upgrade to an existing spell, I think they'd learn to manage.<br />
<br />
Of course, coming up with that solution, or finding some other one that gives every class a primary epic 1.5 but still let's clerics melee, would require some creativity on the part of SoE dev team, which we all know isn't exactly their strong point.  So since the clerics do have a shield, and that just isn't going to change, I think that our original epic, and TA for those that have it, should be clickable from inventory.  In fact, I see no reason why most clickies shouldn't be useable from inventory.  If I want to fill my inventory slots with my fur booties, old epic, JB Bracer, earring of cleansing, JB BP, Dain Ring, chardok ring, and 10 Dose Kilva's potion (hypothetically maybe I really dig DSes), I don't see how that's so terribly unbalancing.<br />
<br />
Of all of them, the booties perhaps gain the most by being inventory usuable (they're the only item that'd you'd need to use right away sometimes, without having time to switch them in), and yet they are the only item on the list besides the potion that actually is inventory usuable.  The rest are just stat-wise outdated items that still have useful clickies, which people can already take advantage of by pretending to be bards and switching in and out.<br />
<br />
So what if instead of switching them in and out people have the option of leaving these items in their inventory slots, a pretty big sacrifice (if I actually filled my slots as I did in the example I couldn't even carry food around with me, let alone components, loot, etc.)?  How does that ruin anyone's enjoyment of the game?  Heck, several of those items (chardok ring, dain ring, old epic) required people to spend a huge amount of time (unless your a cheating bastard who MQed the dain ring or the epic) to acquire, and now they languish unused in many people's inventories or banks.  If people could still derive some benefit from their hard work with only a single click instead of six and some mouse movement, I don't think that would have any ill effects.<br />
<br />
So in summary, stop bitching about clerics.  Yes SoE shows them unreasonable amounts of love, but if they don't and the clerics riot, it would break EQ.  Besides, don't you feel sorry for those poor bastards who have nothing to do except sit on their asses and then stand up every once in awhile to cast CH?  A lot of them are really fond of their summoned hammer, and since SoE is too lame to come up with a better solution than giving them a secondary slot epic, then why should we bemoan their luck?  Instead, we should be lobbying for SoE to make a lot more items clickable from inventory, because that would make everyone happy (except maybe the tailors that sell bags ...).</div></div><hr />

<br />
If we allowed Sony to do that, what type of epic would we have?  Back in the day, the epic meant something.  I mean, it was larger than life, it was a shooting star, it was an icecream headache.  If we were satisfied with just making it an inventory item, rather than something that we eagerly anticipated equipping, the epic wouldn't be epic.  It'd be mediocre.<br />
<br />
The only solution to this problem is changing what type of equipment it is.  Anything less would be a shame.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not complaining or whatever ... but it's a fact that Cleric's get to equip BOTH of their Epic's at the same time.  It would have been nice for Shaman's, Druids, AND Cleric's to have received Epic Shields instead of weapons and be able to equip both as well. <br />

/sigh I guess it had to come out at some point.  Yes, I do play a cleric.  He's a halfling, and his name is DonVito (hey I figured since he was going to worship the god of thieves...).  I created him to play with a friend who was just starting, but once I started I couldn't stop.  Last week, after investing countless hours in to him, he finally hit that critical level ... 15. /cry with joy. :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Seriously though, two of my best friends IRL play clerics as their mains.  I also have a bunch of friends in-game who are clerics.  They've taught me to announce CannV (they have weird issues about people's health suddenly going from 100% to 60% without warning), and I've taught them (well some of them) to Virtue dogdog (helps keep him from dying when I forget to pull him off on enrage).  I think one of the key marks of a really good player is having knowledge of what all the other classes do, and how that impacts what you do with your class.<br />
<br />
Two seperate and distinct issues got combined together in this thread because of a lack of knowledge about another class, and I felt it necessary to remedy that.  Our beef isn't with clerics: yes they can equip both epics at once, but if they are actually meleeing then they aren't going to, and if you do equip both just for the stats they get an extra +10 Sta +25 Wis +15 Cha +10 to saves +100 Mana primary; big deal.  After only doing epic 1.0 warriors got two weapons (three sort of), mages got an item and a spell, and we got a primary and an insta-click from inventory SoW.  How does letting Clerics have a decent but not really amazing anymore stat item after doing both 1.0 and 1.5 negatively affect me?  It doesn't.  What does affect me is when I have a TA, 1.0 epic, and 1.5 epic (oh how I wish this was a problem I actually had) and have to keep switching them all like musical instruments.<br />
<br />
Instead of being jealous of their epic, we should be focusing on the real issue with ours, which I see as being that we all are going to want it to be our main primary item, but that makes using our previous primary items a pain in the ass.  One suggestion was making the 1.5 epic equipable in other slots, but since slots are a key part of an item's basic design I seriously doubt that we will ever get to wear our Talisman on our ears or something.  So instead, I proposed changing the previous primary slot right clickies (and while we are at it most other clickies as well) to allow them to be clicked from inventory, because it seems to me that solves all the problems with minimal impact on the game.<br />
<br />
While I'd like to agree with many of you and just make the epic clickable from the inventory, I would hate myself for doing so.<br />
Well with the 1.5 epic I fully agree; it should be an &quot;icecream headache&quot; of an item.  The 1.0 epic still is for me, and I'll be using it until I get 1.5.  But once I do get 1.5, then that larger than life 1.0 epic gets to sit in a bag somewhere, probably in my bank.  I think that's lame.<br />
<br />
You might think that a new shaman pursuing 1.0 might view it with a little less awe if it's inventory clickable, but I doubt it: A) I think knowing that it's lifespan exists beyond the point when you get a better primary makes it worthy of more awe, not less, and B) until mudflation changes things ten expansions down the road, the 1.0 epic is going to be the best primary slot item for almost everyone when they first get it, unless their brother got them in to the top guild on their server at level 5 or something and they already have a TA, at which point I think the wonder is kind of gone anyway.<br />
<br />
Still, just to be sure the 1.0 doesn't lose any prestige, I'd be cool with making it so that once you complete 1.5, there's an NPC that you can give the 1.0 to, and he gives you back a &quot;sharpened spear of fate&quot; or something that's identical except inventory clickable.   That way the young 'uns get to quest for the same spear we did, but we get to keep using said spear even after we get something better (1.5) for our primary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shamad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">How hard is epic 1.5? The stats are almost potime worthy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Our epic is the ugliest damned thing I have ever seen. It's also not something I really want to wield in my Primary slot; I'd much prefer a RANGE option or something to hide that nasty graphic. But the stats are absolutely amazing to me. Never in my whole entire career as a shaman has anything that nice ever been so available to me. I'll be proud to get hold of it and wield it.<br />

Alternatelym figure out a way to keep the epic 1.0 visible on your character - Because it's quite obviously the best-looking of all the epics. Innoruuk's Curse a close second.</div></div><hr />

Epic 1.0 clerics primary, shaman primary<br />
Epic 1.5 clerics secondary, shaman primary<br />
<br />
How is that justified? Do &quot;all type of shaman players&quot; have UBER shields? I didn't ask for something that strayed from tradition. Tradition is, we get epic in primary, why did it change for clerics? What's the justification? Just answer this question.<br />
<br />
Every class has weapons that are better than their old epics.<br />
<br />
List the shaman weapons? I used my epic until I got into the elementals where I got charm bird staff. Before that VT did not seem that great at all, I rather have my epic. So go ahead and name them for us.<br />
<br />
If our epic was secondary but equiping it meant you couldn't have a pet up, I'd sure as hell be pissed. When the clock is running out I've seen clerics jump in and start meleeing with their summoned hammer to save the adventure.<br />
<br />
So because clerics use their primary as DPS, that justifies making their epic a secondary item. First, Clerics have better nukes than shaman! And 2nd, what about the shaman melee'ers? still doesn't justify why theirs is 2nday and ours is not? Again it's because the shaman you play with don't really care much for epic 1.0 anyways. There are a lot of us that do.<br />
<br />
<br />
So in summary, stop bitching about clerics.  Yes SoE shows them unreasonable amounts of love, but if they don't and the clerics riot, it would break EQ.<br />
<br />
This has NOTHING to do with Clerics, it has everything to do with giving people more options and freedom in the game. It wouldn't unbalance anything and I'm not asking for them to make clerics primary or worse or to make ours better. Just give me freedom.</div></div><hr />

You don't know what I do in game. Unless you have first hand experience don't try to educate people.<br />
<br />
There are only 4 classes that I have not played for countless hours. I 3 boxed Cleric / Warrior / Shaman in ldon with no one else. Lacking dps guess what happened? The cleric nukes while the shaman dotted and healed. <br />
<br />
You think it is ok for a high end shaman to swith in a weapon, epic 1.5, for conditional purposes. But you don't think a cleric should switch in a summoned hammer, for conditional purposes. On top of that, this condition comes up infrequently, and would not require a constant switch, while a shaman has to switch every 10 min etc.. <br />
<br />
While I deleted the stuff where you agree with me that something is wrong, you defense of the cleric class is out of right field, as if what I am saying implies they need some kind of nerf.</div></div><hr />

I also need to get my 1.5 to get my epic 2.0 which is going to be a long way down the track so dont think cause a shaman has ta epic 2 is going to drop into there lap, also cleric epic has a shorter reuse and if we wana get techincial there effect blows our Pos one out of the water. effect lasts 1minute hot*that gets over wrote by anything that heals more than 500 a tick* and also gives a small amount of crit dmg and melee dmg increase for my grp only..when the cleric epic does a divarb, 6min reuse AND a 2k heal AND a remove determental effects*eg..stuff you normally have to dispell to get off*.. now think about who got the bad deal, and on top of that theres is a shield.. we were the battle priest class the tribal people..and we dont get bash we dont get any epic shield or ranged.. we get a freaking main hand weapon, and if you get a ta.. you dont bother with epic basically cause ta is alot greater than some crap effect only some exp grp or raid grp that has like 1-2 melee dps in it that gets blocked by my own freaking buff.. our epic is yet another sign that sony devs are complete clueless to what we actually do.. also it has healing focus for less agro..last time i checked i debuffed and slowed the mob first not used my under powered heals to spam the tank.. also dont preach about how were balanced in oow, be a level 65 shaman without all the oow crap and do high end pop and god.. they didnt balance a damn thing they just pushed up to higher level..its exactly same going through those expansions.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Kanamori Hitatomi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">How many clerics *only* wield their epic.  I know just about every cleric in my guild (around 20 of em) uses other items EXCEPT when rezing.  There is no excuse why their epic is a sheild (should have just made it another procs every frigging hit even when max overhasted).<br />
<br />
Yes, it has been confirmed that the shaman epic 1.5 click does NOT stack with our focus line of spells.<br />
<br />
As for melee'ing.  I still do it on a lot of mobs, since our dps is crapy anyways, might as well work on melee skills again (since we got new stat caps).<br />
<br />
For our epic, the focus effect is a complete friggin joke.  I know not a single shaman (at lvl 65) has gotten HEALING agro.  Now slow or DoT agro . . .<br />
<br />
Write what you want, I'm happy clerics are the only epic I've seen that has a 6 minute reuse times (all the others are 10 minutes).  Now, who's overpowered.  It's not a question.  Look at the AC on any shaman item.  I know of one item that has 61ac, are there any better (btw, that cleric epic shield has more ac than 5 of my items put together and better stats, strange, since I'm in a raiding guild).<br />

Now as to Epic 1.5 I got no idea, havent even looked at Lucy to see...now as far as the Epic click stacking with Focus /shrug<br />
<br />
<br />
Has there been any feedback on this issue? Thats kinda lame that it doesnt stack, especialy with stats raising and a dex buff actualy have the possablity of doing something, albiet small.</div></div><hr />

The problem has been know and presented (and countlessily /feedback'ed (along with the pet thing) everyday by all the shamans I know) to SoE.  Answer is.  Well look at it.  Remember seeing those Top 10 lists on the SoE shamans lodge site?  Ya, that the time scale I'm talking about.</div></div><hr />

No idea about the stacking with Wunshis Focusing / Talisman of Wunshi, cause i dont have it, but when looking at the info from Lucy i dont see why it should be blocked.<br />
<br />
I think many people mistake that effect with out new OOW-AA Ancestral   Aid, which is a group HOT with added str/dex/agi overbuff.<br />
<br />
Ancestral Aid *does* stack with Focus of Spirit / Focus of the Seventh, and has proven to me to be nice in emergency situations.<br />
If Ancestral Aid does not stack with  Wunshi, then we have a serious issue which should be resolved by the devs. IMHO it cant be the intention to have Wunshis blocking Ancestral Aid.</div></div><hr />

Odd, it stacks with Focus of Soul for me, and Focus of the 7th.<br />
<br />
As to Wunshi's Focusing, already been confirmed above that it doesn't stack.<br />

List of High AC Shields (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/adv_search.html?classes=9&amp;race=0&amp;type=Shields&amp;effect=9999&amp;fzone=0&amp;foodtype=0&amp;smod=0&amp;stype=0&amp;stat1=None&amp;statlim1=0&amp;stat2=None&amp;statlim2=0&amp;stat3=None&amp;statlim3=0&amp;pristat=ac&amp;priwt=2&amp;secstat=hp&amp;secwt=0&amp;tristat=none&amp;triwt=0&amp;level=&amp;price=&amp;qt=b&amp;aug=y&amp;st=).  Also, while their shield AC may be as high as Aegis of Judgment's (the best shield from Luclin, which is six expansions old), A) it is their epic, B) who knows what else will come out of the top GoD zones and the locked OoW zone, and C) they are a plate class and we are chain.  Now this doesn't usually carry over in to shields, but my point is just that in general a cleric should have more AC than a shaman with equivilant level gear.<br />
<br />
Nice creative quoting, but please link the post where I ever said that. I do see where howler said it, one post above mine.<br />
My apologies, whenever I have a second quote by a different person in one of my posts I have to do it by hand, and if it's late and my brain fails to put the left side of the screen together with the right properly you get a misquote.  I assure you it was in no way an intentional misattribution, and I have edited the post to correct the mistake.<br />

Epic 1.0 clerics primary, shaman primary<br />
Epic 1.5 clerics secondary, shaman primary ... What's the justification? Just answer this question.<br />
First off, the cleric summoned hammer was added after 1.0 but before 1.5, which explains the difference.  As for my justification, I could reiterate it, or I could just quote what I already said:<br />
it actually seems pretty obvious to me how SoE can justify giving only one class in the game a secondary epic, when that is the only class in the game with a spell line that summons a uniquely useful primary weapon.<br />
There's nothing wrong with disagreeing with me, but please don't ask me for things I've already provided just because you didn't feel like reading it.<br />
List the shaman weapons? I used my epic until I got into the elementals where I got charm bird staff ... So go ahead and name them for us.<br />
Uh, why bother when you just named one yourself, thereby supporting my point.  Besides, &quot;better&quot; is fairly subjective.  But if you insist...<br />
Cudgel of Glowing Clay (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=20455) - Better ratio, focus effect that adds a lot more dps to us in most situations than our old epic dot does, and stats which are way better except in terms of wis and a few resists.<br />
Sharkspine Club (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=17876) - Better ratio, a proc that in most fights will do more damage then our epic DoT will if it goes off even once, and better stats except for resists.<br />
Noqufiel's Wand of Infinite Enmity (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=29728) - Better ratio, respectable proc, way better stats.<br />
Time's Antithesis (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=20895) - Better ratio, better stats, and I've heard through the grapevine that right-click slow is useful.<br />
If I really wanted I could keep this up all night.  Hell, just looking at ratio alone there are 35 weapons on Allakhazam that are better than our 1.0 epic.  Several have been around since Luclin, and one even came from LoY (who would have thought?).  And if you are going by stats, a search prioritizing sta x3 wis x3 hp x1 reveals 18 items better than our 1.0 epic.  As for effects, this is too subjective to do a search on, as it has to do with your playstyle, what focus effects you already have, etc.  But if you don't have burning affliction or improved damage already, even pottery-made items with these effects from the bazaar could add more damage than our epic clicky.<br />
Again it's because the shaman you play with don't really care much for epic 1.0 anyways.<br />
The shaman I play with don't ... huh?  At the bottom of my sig is this lovely little thing called a Magelo link, and if you click on it you will find that in fact the Spear of Fate is my primary.  <br />
So because clerics use their primary as DPS, that justifies making their epic a secondary item. First, Clerics have better nukes than shaman! And 2nd, what about the shaman melee'ers? still doesn't justify why theirs is 2nday and ours is not?<br />
/em bangs head against the wall.  WE DON'T HAVE A SPELL LINE WHICH SOE GAVE US SPECIFICALLY TO ALLOW US TO ADD DPS IN GROUPS WITHOUT TAKING AWAY MANA FROM HEALING, OR TO ALLOW US TO SOLO!  Meleeing to us is not what it is to clerics.  Different classes are different!  The closest equivilant I saw for us of their summoned hammer was dogdog, because both add damage (I suspect the hammer adds a lot more) and both are useful in soloing, which is why I used dogdog as an example in my post.<br />
Lacking dps guess what happened? The cleric nukes while the shaman dotted and healed..<br />
First off, if a shaman can slow, DoT, and heal with no problem in wherever it is you are hunting, why in the world would you even bother having a cleric when you could have a DPS class (heck even a paladin could add more DPS, and they'd give you a rez and off-tank as well).  You don't add a cleric to a group with a shaman unless you need the cleric for healing, which quite frankly you do need in many many places.  As for nuking, if your cleric has FT20 + MC3 + C5 + SD + that Lunar Whispers buff from the Burrower item + and is outside sitting on a horse, sure they can keep up heals and still have mana to nuke.  But if you don't have FT20 + MC3, and your group wiped once already so all your mana regen buffs are gone, and you are running around a hard LDoN barely having time to sit, there's just no way you are going to have mana to nuke.  Yet that is exactly the time you'd most need some added DPS, and you aren't going to want to give up  250+ hp/mana, a focus effect that reduces your healing agro, and a right click that could save the group just to get it.<br />
<br />
And you've still ignored the soloing issue.  We might not be the mighty soloers we once were, but soloing is still viable for us.  Not so for Clerics, at least before they got their hammer.  Even with it, they still aren't great soloers, but they can do Chardok or HoH (or I'd think Veksar but not sure).  If their epic was primary they could not use it while soloing, and if SoE told you that you don't get to solo with your shiny new epic 1.5, how exactly would you feel?<br />
You think it is ok for a high end shaman to swith in a weapon, epic 1.5, for conditional purposes. But you don't think a cleric should switch in a summoned hammer, for conditional purposes. On top of that, this condition comes up infrequently, and would not require a constant switch, while a shaman has to switch every 10 min etc...<br />
You can't just swap a weapon in an out with an item to get the benefits of that item's focus effect and stats.  You can swap a weapon in and out with an item to use it's clicky.  That being said, DID YOU EVEN READ MY POST!?!?  Half the post was arguing that swaping things in and out is a giant pain in the ass, and was trying to come up with a solution to avoid that.  How is that in any way saying &quot;it is ok for a  high end shaman to switch in a weapon, epic 1.5.&quot;<br />
This has NOTHING  to do with Clerics<br />
There is no way SoE can justify to me why clerics  get a shield for their epic and we get a primary slot item. Clerics  replaced their epic from their primary slot a long time ago. Just look at the Cleric  only Zek hammer, it is clearing much better than the epic. They also summon hammers that they can use for combat. CLEARLY clerics  wouldn't care if their primary was their epic.<br />
Ummm, I'll just let my bolding speak for itself.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, what it comes down to me is that there is entirely too much grass is greener class envy going around IMHO.  I forget who said it, but in defining class balance someone here said that classes need to be balanced against the content, not each other, because if they were then we'd all be the same.  /applaud.  I don't think we all need to be the same.  If one class get's a spell for their epic, that's cool for them.  If another get's two weapons which combine in to a third (warrior) or just two weapons (ranger), that's also cool with me.<br />
<br />
And if another class gets a secondary instead of a primary because they are the only class in the game which summons a primary weapon that can do things no other weapon in the game can for them, that's cool with me too.  None of this has anything whatsoever to do with our issue of having to treat our most prized possesions (2x epics, TA, Dain ring, etc.) like instruments that we have to keep swapping in and out.</div></div><hr />
