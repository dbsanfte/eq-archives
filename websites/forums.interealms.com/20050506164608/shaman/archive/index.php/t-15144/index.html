<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">hm... did you lose your aa's too? havnt ever deleved with this bug, but apparently you lose all your aa's... so why do you still have the elder tag? /boggle..<br />
<br />
EDIT: my bad.. i thought you were looking at yourself in 3rd person... and apparently are still clothed if thats the case.. along with a different name  :o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">apparently this happened if you pre-ordered LDoN, there's been a couple threads on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Actually, I ordered it earlier that day and canceled it after I got on the game and didn'thave my AAs, flags or graphics. This happened that night about 8 hours after that when I died.  Even though I deleved I still had my AAs.  And when I got the rez I ended up with 97% into 50... although it wouldn't let me port into Time to get my body back.  I did have my Elder title still though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The delevel to 50 problem extended beyond the repair of pre-ordering because all they did then was re-enable your expansions.  They didn't address the other complication which was a translating of the exp invested in AA back to normal exp.  With many people the result was a gain of 100% or more in normal exp bar (without any level gain), but with a couple the gain was severe enough that the exp did double back upon itself and made for little or no notable change, however it was still affected and at an invalid number.  When you died the game ran into the equivalent of the Y2K bug and decided once more to cancel out your expansions (but not in registry this time, so you can still zone through them) and reset you to the original max level... 50.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thats one HELL of a hit by Tallon Zek though!!  Dropped 15 levels at once, gotta be a record or something :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Salas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ya the text You have lost 15 levels is just funny<br />

Took the blue pill eh?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It's just the UI that caused it to say Shama.  In fact, I never even noticed that till you mentioned it.  I wish that I would have screen shoted it when I first told the guild.  We had two people that it happened to earlier than that in Time, and when I died.. I saw the text before I even started zoning, so I had about 10 secs to think that I didn't see what I thought I had saw.  <br />
<br />
When I first told the guild, I was like /who all valsuvious.  Obviously they laughed at me.  I'm a new member to the guild, and the head shaman told me that they only accept members that are level 65 therefore he was going to have to remove my tag /rude.<br />
<br />
Was a bit funny obviously though /sigh</div></div><hr />
