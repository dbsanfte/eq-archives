Why the heck wouldn't anyone want to be a hunter? Pretty crazy I tell ya. I am very thankful I have like 3 alts 40 or above, one of em hopefully will survive the nerf wars.<br />
<br />
Hunters did not need that. Flare works perfectly fine.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hey Mill,<br />
<br />
I enjoy your posts, in all honesty you usually seem to have very well informed opinions.  I also enjoy the fact that a knowledgeable player as yourself has a high opinion of hunters.  Too many bad hunters running around as alts has given the class a poor reputation.<br />
<br />
As far as the planned changes; the change to scatter shot is a &quot;fix.&quot;  Per the description, it is supposed to be instant, which means it can be cast on the run.  Right now it can not be cast on the run like our other instant shots, so it is being fixed.<br />
<br />
Track Hidden, in it's current state, is pretty worthless.  The range on it is around 5 yards and it takes a while for it to pick up a hidden mob even when it is standing next to you.  The range of all of the other tracking skills is the entire minimap, except for track hidden.  All hunters have really asked is to have the range extended a bit so that it can actually detect a hidden mob before you get ganked.  If it can't do this, then why have it at all.  I would think extending it to the entire minimap would be a bit overpowered, so I doubt they would go that far, just make it 20 yds or so, that would be plenty.  And yes, flare works as intended, but you rarely run around a contested zone spamming flare every few feet.<br />
<br />
I agree, they seem to be anti-rogue changes, but in actuality, these are just 2 of the many requested changes/fixes officially generated and posted on the Hunter boards by Caydiem, the moderator.  She was scheduled to have a meeting this week with the developers to address our issues, and it seems that these are two of the upcoming changes that she was able to share with us at this time.<br />
<br />
We still have several major bugs that continue to be a great nuisance, to include pet run speed, AotH, and casting delays on some of our shots.  Hopefully we will get some attention, all I ask is that they continue to fix the bugs and allow us to work as intended.<br />
<br />
Oh, and if we were the Blizzard darlings, we would not have gotten our dps reduced by 14% last patch.  Our resist pets would not have been nutered, and the spiderlings would not have gotten their attack speed reduced.  We've been bitch slapped by the last 2 patches.  Not the way you tend to treat the darlings.<br />
<br />
My vote for darlings has to be:  3. Druids, last patch made them better than pally's, 2. Shaman, did they really need to be made stronger?, 1. Mages, most dps, range extension and almost endless mana with the new conjurable water (4,200 mana?) and high int/spirit items being added.  Although they are not discussed much, Mages are definitely flying under the radar as one of the most overpowered classes, imho.  But I do love having them in groups.  :)<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I only have love for all of the classes (except those GD ganking rogues ;) ) But let's be real, visit the WoW general boards and read all the Hunter hate, and then tell me we are anybody's darlings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Scattershot doesn't scare me that much, the detect hidden really does. My brother has a hunter(and a 60 warrior) and the hunter is now 57, he uncovers rogues all the time with flare if they are anywhere close. But to have an active detection system all the time? If caught at range, I am hurting, badly, now it would seem sneaking up on a hunter is harder than usual. I mean christ, one mark and I am already screwed out of my main power for 2 minutes.<br />
<br />
I envy hunters to be honest, almost rogue damage, at long range, heavy armor snare on the run, snare up close, blind like ability, traps, tough pet, they do not need more powers.<br />
<br />
What it boils down to, is yet another rogue nerf, and a buff to the most played class in all of wow.<br />
<br />
Honestly, what is next, why not just take away stealth completely for rogues? We already have very light armor and no ranged utility, why not make rogues the easiest class to kill? Thank god I have a mage, a druid, and a shaman getting higher each day.<br />
<br />
Imagine if rogues had an instant cast, long range ability that made it impossible to shoot ranged attacks for two minutes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Millman,<br />
<br />
You made me all teary eyed.  I'll remember your plight next time I'm in group PvP with my guildies and the 15th undead rogue ganks me while I'm picking off the casters (which I can no longer do as well due to their recent range extension).<br />
<br />
I tell you what, I'll trade scattershot on the move and improved track hidden for poison arrows and shadowmeld on the move.  Or just give me a way to stun lock with my ranged attack, and we can call it even.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">&quot;Blizzards darling...&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, but that just makes me cackle my ass off. ROFL!<br />
<br />
We were the last class to be implemented, bugs and all, still with major issues 4 months AFTER release (not to mention the ones they've introduced in patches since release).<br />
<br />
FYI...Druids and Warlocks got attention long before we did.<br />
<br />
Seriously Mill, get past the class envy. It isn't becoming of you. :) Hunters are only now becoming what they were envisioned to be. Even after the pouch/quiver and pet nerfs, we're still a viable class sure, but nowhere near what was advertised.<br />
<br />
And I'll reiterate...[insert Thunderwolf's last paragraph here].</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thunder,<br />
<br />
I have seen hunters do very well, even when jumped by rogues, I could tell you why but you would yell at me. Oh hell I will anyway, hps. 4000-4200 hps at 60 is a good goal, easily attainable with still very high agility. Most rogues are dumbasses and really short on hps, an easy kill. Not saying they can't kill you, they can, but if you see them coming, all the time, pretty much makes you invunerable to them if you pay attention.<br />
<br />
We will have to see what happens with the skill, what the range is, but if I know Blizzard, and I am thinking I am starting too, they need to keep their most popular class at the top.<br />
<br />
If you are ever stun locked to death, you are doing something horribly wrong, or are already hurt. Stuns have diminishing returns and take a hell of alot of energy. Even with the addition of my mace stun, I have never been able to stun lock a decently equipped player to death.<br />
<br />
If you are in group pvp, somone should be playing anti-rogue duties as well, another rogue works best, nothing is an easier kill than a focused rogue on a victim.<br />
<br />
Oh ya, forgot, NE hunters can stealth too, stealth in a position, watch the rogues around you and attack at will, no wonder NE hunter is the most played class.<br />
<br />
I like the hunter class, I simply fear having my most important ability further gimped. Give my rogue mail armor then if I am going to be eating arrows before I can close, every single time. <br />
<br />
Poison arrows? Oh you mean like that dot arrow? or the snare arrow? Or the instant extra damage arrow? Have those already, don't ya?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Valgoth,<br />
<br />
druids and warlocks needed attention, warlocks still need more attention than any class out there, they are almost completely useless in pvp, and not much to offer in groups besides a hp buff and marginal aoe.<br />
<br />
I watched my brother level his hunter man, watched him get attacked all the time of course, he does well, very well, and solo is so easy as to not be believeable, sick pet, hit shoot, wait a few seconds, rinse, repeat, never even close to death by mobs.<br />
<br />
Darling class? Yup, hell watch the intro video :) Almost rogue damage, but at range, uber pet, mail armor, stuns, dots, snares, blinds, pretty badass.<br />
<br />
Maybe I am just griping, it just is not as easy as people think as a rogue, it is mostly perception.<br />
<br />
Mill</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Damn it Val, he's got us.  Yes, we are the masters of PvE.  Yes, we have many beneficial and useful skills.  Yes, we are a hell of a lot of fun to play.  That's why I'm a hunter.<br />
<br />
However, my issue is with the &quot;darling&quot; reference.  We are certainly not receiving the attention we require, just to fix our current host of bugs.  Scatter Shot change is a fix.  Several, more debilitating ones, are still &quot;being worked.&quot;    Yes, Druids got love, Warriors got love, Warlocks got some but not enough, and we need some.<br />
<br />
Rogues, well, let's just say it's tough to feel bad for you guys when you have such great dps, stealth, and cc abilities.  And you are a lot of fun to play, especially in PvP.<br />
<br />
I see your point on the impact of these changes to the effectiveness of stealth, however, no skill should be 100% effective.  There has to be a viable counter for every ability and tactic in order for the game to be balanced.  Flare, by itself, does not balance Rogue stealth ability.  Improved track hidden is needed to keep game balance and make this Hunter skill actually useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">/snap!<br />
<br />
Awww, hell! The jig is up! :)<br />
<br />
Mill, I'm not saying we're not an easy class to play, but that doesn't change the fact that some of our key abilities are bugged and need to be fixed. Roll up a Hunter yourself. You'll have a lot of fun with it, I'm sure of that. But you'll also be able to see the problems we're talking about first hand.<br />
<br />
What saddens me is that we ARE such an easy class to play (though maybe not to &quot;master&quot;), that every T,D,&amp;H has come out of the woodwork, rolled a Hunter alt, and tarnished our reputation quite a bit. I'm starting to agree, more and more, with Krup's &quot;Hunters are the EQ Druids of WoW&quot; statement.<br />
<br />
Hunters that don't put their pets on passive during instances, or Hunters that pull in instances using Aimed Shot, or those that roll on things they have no reason to roll on, or those that....you get the idea...phooktards, one and all.<br />
<br />
Hunters are a dime-a-dozen. Exceptional Hunters are not. It's sad that we've gained the &quot;druid&quot; reputation because of all of the idiots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">This change could effectively take stealth away from rogues completely, yes, it is too much. It literally would be like a rogue getting a fix that takes away your ranged ability, over the top. Hunter in group? Crap, need to stay away then, what is the point? There are hunters everywhere.<br />
<br />
Flare works awesome, if somone has the skill and patience to actually use it.<br />
<br />
Hunters already can demolish most classes with ease, warriors, paladins, mage, warlock, I do not know about shaman, but an uncovered rogue is certainly dead if the hunter can find his own ass with two hands.<br />
<br />
Improving a class, so that it directly hurts another classes core ability just sucks.<br />
<br />
<br />
Valg, you are correct, same with rogues, there is alot of them too, alot of stupid ones indeed. The deadly ones are fun to fight, others are easy. I do not want, however, a dumb person of any class to have a big advantage over me. Even a dumb hunter who seems me skulking about should kill me if he gets the jump at range.<br />
<br />
We are going to do extensive dueling when my brother hits 60, to see the best strategies between rogue/hunter, make it as realistic as we can, even though we know we are there. Will be interesting.<br />
<br />
I probably am just overreacting.</div></div><hr />

Wow, what a difference.  Hunters are fun.  I don't know why everyone doesn't play one.  I didn't play a hunter pre-patch, so I don't know really what the differences are/were, but post-patch, I'm still having a blast with him.  Never got to level 20 quicker.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">In reality, the patch produced a noticible decrease in bow speed, which unless you were used to playing with the higher firing rate, you would not notice.  However, for those of us, who like many rogues, have developed a series of attacks done in a pre-set sequence, it wrecked havoc with our timing.  So, not only are we firing at a slower rate, we do less dps, and have to now wait to do the things we could previously chain together.<br />
<br />
At least for me, it's not so much the decrease in dps that annoyed me, but the change to my playstyle and habits.<br />
<br />
But, yeah, we still rock.  Now if they would just fix the bugs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Druids and mages? Right, those are two classes that can put the hurt on us if they want.

<br />
Track Hidden = one class...Hunters, that can see through one of your abilities. One.<br />
<br />
The problem for Rogues isn't the ability being fixed, it's the fact that there are so many of us. Can't blame us because we're a fun class to play. :)I probably am just overreacting./em touches index finger to nose and points at Millman<br />

Last month Pally's were the most played class according to you Mill.;)<br />
<br />
Anyway, hunters need to actually use the skill for it to work.  If you're stealthed they might not expect you in isolated gankings.  Personally, I welcome the change as on my server it seems like half the alliance is rogues.  This week alone I've seen 3 alliance gank squads made up of 2 rogues and insert other class here (hunter, druid and pally last week were the 3rd wheels ... druid was the hardest).  I dread group pvp against rogues as with 2 rogues hitting me at the same time I get stun locked and I'm toast.  It seems like shaman die first in group pvp (maybe it's the tauren thing), so any edge is welcomed.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  BTW, I have yet to meet a similar lvl hunter I couldn't kill as a shaman.  Ignore the pet, Purge, FS, purge, melee, FS, keep meleeing, FS ...  Last week a hunter jumped me at 40% health and mana after a fight with a mob.  I dropped him in under 20 seconds with 2 mobs beating on me (yup, lucky FS crits rock).  Granted, he was stupid, I mean he never landed snare on me and tried to melee me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Trust me, it's the priest.  It's always the priest.  We were heading into DM, and saw an ally group heading in as well.  It was like high noon in some western movie.  We both came out blazing, and their group chat I'm sure mirrored ours, which was:  &quot;Priest -- priest first!&quot;<br />
<br />
Fortunately, I stayed up longer than their priest, and so we won.  They were killed, but I got killed as well, but my 4 groupmates were still up.  We camped them twice for giggles, then zoned in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I'm a bit worried myself, still I want to see how it shakes out before I start screaming. As it stands now even unstealthed I can take out a higher level hunter with ease 1 on 1. The problem I'm imagining are groups with a hunter chasing me down across a zone. If they increase the detection, and it's always on, then I want the same for detect traps and a fix to vanish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I don't think it will be a &quot;detect stealth 100%&quot; type ability. That *would* be too powerful.<br />
<br />
I'm willing to bet it has a chance to fail and not detect, and will also have its effectiveness limited depending on level discrepancy. Also willing to bet Blizzard has already considered this too. However, that being said...they *do* allow level 10 Hunters to mark level 60 Rogues. So who knows? :p</div></div><hr />

Subtlty tree with 3 levels of gouge...<br />
Stealth up.<br />
Premeditation.<br />
Cheap shot.<br />
Open up with 4-5 combo points and 4 second stun.<br />
Melee till stun breaks.<br />
Kidney shot.<br />
5 more seconds of stun.<br />
Hemorage before stun breaks.<br />
SS once.<br />
Stun breaks.<br />
Gouge opponent.<br />
Wait for energy to return.<br />
SS opponent before gouge breaks.<br />
<br />
At this point you've meleed the opponent for about 10 full seconds under stunlock.<br />
You are still at full health.<br />
You have 4 combo points built back up.<br />
You have probably landed a snare poison on the opponent by now.<br />
You have kidney shot about 10 seconds away from refreshing.<br />
You have nearly full energy.<br />
This is all without using a thistle tea or preparation to refresh energy and kidney shot ability.<br />
<br />
The opponent can't easily run due to snare poison.<br />
If the opponent is a melee type, you can back off during the gouge to put some distance between you while you wait for kidney shot to refresh before you charge back in for more stunlock.<br />
If the opponent is a caster type, 1 more SS and an eviscerate should nearly kill him.<br />
<br />
I haven't tried but want to try out vanishing mid combat to immediately reengage with the cheap shot to continue the whole stunlock thing.<br />
<br />
So, Mill, what would you do to get out of stunlock exactly?  Nothing.  That's the point of stunlock.  It's a *lock*.  You can't get out of it at the beginning.  If you could get out, then it wouldn't be called stunlock.</div></div><hr />

There is usually a 2 second window where stun drops, on a crappy rogue you might see the window open a couple times.  Playing a Tauren I can warstomp and stun them, but other races are hosed.  I don't know how an orc, troll or corpse does it.  Last night an ambush specced 60 rogue ambushed my 49 Tauren shaman (freshly dinged, no skill ups).  I did what every good shaman should do when down by 11 levels and giving a huge advantage to an ambush rogue ... I ran.  WS, and IGW ... I got away with barely any health left, but I bet the rogue was pissed letting a little fish evade him.  That said, stun lock is a HUGE advantage for a combat specced rogue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Stun Lock is great on paper, but due to lag, misses, energy etc its almost never a sure thing.

Agreed.  Hunters bring very little to an instance group.  Any other class would bring something more beneficial to the group.  In reality what do hunters bring - sustained dps and pet that can off tank if needed.  Burst dps is in better in an instance and a mage could poly and provide that dps, so could a warlock and a rogue would provide superios dps as well.  Shaman, warrios, paladins tank better.  We have little use in an instance group.<br />
<br />
I would say hunters are the best solo pve class going.  If it wasn't for the dead zone of attacks we would be much stronger in pvp as well, especially with the new scattershot change.  <br />
<br />
I'm glad my hunter is my main though, i just haven't picked out my first alt to be the group player yet.  Too many good classes to pick from!<br />

<br />
<br />
get your facts straight, % of ally, yes pally is the most, overall with both realms, hunter is the most played.<br />
<br />
Agreed. Hunters bring very little to an instance group.<br />
<br />
then your grousp, or your hunters, are stupid. Free high dps without getting into the thick of battle, that is very good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Juujuu, you a mage right? Easy, blink, poly, kill. Another rogue? Have hps to survive long enough to blind and then bandage, shaman? wait out the stun, NS heal, frost shock, war stomp if a tauren. Warlock? Forget it, unless sucky bus gets em your dead. Priest? Shield/fear/heal, if undead, shield heal, dot, continue. Warrior? Haha, no way taking them down in a lock. Paladin, ain't taking them down in less than a couple minutes, hunter? winglcip/scatter shot, probably dead just because of close proximity, druid? Rogue is already rooted, wait out stun, NS insta heal, get range, root, repeat, or heal and go bear form and wear them down.<br />
<br />
That is what you do, people die to stun lock because they don't have hps.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, and btw, a rogue has this thing called energy, yes on paper your little step by step rogue thing looks good, it cannot be done in the time alloted due to energy. Personally, a rogue using 4-5 points for a kidney shot is a friggin lunatic, that is a big fat evis. If they are snared, they arent going anywhere anyway, and a person with that build isn't going to have very good damage output unless they stay behind you, and backstab takes alot of energy as well. Alot of non-rogues always post these step by step 45 second stun lock things, without understanding energy regen and how it works. Bottom line is, get some friggin hps, if somone is an all agility build, all intel build, then yes, they are going to die.<br />
<br />
Did a bunch of dueling in the arena the other night, teams, and individuals, and I can tell you, a priest or a shaman with hps cannot be stunlocked to death, not even close. Not if they have hps and know what they are doing. Nor can a rogue or hunter with hps. tried it all. A smart rogue will not even attempt stun lock on a hunter, it is a waste of energy and not needed.<br />
<br />
Pretty amazed actually, serepi plays a 60 priest and is becoming damned good at pvp, even with fear immune trinket, he does very well against me.<br />
<br />
Silly rogues who play the gouge/backstab game with me are funny, they just piss me off and then they die.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why on earth use hemmorage? And also, if you need to vanish to kill somone, you are doing far too little damage. There is a reason I am just about unbeatable vs other rogues, because I don't screw around trying for max possible stuns, I kill. Enormous amount of wasted energy in your scenario to try and lock down a person. In reality, you could have killed them already, and his buddies are gonna come beat you down.<br />
<br />
Stun lock will work on a poorly geared, poorly played player though, which sadly, there is alot of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Why use hemorrhage?  Why use anything else when it's not applied.<br />
<br />
I'm just about to buy the 2nd level of it in 2 more levels.  Let's compare.<br />
<br />
Level 46 SS does weapon damage + 52<br />
Level 46 Hemorrhage does weapon damage + 30 charges of 5 damage<br />
<br />
SS costs 45 energy (probably reduced to 40 due to talents for most poeple)<br />
Hemorrhage costs 35 energy.<br />
<br />
So, hemorrhage does more damage for less energy.  Easy enough to understand?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Juujuu, you a mage right? Easy, blink, poly, kill.<br />
You keep going on and on about how important hit points are and having big stamina keeps people from dying to stunlock.  How the hell can you then go and say a mage is just going to go and kill you as soon as poly wears off.  With my mage, if I'm lucky I can crit my pyroblast for 1600.  My fireblast might crit for 1000.  That's still only about 1/2 your hit points on your rogue?  At that point, the mage has to start getting into real combat.  He's still snared from poison.  If you know you are fighting a mage ahead of time he's probably also casting spells 2x as long.  What's a mage going to do then?<br />
<br />
You can't say stunlock doesn't work, and then do a complete 180 and spout off bull**** about polymorphlock.  It doesn't go both ways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Pretty silly using hemo, upper level hemo gives + 7 to physical hits for 35 energy, I think SS is weapon damage + 58. If you are going to need 7-10 extra hits to kill your opponent, great, waste of time and button pushing otherwize. Hemo does not do more damage.<br />
<br />
Do you play a rogue? It does not sound it.<br />
<br />
I dunno juujuu, I pvp all the friggin time and we usually have other classes with us, rogues are never, ever a problem. They are in fact one of the weakest classes in pvp when specced like 90% of the people out there and facing a ready, well geared opponent. The only times ambush/prep agility wuss rogues are a threat is when there is two of them and the victim has no backup. Course any class would be like that.<br />
<br />
My mace stuns alone probably stun longer in a fight than the extra silly stuns somone wastes combo points on.<br />
<br />
I abslutely love getting jumped by rogues, they run around jumping and dancing doing all kinds of fancy stuff, worst case they get me to half helath before I kill them. Best case, they vanish and get away.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Vanishing in combat is a possible other tactic to combat.  Not every fight goes with you just standing there hitting SS and eviscerate and bladefury.  Suppose you and your opponent are battling it out, and you are both down to about 20% health.  Ya, you could just keep going 33333333333333 until you get enough energy to SS again and hope you win.  Or, you could vanish out of sight, stealth up, cheap shot for 2 more combo points and 4 second stun, and finish the job.<br />
<br />
There's other situations I can see where it's useful.  A mage lays into you after polymorph and then freezes you with ice.  Vanish away so he can't cast his next spell on you while you are frozen, then run up and beat the crap out of him.  When ice drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">My pvp rogue is currently level 43 and about 90% to 44.<br />
I've tried the combat build.<br />
I've respecced to doing a backstab/gouge build.<br />
I'm currently a subtlty build working towards defensive points in combat.<br />
<br />
So you have problems hitting your opponents 7-10 times in 15 seconds?  I don't.<br />
Hemorrhage does more damage than SS.  Mathematics doesn't lie.<br />
Hemorrhage costs 5-10 energy less than SS.<br />
Also any time that you have a partner hitting the opponent, they get hemorrhage benefit as well, making the extra hemorrhage damage take effect even faster.<br />
You still haven't said why hemorrhage is worse in any way, while I've actually used numbers to back up three times over why it's better.<br />
<br />
And I'm sorry that having to concentrate on hitting different abilities in combat confuses you.<br />
We can't all be the SS Kid like you are.<br />
I've got my hotkeys set up just fine to use more than 3 hotkeys every fight.<br />
Not being able to set up your keyboard in an efficient manner isn't an arguement as to why hemorrhage is worse either...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">I would blind before get much below 50% anyway. bandage to full. vanish, in my experience, does not work for crap. Even with no dots on it seems to not work, I do not rely on it.<br />
<br />
yes, blink and ice are a mages friend, many die pretty easily, some are an absolute pain in the ass, and I have never seen a mage run out of mana fighting me unless they already were low. I find I often have a dot on me as well, from fireball I believe maybe?<br />
<br />
Once again juujuu you show a misunderstanding though, you post a scripted list of a rogue that can stunlock for a half hour, then post about combat rogues being stupid and just spamming two buttons, thanks man.<br />
<br />
If I am such a stupid combat rogue, why do I always kick the crap out of all other rogues?<br />
<br />
I use vanish to,<br />
<br />
break root<br />
break ice<br />
last ditch emergency get away(fails usually anyway)<br />
<br />
The biggest thing you are not mentioning, is your theoretical rogue is taking twice as long to kill as he needs to, and his target likely has a friend that is going to come kick his ass, unless he is just ganking lowbies. Wasting a 800-2000 point evis on a few seconds of stun is the ultimate stupidity I think a rogue could commit.<br />
<br />
I dunno, I have pvp'd alot, and stunlock just is stupid, and not as effective as actually killing. I know rogues that try it on me are dead 100% of the time, where rogues that fight as fast as can are more of a danger.<br />
<br />
Time is a rogue's enemy.<br />
<br />
<br />
juujuu, you will get your ass kicked in if you ever face a decent combat rogue, so enjoy your rogue man, if you want to be insulting fine, I will be too. Let me guess, you are an aglity monkey too? Rogues like you make me life easier man, keep at it.<br />
<br />
Another fancy lad rogue thinks combat rogues only use three hotkeys, gotta love ignorance. I use a couple abilities you do not, does that mean you are a mindless button pusher?<br />
<br />
Biggest differences between our builds? Takes you longer to kill a single, putting you in danger, also, after you piss away all of your cooldowns, you are effectively out of the fight, where I am still going at a a good solid strength, ready to take down more. I enjoy group pvp because unlike most rogues I can survive a while and keep dishing out damage.<br />

<br />
On a side note, and keep in mind I know 0 about mages but what I've experienced is that ice mages are impossible for me to kill, but fire mages are pretty easy. This could of course be do to skill, but ice mages just seem to have a much easier time locking me down. Fire spells also seem to have a longer cast time which gives me a chance to close the distance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">I never said anywhere that I actually try to stunlock opponents all the time.<br />
I pointed out the method someone would try to do so.<br />
Stunlock works against some targets and fails horribly against others.<br />
You obviously don't use it when it's not going to be useful.<br />
Stunned targets aren't hitting me, they aren't casting, and they are staying perfectly still for me to keep hitting them from whatever angle I choose to attack from, as well as any other people that are assisting me.<br />
<br />
<br />
if you want to be insulting fine, I will be too. your build = wuss. Let me guess, you are an aglity monkey too?<br />
Of course the subtley build is wussier than the combat build.  No ****.  I do things besides stand there and beat on stuff.  I make use of stealth as much as possible, and it's the build that's giving me the most utility at the moment.<br />
<br />
Uh.  Aren't you an agility monkey too?  I'm pretty sure your profile said something along the lines of XXX of the Monkey on like every equipment slot you have.  Any insults to my gear selection are insults to your gear selection.  Thanks for trying though!<br />
<br />
<br />
Biggest differences between our builds? Takes you longer to kill a single, putting you in danger<br />
Probably.  I don't just want my rogue to be pure dps and no utility.  I tried out subtlety for improved sap, preparation, and the effective +20 maximum energy I have because of the cheaper cheap shot.  Once I'm done, I'll have all the defensive stuff from combat, and the extra SS and Evis stuff that you get early.  Ya, I won't have the duel wield bonus, but you don't have the utility I do, so when you die sapping mobs in instances with your group, I'll be providing group utility on top of just dps.<br />
<br />
<br />
also, after you piss away all of your cooldowns,I pop my preparation and use them all again as I wish.  I can do things unexpected in combat, like trying to vanish mid combat, because I have all my abilities twice over every 10 minutes.  I can escape a lot of bad situations because I can effectively sprint 4x over and vanish twice (sprint, prep, stopwatch, run potion).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">FYI...Druids and Warlocks got attention long before we did. <br />

I erased the wuss build thing, it was mean and I was bad.<br />
<br />
Number one, you make use of stealth? Duh, don't you think I do?<br />
<br />
Number two, gear, I am about + 120 agility, about + 220 stamina, so no, agility is not my prime concern.<br />
<br />
and this crap is just funny,<br />

<br />
improved sap is crap, useless, totally. In the few dungeons you can use it, I can survive a pull saping and taing the hits, or hell, have, duh, a warrior pull. Improved sap is a pvp annoying tool, that is all. When there is two pissed off mobs, see how my 700-800 dps does, and then talk about your cool improved sap. Utility? My ass, your build is a one shot kill wonder or run, nothing else, you have no sustained dps or survivability, I do.<br />
<br />

I can escape a lot of bad situations because I can effectively sprint 4x over and vanish twice (sprint, prep, stopwatch, run potion).<br />
<br />
you can run away better, some use you are in pve, and useless in pvp. You could not ever kill me, the best you could do is tuck tail and run. Wasted skill points my man. When you are 60 and fight a while you will realize this, not untill. This is a classic tactic of baby build rogues, run away with a second sprint, I see it all the friggin time. Problem is, by the time they try to mess with me, they are either dead, or I was using deadly poison and I combobulate them, boom, dead.<br />
<br />
Difference between me, and a subtle/assasin rogue is night and day, and I am the winner. I literally have only lost once, and that was cause no poisons on a zepplin and I had my head up my ass, won't happen again.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have been 60 for a while, pvp'd for a long ass time, on a really tough, high pop server, I kick the living crap out of every rogue out there, I think I am doing okay.<br />

<br />
 The big thing is this, only one type of track can be used at once, unless I am engageing in PVP for certian, I can not afford to keep it on. There will be mobs to track, and if not, then Track Humaniod to watch for all the other gankers out there is more importent that haveing Track Hidden up for a slim chance of actually detecting the rogue with it.</div></div><hr />
