<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Windigo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">In case you don't frequent the main Everquest.com message boards, Verant/Sony has asked for all of our input on their customer service policies as they are revamping them and want our opinions on what we would like changed or what we think is good now.  I've posted their message below so you can have the email address to send your concerns to.  I've sent off my 2 copper worth of ideas and possible problems I see already.<br />

Hello All,<br />
In the past few weeks we have been doing a full review of our Customer Service policies and procedures from top to bottom. On Wednesday October 24th, we will be announcing these changes on EverQuest.com. At this point we would like to ask our customers what things they would like to see changed to make sure our own thoughts are in line with our player base.<br />
<br />
Please send any suggestions or thoughts on this to policyfeedback@soe.sony.com. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Windigo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Here's what I sent in case anyone is looking for ideas.  I know some may not agree with my thoughts or I might be off a bit on some of my perceptions, but it's rare that they ask for our input and say they are truly going to listen to us, so I wanted to respond to them:<br />
<br />
-------------------<br />
It was recently posted on the EQ main site that you wanted customer service<br />
opinions and possible changes from your player base. For the most part<br />
customer service has been excellent for me.  Policies have changed a lot in<br />
the over two years I've played, so I'm not 100% sure where they stand now,<br />
but I would like to voice my opinion on some of the main issues that have<br />
been in affect lately.<br />
<br />
At one time there was a fair policy in place where if something ended up<br />
missing on a character due to a bug that the petitioner would be reimbursed<br />
whatever item(s) was missing then a review would be done to see if in fact<br />
the problem was true.  If it wasn't the customer's account would be<br />
suspended or banned and the reimbursed item removed from the game.  This was<br />
changed later to where no one would be reimbursed for lost items.  I had<br />
since been with guild members who I had helped get certain quest items and<br />
seen them use them, only to have them log in the next day and the item was<br />
gone.  All requests to have the characters reset to the day they had the<br />
item to prove that it in fact existed were denied.  I think it was a fair<br />
policy to protect people who honestly had problems and punish people who<br />
wanted to abuse the system and I would like to see it reinstated so that<br />
people who spend time getting items actually can have faith in knowing that<br />
they can continue to use the items.  No computer programming is perfect and<br />
there are bound to be glitches here and there that might leave people<br />
without things they've accumulated over time.<br />
<br />
I feel that sharing accounts is bad, as it should be due to it being stated<br />
as wrong in the license agreement.  However the policy of banning the<br />
account of someone who finds that their character account has been hacked<br />
and banning the person who hacked it is wrong.  There are malicious people<br />
in the world who will always try to break into someone's computer and steal<br />
their passwords and they in fact should be punished.  Those who are<br />
innocently affected by the many viruses and trojans however should not be<br />
punished.  Many of today's anti-virus programs don't find EQ-specific virus<br />
infections so someone may have their account infected without knowing it.  I<br />
think at most someone who has their account affected should have it disabled<br />
for a week while it is investigated and fix options are given to that person<br />
so they could make sure that they are no longer affected.  Someone who<br />
spends weeks, months or years building a character and friendships should<br />
not be punished because someone steals their information without them<br />
knowing.  If someone shares an account and that information gets passed<br />
around and something bad happens they deserve it, otherwise it's like taking<br />
someone's house away from them because it was broken into.<br />
<br />
I would also like to see the player counts back on the servers.  Often when<br />
there is a linkdeath problem or other server problem a player can see that<br />
there are hundreds less people logged on than there were minutes before so<br />
they know that the problem is widespread and not with their computer or ISP.<br />
This is extremely helpful in diagnosing what a problem is when often guides<br />
in the chat rooms don't readily know about issues.  It is also very helpful<br />
when planning raids and camps to see server population fluctuations to know<br />
if there is a problem and to possible reschedule a gathering due to<br />
technical difficulty, be it with the routers, servers, or connection between<br />
Verant and the general population.<br />
<br />
It would be nice to see more GM events in the game.  I feel since GMs and<br />
guides are part of the customer service program that this is a customer<br />
service issue. The storyline in the game is amazing and quite detailed if<br />
you choose to participate in it.  However if one has played for a long<br />
period of time killing orcs or doing small quests eventually gets stale.  I<br />
would like to see weekly or semi-weekly events on all servers to allow the<br />
stories to grow and to get more people involved in the history of the game.<br />
It would not be hard to do as there are many creative fantasy fans involved<br />
in the guide program or who could be included in the program to develop in<br />
game stories and quests for items, faction, and fun.  Pre-programmed<br />
interactions can do only so much.<br />
<br />
Finally, I would like to see more rezzes for LDs caused by connection<br />
problems between the general public and Verant.  True there are localized<br />
problems often between certain ISPs and Verant, and those should not be<br />
assisted because playing an online game involves link death as one of the<br />
possibilities.  However when people in Kansas, California, England, and<br />
Florida are being knocked off at the same exact time it is often a problem<br />
with the ISP that Verant has subscribed to to provide bandwidth and while<br />
not Verant's immediate problem, it is a problem with the service Verant<br />
purchased to allow customers to connect to their servers, and therefore not<br />
a localized problem.  So I feel when a certain number of people are being<br />
kicked from servers that rezzes should be given if found to be a problem<br />
with a Verant-subscribed ISP.<br />
<br />
That's all for now.  Thank you for your request for these opinions and the<br />
time taken in reading and responding to them.  If I think of others I will<br />
be happy to forward them on to you.</div></div><hr />
