<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Haed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How long did it take you to get from 55-60?<br />
<br />
I haven't kept track of actual hours of xping vs. total hours played down to the minute, but so far it has taken me as long to get from dinging 55 to halfway through 56 as it did to get from 1 to 54.<br />
<br />
I'm about to lose my mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I did 1- 61 in 7 weeks.  52-61 took 3 of those weeks.<br />
<br />
Are you in a tier 1 pop zone?  The exp anywhere else is basically insanly slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yeah get your butt into PoP. grouping with a level 55 in PoI he got 10% to level in I believe just over an hour.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Haed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've tried all the non-flagged planes. Maybe 20 groups since PoP came out. Not extensive experience to be sure, but that does represent some 50 hours played in PoP. I SHOULD have been able to make two or even three levels in that time according to what I've read, but my net xp gain in planar groups to date: About 2 yellow, scattered over 3 levels. 8(<br />
<br />
Seems my luck is just bad. Either I spend hours regrouping and rebuffing after wipeouts trying to get to camps or I'm the lowbie in the group and xp still stinks.<br />
<br />
When the pulls are good I average a blue an hour. When the pulls are bad... well, I've managed average NEGATIVE xp in almost half of my ventures into PoP so far. :(<br />
<br />
I have a 54 monk that I bot for extra damage some times, but about the only place in PoP I can take the duo is PoJ... and finding anything alive in PoJ is virtually impossible during prime time.<br />
<br />
And it's not that the xp is necessarily &quot;bad&quot;. I love seeing the bar move with each kill. But it takes SO long to complete a kill in most of the groups I've been in that the risk of fighting mobs that smack you in the 300+ range just isn't worth it.<br />
<br />
For a blue an hour I can hunt Katta guards in utter safety. I have YET to approach death there.<br />
<br />
Is it just the groups? Just my bad luck? Anyplace I'm not aware of that I might be able to two-box? (cuz my monk is in highly average gear. 2300hp, 1100ac at level 54 with my buffs. Any chance of him tanking in PoP?)<br />
<br />
Thanks all. I love being a shaman and I want to be an ORACLE!!!! ... but my enthusiasm is waning. All advice appreciated.<br />
<br />
P.S. I've even tried some exploring/testing. Shrooms in FG. EEK. Dead monk in less than 1 minute. Can't feign split the little casting bastages. Imps in SolB. IMPOSSIBLY large aggro range and all seem to have &quot;roamer&quot; aggro. Can't feign wipe them.<br />
<br />
Sad to say, the very best xp I've seen so far is popping in on the Iksar Pawbuster in KC for my monk's epic.. Lots of really fast kills means about 1.5 blue per hour for as long as I can maintain the pace. Surely there's a better way.<br />
<br />
Help me Oracle-won Kenobi(s)! You're my only hope!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Valrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Either I spend hours regrouping and rebuffing after wipeouts trying to get to camps Where?  The only place where I had this problem was in PoN, trying to get to the Docks camp when the (already sitting there) 60 ranger was pushing us to hurry up, despite the fact that we were waiting on a 61 Enchanter (too much information, I know, but a little background).  Consequently, we got aggro from random trees/spiders in the field, and got hosed.  You don't need to find An_Uber_Camp_01 to get good XP at 56 in PoP.  I got in several yardtrash groups in PoN and made really good XP.  Get a group doing the waterfall, or the Werewolves.  It's like being in DL (complete with n00bs, but hey).  The SCY in PoD is a tremendous camp.  I did the camp with my guild while I was level 56 (I think), and most stuff there was either even con or yellow...half a blue (roughly) per kill.  And I've spent more time grouping at the Zone In to PoI than anywhere else in that zone.  Yes, you can go around the 'tunnels', and find a 'room', but what the hell for?  Just go so far as the ramp with the Tin Soldiers..plenty of stuff spawns around there to keep your group busy.  If you're getting a group, and they're just killing the mob in front of 'em to pass by to a l337 c4mP, no wonder you're not making any progress.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It took me -along- time as well to get to 60. It was super tough when there was a class penalty plus our racial penalty. The two roughest race class combos were Troll/Iksar Shaman/SK.<br />
<br />
59 took the longest iirc....I cant recall exactly how many months it even took now......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Haed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well, I've tried the trash groups too.<br />
<br />
1% per kill. Average time to pull and kill a single mob: 10 minutes. That's 6% per hour, assuming no trains, deaths and constant pulls. 1.5 blue per hour. Slightly better than soloing guards in katta IF there's no deaths and constant pulls.<br />
<br />
I'll try forming my own group and skew it to the side of insane damage output. Maybe I can increase that rate substantially.<br />
<br />
Me<br />
cleric<br />
monk/ranger<br />
rogue/wiz/mage<br />
rogue/wiz/mage<br />
pally/sk<br />
<br />
That's a lot of melee buffing potentially, but could be worth it. <br />
<br />
By the way the most fun/xp I've gotten in a single PoP group was with me, 58 pally, a botted 60 druid and two UBER rogues. I mean, top of the server type uber. One was 65 other was 63 I think. Doing the basement to clear back to the trials guy. (sorry, can't remember his name. Big guy. Black robe. Long halway with grates in the floor and rows of mobs on either wall).<br />
<br />
Average life expectency of a mob: 30 seconds. It was insane, I loved it.<br />
<br />
Got a blue and a half and 500pp in drops in 15 minutes. THAT is my idea of a group. 8)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Valrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Average time to pull and kill a single mob: 10 minutesThen you're doing something VERY wrong...10 minutes is roughly how long it takes me and my 62 druid partner (usually being botted by a drunk Englishman whose main is a cleric) to charm and kill 5 werewolves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Nzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Took me 3 week of PoP Exp from 55 to 58 on a good group. Depending on the group and pulls i can get 20 percent in 3 hours. I am a Troll so that doesn't help much. That Average Playing though. Probably Ding Oracle in 2 week hopefully.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Took me about 7 or 8 months to level to 50 (back in late 99 - early 2000). I was 50 with a full bar of exp when Kunark came out and dinged 51 the first day in Kunark after I explored a bit.<br />
<br />
I think I hit 60 either right before Luclin, or shortly after Luclin was released. So, that makes it what?....2 years for 50-60?<br />
<br />
I was 60 with a full bar of exp again when Planes of Power came out, and dinged 61 the first day. Still only about halfway through 61, but I have Spirit Call and Radiant Cure and a level 52 warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Talsondar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Remeber, its not the desination (lvl 60), it's the journey...<br />
<br />
Not something you want to hear, I know, but I find the most fun I have in the game is when I put leveling aside and just go out and have fun.  Tell yourself you are going to grind X times a week and bum around and have fun the rest, even if grinding takes up 90% of your playtime, that 10% will make you 100% more relaxed.<br />
<br />
Thats just my opinion though and what works for me may not work for you...=)<br />
<br />
Started my shammy in 99' and hes 55 now, took a loooong break with him but 33-55 have been done in the last 5 mos or so.  About 40 days played or so total on him.<br />
<br />
Getting ready to ding 56 now so from what I hear PoP is the place to be.  Figure about another month to 60 or so with the rates of exp I have heard about there.<br />
<br />
Have fun and the Oracle title will come in time...:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">At 57-58 I was doing a yellow an hour at Hobs in PoN with a full group, most of them higher level than me.  We kept the outdoor hobs spawned clear and pulled a few glooms for fun.  Did about the same in a group of 6 INSIDE the maze (talk to Therin but don't start the event, just kill mobs).<br />
<br />
Duo with my wife (warrior) we could do 2 blues an hour doing trash near zonein in PoN or goos/rats in PoD.  Better XP at a few camps in PoD.<br />
<br />
Trio with my wife and another melee we did ~3 blues/hr in PoI near zonin.<br />
<br />
It's out there, but be cautious and don't overreach - a wipe is hard to make up for in terms of lost pull time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Boy have I run into some bad groups lately.  Looks like the tier 1 planes really ARE the new KC/Loio .. <br />
<br />
Had a cleric with us in PoD that was afraid of spiders, and guess what we were camping?  She had her back to the action the entire time and I think was just watching the wall .. cause she sure wasn't watching our HP.<br />
<br />
Had a bard (this one is actually pretty funny) who group shadowstepped us out in the middle of camp once.  Wiped out half the group instantly, somehow I got lucky.  This was just after we had a GM come and get one of our members out of the wall, like 10 seconds after he got out he died!  LoL<br />
<br />
And what is the deal with people knowing nothing about root aggro?  No matter how many times I explain to them that root = proximity aggro no one in my group seems to get it.  As in the rogue/bard/ranger getting nearly killed in under 30 seconds trying to tank a slowed and rooted mob while the MT is standing like 15 feet away.... /sigh.<br />
<br />
PoP groups are definitely hit and miss, so I say bring your own.  Lately I've got a great MT that has been exping with me (shadowknight) and all we need now is a few good dmg dealers to round out the group.  Clerics in PoP Tier1 are overrated ;)<br />
<br />
edit: oh and to post on the actual topic, you should try pulling for your group once you get canni4 and Kraggs Mending.  Mana is not a problem and getting singles is not hard if you know what you are doing.  Hell even two pulls are manageable with good CC.  I've found that nothing comes close to the exp I can get when I'm pulling for the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">29 days on my bst to make 60 ;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">1% per kill sounds right at that level but 10 mins is wacked.  The group is moving too slow if my poison dot finishes and the mob is not below the 20% health mark.<br />
<br />
The best exp I get is duoing / trioing with a druid / enchanter (hate to add druid to that list)<br />
<br />
Druid shaman combo in pon rocks.  druid charms raven shaman pulls and slows mobs hastes raven ... mob dies in 1 min.  with malosini on the raven and cha buff on druid charm usually goes full length.<br />
<br />
Regular groups should kill as fast as that duo but be spliting exp between more people.</div></div><hr />

About the same here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Haed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Update:<br />
<br />
Went to PoD last night. Spent about 2.5 hours there. Got 3 blue, but we had a little trouble getting started because of a massive LD wave. half the EDIT: ZONE went kerflooey about 40 seconds after I zoned in.<br />
<br />
Also VERY casual pulling. So now that I've actually seen a good group in action, I'll start taking the initiative on getting the pulls faster.<br />
<br />
Oh, and our only DPS was pally tanking (with that crazy arse 52/40 piercer! NICE~), 55 ranger, my dots and alpha dogdog. The occasional druid/chanter nuke. Add a wizard or rogue and chain pull and it would be RIDICULOUS xp. Just like everyone has said. 8)<br />
<br />
Thanks all for the convincing. Gonna chill in the planes for a bit.<br />
<br />
Oh, wanted to log in to check but servers are apparently still down. I have about 50 days played and created the shaman in like August 2002. I need tear and last two fights for epic. Have CMW (big help that is now that the nerfbat has been swung./cry) 7th ring for me and several other characters/friends, 5th shawl etc. And have logged about 175hours of raid time ranging from Dok royals to HoT to Fear.<br />
<br />
I only mention this by way of explaining that I really don't grind much, but I'm starting to feel some pressure (self and outside) to get to 58 at least, and 60 asap,  so I can really start helping out on raids.<br />
<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">1 year to get from 50 to 55.  I did alot of raiding (this was before the raid format)  and wondering around.<br />
<br />
I think now that I am at a stage that I am where I never thought I would be.  When I first started with this char which was right after Kunark came out I never thought I would ever get to 55 let alone where I am know.<br />
<br />
As far as I am concerned I won EQ.  Only took 2 years to do it.  :)<br />

ps- lvl58 is the ownage.</div></div><hr />
