<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Duurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, since I'm not used to this new BA focus... these are just the initial tests done on a couple mobs.... First I don't like that you have to have the Focus item equipped to get the 5-20% added bonus per tick/DD (keep in mind I would sometimes swap out the Coldain Military Wristguard for JBB and chain JBB while DoT eats away).<br />
<br />
This is what I found and think.... Used Pox and BoN to test, (this isn't a perfect test or parsed, but may give you an idea).<br />
<br />
Pox of Bertoxxulous:<br />
90 DD, and 111 damage per tick, for 1998 damage. <br />
With the new Burning Affliction... (keep in mind 5-20% added damage per tick) Direct Damage was 93-117ish, and anything from 115-135ish damage per tick, for a total of 2397 (2280 and 117DD) damage. <br />
<br />
Bane of Nife:<br />
140ish DD, and 214 damage per tick, for 1498 damage. <br />
With the new Burning Affliction... Direct Damage was about 167ish DD, and anything from 217-253ish damage per tick, for a total 2067 damage. <br />
<br />
Anyone have an idea what Breath of Ultor and Blood of Saryrn might do?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Thats how all the other ID items for nukes have always worked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thats how all the other ID items for nukes have always worked. <br />
Not really, ID items work on something instant cast, meaning you get the random effect one time at the time of cast,...ie 5-20% once.<br />
<br />
This is making it sound like EVERY tic of damage will have a variable effect. That is pretty different.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't ID items also work on rains, and each wave gets a random bonus?  I'm probably mistaken, but thought I remember it working like that.  /shrug</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Duurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I pulled the data about total BoN damage from the spell list on www.eqshaman.com (it's been out dated for a long time, and was looking for raw overall damage done by BoN). <br />
<br />
One test of BoN gave out a total damage of 2034, another test gave me 2099 damage. Don't forget that it's the DD+overall (~ 150+1498=1648) standard BoN... I've listed the total damage using a BA3 item. It's still over 20%, so don't ask me where the extra damage is coming from, again I said this isn't exact science, just what I saw. It possible I even miscounted on 2 seperate tests, damn ogres...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gudin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">is it possible that BA items add 5-20% per tick and not just 5-20% to the total damage?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Njorls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It looks like Burning Affliction stacks with Focus of Mediocrity, and probably Timeburn as well.<br />

Here's a log, had to use Ancient BoN since I don't have a BA4 item.<br />

Very nice that the 2 stack :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sithrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Check out this thread (http://necro.eqclasses.com/forum/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=20130) on the necro boards. <br />
<br />
It appears that all DoTs are getting an extra tick, even with no duration extension focus effect. Apparently, this was originally put in place to make up for the original DoT kiting nerf. So 9 ticks on Scourge of Nife with Focus of Mediocrity makes sense, and also helps to explain the damage disparity noted above. <br />
<br />
I have not personally tested this, though, so treat it like any other information you find on the internet.   :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I can confirm Crown of Ambivalence is still working on DoT spell, eg it will extend duration of dot/debuff/Q/buff by 15%; this is ****ing nice !! <br />
<br />
do VI going to nerf ? hope not</div></div><hr />

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Thats how all the other ID items for nukes have always worked.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah seems every 6 seconds is a checked for the 5-20% , atm seems each tick like a new cast of a nuke. after thinking about the two times i cast BON last night i kept seeing the alive with power messed for the wristguard every 6 seconds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>icebain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Its interesting I am seeing figures as low as 1% and as high as 20%. In all cases BON lasted 8 ticks (as we already knew) but the bonus is wildly erratic.<br />
<br />
2 examples<br />
<br />
1.<br />
Tick        Dot        bonus     % increase on 213.<br />
1	154 (base DD damage)<br />
2	237	24	11.27%<br />
3	256	43	20.19%<br />
4	254	41	19.25%<br />
5	248	35	16.43%<br />
6	250	37	17.37%<br />
7	216	3	1.41%<br />
8	239	26	12.21%<br />
9	241	28	13.15%<br />
Total	2095	237	<br />
<br />
Tick        Dot        bonus     % increase on 213.<br />
1	156 (base DD damage)<br />
2	228	15	7.04%<br />
3	239	26	12.21%<br />
4	231	18	8.45%<br />
5	235	22	10.33%<br />
6	235	22	10.33%<br />
7	222	9	4.23%<br />
8	228	15	7.04%<br />
9	252	39	18.31%<br />
Total	2026	166	<br />
<br />
Obvously there is some rounding to be done BUT that does not explain the 1% in case 1. I thought it was supposed to be 5% to 20% ?<br />
<br />
<br />
AAHHHHH where did my tabs go !!! And more anoying i based the figures on 213 dmage not 214 *sigh*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">To answer the original question BoS is hitting up to 380 a tick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I can also confirm that Burning affliction stacks with Crown of ambivalence. I did notice that the Spell efficiency IV no longer stacks however.  Has anyone out there tried with affliction efficiency to see if that one does ?<br />
<br />
Incidentally, I love burning affliction but getting a focus message every tic for every dot ... that's a helluva lot of spam.  :eek: <br />
<br />

Ssti</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Are you sure it doesn't stack?  Don't forget, the efficiency item won't &quot;sparkle&quot; until the spell finishes casting, you might be missing the message if you expect it to happen at the same time with the Burning Affliction &quot;sparkle.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Efficiency items don't go off until the spell finishes casting and the mana is actually spent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">It's about time they introduce a focus effect supression filter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Efficiency items don't go off until the spell finishes casting and the mana is actually spent.<br />
<br />
Indeed, I check for the efficiency message as soon as the spell is finished casting. The burning affliction focus is the only one I know of that doesn't give a message immediately upon casting <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Only thing I know for sure is:<br />
1) This totally screws with calculations of mana to dmg efficiency<br />
<br />
2) Fortunately the effect isn't enough to make me wonder about the DPS rates<br />
<br />
3) The double rate of spam for layering DoTs is driving me nuts.</div></div><hr />
