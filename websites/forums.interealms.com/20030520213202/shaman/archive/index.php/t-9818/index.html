<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Byakko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi there fellow shamans<br />
<br />
My problem is with my charactor graphics. I am unable to see armor pieces on my toon also there is a black shade that covers my toons body when i remove all the amror. (check out the file attached to this thread to see what I mean).<br />
<br />
I have tried everything from deleting all the .TXC files, updating my video drivers, updating directx, downloading all the .s3d files again, re-installing everything over and over, and playing around with the eqclient.ini.<br />
<br />
I even tried getting help from the tech support guys but they had no glue how to help me out.<br />
<br />
Here is my system specs.<br />
AMD Duron 900 MHz<br />
64mb Geforce4 MX 440<br />
<br />
If anyone has any ideas how to help me out I'll be very greatfull.<br />
Thanks:)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">First try typing /dopropertinting while in EQ.  Do all the usual stuff (log out, zone, etc.. - test it out) and see if it works / helps or not.<br />

If not, do you have luclin models on or off?  If you have any new models on, or if you switch back and forth, its safest to turn all velious armor textures off - go into your eqclient.ini file and, somewhat near the top, you'll see lines: (this is a direct cut &amp; paste from my file)<br />
<br />
LoadArmor17=TRUE<br />
LoadArmor18=TRUE<br />
LoadArmor19=TRUE<br />
LoadArmor20=TRUE<br />
LoadArmor21=TRUE<br />
LoadArmor22=TRUE<br />
LoadArmor23=TRUE<br />
<br />
- try setting all of these to FALSE, then restarting EQ<br />
<br />
Mine are all set to true because I don't have much ram, and so I never have any of the new models turned on.</div></div><hr />
