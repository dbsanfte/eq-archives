With them was two level 60 named guys with titles, like crusader xxx, but I can't remeber the title. Anyone seen or fought them?</div></div><hr />

One of the Crusaders spawns nearby the swamp of no hope zone, forgot where the other does.<br />
<br />
There is also a new mob on the hunter cycle, forgot the name of it, something along the lines of nightclaw raptor, drops a 2 ac 1 wis 1 int necklace for Cler/Dru/Shm, has to be some sort of a quest.<br />

Not sure if it still drops anymore or what.</div></div><hr />

Human Necro with negative FV faction. Dropped a fireflye candle and something else.  Anyone know what it's for?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Montecrizto</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 07:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The mobs were live for like 5 days before they took them out because the ring that was dropping, which wasn't even lore, was just too good when considering the difficulty of the mobs.  That and the quest portion of it seemed broken.  I was guessing that the ring was supposed to be a quest reward instead of dropping off any of the mobs.  If they're back in game I doubt its dropping again; maybe the quest now leads somewhere.<br />
<br />
The ring was 5AC 10 sta wis int 25 hp mana 15 poison/disease</div></div><hr />
