<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Getting slowed by an NPC is incredibly debilitating to players, and up until now you either had to just be sad until the spell wore off or risk dispelling all of your positive buffs while trying to remove the slow.  This change should add value to classes that can cure disease and make the spell line more useful. <br />
<br />
We are aware that there is a problem with slow spells generating additional agro due to the disease component, and hope to have that fixed in the next spells patch.<br />
<br />
This is regarding the cure disease to clear slow change and is from an eq.castersrealm.com repost from the eqlive forums.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>engelica</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">that was quick<br />
<br />
wonder how many tries it will take to fix it =)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tiqua Sunrise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Too bad you can't abolish disease to strip the slow off atm.  So you still have the warrior slowed and the shaman getting whacked on from the double whammy aggro.  BTW, for those that hadn't figured it out, the mage focus aggro reducer doesn't work on slow.<br />

Dunno about you, but the abolish disease on my kael pants works just fine in curing it....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">abolish disease on legs in 1 cast, counteract from chardok earring in 2 casts, has worked fine for me in all testing.<br />
<br />
Thank god they fixed this, I've been taking a boatload more damage than usual due to it, I think the clerics will be pleasantly surprised when they don't need to keep healing me anymore =)</div></div><hr />

That is probably because the earring does not reduce agro. It reduced mana costs for damage spells (1-15%, averages 10%).</div></div><hr />
