<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was a idiot in my youth and used a 1hb weapon into my late 30s. Now 45 My piercing is around 50 points.<br />
<br />
Could someone suggest a fast weapon for piercing, also what is a good way to raise the skill?<br />
<br />
Im using a Slime coated Harpoon now 25 dly, Its nice because i can quickly switch it with the howling harpoon in my range if I need to melle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nothing wrong with using 1HB - Ideally you want to keep all 3 of your weapon skills at a decent level.<br />
<br />
The only way to raise weapon skills is to buff your dex and hit mobs, and I don't think you'll find many piercers much faster than 25.<br />
<br />
The only one that springs to mind is the beetle stinger - 8/23. I personally used slower weapons (spine chill spear, jade prod) and I still maxed my piercing skill before level 50.<br />
<br />
One thing you could try, if you have the cash, is making Greater Null potions - they give +25 dex, and stack with Rage (last time I tried anyway).</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you don't, Slime Coated is fine.  Basically just haste yourself and get in there swinging.  Getting any of your melee skills up to 170 or so is fairly easy.  The skill raises after that are alot slower.  190+ is a bear to raise.<br />
<br />
Hrm, about 4 months agro I was working on raising melee skills with my cleric.  At that time, it was possible to raise melee skills (all kinds) on pc pets.  I brought a necro friend into the arena in Shadowhaven, and he just sicced it on me. Raised my defense from 150-190 or so.  Offense from 110-150, and 1hb around 30 points to 150 or so.  I wasn't that concerned with the offense, just the defense.<br />
<br />
I can't vouch that Verant hasn't changed it.  But at the time, it worked fine.  Note - you can't raise skill on other players, just their pets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, the epic weapon does use piercing, so in the end you wanna have your piercing maxed.  But it doesn't really matter anyways, even if you receive your epic with 0 piercing skill, just melee when you can in exp groups.  Speed would definatly help :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Mass killing Hill Giants in your low to mid 40's will do wonders for your skills, and at the end you get the bonus of never having to use any of them again because you can afford a JBB!<br />
<br />
Killing that many giants is like pulling teeth though. Hope you have a TV.<br />
<br />
My log says I killed 568 or them in that time. Oh god.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Mrens....<br />
<br />
what race joo be?  If joo a swiftail shaman then joo might also think about working on your 2hb.<br />
<br />
Grippa is right about keeping all of your weapon skills maxed but the mana free damage joo can gererate with a 2hb can be very nice.  If joo solo a lot and a lizard then 2hb can help a lot.<br />
<br />
Joo might think about that a little also when joo make da plans for da future.<br />

If I could do it all over again I would have to be a iksar though, all well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Pingpang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Spear of Mortification is a 6/21 piercer, shaman only that drops in Kaesora. Has a stun proc also</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">REIF is definitely the way to go, 12/19 with alac and you see you  skills points raise every fight.  One suggestion so, if you're still below 80 or so put your training points into it.  Gets rather expensive past 80, but a good use till then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yep. Most of my training points for 60 levels went into melee skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I recently went back to Halas and saw the trainer.  I just got a Spiritstone, and I guess it's been a while, because I have 205 practice points left. :P  I can't really bring myself to using them on melee skills.  Maybe I'll learn a new language or something &quot;useful&quot;.</div></div><hr />
