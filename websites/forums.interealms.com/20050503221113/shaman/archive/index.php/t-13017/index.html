<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ogath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">this is a patch message from the game ShadowBane from the 24th of this month, <br />
<br />
&quot; <br />
We apologize for the Login server downtime last Monday, which prevented many of our customers from playing the game. In order to compensate our customers for these problems, we will be extending the Shadowbane subscriptions for all current subscribers (with accounts in good standing) three extra days beginning this Friday. So this weekend’s game time will be on us. It is important to us that all of our customers have the best possible experience playing Shadowbane. We have a dedicated support and development staff working on these issues around the clock, and we will continue this pace until we can resolve these service issues. We are committed to providing you with the best possible service that we can. Thank you very much for your support and understanding.&quot; <br />

Dude! SOE could learn something from these guys! <br />
and it looks like they got some new competition!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you played EQ during the first month you got a free month of play because the servers crashed so much...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah, SOE needs to bring the servers down three or four days at a crack just so they can give us some free time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aemon Talishan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you played EQ during the first month you got a free month of play because the servers crashed so much...<br />
<br />
ugh... i never want to think about the first month after release again, much less release weekend.  a month free (i.e. $9.89) wasn't enough to cover the anger management classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Shadowbane will do this because they have to.  EQ already has 400k+ subscribers, SB is trying to attract new people, and looking like the good guy will help do that.  Give it a year or 2 and see if the same thing happened what they would do.  I doubt they'd be giving out free time though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sounds like the old Avis Car Rentals ads<br />
<br />
&quot;We're #2, we try harder&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>xDeMeNtiAx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">heh i got that free month for EQ way back, but the servers werent ever up for a 24hr period the entire first month it sucked ass</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>tannus vidar 2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I didn't so much mind the up and downs back then...It was that I had to run past the goblin I was fighting so I could hit it when it got there,because on the server it was there already...</div></div><hr />
