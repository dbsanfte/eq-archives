<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jhumpy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ahoy, starting a new char.. with decent gear.. etc.. Anyway, i'm just gonna make this short... What race?<br />
<br />
Vah Shir?<br />
Barbarian?<br />
Trull?<br />
Ogre?<br />
Iksar?<br />
Froglok?<br />
<br />
I was thinking of Froglok that'd it'd be cool to be the first 65 froglok or epiced one.. Iksar look pretty sexy with their tails but lack Plate wear-ability.:( Vah Shir dont have any real advantages, same with Barbs..<br />
Ogres have that immune to stun thing from the front through melee. Trull's have that snare necklace, regen, and can actually wear plate.. I dont want to name the whole shuh-bang of advantages and disadvangtages as i'm sure you all know.. <br />
   Bottom line, what race?:) Any help would be great !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Have you ever seen a short discussion about the best race for any class?  Even monks with only two choices will argue for weeks on this topic.<br />
<br />
Anyways, good luck.  I chose barb because I didn't want to be evil, and I didn't want to be a cat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jhumpy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hmm.. Yeah. But with Monks it's easyer opinion to me. Iksars.. They can't wear any sort of plate that is actually *good* to humans.. Like Symbol Loyalty of Vox =P Iksars have the regen, ac, and melee stats &gt; Humans. And their sexy tails. And the regen.. hehe. It's just stubborn Human monks regretting their race that they chose. The only downer for a Iksar Monk is the 20% xp penalty.. But thank god, it does not effect AA's other wise it might have been smarter to go with Human's then.. BUt it does not =) So easily Iksar &gt; Human! =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>steveo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There are seriously a TON of posts JUST like this one... Why not just read one of the others. There are usually 2 or more a week, and have been since the dawn of EQ.<br />
<br />
Normally I wouldent give 2 ****s if you posted a different thread on the same topic every day, but THIS particular topic has no &quot;BEST&quot; answer. <br />
<br />
Play what you like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jhumpy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ok, can someone link me a thread of this exact same topic then? Dont view these boards often obviously from this thread.. And also &quot;Play what you like.&quot;.. I like to play anything that has the most/best advantages over any other race.. Like it'd be harder for a Barb Shaman to solo near fungi tunic camp then a Trull Shaman due to no snare necklace.</div></div><hr />
