<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>asphyxia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I'm wearing basicly a mix between Banded and Blackened Alloy right now....A high level Shaman was nice enough to pass this down to me when i was around 9...Altho I'm not sure at what level I should start seriously thinking of upgrading....And I'm still using the same newbieshield I got from a newbie quest, that I need to upgrade as well any suggestions to a new Shaman?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Save up your money and buy Ry'gorr, Totemic  or Jaundiced.<br />
<br />
Ry'gorr and Jaundiced can be used into your early 50's until you can get some Velious quest armor.<br />
<br />
Totemic is good up until 35 or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>asphyxia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Any idea how much I'm looking for pay for those armors mentioned?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Rygors is cheap ... the bp is the only thing that sells for over 100pp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>asphyxia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Neat. Are Aqua Goblins best money mobs for me at 16?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">screw money, your not gonna earn hard cash till at least 39. IMO just concentrate on soloing at the best exp spots. Once 39 you could try killing HG's in RM for plat (5-50pp drops).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>asphyxia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What if I dont have the EQ to be able to solo?<br />
<br />
Got a +10wis +hp Harpoon 10 dmg 23 delay<br />
<br />
wimpey shield etc. <br />
<br />
I dont think I can really rely on root/rot tactics neh?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My experience at this level is that if you can donate for KEI it will make up for any lack of equipment you may have.  My equipment is better than yours, but not by much. I donate 10 or 15pp for KEI just before I go out hunting.  I pull the mob with a DOT, or Malise if they tend to resist a lot, root them, apply a slow spell and start nuking away.  When the root breaks I melee the mob to keep up my combat skills and nuke as needed.  I can usually kill a couple of mobs before I need to med.  I’ve been gaining about a level every five or six hours since level 19 and I’m now 31.  The KEIs can be a drain on your bank account if you don’t kill mobs that drop loot, but its made leveling a lot more fun since I don’t have to sit and med very long, so I feel its well worth it.  <br />
<br />
At nineteen I hunted at the bridge in East Karana until the gorge hounds and dark stalkers turned light blue.  Then I pulled from the cave entrances in Netherbian Lair until the mobs there turned light blue. Now I’m hunting in Marus Seru, in front of the entrance to Sanctus Seru.  All three locations have proven to be very nice hunting spots.  East Karana is nice because of the large variety of targets.  And if you get in trouble you can run to the bridge and zone.  But if you are an evil race, you’ll have problems with two NPCs that usually stand off the road near the bridge.  Netherbian Lair was much better than I thought it would be.  You can’t SoW there, but there are three zone lines close by so you can refresh your SoW any time.  The Netherbians can drop up to a couple of plat each, along with a few other odds and ends.  If you know of any gnome tinkers, save the porous mineral blocks for them.  They’ll love you for it.  If you get into trouble, you can either run to the guards or you can zone.  If I over pulled I would usually root the one I wanted, run the rest to the guards and come back to the rooted, soon to be dead, mob.  And Marus Seru is nice because of all the available mobs.  The Greyhoppers and the Stonegrabbers are social, but they aren’t aggressive.  And since the guards will only assist you with aggressive mobs, you can pull these two mobs right up to the entrance to Sanctus Seru where nothing spawns and battle away.  If you do get into trouble, the zone line is just a short jog away.  You won’t get much loot here, but I’m still gaining about a level every five or six hours.  As long as you melee the mobs during part of your battle to keep your combat skills up, I think this is a fun way to solo.<br />
<br />
Another option you may hear a lot is to fight in Paludal Caverns until you about 25th level.  This zone does have a great XP bonus, but I much prefer fighting in the outdoors where I can run away if I get into trouble.  However, if you like to group, you may like Paludal.  Just don’t be surprised if you find it vastly overcrowded.  <br />
<br />
At some point you’ll have to update your equipment, but if this is your main character I think you’ll find that the higher your level the more opportunities you’ll have for making money.  <br />
<br />
Best of luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>asphyxia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hey thanks for the tips.<br />
<br />
I do enjoy grouping...I prefer to fight in a gropu but I know I need to be well rounded so I am going to try your suggestions to improve my skills and abilities.<br />
<br />
I find it hard to get my piercing skill up to its max for every level because of the low INT Vah Shir have....So I definatly need to spend time rounding off my skills....All my casting abilities are basicly maxxed out.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks again for the tips guys.<br />
<br />
By the way: They give out free KEI in the bazzar now :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Your Int really has nothing to do with how fast your piercing skill rises. Any skills that you raise that are affected by int are actually affected by the higher of Wisdom or Intelligence. To get skill-ups faster, you need to get haste and swing more often. We don't get our first haste spell till level 29, but Enchanters get it at level 16. If you're grouped with one, ask them to cast it on you. I have a level 19 Shaman on another server and he partners with my g/f's level 18 Enchanter. His piercing skill is maxed for level, and is working one hand blunt once he's maxed at a new level.( BTW remember the skill cap for Shaman on melee is your level times 4)  The 23 delay you have on your spear is pretty good for your level and skill raising purposes.<br />
<br />
Don't be an outdoor Shaman, you'll just wind up looking like a Druid on roids and will be unprepared for higher level zones in the game. Indoor zones almost always have experience bonuses to them. Definately play in Paludal. It's worth waiting a bit to get a group at the bandits. You can make good exp still on the fiends ringing the lake. Try out different styles of fighting. Root/rot a mob. Try and slow/dot/melee the next one. Practice different strategies there. Then in the bandit groups, you can make some decent coin for the level. The bandits drop up to 3-4PP I think, and bronze armor that you can sell to vendors for 2-4 pp.<br />
<br />
Use the search feature in the Bazaar with the filters for Shaman and your race and search by slot for upgrades. I personally probably spend way too much time there myself, but I never buy something the first time I see it for sale. Get an idea over several visits what the average price for an item on your server should be before buying something.<br />
<br />
Good luck and have fun :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>asphyxia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Oh ok because I thought or read int he PoP manual that INT affects how quickly skills raise...In any case thanks all for the help I have a list of things planned out to do :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Calabar said it was hard to get loot in Marus Seru but he overlooked one obvious and quite lucrative source.  The greyhoppers drop Low Quality Rockhopper Hides which by themselves sell for 5pp and up in the bazaar or with a little more work can be made into leather padding which sells for 20pp and up.  The drop rate is quite good too.   About 95% of the time you get a pelt and well over half of those are the LQ ones.  The Greyhopper Pelts you get the rest of the time are a cheap way to get your tailoring up near 90.  Just combine a pelt and a pattern in a sewing kit to make armor.  Other than that Calabar is right about MS.  Easy to get a group there and almost perfect for soloing.  Just don't kill Recusos until you're ready to ruin that faction(it can't be fixed).  They start out indifferent but it doesn't take many to become KoS.<br />
<br />
Abividad is right about Paludal Caverns being a great place if you like to group although you may have trouble getting into bandit groups at 15.  If you can't, the shrooms and Phlarg Fiends are great XP until you can get into the bandit groups around 17 or 18.  The bandits will give you tremendous XP and good loot until you reach about 25 or 26.  At that point Marus Seru or Netherbian Lair is the next stop.</div></div><hr />
