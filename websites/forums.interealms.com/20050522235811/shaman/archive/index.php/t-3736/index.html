<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've barely touched the bazaar, but I can already see this is going to profoundly change the game's economy. <br />
<br />
The number of people actively auctioning items has gone way down, and I'm not sure if, as I suspect, this is the future of the player economy, or just the novelty factor of a new toy. I assume it's the future and more and more deals will be Ultima Online-style with NPC-type merchants.<br />
<br />
Here's what I predict:<br />
<br />
1) Massive influx of low-end items. Probably great for twinking or new characters. It was really never worth auctioning those 20 low-end items, but it sure seems worth it to watch TV for two hours and let people sift thru your satchel while you're afk.<br />
<br />
2) Common items are now worthless. You'll see prices plummet on items once the seller takes note that 21 other players also are selling the same item. Having this kind of steep competiton will only heighten mudflation on everything but items massively in demand (fungi tunic) or massively rare.<br />
<br />
3) Far fewer live auctions, which means bartering is dead. CBoL for Torpor? Sorry, pp only. Really, pp is supremely valuable now. Also, haggling is dead. You have 32,134pp for that 35kpp spell? Sorry. I suspect some people who don't want to be logged in 24-7 will /auc or use the bazaar channel, but I'm not sure how many. <br />
<br />
3.1) The phrase &quot;make offer&quot; may disappear from the EQ Lexicon. <br />
<br />
4) A wider selection of spells and items will be available at all hours. No more missing out if you don't play prime time. This, I assume, was the point.<br />
<br />
5) Confused buyers. No more asking questions about items or seeing stats as the text scrolls by. Know the gear or get lost in the shuffle.<br />
<br />
6) Phone bills rise across the world; servers snap under the load; computers everywhere overheat and die; and raids are cancelled because too many people are /afk to sell.<br />
<br />
7) Finally, OMG THE EC TUNNEL IS EMPTY.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shayman Quod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">No Economy?<br />
<br />
Look at This (http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99991847)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Now instead of a true bazaar, we have Walmart.<br />
I'm sorry but a bazaar without haggling isn't a bazaar.  If you think it is, you should go to a third world country and enter their markets.  It can be quite enjoyable to haggle with them over the price of a trinket!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I don't agree with #5 (confused buyers). You can inspect the stats of every item from the bazaar search window - this is much nicer than someone in an auction channel yelling &quot;WTS item_1, item_2, uber_item_3&quot; all the time and not telling you the exact stats.<br />
<br />
Certainly yesterday, the trade channel was still going strong on my server, perhaps the bazaar will get used most for low-medium value items, and the trade channel for high value stuff. So there is still hope for being able to trade for spells like torpor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I predict that the auction channels will stay strong.<br />
<br />
When I am online, I am always in the auction channel, unless I am doing something intense that requires concentration.  I checked the bazaar for a few items I want, and there were none for sale.  However, I know there are some people out there that have them, they just don't technically have them &quot;for sale.&quot;<br />
<br />
A prime example is my JBB.  Whenever I see someone auctioning to buy one, I take note.  A few days later, if they are still trying to buy, I ask them how much they are offering.  If I were to find someone thats making a really juicy offer for one, I would sell.  However, I would never say &quot;WTS JBB&quot; because then I would get about a billion tells from people who arent really serious about buying one saying &quot;how much?&quot;.<br />
<br />
In addition to that, I don't spend much of my online time in the bazaar.  I spend it hunting or raiding.  Having to be in the bazaar to buy or sell anything just doesn't work for me.  Maybe when the day is over, I'll load all my junk loot on to my mule and put it up for sale.  Any uber stuff I get, though, is still going to be sold via auction channel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Yathandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I like the bazaar cause I hate making offers.  Half the time the person has a price set in their head about how much they want for the item and I have no clue.  So then they tell me my offer is way too low.<br />
<br />
It really turned me off to buying from people.  There are some good ones out there, but I felt like most of them just wanted to rip me off.<br />
<br />
So I guess both systems will still be around, each for those of us who like to deal with player sold goods in a different way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Carrieanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">hehe #7.. Tunare has it's market in gfay not EC tunnel :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yeah, but I can see it now.<br />
<br />
/afk PST with offer<br />
<br />
Just for old-times sake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Some other side effects -<br />
<br />
   1. Dropped tradeskill and research items will be much easier to find.  Just go to the bazaar and buy them up.  This is a good thing, IMO.<br />
<br />
   2. SoW potion prices will be included in the price crash noted in #2 above.  SoW was selling for 110p on Rodcet (100p was a bargain); the Bazaar opened with a bunch of vendors selling it for 100p, then somebody undercut to 90p, now someone has it for 80p.  It's going to end up around 70p or less, I get the feeling.<br />
<br />
   3. Low and midlevel gear will sell well.  High-level gear will still be auctioned.  I already see this happening to some extent.  One exception: people who TRULY HATE to haggle may put something good on a mule and fix a price.  The guy I bought my JBB from, for example, set a firm price of 15k and wouldn't haggle.  15k is a good deal, it's a fair price.  I'm sure he would have gone for the mule-in-bazaar option, but /auction would have gotten him 5k more eventually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bahdluk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I went and checked out the bazaar last night for the first time.  I really disliked it.<br />
<br />
Every time I found something I wanted to buy, I went to the vendor and it wasn't there even though the /bazaar had it listed.  Untill it is fixed to accurately show who has what I will continue to use auction because it takes too long to find what you want and who really has it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">auction channels should be perma banned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Moribunda Twynkletoes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">For things like potions, if someone is selling potions for considerably less than you would like to sell them, doesn't have too many of them and you've got some cash...you can buy up their stock and sell it at your price.<br />
<br />
Is there any log of who bought what from you and when?<br />
<br />
~Mori *grins toothily*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">#3 is actually my biggest concern.  Sometimes, I don't have the plat required for an item but I do have something of equal value for trade that I just can't seem to sell.<br />
Fortunately, there is still the &quot;auction&quot; channel.<br />
<br />
Be nice if they could find a way to incorporate a trading system with the bazaar, course that would be hard to do considering an item's worth changes from person to person, thus it would require price-fixing to do properly (and price-fixing would suck).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Personally I love it.<br />
<br />
I sold acryllia and pelts like a madman last night.<br />
<br />
I dumped a few things I had no interest in at 100-300pp each and didn't mind in the slightest.<br />
<br />
<br />
I bought multiple silver etched warhammers for 80 pp and resold to vendors for 170 (do your homework people)<br />
<br />
Potions have always been a nudge IMO.  Honestly, if someone wants to undercut by 20 pp, let em.  It's their carpal tunnal not mine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I lik the bazaar.  It allows me to put up for sale all the low-mid lvl shaman gear I have accumulated in my bank and can never sell cause I dont want to waste the time auctioning for  50p item.<br />
<br />
I sold several things yesterday while I was running errands.  it was great.  Of course I had them marded way down as I just wanted to sell them to make room in my bank but still it is pretty cool to walk away for awhile, come back and see that you sold some stuff.<br />
<br />
I will finally be able to get rid of my Totemic armor and all the shields I never use.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
There's a simple fix for that man.  Basically change the interface so that when you click on an item, it'll tell you the pp value, plus the pp value (set by the vendor) of any items they will accept for trade equalling the pp value they originally set for the item.  So you want a Fungi, and you have an RBG to trade + PP.  Someone's selling fungi for 45k, but will accept rbg + plat.  They set the RBG to a value of say 27k.  So from you the vendor would accept RBG + 18k cash.  It's not that complicated, but I guarantee it's hard as hell to implement.</div></div><hr />

You, my friend, are the new entity I'm calling the &quot;trader raiders.&quot;<br />
<br />
You search for items like silver etched warhammers, forest loops, jewelcrafted items priced below vendor value, and you buy and resell. A guild of mine made 2kpp doing this last night. 50pp for a silver ruby veil? /cheer patent stupidity.</div></div><hr />

You can right click any item to get an immediate statistical info pop up window.<br />
<br />
People will still auction..and still do..floggin your wares (at least on this server) is still happening along side static /afk vendors.</div></div><hr />

Whoo HOO!<br />

<br />
Why do I feel like Michael Douglas from Wall Street? :)<br />
<br />
Yup I totaly agree.  They'd just sit there and never find out so I buy it, sell it and smile.  Same with Lumbjack caps and other things.  Way I look at it, we both get something, them what they wanted and me a profit for knowing enough.  Though I forgot Forest loops :) Thanks !</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll just quickly clarify, as my point was kind of misread. <br />
<br />
There are far too many items for sale to just sift anymore. No one is saying &quot;Helm of the Dark Puddding. 50 ac 100 hp 25 sta effect AoB. shaman useable!&quot; You have to be looking for a shaman helm OR looking for that specific item. So can't just be passively browsing now, you must be actively buying, and pretty much know what you want at the very least by the slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Epyx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Lol...luna im guilty of the silver hammer..you wouldn't happen to be on the Rathe would you?<br />

I was wondering how come it sold so fast I had set the price to 100pp hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Epyx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Mormegil...aye I see what you mean.<br />
<br />
 Although on our server we are still seeing a lot of &quot;flog wares&quot; vendors alongside the static /afk ones.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Personally I think it most benefits the lower level players.  Hrm, yet another piece of armor that isn't worth sitting around in GFay auctioning off.  I'll throw it on my bazaar mule and sell it for a handfull of plat more than what a vendor offers.<br />
<br />
Gonna make some alts and give them a couple hundred plat &amp; let them go outfit themselves with a enough stuff that I can take them out and kill stuff when I'm just looking for mindless fun.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>jsmaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">The auction channels and trading will of course still exist because the mules in the bazaar are most likely not going to have high end items sitting on them.<br />
<br />
The level 60 shaman that just scribed torpor isnt going to create a bazaar mule to sell his fungi, hes gonna auction it every now and then in the auction channels or trade it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">jsmaze: &quot;The level 60 shaman that just scribed torpor isnt going to create a bazaar mule to sell his fungi, hes gonna auction it every now and then in the auction channels or trade it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Why not? There's far more people shopping in the bazaar atm than watching the channels. Really, I suspect for big-ticket items, that person will do both for now.<br />
<br />
There's no reason not to put a fungi on a bazaar mule to rake in your 35-40kpp (Fennin price). It sure makes more sense than sitting in EC or Gfay -- zones where weight matters and banks are far or have faction issues. <br />
<br />
It isn't going to happen overnight, as we are creatures of habit, but more and more I suspect a slow attrition away from auctions and to bazaar mules, especially since it's so easy and the zone is so conducive to it. It's quick to create a selling mule and dump your stuff on it, and even when you're playing if you see someone buying the item you're selling in a chat channel, just log on to your current dormant bazaar mule and seal the deal. The bazaar is the place to be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is the best thing that has ever happend to my player enjoyment in EQ.<br />
<br />
I do think the people who are most unhappy with the Bazaar are the ones that enjoyed sitting around for hours at a time auctioning, bartering, buying low, selling high.  I can understand it, if you have the patience to do that you can make a lot of money.  I don't have any sympathy for them though, the bazaar makes MY life so much easier I almost can't stand it.  <br />
<br />
As others have said I think it'll drive the low end economy down to the ground.  People will have to sell that common stuff cheap because there's ten other people selling the same things for less.  I think it'll send the higher end economy much higher though.  <br />
<br />
The way I see it if someone has something that's normally selling for 50k, many people will put it up at 60 or 70k, go to work, school, bed, whatever, and see if anyone bites.  Why not?  You're not losing anything, just set it and forget it (heh heh!)  You don't have to deal with people telling you how overpriced you are, you're not even there.  Either they buy it or they don't, and if they don't you can always lower it later.  The biggest problem with getting the best price for what you're selling is findind the right buyer.  Well now you don't have to find him, you can go on about your day and he'll find you eventually.</div></div><hr />
