<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Blogch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i am having a problem with my SCRM stacking with my buffs.  oddly enough it works for FA but not Fo7.  my FA lasts 11 mins but my fo7 only lasts 1:35???  just wondering if anyone else is having this problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Wow, Blogch, can you please shrink your signature to fit the guidelines for the Crucible?<br />
<br />
SIGNATURE RULES:<br />
Size: no more than 100 pixels high, approx 250 pixels wide.<br />
LESS THAN 25K in File Size.<br />
NO java, flash, shockwave.<br />
<br />
To answer your question, I haven't noticed any issues with SCRM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i am having a problem with my SCRM stacking with my buffs.  oddly enough it works for FA but not Fo7.  my FA lasts 11 mins but my fo7 only lasts 1:35???  just wondering if anyone else is having this problem.<br />
<br />
How long do you think it should last?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Darguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well I think he is talking about Spell Reinforcement Mastery which is a 50% extension in the length of the buff.<br />
<br />
150% of 80mins is 120mins or 2 hours.<br />
<br />
So 95mins is about 25mins short of what it should last I think is his point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Maybe it's lasting 135 minutes and he thought it said 1 hour 35 minutes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Darguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Good point.<br />
<br />
I looked at his magelo and he has a Drape of the Unending with Enterninostrum which is a 20% extension on top of the 50% from SCRM.<br />
<br />
That would yield a duration of 136mins or 2 hours 16mins on the buff. And most likely before you could hover and get the duration it would be 135mins and change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kilgaroz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Only marginally related to this thread, but I use my pet as an FA timer then hit all the melee in my group.  Often times, I'll hover my cursor over the pet when I first cast the spell and it reads as 6:30 or the like.  I've got SCRM and Crown of Ambi, so it should read over 10 minutes.  Then, when the spell has supposedly run out (hover the mouse = 0:00), the spell takes some time before it actually wears off.  Anyone else find this happening?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">That's just a bug in the display of pet buff timers - the last buff to land displays the base time rather than the actual extended time. Buff your pet again with something else and his FA timer will display properly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kilgaroz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Heh I noticed this last night myself was was looking foran answer thanks</div></div><hr />
