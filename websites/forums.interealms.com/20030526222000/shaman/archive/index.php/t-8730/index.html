<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Errun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is weird, I can find no definitive data on this dot except duration and mana (heh).<br />
<br />
I have heard its progressive - meaning the damage it does per tick increases over time.  But thats a rumor.  What bugs me is Lucy doesn't say.  So do folks just not know for sure??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1300ish damage over 1 1/2 mins. 9 sec casting time. Splurt style, meaning it does more damage with every tick. Very low agro until the last tick or so. Pretty worthless in todays 60+ exp grind unless solo.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Errun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">So, for my information, Kraskster, what does Lucy tell you from that information.<br />
<br />
Also, even post 60, I fail to see that a mana free 1200-1300 dot is useless, especially duo'ing.<br />
<br />
One last request, I would ask to get a basic understanding of the range of damage per tick.  Based on what i have found, that may not be available.  If not, this gives me some basic information to work with, thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you have your epic yet?  If so, epic yourself.  Seriously.  That's what I did as soon as I got it.  The damage IS progressive.  From what I recall it starts doing only a few hp of damage and builds up slowly, where the last few ticks are doing a couple hundred damage.   This taught me that I should never refresh the epic dot until it was completely done or I'd end up negating the most damaging portion of the DoT.<br />
<br />
Epic'ing myself also taught me when I should use it as opposed to JBB or when to use both.  If the mob is gonna die in 30 seconds, use JBB.  If a mob is going to last longer than a minute, epic then JBB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The spell lasts for 14 ticks (each tick is 6 seconds). It does 12dmg the first tick, then 24, then 36, then 48... so the last tick it does about 168 dmg.<br />
<br />
Total damage is about 1260.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Question is answered in this thread (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=8463) from a few days ago.</div></div><hr />

Tells me tick amounts, range, resist modifiers, checks vs magic. Admittedly it doesnt say how much damage it does but thats easy to determine. <br />
<br />
The dot is useful in situations where you will be fighting a mob that lives 2 mins+ in your camp, or when you have adds parked and not mez'd waiting to be keeled. Even then, if you have the mana its generally more effective to cast torrent + icestrike or drop bane of nife on them. Generally the way I look at it, if I am going to cast Pox, i'll epic also.  I got my epic at 58, but I imagine that if you got it at 50-51 it would be a tremendous asset for a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Errun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Please understand, <br />
<br />
1) I am not well versed in Lucy.<br />
<br />
2) My purpose was to determine where and when to cast (plague, bane, pox and epic) and yes resistance checks are valuable as well as duration. <br />
<br />
Without the damage information, Lucy was not completing that picture.  I do try to find out myself before I ask a question on a forum.<br />
<br />
IMO, between this thread and the linked thread, I have gotten the information I was looking for.  <br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Does this spell get prolonged by  Extended affliction effext? i.e with Coldain Bracer extended affliction III, do we get an extra 3 or 3 ticks of damage, and if so, does it increase to 180, 192, 204 etc?</div></div><hr />
