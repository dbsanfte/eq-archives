<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Siglo Goodsmoke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This thing now takes 10% of the mana cost off of all spells except CH.  Is there any argument that shaman should be wearing something else now?  I am trying to convince myself that I can still wear my much beloved IGS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">for me this item would be situational at best.  Never a permanent part of my setup.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Crashem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">obulus death shroud &gt;<br />
<br />
10 percent more mana is NICE :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Duffe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">ill still be using igs, canni is still good enough for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ciele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If I could scrounge one up I'd ALWAYS wear it.  10% cheaper spells means less Cannibilzing ... less button pushing ... more playing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Since I raid a lot, no. FT items, Bard song, KEI, I never run out of mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>fenwyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The ODS now beats out the shoulder item from Chardok that I currently swap out with my IGS depending on the situation.<br />
<br />
The Chardok mantle is 6ac 8wis 1 to all saves<br />
<br />
The ODS is 10ac 5sta 3wis 25mana + the mana conservation<br />
<br />
Can't wait to get my hands on one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zorarian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">For iksar who have weak shoulder choices, yes probably. For other shaman races, probably not.<br />
<br />
Is mana regen a real problem for us anyways?<br />
<br />
-Zor</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">agree Ciele, less click/press on my canni button is alway nice, and it work for all spell except CH</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Straif</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">4 days ago I bought one of these for 400pp, it is now one of my best items :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Considering the changes to NPC casters, I'll keep wearing my hardened bone spaulders.  +12sv all &gt;&gt;&gt; 10% mana reduction when mana isn't a problem anyway. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I 2 box my shaman.  The less buttons I have to press over there, the better.  The difference is really nice, and very noticable.<br />
<br />
Can't see myself wearing anything else for a long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I droped my igs for a ww mantle, and a crappy one at that.  Saves just not as important as they use to be imo.<br />
<br />
Id use the ods though over those 2 (but i have mc3 on another item) if you dont have scm3</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I agree it's situational.<br />
<br />
<br />
Lets say a Kael Raid, I'd be going for Higher AC but on Xp runs, I'd take ODS all day long and twice on Sunday.  How often do you have Bard + Chanter?  Not very I hope.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I guess it also breaks down some when you hit level 60 and have Torpor heh.  Mana regen/efficiency problems become a lot less of a problem then.  Very nice effect and all, but from some of the horror stories I'm hearing about xp mob casters, I think resists just got a lot more important for everyday grinds.  Been raiding last 2 days, so no chance to experience it firsthand yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Did they put anything on sky items? (ala shaman shoulders from sky)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Demisius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Anyone else notice that the olbus death shrowd<br />
flickers whenever we cast canny?<br />
<br />
Seems sort of odd, considering canny doesn't<br />
cost any mana....   I'm worried that I'm getting<br />
10% less mana from my cannies and hoping<br />
I get 10% more ;^)......<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyone with a death shrowd care to do some<br />
tests?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">On the canni thing I have the same worry.  Unscientifically, I haven't noticed any difference in the time it takes to buff myself and then get back to full mana with canni, but I'd like to think Verant wouldn't be soooo stupid as to take away mana from Cann (though I wouldn't put it past them).  Getting back to the original topic, what about the 8th shawl?  Flowing thought effect gives more mana, and it has the added bonus of good stats and an increase to buff duration.</div></div><hr />
