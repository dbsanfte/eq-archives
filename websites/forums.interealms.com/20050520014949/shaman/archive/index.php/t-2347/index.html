<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'd like to see what everyone considers a &quot;true solo&quot;?<br />
This is largely opinion based, and there is many variables to consider but for me it involves the following:<br />
<br />
#1 Only shaman castable buffs. This means only spells you are capable of putting on yourself. Aka spellbook and clicky items. If you own equipment or items that have effects, they would be considered legal. No aego, no KeI.<br />
<br />
#2 Potions are legal. See #1. Ideally the shaman was actually the one that made them with his skills. State buffs, mini-clarity, damage shields all are good. <br />
Exception to this rule is stinging wort potions because of their cumulative effect. I'd even go so far as to say 1 Stinging wort cast per fight, but no more, not chain casting it.<br />
<br />
#3 Pets are legal and encouraged.<br />
<br />
#4 Any tactic is legal; this means kiting, root/dotting, root zoning, gating, whatever it takes to get the job done. (obviously exploits don't count)<br />
<br />
#5  You must pull the target solo. You must engage the target solo. You can split the targets however you think is best, but it must be done by the shaman. <br />
This means you can't have a group clear an area for you, so you can kill &quot;boss&quot;.<br />
I think fighting to a target, and then waiting for respawns is fine, and obviously locked doors require assistance.<br />
<br />
That's the things I can think of off the top of my head. What else is there?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Epyx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would have to agree with these points. All our innate abilities and skills..unique to the shaman class. We do have a DS spell etc its just that we need to create a potion to channel it etc...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ulver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Anyone can quest/obtain DS items like the Jaundiced Bone Breastplate, Coldain Rings, and Regal Band of Bathezid</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Agreed. Only items or spells that a shaman has access to.  No help from anyone else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You forgot one item:<br />
<br />
#6. Sworn affidavit signed by the soloer, the witnesses, and the mob (on his next spawn)<br />
<br />
Who's tracking this stuff?  If it's fun and challenging, do it.  It's not like your kills are subject to peer review.  If you want to limit yourself to stuff you can do all by yourself, great.  If not, that's fine, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I agree, soloing is meant to be done... Solo.<br />
<br />
When you are all alone in zone you get to do anything in your power, Summon a pet, use a DS, gate, what ever.  But the people that say &quot;i was lvl 10 and soloed a Hill Giant!  he was slowed by a 51 sham, i had lvl 60 druid, cleric, sham buffs on...but i did it SOLO!&quot;  they are full of crap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Riokhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I agree.<br />
<br />
Solo means I walked into the zone under my own power. Buffed myself. Pulled and killed the mob myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Solo is when I walked into lguk... went down to the live king... No one with me or there... full camp... made a pet, buffed up, drank a DS potion, and single pulled the king... then when I had my pet offtank the wanderer add and tanked the king myself through his LoH and everything... and won.<br />
<br />
<br />
and when I looted my froggy crown :D<br />
<br />
It would still be solo if I made regen potions, clarity potions, haste potions (http://forums.off-topic.net/images/smilies/ugh2.gif), DS potions, or any other potion.<br />
<br />
It would be solo if I kited him or root/rotted him, or if I tanked him.<br />
<br />
I killed him with no help at all - I soloed him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">&quot;root zoning, gating&quot;<br />
<br />
If a zone change is involved I'd say it is cheese.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Pingpang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If you root/zone to split mobs so you can single pull your intended target how is that cheesing?</div></div><hr />
