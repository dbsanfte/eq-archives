<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mookle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Seeing as I posted a question I thought I'd also offer up some info.<br />
I hunted Golras on the ice island at neg 5000,neg6000 (I think) south of the elf base anyway.<br />
With the pet I could solo them easy enough at 34 and very easily at 37. They are all reasonably fast spawning statics. Nicely spaced out as well and i never had any problems with adds.<br />
I avoided the Hulkings at the lower levels.<br />
With my melee partner we could mash them all with very little downtime and take out Hulkings too.<br />
In the time I hunted there I hardly met anyone else.  So be prepared for a lonely time.<br />
THe loot was pretty mediocre sometimes a few plat sometimes less.<br />
At 37 and almost insanely bored of the place I duo'd with the warr on Chief Owoompa (sp?) . Hes a nice fast spawn still blue at 37. He dropped mostly dross but we did get one Batskull earring in around 3hours of camping.<br />
To sum up:<br />
If you have limited time to play and want somewhere thats not camped and not too taxing the golras may be for you. And you won't have to listen to constant inane spam . Only the despairing OOCs of people who have fallen off/cant find/waiting for the boat.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Spiritmarked</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As a Vah Shir I hit this spot at 32/33.  Triple dot/root takes the golras down acceptably fast.  At 34 I realized that my melee skills (defense, particularly) needed a good bit of work.  Thankfully, 34 is an excellent spell level for this sort of thing.  Fully buffed- (Shifting shield, all 4 stat buffs, Fury, Talisman of Tnarg, regen) - I pull with scourge and go toe to toe with the golras.  Dog is hasted and str-buffed.  Not too bad, and defense has gone up a ton.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shubert TZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I went there last night for my Canni 2 scroll and at 37, all are light blue</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Korlace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I started killing here at lvl 30.  Pulled with envenomed breath and melee'd them down, another envenomed breath when they fled.  The only buff I bothered with was SOW.  Did have a REIF and 1200 hps tho.  Still getting a blue per 3 kills at 32.  The xp in OT with a full group was faster, but this is a great safe spot that you can use when you need to be semi AFK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">was here at 30, stayed till 36.  exp was still good at 36, but decided to hit the yeti's in dl.  had a reif, schw, and ikky bp.  led with slow, by the time they got to me, landed envenomed breath, then meleed to death.  by the time 34 came around, could keep every spawn clear with no downtime.<br />
<br />
head to dreadlands, do the same thing in the yeti cave.  careful of the pathing, it's a pain in the ass.</div></div><hr />
