<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Elenrak-FS-Rathe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey there all you fellow Shammy type persons!  I'm looking for info on what kind of forces I will need for epic fights starting with the Reavers/Ghiosk?  Also, what kind of strategies worked best on each fight?<br />
<br />
I'm a level 55 Shaman and I'm getting depressed now seeing all my friend Shamans that grew up with me getting their epics and I'm not going anywhere.  Thanks in advance for your help!<br />
<br />
(Hey, Bullwolf :D  Grats on the epicness, bub!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm sure you can find more detailed info if you use Search, but here's a quick rundown:<br />
<br />
Lord Ghiosk: Spawns from a Black Reaver, is roughly as hard as a BR. With mid range gear and a good puller, a single group around level 55 can kill Black Reavers.<br />
<br />
Neh Ashiir - Same toughness as Ghoisk, maybe a bit harder. Again spawns from a BR, but because of location, you might need a couple of groups.<br />
<br />
High Scale Kirn - The hardest to get to - A single uber-group can get to him the conventional way, it would probably take 3 groups of 50-55 people in mid range gear. Kirn himself is about as easy as Neh. There are alternative strategies for getting to Kirn, search and ye shall find :)<br />
<br />
The Iksar Child - Spawns from golems in Fear - these take a full Fear raid to kill, I honestly can't remember how hard they are as it was many levels ago when I got my tear.<br />
<br />
Lord Rak - Since the caster AI changes I think he's a bit less extreme. We killed him very recently (since the patch) using 3 mage pets, one of the pets went linkdead during the fight (well its master did), and we still had no problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Merlota</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">it should be noted that fire pets are no longer immune to his AE.  The old &quot;heal the pet and watch the show&quot; doesnt work very well anymore</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hmmm.  Can someone confirm merlota?  My understanding of the new pet resists structure is that they save against the highest resist available--their owner, or themselves.  Thus a fire pet would take it's own innate fire resistance and use it for a check against fire, but if a disease spell were cast on it, it would use it's masters DR to check vs the spell.<br />
<br />
Fire pets should still work.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I thought that the fire pets would still work.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought that the changes to pet resists were dynamic, meaning they'd change to check against whichever resist was higher - the owner's or the pets.  So if the fire pet's natural FR was higher than the owner's, it would still check against that.  Is that the case or am I off in never never land.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The top-end (epic?) Fire pets are _not_ immune to Fire.  The pets one level down are.   At least, that's how I remember it.<br />
<br />
Also, about the Golems.  They Death Touch (2k HT every 30 seconds).  You need to have a tank with some serious HPs (5k+) taunting and have a couple clerics CH'ing and the rest spam-healing.   At least, that's how we did it the last time.<br />

<br />
And the 2nd-best fire pets are still immune to fire.  One was beating on Faydedar the other day, it seemed to be enjoying itself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Merlota</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">was just posting this after we wpied out last night. tried a bunch of different pets, lvl 56, 58, and 49.  all were eaten by the AE.  Last time I did this the lvl 56 pet was fine, and have used the 49 before with no problems.<br />
<br />
Consensus on the mage boards is that there is a bug and the water pets currently are immune to fire. <br />
<br />
That being said, 2 clerics 1 druid and 2 mages were able to keep 2 fire pets healed from the AE and melee damage until we ran OOM so he would be tankable as long as aggro was controlled and he didnt turn around onto the rest of the melee.<br />
<br />
I'm on Tarew Marr if you want to chat more about this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I watched Rak go down 6 days ago to 3 fire pets, hadly any healing was needed. So if there's a bug it must have been in a very recent patch.<br />
<br />
It's definitely something to check is fixed before you do it yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>joebooracle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">wacked rek on 2 august 02..not problem with ae on fire pets.had 2..58 and 49..last patch fixed it..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Srob</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Completed epic on 8/5/2002 with 2 lvl 49 fire pets - no problems keeping the pets alive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kongming</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Rak failed.  with 2 mages 57 and 55.  fire pets dropped so fast.  we were chain healing and they still died..... dunno whats up with that</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tudorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">on 8-7-02, we went for Rak with fire pets..<br />
the level 56 decoy pet did NOT work for whatever reason, he got a smackdown. That's the one I had used when I did my epic and it worked np. the 60 mage had to let his decoy pet die and summon I think it was a lvl 58 fire pet which worked great along with the other mage's lower level fire pet who was roughing it just fine.<br />
<br />
on a side note, Rak was not taken that night due to the fact that he gated. It was decided on that raid to pull Rak from his spawn spot inside the house, out to the bridge =/<br />
Rak got down to less than a bub left and a gate went off.. he then proceeded to summon some people =/<br />
By the time ppl were rezzed and gtg, a Black Reaver had respawned in the first room past door, and Rak had despawned =/<br />
<br />
Note to any else who may try this: Yes the hallways inside are small and it can get crowded, but DO kill Rak there. There is no need for anyone to jump in and help the pets honestly, though at times it's common to see melee rush in during the last bub and finish him off a lil quicker. Just have the raiding party down the hall a bit from Rak and fend off any wandering mobs that may come help Rak take down the pets.<br />
<br />
The despawn brings up another point that people were upset about on the raid. Seems many people think that Rak cannot despawn. &quot;I've seen him up for hours/days etc..&quot;. True, the original Rak that pops from a Black Reaver should not despawn any time soon, if at all. Honestly not sure if he can despawn in that state or not. But once a shaman turns in the Tear and triggers the Scale to drop, THAT version of Rak CAN despawn. Best I can tell, the turn in of the Tear with a faction hit does a repop of Kirn and to a chanter on our raid, the first Rak conned even while the 2nd Rak conned yellow, if that makes any sense.<br />
Best reason I can assume for Rak despawning now, is say the raiding party fails and realizes they cannot take him for whatever reason (yeah I know it's a longshot, he's not hard), or they lose people due to the time, or whatever.. Well, then there would be a Rak on the loose with a Scale on him. What would prevent any other party from coming in, killing Rak and nabbing the scale, then just faction work True Spirit to ally to do the final turn-in?<br />

* Use the 49 fire pets.<br />
* Pull Rak's reaver, not Rak</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Merlota</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">we're trying to figure out what is what here.   looks at this point like the mage should have low resists so the pet takes it's natural resists instead.  it might be something like &quot;pet has resist of 120 to fire AND has a special immunity.  if mage's is higher it loses the immunity&quot;<br />
