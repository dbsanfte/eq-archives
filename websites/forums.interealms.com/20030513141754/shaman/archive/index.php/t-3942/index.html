<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well going on my first real raid in a few days in kael.<br />
I won't be the main shaman (only 51) but some suggestions on kael specific raiding for would very helpful.<br />
I've read most of the general raiding type stuff :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Get right up the giants skirts while trying to slow. At LEAST mele range. Tanks will like you alot more since the mob wont come running after you, it will just turn to beat ya head in. Never ever try and slow until a debuff has been landed, unless you like dieing alot. Since you wont be main slower, i'd just wait until you see/hear the main shaman cast, if he cant slow it, toss one on there and hope it sticks. <br />
<br />
Also, buff buff buff and buff some more. Learn it, love it, thats what a raiding shaman does. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Heelah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">be a good idea to keep HoS on all the melees<br />
/rtarget is your friend!<br />
depending on how many shamans (shamen???) you could get a shaman chat channel set up to aid in communication. <br />
(what is slowed/not slowed, malosi'd, etc)<br />
and protect your chanter! pre-emptive heals are a must if the chanter aggroes an unslowed mob! (like as soon as you see them take dmg/get summoned)<br />
at 51 in kael i did pretty ok on resists, we did left arena with 2 groups untill we got wiped by a VERY red protector of zek =/<br />
if you see the MA's life going fast, ninja heal to give time for the CH to go off.<br />
slowing/parking adds will also help alot<br />
basically watch &amp; learn your first time around, kael is a fun place =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This is from an old post by Zorlac that i saved. Kudos to him for a great summary:<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------<br />
Kael Drakkal<br />
<br />
Troopers: Most can be slowed no debuff. However some level 54 troopers are tough to slow no debuffs. They rampage. Can drop quest armor. <br />
<br />
Adjudants: Same as troopers. They rampage, gate and CH. Needs snare, they can run. Can drop quest armor. <br />
<br />
Legionaires: Apply one MR debuff at least. They rampage. Hit in the 160+ range. Can drop quest armor. <br />
<br />
Veterans: Apply Malosini. They are very resistant. They rampage and enrage. Hit for 220+ range. Can drop extremely rarely up to 3 pieces of armor. <br />
<br />
Sentinels (only Tormax area): Extremely resistant (red con to 60), usually need ToV like debuff to slow them. AFAIK, red cons to 60 rampage only, blue cons flurry and both enrage. Hard to solo pull, have 2 tanks with defensive ready they hit in the 220+ and extremely fast. Some are level 60 shaman buffed by Kykenka near Tormax. Can drop up to 3 pieces of quest armor. Usually it's 2. <br />
<br />
Protectors of Zek (Arena): Very easy to slow but apply debuff to make sure you slow it first shot, they hit in 330+ range so if they resist your slow, they will hurt you. Some are clerics, thus they CH/Gate. Needs to be snared, sometimes they don't gate but run. They can drop a nice blade called Defiance. <br />
<br />
Kalis Stormsomething: level 59ish, ranger PoG quest, easy slow, same rule as protectors. Can drop Black Blade of Torment. <br />
<br />
Gleed Something (near Tormax): Drops a 20/30 RNG/WAR bow and a 10/24 ranger blade. Hits for 200ish, easy slow, needs to be snared. <br />
<br />
Dlammaz Stormslayer (near Tormax): Hits for 520+ (double), has mega HP, can be slowed but not easy. Drops Cloak of Maelstrom, PH for &quot;a storm giant warlord&quot; who drops the Mask of War. Have a tank with defensive tank him until you slow him. You need 2 groups at least to take him out. <br />
<br />
Clerics of Vallon/Tallon: AFAIK, drops are only quest pieces for PoG cleric quests. Heal, CH, gate, run. Hit in the 200ish. Easy slow. <br />
<br />
Semkak and Grekan Prophets of Vallon/Tallon: Hits in 300ish, Heal, gate. Easy slow. Even if they resist, they will try to nuke you with uber 20point DD nukes so no real worry of melee. They CH, Gate, run. Drops are nice priest/caster gear but mostly Circlets of Vallon and Tallon. <br />
<br />
Bjakor the Cold (near PvP arena): hits in the 220+ range, can be slowed like legionaires, drops Gladiator Chain Legs or some very nice monk scepter. Rampage. <br />
<br />
Vealok the Angry (near PvP arena): same as above, drops Gladiator Chain Arms or the same monk scepter. <br />
<br />
Arena: One solid group can kill armor droppers easy. To kill protectors, clerics and gladiators you need more firepower because respawn will get you if not. <br />
<br />
Tormax area: Can be done with one group, but best with 2-3 very solid ones to pull out Tormax's guards, sentinels and other named from chamber.<br />
----------------------------------------<br />
<br />
The info on the nuking clerics has changed. I think they are bit tougher now as they cast that ~1k cleric nuke.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you are boring and you don't have to debuff / slow the giants (to many other shamans there) load burst of flame (yes, our level 1 DD) and hit each giant once to get the faction hit. You can go in and melee too (if you havn't maxed your melee skills). Well, that was what I have done on my 1st kael raid ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I started as Main Slower in Kael at 47. Still main slower for my Guild at 57. One thing I love to do is get the next highest Shaman (if there is one) and do Tandem slowing.<br />
<br />
If your slow does not stick,<br />
<br />
Shaman_01 /tell Shaman_02 My attempt to slow has faild. Your turn!<br />
<br />
and vice versa. Whoever slows it, Call it in the raid Channels so your tanks don't get skittish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">ended up doing sirens grotto instead<br />
I was only shaman there and main slower.<br />
heaps of fun :)<br />
Only wiped on a lvl 63 mob</div></div><hr />
