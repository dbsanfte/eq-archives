<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Been killing some of these and the pestilent puslings with an sk friend of mine , his bst on 2nd account and my shaman and palidan. Course him being an sk he can pull 4 (hut we sit by has 4 in can vary i think) and fd and do his thing to split them. <br />
<br />
   My question is there any of them that i can split up with my 61 shaman and 60 palidan? Prolblem i mean is the pull. Ive killed two before by myself  on &quot;tag&quot; overpull.   wasnt easy since the wretched enrage and summon and the pestilant ones HT. Healing the shaman who's being summoned each time root breaks, while the pally is about to have an enraged mob (at low mob health) was fun. <br />
<br />
   My puters arent on top of each other so takes a little work and i dont know how much i could assist myself with 2nd puter to pull. Maybe there is a smaller amount in a hut i could do i dont know about? The ones we were at are all lvl 55 to i guess 57ish and they take some work but its fun and been decent aa exp. My sk friend isnt on as much as me and i would like to see if i could find a place to kill them myself without getting wiped each pull. They hit up into the mid 300's and 4 angry unslowed ones hurt a bit. Anyone have any suggestions?</div></div><hr />

       Zone is pod. My friends and i both 2 box and we were set up along righ zone wall one of the last huts before you get to CY's i guess it is. The huts have different types of puslings in them and we found one with 4 wretched non casting puslings. He would also pull from other places close by and split them up. I was just wondering if there is any place i could get a small hut of these split up to two box? <br />
<br />
      My palidan just hit 61 with me and i have all my spells for both char's and been trying to figure out where to go hunt since i'm not flagged for tier 2 atm. Puslings are doable single but thats the problem they come in bunches far as i can tell.</div></div><hr />
