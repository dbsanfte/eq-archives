<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Haimon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone by chance traded some Tae Ew blood vials for any of the armor pieces? I have been soloing the enterance to CT and have picked up a few vials and was thinking of searching out a smith to work out a deal. If not...how much do they sell on your servers?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dsalcedo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Tae Ew blood typically goes for 3k a piece on Quellious.  However if you can find a nice smith then they will usually do the combine for a small fee or free depending on how many components you give.  I usually do a 2 for 1 deal with a blacksmith on the server.  Enough components for 2 tries with the extra going towards the smith.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jedediah Bloodmoor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Typically any smith will make the attempt for 300pp per item(the cost of the other components)if you have the blood and their not busy, at least they did for me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I hunted CT entrance with 61 Mage guildmate (who has 248 in smithing) and we got 3 vials in about 90 minutes (I think we were really lucky).  He made me some nice leggins :)<br />
<br />
Do you have a guild smith who can do combines for you?<br />

I nice chanter in PoK did the distill mana part for me free (I supplied the two sapphires and poison vial).<br />

hmm, on Xev you can't give those things away anymore.  Shield is down to 7 k, tunics and legs to 8 k.  Tae Ew blood prices have dropped accordingly.</div></div><hr />

At 60+ a shaman could solo the two entrance mobs, although he might need some help splitting them in the first place.  The blood drops about 1/4 mobs.<br />
<br />
The rest of the components, as said earlier, are cheap.  All it takes is knowing the Smith to make them.  Don't get ripped off by others selling this blood for extreme prices, and don't get ripped off by sellers of the shield or armor.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Scurvey Pestilential</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I was auctioning for a GM blacksmith last night to do combines for tunic and shield on Sol RO.  I get a tell from this dr00d called Perl, asking for 5k per combine.  I said no thx, she then sent me a tell along the lines of &quot;LOL, do you know how much is costs to get to GM in smithing, you pay 5k and you get a 20k item and a 30k item&quot;.  <br />
<br />
So I said no thx again, and got another tell back saying &quot;ROFL&quot;.  She then started spamming the zone shouting &quot;ROFL, Scurvey thinks 5k it too much for a 250+ smithing combine&quot;.<br />
<br />
I could have replied along the lines of, &quot;No one forced you to get to GM blacksmithing, and I think you'll find if you go to the bazaar your prices are somewhat outdated as is clearly your thinking.  Greedy, immature bitch.&quot;<br />
<br />
But then I thought, nah that would just be lowering myself to her level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Meschit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Tae Ew smithing is so farggin' easy. It doesn't require a zillion subcombines, and it's amazing that VI hasn't nerfed it yet. I equipped every priest class in my guild with the shields, and just about every chain wearer has got tunic and legs. I still got enough blood out of it to pad out my bank account pretty nicely. I managed to sell Tae Ew weapons and armor before the market got saturated.<br />
<br />
Have yet to find pristine scales or swampwood staffs though. Guild has raided 4C top and bottom, cleared out maze, CY and mud temple. Nothin'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Prices are getting near to 15k tunic, 10k legs on AB. Been dropping fast over the last month as people finally caught on.  Blood was going for 2k each but I've not checked recently. For something comparable to SS quest gear, the BP and legs are well worth the effort if you aren't raiding HoT on a regular basis (or don't have the DKP/RP for it).<br />
<br />
I got some of my blood ages ago with a group. I then went back for more, and could easily solo the 2 entrance mobs. Root one, slow the other, then malo/malosini the rooted one (so root lasts longer). Slow the rooted one for safety. The just epic, dotx2, JBB and reapply dots as needed. I used alpha pet with focus and celery. Torpor<br />
<br />
By the time the root broke, the first mob was nearly dead. Finished it off, switched to the next and killed that. After that with the 2 broken just wait for the respawn.<br />
<br />
I tried the next pair a few times. They are tough! I used root to try and break the spawn, zone out and then pick of the one I'd left rooted near the zone. The AE rain is a real PITA and killed Fido. The best I managed was when I got the lizard down to about 30% but then I was oom (with horse, canni V and KEI) and had to zone. I also had virtue. I wouldn't recommend even trying the second pair if you don't have at least 3k hp buffed.<br />
<br />
In summary - best to take a partner or a group along but it can be fun soloing there if you are 61+ (epic and torpor recommended). The blood isn't that rare a drop, certainly there's no need to pay 2k per vial. I got 2 from soloing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">As a gm smith, I can tell you that 300pp for a combine is an insulting amount. All  I do is click combine? Funny, all the guy selling torpor did was click loot. Furthermore, every tunic/shield I make for someone means thats one less potential customer I could sell to, and one more competitor. It also means that people will try and buy supplies, jacking the price on them up. I never do free combines for anyone not in my guild, or a close friend, and urge other tradeskillers to do the same. It only screws up the already piss poor server economy.<br />
<br />
I will combine for 4 times the amount in supplies (ie you keep first success, I get the rest), or 1/3 my normal selling price, whichever people want to do. You wanna get components? Cool man, I'll cut ya a break, but dont think you did even a tiny fraction of the work. My opportunity cost for gm smithing was me not being 65 with 2 dozen aa.  I did this to make money, while everyone else was leveling. Dont like it? Find a new gm smith. <br />
<br />
People generally find my deals quite reasonable, roughly 7k a sheet on the plate armor, 5k on the chain. Tae ew stuff varies, but normally about 15k on the tunic, and 20 or so on the shield. I take crap I or my guild can use and sell in trade, and offer generous amounts on tradeskill components. I offer repeat customer discounts (I think one person has had my gnome combine over 40 nightmare bows), and feel confident in my rep. I dont need to hustle sales any more, and I certainly dont need to hand you a 15-20k shield for 300pp lol. :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only people that have taken a tradeskill up that high will truly understand. <br />
<br />
It's not just clicking a button. If it were that easy then everyone would do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">And as a poor person, not everyone else understands that we sometimes can't pay 15k for it.  I've never been good at getting money in this game and would be more than happy to gather components for the items above and beyond how much it takes for the item I want.<br />
<br />
And as far as just clicking combine, that is correct.  If all the items are provided you still click the button to make it combine.  this is not to impune time taken to get the skill, but for me you'd either get the 600(for example, I would probably pay more or work an agreement out with the smith) or none at all :/  I'd love the upgrade, but have survived so far.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most tradeskillers will just not take the 600pp. Similar to when someone offers 500 for a 10k item ;)<br />
<br />
There are plenty of ways to get coin. Laziness is no excuse. Farm leather padding, make celestial essences, kill hhk guards, make kiolas, farm silk swatches. I cant stand beggers and bums. You want a tae ew shield, but dont have coin? Hey, cool, I want 300 silk swatches and 400 heady kiolas to get my tailoring up on an alt for her shawl. Dont wanna farm? Too bad! <br />
<br />
Go to a new yakesha zone and get some drops there. Nice crap coming form dungeons? OMG! Norrath is filled with folks who pl'd themselves in outdoor zones huddled like sheep at the zone line, people who were too weak or cowardly to go into a dungeon and take an item from a mob's dead hands (or claws, or what not), and wonder why their gear sucks at 60.<br />
<br />
I respect people willing to haggle, and wheel and deal, and love discovering ways to get coin. I was the first person I know of to figure  to feign pull Lynuga to Stargek to get mass ivyndyr hoops for about 300pp each; its how my old guild way back when became quite wealthy. Tinkered bows? Shark Meat? Done them too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Flabbo you should talk to my bro Kioras on Torv sometimes, you have the same business ideas. <br />
<br />
We spent a lot of time in our 50's farming plat items so he could GM smithing. Non guildies begging for combines for nothing or near nothing have no idea how much work smithing is. He did do free combines for guildies until he found out that a few were just selling the items that he made for them for plat when it was clearly spelled out that the items were for personal use only. <br />
<br />
Smithing is a pain in the ass, if you don't want to pay for it fine, but don't say you're being ripped off because you're getting charged just for someone to hit combine. Probably the same kind of person that thinks ports and kei should be free because all the person has to do it cast a spell. <br />
<br />
Think doctors should be free just because they don't have to use any items to examine you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Okotona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Funny that you mention the 300pp... because I paid that and a 10 dose SoW potion for my tunic (I had absolutely all components in a handmade backpack for him).<br />
<br />
As well, I told him that I wanted this as an upgrade to my studded Acrylia Tunic (*shudder*), and that I wasn't trying to get a cheap combine and sell it.  He was a nice guy, Athcaldonor, on Xev, met him on Xevserver.com and in PoD, I called him a psycho a few times for quadding yard trash (but in a good way  :D ).<br />
<br />
I understand the whole 'you don't know how long it took to get this skill' thing, I'm a psudo Tradeskill freak myself, all skills but JC above 130, with Alchemy being the highest at 180 (90-180 skill took only 6.5k, and great sense of accomplishment :D), pottery at 171, smithing at 168, Brewing 162, Fletching 141, and Tailoring 131.<br />
<br />
Moreso, I stay in contact with him and since we both solo alot we chat about random crap while medding.<br />
<br />
I too hate beggers... the kind of people that ask you to lower your price of Prismatic Dye to 20pp (costs 28pp to make and 3 combines =p), and I wouldn't of had a problem if he told me no, I guess I was just lucky, I think I'll go to CT and get him a few bloods and an extra so he can make me a shield (I variate from SBS and CCS =p).</div></div><hr />

<br />
And that is their choice in the free market system.  However, offering 500pp for a 10k item straight up and offering the materials plus extra and some money to combine are not the same animal.<br />
<br />
There are plenty of ways to get coin. Laziness is no excuse.<br />
<br />
Thanks, now I'm lazy for being poor.  Guess my fun in this game doesn't entail me farming greens over and over instead of grouping/guilding with my guild.  Damn me.<br />
<br />
Farm leather padding, make celestial essences, kill hhk guards, make kiolas, farm silk swatches.  I cant stand beggers and bums.<br />
<br />
Now I'm a bum.  I don't have the time to farm for all this crap, I do good enough for the items I need for tradeskills and guild stuff.<br />
<br />
You want a tae ew shield, but dont have coin? Hey, cool, I want 300 silk swatches and 400 heady kiolas to get my tailoring up on an alt for her shawl. Dont wanna farm? Too bad!<br />
<br />
Since the x number of plat and enough extra materials(or blood) to make 3 of what I want isn't good enough for you, I'll ask the next GM smith.  Luckily Xegony has GM smiths that aren't asses :)<br />
<br />
OMG! Norrath is filled with folks who pl'd themselves in outdoor zones huddled like sheep at the zone line, people who were too weak or cowardly to go into a dungeon and take an item from a mob's dead hands (or claws, or what not), and wonder why their gear sucks at 60.<br />
<br />
Most of the &quot;sheep&quot; I see have this condescending attitude too  :D <br />
<br />
Check my magelo, half the crap I have I looted myself alone or on raids.  Got my hate gear at ~46 and don't pay for RC mqs.  My gear doesn't suck, but I want to improve it.<br />
<br />
I respect people willing to haggle<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>ShakoBoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Being a tradeskill junky, I know that it can be a pain in the arse to get to a high lvl skill.  This especially concerns Tailoring and Smithing.  Each of these skills require huge amounts of time and money to raise.  I definitly think that the charge for a combine thats 250+ trivial should be a little costly, even if you have the ingredients ready to go.<br />
<br />
Also, on the point of not being able to afford lots of the better equipment and what not...there are a TON of ways to make money.  You definitly don't have to farm greenies to make the cash.  Infact, I recently found a spot in Dulak where I can single pull an endless amount of Dark Blues mobs that drop an assortment of gems (Blue Diamonds included), an occasional good item and the new spell research components.  Also, you can &quot;play&quot; the bazaar and buy low and sell high.  Just sit down for 10 mins and do a check of all the different gear thats for sale and every once in a while you will find a good deal ( This is how I've made most of my money :D ).</div></div><hr />

PS.  People who think they should make money off of tradeskill combines make me laugh... a short, pity filled laugh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I definitly think that the charge for a combine thats 250+ trivial should be a little costly, even if you have the ingredients ready to go.<br />
<br />
As do I, unless the sum of the ingredients is double or triple or more than a single attempt.  This gives the potential for the smith to do a couple free combines which he can sell for full amount.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">LOL Jaeden, settle down. I think you took my generalized comments way to personally.<br />
<br />
Also, theres a subtle difference in bringing someone 3 sets of materials and wanting one combined, with the smith keeping the rest, and 3 sets of materials and wanting the first SUCCESS with the smith keeping the leftovers. The second way is much less lucrative. If the smith fails 2 combines, but succeeds the third, the customer gets his shield, the smith gets squat. The other way, success of fail on the customers piece, the smith gets 2 sets of materials. <br />
<br />
Like I said, if someone brings me the extra materials I request, I'll do it free of charge. Someone wants to offer something useful, help on a friend's epic, or their old gear in a partial trade, odds are I will deal.  I was specifically referring to just bringing me the materials for ONE go and asking for a combine, or offering one combine and a paltry offering.  I will be getting something worthwhile for my efforts. I'm sure there are other smiths out there who do things cheaper, but its not worth my time, as usually I have to spend 30 minutes explaining to whoever wants the combine what I need. Half the time its while I am leading a raid.  No sooner do I arrive to hit combine, than I realize their ore isnt enchanter, the mana vials not made etc. Sorry dude, Oracle isnt a chanter title.  Even worse is when I have to brew the temper and they pitch a fit if I fail on a sub combine. Its much easier to just do cash and carry smithing.<br />
<br />
I resent being labled greedy because I wont effectively give someone an item.  Then again, people may catch me on a generous day. A lot of my deals and such depend on how much I have had to drink.  :D I have made well over a million plat on smithing, but my guild is pretty cash poor in general. The faster I am able to buy/make them gear, the faster we can get through the HoT stage we are on now.<br />
<br />
I didnt do smithing to make new friends, I did it to support the friends I had. I found out I got a lot more &quot;friends&quot; after I gm'd smithing. DAMN, I didnt know I was such close pals with every ogre and troll on Drinal.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Hehe, friendly jabs with the Spear of Fate do not the Universe tear :D<br />
<br />
And your right the distinction is there and the only time the smith getting leftovers is fair is if they aren't max and might get a skillup :)  otherwise it's pissing away good materials :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">[QUOTE='Flabbo' Someone wants to offer something useful, help on a friend's epic, or their old gear in a partial trade, odds are I will deal.  QUOTE]<br />
<br />
Smithing definately makes some good opportunity's for some dealing. My bro just last night traded RZ cultrual combines to a HIE GM smith in exchange for some future armor combines if my hi elf pally friend ever comes back to the game. The donal's bp on my cleric was a trade for services. And like Flabbo said, putting all that work into smithing wasn't to make friends, but to help friends. We encountered the same thing with smithing. When Kioras first gm'd smithing he made a few items for our closest friends and all of a sudden most everyone that could wear human cultrual in the guild we were in at the time wanted to be his best buddy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Meschit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I usually charge 1K for combining, and the easier you make it for me, the less I charge. Plus, if you give me hard to find stuff that aids me in skillups, hey, it's on the house! I've already made enough plat from selling my wares. <br />
<br />
I look at it this way, the time I devoted to smithing made up for the time I would have spent camping and raiding, which I hate. I don't want to devote every weekend for the chance to get an ultravision bracer in Velious. I AM THE HEPHAESTUS OF TROLLS!</div></div><hr />
