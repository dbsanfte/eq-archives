<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, now that we've all had time to get used to the spell selection menus and load/save spellsets...<br />
<br />
Does anybody really use the spellbook any more?<br />
<br />
I just got some level 64 spells, and was faced with the task of figuring out where in the book to put them... then I realized that I hadn't gone fishing in the spellbook for a spell in weeks.  Buffs?  I always use the right-click menu for that.  Switching from solo to raid mode?  Saved spell set.  Died and need to rebuff?  Spell set.  Travelling?  Spell set.  DOTs?  Right-click menu.<br />
<br />
I guess if I ever had to cast something I had NEVER looked for on the menus I might look it up in the book.  But I'd be more likely to search the menus for it because then I'd know where it is for the next time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>nornez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">right clicking for spells is the only way i do it now. any new spells to scribe just get scribed in the first available spot in spellbook &amp; no more spellbook maintenance is worth the drop-down spell selection alone. but i also find memming new spells takes just half the time it used to now that i'm used to where in the drop down menu all my spells are.<br />
<br />
i know some die hards that won't evre stop using the spellbook for memming spells... oh well, whatever works for ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">WIth all the new spellbook tools it makes it much easier. I put my most common switching spells in the first page, then try to keep everything semi orginized from there. I find it easier to just grab a quick spell from the book, then to scroll in the little menu bar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Foggy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Very rare I use the spellbook now (cant think of the last time I did).<br />
<br />
I have 6 spell sets set up and on the odd time that doesnt cover it I tend to go through the menu system as it is pretty quick now I have learnt the layout.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Here's something handy I found if you're like me and never load Gate until it's too late...<br />
<br />
1) Un-mem all spell gems.<br />
2) Load Gate in the slot you normally swap it into.<br />
3) Save that list as &quot;GATE!&quot; or something.<br />
<br />
Now if things go south, I used the GATE! spell set to quick load my escape.  It ignores all the gem slots you left empty -- i.e. only unmems the one spell in the slot for gate. And no page flipping.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Unei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Spellbook all the way, it is still the fastest way to go.<br />
<br />
No fishing through mulitple menus.  Now if you could assign your ten most common spells to the first level of the menu it might be another story.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Same; I still use my spellbook quite regularly. As a fast typist, it's easier for me to /book 5 and get the spell I need with 1 click rather then fishing through multiple menus/sub-menus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I use both. I have about 8 saved spell sets, and those times when I need to fish for something unusual I'll go to the book if I dont know exactly where it is in the menus or use the menu if I know where it will be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>sharookan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Spellbook all the way, it is still the fastest way to go.<br />
<br />

<br />
same here. i hate the new stuff as it interrupts my scribing all the time.<br />
i wish i could turn it off somehow. Spellbook is fastest way, unless u have all ur lv 1 spells still at page 1 ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zyphun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have my spell book really well laid out for my playing style, so I tend to use it more right click menu. My problem with the right click menu is I think it's poorly laid out. I find myself hunting for stuff there then I do when I am looking through my spell book. The spell sets are a completely different story, I use them constantly. I have one for group buffing, raid buffing and one for regular debuffing/dots. I have other spells sets too, but I rarely use them two or three seem to be a happy medium with a little swapping out from the spell book now and again. Actually now that I think about it, I do use the menu system for buffing people below 46, it's easier then flipping to the back of my spell book. hehehe Guess I am to old and stuck in my ways. ^_^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I only have 3 spell sets; buffs, solo, and group.  Everything else I still go to the book for.  I know where 90% of the spells in my book are by page number, so its easier to /book xx than delete spell gem, right click empty gem, wade through 10 different sub menus till I find the one I want and then click on the spell that I dont want that is right above or beneath and then repeat the process again.  I ALWAYS seem to mem the incorrect spell first because when I get to that point its already taken me about 20 to 30 seconds longer to get the spell I needed and im in a terrible rush.<br />
<br />
I do have friends however that only use the right click now.  Ive seen thier spell books though, and I cant say that Im suprised.  Apparently Im a little anal about the way I keep my book organized.   I had a friend borrow Thor once for buffing and he was laughing like crazy because I keep all the spells in the back that I dont use anymore organized by type and level.  (all stat spells grouped together by type, running from lowest to highest top to bottom, all roots together, all dots by type and level, etc)<br />
<br />
It just makes sense for me to have it that way, and since Im the one that has to live with it I dont care what they say.<br />
<br />
edit: speling n gramur be yur frendz</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Wow, I didn't know about leaving the spell slots empty to avoid memming/unmemming.  I THOUGHT about trying that but never got around to it.  VERY cool feature, and Gate mems so fast that with any lead at all you'd be able to get it memmed in time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Togh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I use both still, but spell sets are very useful. I especially like spell sets for when I'm root rotting. I have 2 sets. 1 for Root Rot Debuff with slow, malos, malicious decay, and gate. The other root rot DOTs with Bane of Nife, BoU, Pox, and Plague.<br />
<br />
Also, another nice set is a pre-50 buff set. It has all my pre-50 buff spells. I just load em all up a once whenever a lowbie wants some buffs, and then switch back.<br />
<br />
The other useful spellset is my Mass-buffing one. It has all my buffs, Group Acumen, Billy, Group Diaku, Group Wrulan, Fo7, and Group Boar. I join a group, load mass buff, cast all of em, load my standard set, and bang...good to go.<br />
<br />
MY WISH: My main wish now is for a command like /loadspellset 1 to load a particular spellset. The one thing I hate about spellsets now is it requires mouse access. If you want to switch spell sets quickly, I right-click just off the button and is gives the menu for the window rather than the spells set.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Too used to using the book, so I still do.  I use the right click menus for swapping my 1 or 2 free slots between dd's / dots as necessary when exping, but that's about it.  All buffs are on page 1/2, so easier to go there to mem them, and most of my other spells that I use are permanently in place (Q, tnargs, turgurs, canni)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I use a combination of the saved sets, the right click and the good old spell book. I do have several spell sets saved for common sets. I've also used the right click menu's to dig up some spells especially older spells that are filed in the back of the book. I've found the right click menu's kinda combersome to find some things, like VoB for example. It's several levels down under stat buffs -&gt; str buffs. It's much easier to just open up the first page of my spell book and mem it from there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Lohknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I use the right click spell menu occasionally, but I still go to the book when I need to find a single spell.<br />
<br />
But in terms of spell sets I have a bunch here they are:<br />
<br />
- Group Buffs - All the target group buff spells<br />
- Best Buffs - All the best single target buffs, mostly for buffing yourself after a rez and for soloing<br />
- Exping - All the best spells for an exp group<br />
- Raiding - All the best overall raiding spells when you need to debuff a mob at the start of an encounter<br />
- Raiding Damage - All the best spells for raiding after slow has landed, things like nukes and DoTs<br />
- Soloing - All the best overall solo spells<br />
- Soloing Damage - All the other DoTs for those times you want to stack like 7 DoTs at once<br />
<br />
Each of my non buff based spell sets have Quiescence, Tnarg's, Root, Canni 4 and Slow.  Those five spells I never de-mem while fighting.  These spell sets only swap the last 3 spell slots.<br />
<br />
If there is any class that really needed the spell sets, it's shamans.  No other class needs to swap spells as much as we do.</div></div><hr />

My shaman life would be complete if I could only hotbutton spell set selections.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I never use the menu. I find it cumbersome, slow, and too easy to grab the wrong spell.<br />
<br />
I suppose if I ever felt like deleting all the old spells that I don't use anymore so the menus would be of a more manageable size, I might use them...but I have no such intention, and will continue to exclusively use the spellbook.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>icebain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Its great you can select the spell while running stop and click, up and down and your done and on your way. its even quicker that shouting TRAIN TO THE GY !!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I only use my spell book,<br />
so much faster to type /boo x.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I still only use my book, other methods seem too slow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>nornez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">all I can say to anyone that says going thru (like 10 menus come on??? heh) the menuing system is too cumbersome is that it took me a day in XP grps of just saying thats it &quot;I'm just using the menu system &amp; not the spellbook to get used to where all the spells are&quot;. Made all the difference in the world. <br />
<br />
Beforehand going thru the menuing system was hit &amp; miss looking for spells but if you take the time (not long at all) to memorize where all the spells are I can guarantee... that is guarantee that memming spells using the menuing sytem will be way faster than opening the book &amp; dragging spells to the spell gem window to mem.<br />
<br />
But like I said in an earlier post there are gonna be the die hards that swear by the book... oh well to each his own, I personally take advantage of features that really do help my gameplay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Foggy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">MY WISH: My main wish now is for a command like /loadspellset 1 to load a particular spellset.

<br />
<br />
Amen to that - have been feedbacking that for a while now :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">For me its now only spell selection with drop down (err right  :) ) menues.<br />
<br />
I am slow typing and now i can finally mem this buff, warrior_01 is bitching about,<br />
during mid-fight and the mob won't come after me. Automatic rememming is so fast<br />
for most spells, that a mob maybe turn around and look at you puzzled - but very rarely<br />
he will reach and hit you, before you stood up again (assuming you are not memming<br />
at his feet ...).<br />
<br />
Just need a new mouse and a better mousepad someday, as i occasionaly tend<br />
to mistarget a menu line (but they get highlighted when cursor is over them, so no<br />
biggie).<br />
<br />
P.S. what Arriana said about big menues, personally i would love to have a hide<br />
function for old spells rather than a delete (hey, i earned that 'lesser healing' in <br />
my youth, i do NOT delete it  :D )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>eleon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Fast question. I have been meaning to learn the new automem of spells feature, and was wondering how you activate it. I looked around my spellbook and did not see anything to click on to activate it. where is this fearures (wonders if he has to unload the custom UI to see it).<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">To save and load a set of spells, you need to right click on the little book icon that (by default) is below the column of spell gems. Some custom UIs removed the book, so yours might not have it.<br />
<br />
I don't know if it works from a hotkey derived from the book icon or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>eleon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Thanks Kianor :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">For 3 years I have had the spellbook hotkeyed in slot 6 on my main hotkey bank.  I removed it last night.<br />
<br />
My book is well organized, and I know the pages by heart.  I have been typing /book # to get to the spells I wanted and then hitting the hotkey when I am done memorizing.  No longer.<br />
<br />
The spell selection list feature lets me pull up individual spells as needed, and the saved spell sets cover 90%+ of my usage.  I have several spell sets saved: buffing one person, group buffs, my default set, my solo set, disease slows, etc.<br />
<br />
I may never use the spellbook again except for scribing spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I just came back after an 8 month hiatus.  I've always kept my spellbook really organized, but after about an hour or two playing with the right-click menu, I like it a lot.  Most of the stuff is pretty intuitive to find, and less sit time = less sit aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>sharookan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">But you DID notice that there are horses for exactly THAT purpose ? ;) The rightclick thing is missing 1 option...deactivating it. when i mem spells old school my spellbook keeps closing for no reason. hate it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">But I also noticed that horses can't be summoned indoors. :)</div></div><hr />
