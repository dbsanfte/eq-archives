 we won't be ignored.<br />
we'll see.  <br />
Just for the record my problem with Beastlords being Near as good and better than shaman in some respect is pretty much the same problem i have with Paladins and Sks.  they are better than the sum of their parts.  Shadow knights will  survive more melee than a warrior or a necro (lifetaps , Ht etc), Paladins will survive more melee than a warrior or a Cleric. Beastlords will survive more Melee than a Shaman or a Monk(Reverse the Nerf!!),  they have tremendous Mana regen. and Uber Melee skills and a Pet i would Kill for.<br />
what have shaman received spellwise  in the last 3 expansions? a slight upgrade to Focus and Malos. a group remove poison/disease, and a heal over time that doesn't snare. Ferocity is even better than Ferine Avatar. and that's like our signature buff.</div></div><hr />

I assure you that we do not feel that AM3 is overpowering. We know that the Ranger community wishes to see more dual wield abilities and the team is evaluating those options. <br />
<br />
In addition the list of AA's out there is in no way complete. Rangers will be receiving new AA's with this expansion and we will not be &quot;nerfing&quot; AM3.<br />

Shows how very little some classes know about another, and have absolutely no credibility in arguements about balance.  Mages get mala and malosinia, so I could just be pointing out semantics...but could be more than that.  Or it could be less, as in clues.</div></div><hr />

<br />

I think they were talking about BLs, the thread seemed to get derailed a bit &amp; an argument about BLs (who are hybrids, obviously) ensued.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">After reading that thread, I see that shaman will get more useless stat buffs and long casting, inefficient nukes and probably some more heals that (without accounting for crits) heal 1/4th or less of a tank's hp.  Makes me glad that I started a beastlord up.<br />
<br />
Also, I really enjoyed all the posts from people (with signatures proclaiming they have a &lt;60 shaman) saying that shaman are completely balanced at all levels, and I think at least one person said we need nerfs.  Not to mention, one poster said shaman need nothing because we got stoicism in a recent expansion.  I sure am glad a level 44 spell fixed us up nicely.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I feel our power relative to almost every other class has fallen dramatically in the last year, and, with the new melee fix, it seems our power relative to every class has fallen considerably.  I'm not sure what exactly would make a shaman more in balance, but i do know that a dog with floppy ears certainly won't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ciele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">No matter what, there is just over a month till GoD is released.  Do you really think that SoE's eqlive team is up to the task of rebalancing 16 classes, making a new class, itemizing and balancing all the new zones, coding for new features (which in all fairness is mostly done if they are beta'ing), testing new zones, reading feedback, and dealing with the inevitable bugs?  <br />
<br />
If you think that this underpaid, understaffed and overworked eqlive team can do all that in just over a month to release, I've got a bridge to sell you.<br />
<br />
My sense of how this is all going to fall out is that the development team is going to look at shaman say, oh they are already balanced, they don't need anymore work, and we'll fall through the crack AGAIN, like how it was with LoY and PoP.<br />
<br />
The first pass of beta isn't even close from what I am reading, unless we howl and scream and send off emails and suggestions we WILL fall through again.  In a sense every upgrade a class gets now is through intense lobbying and whining, look at the rogue AA list for example.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sordia Winetrsbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">No, they really think that shaman are hybrids.  The arguement came up with why Clerics heal better.  Because they are pure casters and shaman are hybrids.  I sat and shook my head through the entire conversation and wonder what the hell class I play, since it is obviously not the class that they were talking about.  I love my shaman.  I really do, but hell, even with loving the class, there really is much that has changed since I started playing which is right about Kunark.

I really love it how A_Turtle_Pet_01 thinks, shamans are overpowered, because he still loves to play his toon. So as long as we find 1 member of any class, that is too short-sighted to see actual issues, the class is fine?  :rolleyes: <br />

<br />
Oh wait, that is me =)<br />
<br />
Here is my druman http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=592982  Yes, my gear is not top of the line, but I am not trying to be a shamuid as I call them. <br />
<br />
Now, perhaps my comments are not in agreement with those who like to bash their own class needlessly, for that I apologize. I can tell that several of the folks posting here haven't even read the post.. talking about Shaman's being hybrids or anyone there thinking that... I really hope nobody has said that.<br />
<br />
First you must consider the level of ignorance I am dealing with... one, a long time board rival by the name of Gurck, who lies and whines and brags quite often about stuff that he has no business bragging about. I have conceded that Shamans have end-game issues and are less preferred in LDoN than others, namely 65 Beastlords, for the slowing slot.  This of course has nothing to do with him, he is rather hypocritical, because the rest of the game is... well, perfectly balanced for the Shaman class.  On top of that, because of our dominance in other situations, I find that we, ourselves, are balanced beyond looking at other classes.  Can I convince power-hungry players of the class that no, there doesn't need to be a Shaman in every group because we should be the most desired class around? Heck no, but I do make sense when I say 1-64, we are the number 1 support class in the game, and if we pay a price at 65... so be it, we can't have the best ALL the time.  <br />
<br />
Am I clueless about the class? Hardly, most people I group with think I am a pretty darn good Shaman, some even say I am the best they know..  Do I take that with a grain of salt? Yes... I'll even say to them, maybe they just haven't grouped with any decent shamans in 1-65.. I doubt I am extroardinary, though better than average would fit.  Maybe being 62 is a hinderance to my credibility, so I guess when I ding 65, I'll just be adding credibility that anyone can do it (As I believe as well).<br />
<br />
Frankly, I am one of those people who has a real problem with the over-simplification of the game.  I like challenges, and I really do not want my favorite class to become &quot;too easy&quot;.  I understand how useless our buffs our for EP+ folks, and how, due to our relatively low burst/sustainable dps, we can't really compete as well in LDoN (Though, I have more fun tanking/healing in LDoN than I do slowing.)<br />
<br />
If you live in the &quot;grass is always greener&quot; world, you will often find problems about &quot;life isn't fair&quot; because instead of just worrying about yourself, or in this case, your class... you wan't to compare it to everyone elses.  Now, is it fair that some guy living down the street drives a Ferrari and I drive a Civic?  Yes!  I get what I need out of MY car, and hopefully he gets what he needs... but if you want to compare them to each other... no... I am &quot;out of balance&quot;.  <br />
<br />
I also have a big problem with ANYONE who tries to defame ANY class they play in order to get some TLC.  I can understand making constructive statements about areas we would like to see improvement, but when Shamans go bashing Shamans, or Mages go bashing Mages, or Warriors go bashing Warriors... I would personally rather tell them to all go to hell when they use this tactic.  You want to know why Monks or Warriors had a hard time getting groups?  Part of it was because of how much they yelled &quot;I suck&quot; and I don't think, even if someone is convinced that they are in need of change, that adding to the dislike of a class without any legitimacy is wrong and unfair to the rest of the players of the class.<br />
<br />
Think of me what you will, but my responses to one particular, and notorious troll are different than the rational responses I will make towards anyone who takes a solid and knowledgeable case about the class.  I do not listen to people who complain that they can't slow with War tanks without taking aggro for 10-15 seconds.  Sure, we can't all be perfect, but slowing is what we're the kings of, and to see a non-raiding, non-ldoning, and poor aggro-managing Shaman try and say we need boosts when we most obviously do not within all previous expansions and out of the end game, I'll tend to get a bit inflammatory and in fact, quite negative.  I understand this post will likely, also cause alot of derogatory remarks towards myself, but I felt I had a right to defend myself for those who would bother to listen.<br />
<br />
By the way, I do not claim to know EVERYTHING about the game nor the class, just more than that one particular fellow and those who make innacurate claims about the class I do play well.<br />
<br />
Thanks-<br />

Would you call it &quot;fair&quot; if scientists took the best elements of the human race and created a new hybrid organism that is smarter, faster, stronger, lives longer and can resist more punishment once they reach adulthood, and then had this new organism that has most of your best qualities and more to compete against you in the job market?<br />
<br />
Oh wait, you do your job well, and are satisfied...so your employer could never compare you to something that would do it so much better.<br />

<br />
They aren't better than us at everything... <br />
<br />
By the way, Mark34 is the one talking about them being able to buff more hps than we can with FoS..  Well, the reason we can't buff even more hps is probably a little thing called buff slots, and while this is only applicable to folks who have a STA deficiency, we have IOS/KRAGG/Boar or Brute and they all stack, and we get them earlier than the Beasties do... we just don't want to take up that many buff slots.</div></div><hr />

From the other thread<br />
<br />
Mabe I am getting the wrong message here.<br />
<br />
A necro has better DOT's than a shaman... they should, they are a pure caster.<br />
A Cleric can heal better than a shaman... as they should, they are the main healer, a shaman is more of a 'medicine man'. Just be lucky you don't have the BL heals, yeah my heal at level 52 rocks.<br />
A Shaman heal vs Paladins might be an argument, as they are both 'hybirds' in a way.<br />
The thing about being a Hybird,  is that there is always going to be a class that can do something better than you can.<br />
<br />
<br />
And yet, not a single correction of this whole 'well shaman are hybrids' arguement.</div></div><hr />

Shaman is clearly superior throughout 1-64... not in all departments, but how many groups take a beastlord over a shaman during those levels?  Few... beastlords during that time get the dps slots, and we get the support class slot.<br />
<br />
I once heard this described as an almost practical tradeoff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Say, you got slaughtered by the used card dealer and the guy got the ferarri at auction?  So, he was the smart one.<br />
<br />
If you really feel this way about Beastlords, maybe they were the smart ones for picking Beastlord instead of Shammy.  Sure, alot of us have been around before Beastlord's existed, but so was that Civic =)<br />
<br />
And, actually, I have played a beastlord till 40... I got bored... My shaman is so much more fun.</div></div><hr />

<br />

And you forgot to remember one point as well....it takes about a month to hit 65.  From then on, all you get is AA's.  Nice try, but it doesn't float.<br />
<br />
<br />
You're exaggerating quite a bit, don't ya think?<br />
<br />
<br />
Get to 65 and 100+ AA's on your shaman. Then make, or play a lot with a 65 beastlord. Raid a lot or do ldon a lot. Then come back when you have more info. Until then.....<br />
<br />
The only thing we have over a beastlord is Q/Tnargs when it comes to group desireablity. The only thing we have over a beastlord for raids is Q/Tnargs, Malos, Malosinia. They in turn have a 9hp/9mana per tick buff and Paragon of Spirit, a slow that does nearly the exact amount in PoP encounters, a pet that does more dps by itself in most cases than we do with our pet, dots and nukes in the long run, not counting the melee damage from the beastlord. Are you sure you really aren't a beastlord who wants to remain the &quot;King of the Hill&quot;, and any improvements on the shaman class would threaten that domminance?<br />
<br />
Oh wait...<br />
If you really feel this way about Beastlords, maybe they were the smart ones for picking Beastlord instead of Shammy.<br />
Yeah, you are....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>VXThis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Heh, no, I am not a beastlord.  I find the beastlord class, atleast until 40, to be rather boring, but I may play it up to see what it is all about.<br />
<br />
Also, the only place I have yet to see a beastlord supplant a Shaman is within LDoN.  LDoN has quite changed the dynamics of the game though, clerics are also useless here and it is only a matter of time until people figure that out.  My shaman heals just fine and does more dps than a cleric in LDoN, even in the 65 missions (Though I doubt this would be the case in the hard missions).  Also, just with the gear I have, I am quite capable of tanking in LDoN, as I have on several occasions, including a rush group where I usually TM'd 1 or 2, sometimes 3, mobs while the group killed the others.  We were quite successful.  Yes, we did pick up a Beastlord and he was able to TM somewhat better than myself, but I didn't feel that intruded on me in the slightest.<br />
<br />
Am I all knowing? No, I haven't claimed to be, and while I attacked one particular poster, who does not play end game nor owns the LDoN expansion, because I felt he was jumping on a non-applicable to himself bandwagon, I do understand the dissapointment felt because within LDoN, we are not the most desired class on the boat.<br />
<br />
Would I like to see changes to the Shaman class? Personally, I don't think we need it, I am quite capable of doing my job fine at this point, and while in one particular situation we have lost desireability, I do feel that Shamans probably became too desired with the PoP expansion and this is the biggest problem... or basically, that supply is far ahead of the demand.  The truth of the matter though is that we have lost almost no desireability within the PoP expansion, this debate barely existed before LDoN was released, and I think the majority of complaints are directly related to LDoN and how easy it is.<br />
<br />
By the way, as far as end game goes, this is more fuel to the fire honestly... this has been a problem for quite some time from the EP+ Shamans, as their buffs are nearly useless... and even below, there has never been much of a reason for more than a couple Shammys on raids.  I simply don't recall it being a big issue until LDoN either though, probably because we didn't have anything else to add to it.</div></div><hr />

I think the word you were looking for was complacent. <br />
<br />

Maybe so, but a lot of people (including yourself) are still in the dark of how strong a beastlord really is.  They can fill the role of slower and if they have to, buffer as well, and they add so much more on top of that, in just about any circumstance.<br />
<br />
I think the majority of complaints are directly related to LDoN and how easy it is.<br />
No, most of the complaints are directed at the fact that a shamans key function was to slow. That is what we were best at, then they go and add mitigation, which reduces our power by a %.  A beastlords slow, which is naturally 10% less, gets stronger in comparison to ours, when you slap mitigation into the equation.  They have our key function and they add a lot more in terms of raw power to raids, exp groups and ldon.<br />
If shamans were given a true upgrade to turgurs (a level 51 Kunark spell), or even a nuke (disease would be grand) that didn't suck, so that we could contribute more to raids and stack better with one another, we would still be just as &quot;balanced&quot; then as you say we are now.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Gaky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">i don't usually post but all the grousing has me wanting to say a few things.<br />
<br />
i've been lurking on these boards for a few years now and hardly ever feel the need to post.  i've been playing since release and my 65 shaman has been my main most of that time.<br />
<br />
as a class, i think we are the best out there.  we are fun to play, very useful in groups, can solo... we haven't seen our spots in groups taken away from us as was the fear a while back.  i feel so very powerful every time i log in. <br />
<br />
i picked a shaman for 2 reasons. 1) my friends wanted sow 2) it was the jack of all trades.  we could (and still can) do it all.  i knew when i clicked shaman that i would be master of nothing.  that is part of what called me to it.  didn't most of you know when you picked that you wouldn't be the best direct damage, the best heal, the best tank/melee?   <br />
<br />
i can do it all in any group.  i can be main heal, and am even one of the rare shaman that enjoys that job.  in a typical pull i will slow, root adds, heal whomever needs it, melee and nuke.  <br />
<br />
i hear many people saying we are gimped and i refuse to believe it.  i can't believe it based on my experiences.  i'm not time geared, i have about 90 aa now and i only get maybe 4 a week in a few hours of play a night and i can do everything a shaman is expected to do and more.<br />
<br />
i would like to see some love sent out to the shaman by the devs during one of the expansions but if we never get it, it's not the end of our class.  we still aren't gimped and we will still have spots in groups.  <br />
<br />
maybe i'm bad for breaking with the ranks.  maybe i'm bad for thinking that we are really ok.  but i think more people need to realize what a gem we have here.  it's ok to ask for things, we all want something to spice it up, but we are a great class and i wish more people had fun playing.  you read these boards and it sounds like everyone hates their class.  even worse, it sounds like class envy and that just stinks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Honestly, the concept of game balance has been whacked for a while - like since they first upped levels.  They can't have each class so specifically seperate that we each have our own little niche, or the game is unplayable without a specific pattern.  Nor can they blur the line between classes, or one feels threatened by another.<br />
<br />
But it's still a bitch to see others getting goodies while we get nothing, for several expansions.<br />
<br />

But stop and think a moment - why is EQ so successful?  Is it because classes are wonderfully balanced, and there is joy in Mudville?<br />
<br />
Or is it because there has been a constant supply of new things in the game?  Levels, aa's, spells, new places to see, new mobs to kill, new loot to be had.  If you keep passing out the goodies, but skip the kid in the corner, he's going to get upset - doesn't matter if he's the smartest kid in class, or if he rides the little bus... he see's the others getting things, while he gets nothing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How many times do I get to watch guildies either buy or level a shammy-bot because as main shaman in a small guild I can't be everywhere, and yet as long as the **** doesn't hit the fan, a bot can buff and slow as well as I can?<br />

Clerics complained that all they got to do was stand up , cast CH, sit down... they got bash and a nifty little &quot;Proc-O-Matic&quot; hammer.<br />

When are we goning to bitch enough to get anything? <br />
Easy answer - as soon as we decide what realistically would improve our class without overpowering us.<br />
<br />
Granted yes we are fairly well rounded. We are also outdated. <br />
Give me something usable by ALL shaman, not just the people that are EP+ and not just the &lt;60 people either. <br />
<br />
Statbuffs, yes useless at high end and what we have is just fine for those not maxed. <br />
<br />
We are supposed to be debuff kings, give us another debuff... a slow that slows casting times for mobs, anything that is not just a rehash of what we already have. <br />
<br />
We are supposed to be backup healers , where is our group heal? Hell group Q and I'm a happy man. <br />

Not quite sure how to take this.  My response was to VXthis saying that a Beastlord &quot;might&quot; be stronger at level 65 than a shaman, but that a shaman is stronger levels 1-64.  Basically who cares?  <br />
<br />
If you are just pointing out all of the power leveled clueless players there are now, I agree, but I was just making a point that leveling takes almost no time or effort at all now, thanks to PoP trivializing it, and so his point was invalid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">You have a point Used Car, but are exaggerating a bit.<br />
<br />
Contrary to popular belief there are still people out there, that are in their 30s or 40s, take their time to level and maybe even enjoy their playstyle  ;) .<br />
<br />
So has the importance of high end play grow over time, as more and more players bump at the level limit? Sure. But still the 1-64 crowd is nothing to 'not care about'. They should still be considered balance wise, albeit less than in earlier days.<br />
<br />
Focussing purely on the high end part of the game has brought us the joys of PoP and massive trivializing of older content. Sure you could argue that EQ is growing old and the earlier levels doesn't 'matter' anymore, but i would prefer to have the game as a whole healthy and balanced (as far as possible for SoE  ;) ).</div></div><hr />

My conclusion is that because I am a Shaman, the only groups I am getting now are from folks who are just filling slots without trying to balance out the group.  Now we know that a well skilled and equiped group of just about any 6 players can win an adventure but when you get to a group and see that there are five healers and one melee you start to wonder about the ability of the group.<br />
<br />
Our slow has been given away and our buffs that aren't that important with end gear can be Bot-cast.  We need something to make solid LDoN groups want us.</div></div><hr />

i might be wrong but the lower players will eventually get to 65. and then they see what the higher poeple are saying. shaman between 1 to 50 are great, 50 to 60 still great 60 to 65 still great but not so handy to have in agroup, but alot classes now like this, but we are slipping back fast. we do need something now to keep poeple wanting us. i dont want more damage dots, just faster, i dont want a hugely u/g dd though sim to atleast cleric be good. and alittle faster than velium strike. and u/g rain spell be nice. i like to be master of buffs and debuffs. i want a shaman only buff with nice attack. and slows that noone can compete with , like cleric are way best at healing, so a slow that has quicker cast, less resist as cant really increase %.<br />
better healing wouldnt go amiss too much improve quin shouldnt be overpowering.<br />

Get it now?  And yes, I know Beastlords are strong, everyone should know that by now.  They are probably the most unbalanced class in the game next to bards.<br />

It isn't envy it's rage.<br />
<br />
<br />
sure BST do more dps, and can slow, but shaman is overall a stronger class<br />
<br />
better slows<br />
Not when mitigation becomes a factor<br />
better buffs<br />
A beast can give just as many stats and hit points as a shaman can, they just don't do it at the same speed with group buffs.<br />
<br />
1000x better healers<br />
Better healers yes, but not 1000x, and if you have a Paladin as your tank, you don't need a shaman.  A 10% slow difference means nothing if you kill faster.  The only thing a shaman has over a beastlord is Tnargs, Quiescence, and Tigirs.<br />
<br />
If I had to do it all over again, I would have made a beastlord.  But no way in hell am I putting as much time into another character again.  I have an alt beastlord, but I can't even play longer than an hour before becoming bored out of my mind with the lower levels.  The same goes for any alt I try to level beyond 45.</div></div><hr />

Almost every class believes that they are underpowered or lack something when compared to another class.  <br />

There is a reason I wanted to make a shaman and that is becasue of what I saw they contributed to a group and a raid.  (And hes going to complement my Mage real well)<br />

Realistically, what is it that you have changed?  Why?  DPS?  I never considered a shaman to take a dps role, being a priest class.  What is the shamans best heal (in HP) and best HoT?    I know there are shamans that solo... I have a guildee that solos in Mischief often, and I want to tag along soon just to see how its done.  <br />

<br />
Inertia, if you look at the development of the shaman class as compared to the development of EQ, you'll see that our flagship abilities have recieved no upgrades in a substantial period of time.  Key abilities like slow have been nerfed by mitigation while the slow spells have been dolled out to several more classes making shaman less attractive.  Now classes like rangers, bards and BLs also have slow and in some cases, their slow can be more effective (not in percentage, but in cast time or as with bards it can be applied before the mob arrives in camp). Mana regen has been mildly nerfed by very poor mana to effectiveness ratios on our spells for instance our &quot;best&quot; single target DD has the worst damage to mana ratio of any priest or int caster class.  While EQ becomes more and more of a DPS fest, our DPS hasn't changed substantially since Kunark.  While we CAN stack some very sick damage on DoTs, who: 1) has the spell gem slots, 2) has a situation where a typical mob lasts more than 2 minutes, 3) has the HP to survive being summoned, pull aggro from the MA and take the beating that they recieved when they were caught sleeping with a sibling (while another class did the same damage you're doing in one spell and is the last to die when your group wipes ...).  The only thing we do that has been mitigated less than with other abilities is healing.  I have NO idea how anyone can argue against this when the facts are right there for all to see.</div></div><hr />

This is all true, but how many shamans actually cast malos in normal LDON groups?  I sure don't, unless it is on a named.  The beast slow cost less, casts faster and if you have a mage or bard with your group, resists won't be an issue, neither will the mana it took for the beast to slow with....remember, they don't need to nuke or dot to dish out a fair amount of damage, we do.  So mana is not the issue here.  And as far as buff slots go, I knew this would be brought up (it always comes up).  How many groups that have a shaman actually go out of their way to group with an enchanter for VoQ and VQ? None that I know of...you simply bring a buff bot, get your buffs and be on your way.  The same applies when it comes to wanting shaman buffs and not needing a shaman in the group.  <br />
<br />
We need something that sets us apart again...something that we can contribute outside of some minor hp boosts that no other classes bring to the table.  A group avatar (especially mgb version) would be fantastic, as would like many have already stated, some new debuffs and ability buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">My thoughts... if you arent 65 and 100+ aa's, your input isnt needed or desired on what we NEED in this expansion. Its aimed at elemental/time guilds. Not Johnny Karnors. Not MR Leet easy ldon healer! Not people who are perma lowbies. Have 8 level 30 characters? Super, get one to high level, then you can comment on how we function at the high level game. 1-64? Who cares. We heal fine in BoT? Newsflash. GoD ISNT AIMED AT BOT/POV PEOPLE. How well do you heal in LDON hard? Even with another slower? &quot;But we arent meant to be healers.&quot; BS. We are a healer class, and with slow mitigation in its rampant state, we wont heal for jack in the content this expansion will contain. <br />
<br />
Shamans are DEAD WEIGHT in high octane exp groups, and have been for a while. Since you still need a healer, why not take a slowing class that contributes in a meaningful way? (cough chanter/bl/bard). <br />
<br />
We need a significant dps, healing, and buffing boost. Yes, I said buffs. NOT stat buffs. Real ones. That do stuff. Strikethrough, Combat Effects, Avoidance, etc. Time gear modifiers in buff form. Noobs who need daiku need not apply. This expansion is designed to challenge those nearing the top of the game, not tanks with 170 buffed Sta. My guild is only recently elemental flagged. My roommate, arguably one of the poorest geared tanks in our guild, uses sta for a dummy buff. In a bit of gear, I will too. WTH do people like us, WHO THE EXPANSION IS AIMED AT need stat buffs for?<br />
<br />
Bane was actually nice. The recast time sucks, but at least it was a step in the right direction. <br />
<br />
But this is Beta? Bah. Having beta tested before I can GUARANTEE you that unless we bitch now, we will be bitching later. The difference is, later wont do any good. NOW is the time to complain, where SOE can change it without admittign it was wrong. SoE assumes players are all greedy whining pigs. If you ask for a reasonable amount, its automatically assumed its too much, and you get crap. Ask for the moon now, and we may get a fair shake. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Keyline Wintermystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">Question, where is it being said this expansion is geared for Time/EP guilds?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>Retron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">Over the weekend, I got my first taste of LDoN hard missions. Until then, I'd been in the normal ones and indeed I could (if pushed) act as main healer. I don't like doing it (as I'd rather be doing some form of DPS), but extended Q does a fine job of healing a plate tank.<br />
<br />
LDoN hard was a different proposition. The mobs there seemed to triple for up to 985, way, way beyond anything I've fought before. Good job we had a druid healing, I thought....<br />
<br />
Until he went AFK for a couple of minutes and the rest of the group pulled a single, that is. Inc, Malos, slowed (great), then the rot set in. I plunked a Q on the tank, who was from an elemental guild - he must have had 8000 HPs or so at least, as Q seemed to do 4% or so per tick. He then took a bad round, losing 25% or so health - not a problem, I thought, I'll use Tnarg's with my shiny IH4 sleeves.<br />
<br />
1500 or so pumped onto him, which brought him up into the 80s, before another round took him to near 70. Seeing that I was fighting a losing battle, I switched to Kragg's and amazingly he didn't take much damage - he was back near 90. However, another crummy round and he was in the low 70s again, and I'd blown a large chunk of mana. Thankfully the mob was dead, allowing me to use Q to heal - the druid came back after that and all was well.<br />
<br />
Until then, I thought we made decent healers. I'm unlikely to ever see the elemental Planes, but from what I've heard Hard LDoNs contain mobs similar to EP trash mobs - and there's no way I can see a shaman being remotely efficient there, although admittedly I don't have any healing AAs yet. <br />
<br />
To sum it up, it's a whole different ball game at the higher end, something I didn't realise was so bad. To remain as efficient against 900 hitters as we are against 370 hitters, we'd need a huge boost in healing abilities, and from the looks of the GoD beta spell list that just isn't going to happen. I suppose that will leave druids and clerics as viable healers still, but any chance of having a shaman main healer goes out the window.<br />
<br />
Hopefully I'm barking up the wrong tree, but boy - I felt utterly inadequate in there!  :p <br />

anybody else see why this is funny?  to spell it out for you, they don't nuke or cast half as much as you because they don't need to, not because we're uber...<br />
<br />
i don't think we're seriously broken, but there are a ton of things to be fixed.<br />
<br />
-shaman do not stack on raids, nor do they bring anything very unique to a group.<br />
-dots create way too much agro and are virtually useless in most grouping situations.<br />
-upgraded Q is nice, but in current version isn't super.<br />
-the aa cani as it stands sucks and is only nice because it's an aa.<br />
-it's obvious that our new slow is going to be worthless and won't be an upgrade to our lvl 51 spell.<br />
-with slow mitigation, our slow is not unique and so we lost our status as master of time and space.<br />
-we can heal adaquetely with the 1300 hp heal in normal ldon or pop tier 2-3, but anything more difficult and we fall apart.<br />
-our nukes are inefficient, slow casting, and laughable in the dps department.<br />
-and our pet swings like a blind geriatric.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Chutoi<br />
Here is Chutoi's post in case anyone doesnt feel like trolling the SOE forums:<br />
<br />
I actually am posting in spite of myselfand its gonna be a LONG post. These threads tend to be excruciatingly painful to read, mostly because the people posting have no clue what theyre talking about. (No doubt some will immediately point fingers at me.)<br />
My bonafides, such as they aremy main is a 65 shaman with 557 AAs. Im the raid leader of a time enabled guild, and yes, we have cleared time in under 6 hours. What does that mean? Besides the fact that Ive played a shaman for a good long while and that Ive had to memorize most of the abilities of other classes, not much. However, it does mean that I have had to play almost every class out there at some point. Those on which I have spent the most time are druids, enchanters, clerics, warriors, monks, rangers and wizards. Ive spent the least time playing beastlords. (For the class of trolls who cant refute something so resort to insultsyes, I have a life, a girlfriend who is entirely too good for me, a job, and I do exercise.  )<br />
<br />
First, Im going to take a moment to be elitistone of the earlier posters was exactly right. Shaman are comparatively very powerful at level 60 (compared to other classes). HOWEVER, from levels 61-65, especially with the inclusion of AA abilities, the other classes take a major jump in power. Shaman do not. Shaman are very static in power from 61-65. That leaves them noticeably behind the curve on balance. I am going to be talking about end game shaman (level 65). If havent played a level 65 shaman, and arent correcting something I say about a class other than a shaman, you dont have any business replying. My response to you is, talk to me when youve experienced it. Shaman have not had a significant upgrade since Kunark.<br />
<br />
Shaman are not hybrids. We are a priest class. Originally, near as I can tell, our role was to be sort of a battle priest. We trailed slightly in healing, but had higher melee caps. That was useful up until about level 50ish when mobs started to beat the tar out of us.<br />
<br />
Fast forward to todayclerics now out melee shaman at the end game. Out of curiosity, I dueled a cleric (weapons only). I was using a 1hs 23 del, 32 damage with a 450dd proc (-350 resist check on DR). The cleric was using his summoned hammer. Same hp, same haste on both characters, close to the same AC (I was higher!). The cleric won. Clerics get the slam ability too. Only large race shaman get slamand it caps at a skill of (1)or maybe (0). I forget. Other shaman have no ability or spells to stun a mob. I think I can safely say the vision for shaman no longer is that of a battle priest. What about the rabid bear AA, some may ask. If you spend the AA on it, and the max AA to hasten it, you get 5 minutes of better melee every hour and 20 something minutes.<br />
<br />
Lets look at nukes a sec. Shaman have 2 types of direct damage (dd) spells. One is a rain which pisses of chanters and gets resists you have to use to believe. After malos, I usually get at leave 1 of the 3 waves resisted. While Im mentioning it, why is it that it hits FOUR targets once, or 1 target 3 times? However, if we cast it on four targets and stand close, it hits four targets ONCE and will still hit me for all 3 waves? Love those game mechanics. Oh, yeah. Rain spells cant be used next to your without nuking yourself, and it the mob moves or is pushed out of the rain effect, it wont get hit.<br />
<br />
The other line is direct single target nukes (cold and poison lines). We have one fire nuke (our first nuke at level 1) and never got another one. Our best nuke is 925 damage (cold) but takes 7.8 seconds to cast! Do the math and youll see that RANGERS can out nuke usthey can just cast twice and do 1400 damage before our spell gem has even refreshed from the universal 2.2 second delay between cast times. Our poison line does less damage, though is marginally faster. Our dam/mana ratio is pretty awful too. This problem is exacerbated by the GoD spells currently on test. Somehow Shaman are the only class not getting a larger nuke. Clearly we arent nukers.<br />
<br />
Okay, so we arent nukers or melee. What about healing? One of the biggest fallacies floating around is that shaman dont need to heal because we have slow. Wrong. PoP mobs, or LDoN hard mobs hit hard. Rumor has it that GoD mobs hit harder. I dont care if its slowed or not, or if you have a time equipped tank or notmobs get lucky and can get good hits in on everyone. A single max double hit (1 round) in a hard ldon does more damage than our largest healand the cast time on that heal is 10 seconds (and isnt affected by spell haste). That doesnt, of course, address the fact that people take damage BEFORE its slow. Our heals are significantly worse than a druidfor the same mana.<br />
<br />
I could go into a long analysis of fast and slow heals, but the bottom line is . . . shaman are lacking. I dont know of any 65 shaman that use our 10 second (in)complete heal of 1950. Everyone uses tnargsbase 1300 heal because we can get AAs and focus items to make it . . . close to the BASE druid fast heal. Our heals barely touch a tank with 10,000+ hp. We have no group heals. Even a druid gets an AA ability to heal the group. Paladins are getting a new nearly 1k single target heal (1 second cast time!) in GoD. Not to mention that they OWN for group heals. Strangely, in GoD, clerics, druids, and paladins are getting new heals. Shaman get a new heal over time that does an extra 60 hit points of healing every six seconds. Hate to break it to ya Sony, but even slowed PoP mobs do more than 300 OR 360/tic. I shudder to think just how effective well be in GoD (the image of bailing a leaky boat with a spoon comes to mind). Okay, so were not very good healers (a hybrid WARRIOR class out-heals us!).<br />
<br />
How about pets? That seems to be the vision for us in GoD. Were getting lots of new pet abilities. The shaman community has done LOTS of tests on pets so far. Base dps on dog dog is 12.7 dps. If we carry around backpacks of rusty weapons and give it two weapons (since shaman have NO items to summon a weapon), it can suddenly dual wield. Fully buffed and weaponed, it can do around 38 dps. (all numbers dependant on AC/level of target, of coursethese targets are blue con mobs at 65). Just for reference, our level 56 poison DoT does similar dps.  The only class with a pet worse than ours is the single level 55 druid bear pet (which is so patently bad as to not really even qualify). Shaman pets are just bad. Okay, so were not even CLOSE to a pet class. Our pet qualifies as a low level DoT at best. (BTW, thanks Sony, for giving us a ton of new pet AAs in GoDIm sure it will get our pet up to maybe 45dps for only 150AA pts. /sarcasm off)<br />
<br />
How about DoTs? All of our DoTs are stackablewe can do major dps if we stack 8 DoTs on a mob! Now . . . uh . . . oh wait. Id have to unmem slow, cannibalize, heal(s), malos . . . erm, nm. Our top 3 DoTs can do decent dps. Blood, Breath, and Banemaybe up to 1000/tic. Of course, in a group, youre tanking if you cast all that. Not to mention it has to be a pretty piss-poor group if the mob lasts long enough for you to cast all those. Well, we can solobut solo exp was nerfed pretty hard. We have to root/rot too, since we cant melee mobs (even slow) in PoP effectivelysee discussion on our heal over time spell (quiescence) above. On a good note, were getting a new DoT in GoD. Currently, its yet another of our disease DoTswhoops. Did I forget to mention that our disease dots take 2.1 minutes to run? Unless youre soloing, when was the last time you were in a group that took 2.1 minutes to kill a single mob (besides a named or raid level mob). Our entire disease line of DoTs is useless in a competent group. Its a complete waste of manayoure better off nuking with that slow-as-heck nuke. But look at the bright sidewe get a NEW useless DoT. /cheer. In GoD we at least get crit DoTs, never mind that it costs a heck of a lot more (30AA last report) to get them. Who cares if it cost casters a lot less to get their crits. Screw the DoT classes.<br />
<br />
Well, now, lets come to the big thingslows! Shaman are the master of slows! Sort of. Beastlords cast it faster. Enchanters cast it almost as well. Shm-75%, ench-70%, bst65%. Current parses of mitigated slow (ie everything endgame) seem to indicate that the above percentages are reduced proportionately. Lets look at mobs slightly effected by slows. That means its about 25% effective. Multiplying it out yields: Shm-18.75%, ench-17.5%, bst16.25%. Not too impressive is it? Dont worry! Shm can heal! (Well just ignore the fact that shaman healing was last changed before mitigation was put in!) So what if mobs are doing almost their full unslowed damage! Shaman can slow so they dont need heals! Right? On a good note, we get a new slow in GoDit does 60% slow instead of 75%, costs more mana, has a TWELVE second refresh (cause we never get more than 1 mob in camp), lasts 42 seconds instead of 6.5 minutes, and will fizzle more because its level 65 instead of 51, but its NEW! Im in a rush to memorize it, let me tell ya!<br />
<br />
What about buffs? Our stat buffs are vital for those end game people who need the additional 2 strength to hit their cap (hintthere arent many who arent well over the caps). What about avatar? +140 attack and stats? Well, the BL (a true hybridthe total twit who called shaman a hybrid class needs to be shot to improve the gene pool) can give more attack with their buff. HP buffs? Shaman can only do 430hp unless the target has less than max stamina. BLs can do about as well.<br />
<br />
Mana regen? A lot has been made over this, but its getting deflated constantly. Enchanters and (in GoD) clerics get a free bar of mana every once in a while (depends on how many AAs they spend). The FT cap is pretty big. Horses. Paragon, SD, VoQ, Bot9, clicky buffsthinks aint as far spread out as they used to be. Shaman mana regen is good, but not god. Since DoTs are apparently meant to be out primary mode of damage (never mind agro issues), I also invite you to go look at the mana costs on thoseits obscene. They also get resisted a lot.<br />
<br />
Someone tell me again how overpowered I am because I can solo Lodizal or Yeldema. I hate to break it to you, but so can other classes. Hell, a warrior on our sever solod Yeldema before PoP came out!!!<br />
<br />
Does any of this start to make you wonder why some shaman are annoyed? In GoD we get a DoT no one wants, a slow no one will use, and a ton of pet AAs for a pet that sucks rocks. Were getting a new cannibalize spell that is LESS efficient than the one we have (its more damage per cast but gives a lower percent of mana backnets to about 1 more mana per tic). We cant keep up on healing in a group because one resisted slow and our tank gets pounded to heck and were reduced to chain healing with no time for another slow on hard mobs. We get no group heals, even like the 40+ minute AA for druids. <br />
<br />
So to all you pundits screaming, overpowered, I say youre morons. Hybrids out heal us, melee out nuke us, and weve got more pathetic skills and spells on the way while everyone else gets upgraded.<br />
<br />
Oh well. At least I can go solo Yeldema if there arent any warriors camping him.<br />
<br />
Chutoi<br />

<br />
<br />
An excellent post and very well thought out.....it reflects all our feelings and problems very constructively and succienctly, with just enough sarcasm to be entertaining :D<br />
Thanks for the post Chutoi, I know I at least enjoyed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>Gnofr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">Though I've enjoyed reading threads on this fine board for about a year (which is as long as I've been playing EQ), I haven't wanted to post.  All the hoopla over the upcoming existence of GoD convinced me that if ever there was a time to voice my opinions, now might be it.  I'd rather GoD didn't hate Shaman, but be created in our own image:<br />
<br />
Powerful,  Mystical,<br />
Sublime,  Solitary,  Social;<br />
<br />
Complimentary and contradictory;<br />
Beyond complete comprehension.<br />
<br />
I am encouraged by some recent Shaman threads that make concise, concrete suggestions about what GoD should and shouldn't be like.  I am glad to see similar suggestions on other class boards.  I am especially glad to see positive, constructive comments from experienced raiding players that will benefit all levels of their favorite classes.  I hope folks at SOE make many of the improvements to Shaman that have been suggested.  However, what concerns me more is the possibility that this expansion and EQ2 later on will &quot;encourage&quot; even more group involvement and actively discourage solo and duo enjoyment.<br />
<br />
As a background aside...  I do not hate people.  I have managed people professionally for many years.  I understand and appreciate what being social involves on many levels.  I have been elected to public office.  I have adult children and a good life outside of EQ.<br />
<br />
The main aspect of EQ that enables it to capture my continued interest is that it is massively multi-player.  That EQ is inherently a social game does not mean everyone who plays it enjoys to group.  Nor should it.  EQ's design is more robust than that.  The more I read that any expansion, or EQ2, will increasingly emphasize grouping, the less likely I am to buy it or subscribe.  If GoD is being targeted toward elemental/time guilds as arrogance suggests, then its market is quite probably too small to be profitable and certainly of no interest to me.  <br />
<br />
There are a myriad of ways to play and enjoy EQ.  Its facilities for grouping are central to most.  Its apparently underlaying founding principle that most individuals are more likely to continue paying their subscriptions if they are coerced into grouping and belonging to a guild may or may not be true.  It is certainly a counter-productive tactic to take with me.  I appreciate that many players do not feel coerced and enjoy grouping above all else and that's great!  Those of you who arrogantly retort something to the effect of &quot;then you're playing the wrong game&quot; simply don't understand this game or people as well as you might think.<br />
<br />
I value the time I spend with my wife above all else.  The only reason I play EQ is that it's an enjoyable way to spend time with her.  So, she has her eight characters on her PC, I have mine, and we have a full-time trader account.  We've played most every day for about a year.  We duo most of the time.  We solo sometimes.  We group sometimes.  We're fairly active trade skillers.  We're moderately active officers in our guild.  However, any game content that we can't duo we pretty much skip.  We don't care that much of the game will thus remain unavailable to us as long as there are lots of fun things we can do.  Anything that detracts from our ability to enjoy the game together simply pushes us closer to choosing some alternative activity.  The real world is full and glorious.<br />
<br />
We've recently started having fun in EQ with our son who started a Shaman using our trader account.  He's found the time spent on Norrath with us surprisingly enjoyable such that we're considering starting up a new 4th account for him.  Again, new content designed exclusively for raiding guilds won't positively influence that decision, or any of our game enjoyment, except perhaps by decreasing the likelihood of encountering a few ubers destined for the ignore list.  Please don't mistake me; our friends lists overflow with most of the long-time players we've met who are shining assets to the community.  A few aren't.<br />
<br />
At my age, I have little patience left for those folks who go on ad nauseam judging how others play or spewing dogma regarding how others should or should not play.  That we can interact and share Norrath with people who play for very different reasons and in very different ways from us is quite cool.  That we can choose to ignore them is vital.  That they can choose to ignore us is probably even more important.  If EQ really is simply a game designed to socially engineer a gang mentality into American youth and waste potentially productive human resources while making a profit, so be it.  I don't think it is.  I wish those folks who enjoy raids all the best and hope theirs is the highest roll for the most uber loot.  I also wish they weren't so frequently myopic and condescending and didn't influence future game development to the detriment of social soloers.  I expect I care less about the game they play than they apparently do about mine.  /em sighs.<br />
<br />
The question is, should Sony ignore subscribers like us?  If the majority of EQ players have raiding mains who have been lvl 65 for longer than we've been playing, as many seem to take for granted, then Sony probably should.   Unless maybe they want to sell EQ2.  From what I can tell, only Sony can actually do more than speculate (all too often loudly) about EQ's real subscriber demographics.  Even they can only make highly educated and variously hedged bets about what will make EQ2 most profitable.<br />
