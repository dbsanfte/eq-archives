<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KriFos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Too often I log on and see a guildmotd about a raid or something that is already outdated.<br />
<br />
Wouldnt it be nice to have a date and time-stamp after the guildmotd?<br />
<br />
Just an idea - i /feedback'ed this - if you like it - do it too, as im sure no developer will read this post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">*Shrug* My leader just puts dates on his MOTD. Why can't yours?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KriFos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Timestamp too? ... and sorry mr wiseass - but this wasnt an opportunity for you to brag about your guildleader's enourmous capabilities...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>dennman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">running out of things to complain?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KriFos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This wasnt a complaint - it was a suggestion - it would have been neat.</div></div><hr />

Timestamp too? ... and sorry mr wiseass - but this wasnt an opportunity for you to brag about your guildleader's enourmous capabilities... <br />
<br />
Hardly an enormous capability is it?  I mean with all the things the shaman community are trying to get SOE to look at.  Such as spell drops, focus items, heals, post 60 spells, etc.<br />
<br />
BUT NO, KriFos want's a timestamp on guild motos because his leader is too much of a bum to write it himself!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>KriFos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah, maybe you too could get a finger out your ass and stop COMPLAINING for everything... Stop playing a shaman if you dont like it. Simple as that.<br />
<br />
I was just coming with an ingame suggestion - no ranting at all - and there suddenly is 1 gazillion pist off kiddy shammies who yells &quot;WHY WE NEED THIS WHEN OUR SPELL_00 and SPELL_01 .... AND SPELL_112341241 IS SO MESSED UP???&quot;<br />
<br />
For the love of someone - please stop your complaining and realise its a game and that SOE actually not HATES any class - they actually try to make the game BALANCED you paranoid little child.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Wow Kri please tell me you dont work at a place were you have to put up ideas that could be criticized. Mrens wasnt actually harsh on ya and call him wiseass...anyway...... Yes a guild leader could put his time and date on there if he wanted too. Having it time stamped sounds like it would make things easier. Some people just feel that soe has ALOT of other things they need to fix more so than a convience like that. Doesnt mean your  idea is bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">How you going to timestamp it? EST, PST, GMT? <br />
Everquest game time? Oh wait, can't tell time on the moon.:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Racknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm gonna go with postal worker or prison rodeo rodeo clown.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It's a suggestion, an idea. Not necessarily the most practical because of all the time differences. But yeah, probably easier for a guild leader to post /MOTD: Dain Raid, followed by Tormax, at 1900 EST, 0000 GMT, 16 Feb 03.<br />
<br />
If eq has done anything it's force me to learn exactly what time it is in Australia, and England at any given time.<br />
<br />
The reason people jump on this guy is they realize that SOE has limited time and resources, and * IF * they're going to look at in game fixes they'd prefer it was Shaman related and not something 'minor' such as this.<br />
<br />
Figure they'll ignore both, fubar Bard songs, screw up the underlying code so for 30 minutes we have 15,000 health, then take the servers down for 2 hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>KriFos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">How to timestamp? Well, easy:<br />
<br />
1) It goes by a standard time at that server (for me AB - will be GMT)<br />
<br />
2) It will automatically convert into your local time. When using /time - EQ checks your computer clock right? - Shouldnt be impossible to synchronize it.<br />
<br />
3) Use .beats - the standard internet time... http://www.timeanddate.com/time/internettime.html<br />
<br />
Personally i find both nr 1 and 2 the best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Meecham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Not exactly earth-shattering, but I think its not a bad idea personally.  Wouldnt exactly be hard to implement would it?<br />
<br />
BTW Scurvey, please dont call my guild leader a bum.  Thanks...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Usually our motd's are boring like &quot;check our website or you'll regret it&quot;<br />
<br />
and <br />
<br />
&quot;grats on Bob for reaching level 65!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">This isn't a bad idea at all.  It definately isn't a whine or a flame or anything of that nature.  It's just a modest idea that would make the game a tad bit better.<br />
<br />
Some days, especially patch days, my guild goes on a 12 hour killing spree.  Whenever we OTM to one place, we put it in the guildmotd.  Sometimes the officer remembers to put a time, and sometimes they don't.  Sometimes we forget to update the guildmotd when we OTM, and people will log on and see a 4 hour old guildmotd, and say &quot;hey all, omw to zone_01&quot;, but by that time, we are actually in zone_03.<br />
<br />
Just put the time in either PST, GMT, or allow the timezone for all timestamps to be picked by the leader in the new guild UI that is coming out in LoY.<br />
<br />
edit - mrens, dennmen, and scurvery:  you are all asses.  That is all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">SOE has time to remove tiger pelts from oozes drop list, they could do something like this.  Lord knows they don't spend time thinking about what their changes mean to the players or even doing in-house testing.</div></div><hr />
