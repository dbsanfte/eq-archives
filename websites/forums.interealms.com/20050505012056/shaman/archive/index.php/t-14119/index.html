You used to be able to skill up melee skills by attacking a LB -&gt; Blue pet in the arena.  This will be the easiest way in a controlled environment.  <br />
<br />
Wyverns in CS are also pretty weak melee wise.  You could haste + regen yourself and try tanking some slowed Wyverns.  This will give you a small amount of XP too.  That's how I got my last few points of Defense up.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chulain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Best way to raise the skill is just to use it.  Find a blue mob that doesn't hit very hard, slow it, tank it, and beat on it.  Make sure you are buffed, hasted, even borrow a haste item if possible.<br />
<br />
I can't remember what mobs are best for this at 55, maybe someone else can offer advice on that.<br />
<br />
Also, try to get a weapon with the lowest delay possible.  Even if the damage is low.  Lower damage is actually better, so you can just keep hitting the same mob for awhile without killing him.<br />
<br />
Training points are pretty cheap now, since you get 5 each time you ding an AA.  It might be wise to dump a load of points into 1hb to get it started.  That's pretty much a personal preference.<br />
<br />
Don't forget to work on 2hb as well.  Use the same technique.<br />
<br />
Once the skill gets over 100 or so, you can just use a 1hb or 2hb weapon while soloing normally.  Pull with slow, dot, tank mob while autoattacking.  2hb weapons are pretty nice actually...my Hammer of Spiritcalling will swing once between each JBB blast.  Not quite as effective anymore at 65, but if I remember 55 correctly, that was my standard soloing tactic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ailith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My plan (when satisfied with 2HB) is to get SoulStripper (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=19349) , buff up as much as possible with dex, and try the Yetis (DL) if they're still DB. If not the yetis, will have to search for something else.<br />
BTW - don't forget to put a bunch of training points in to start!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I wouldn't worry about 1hb too much though.  Piercing will get you the epic, which is pretty damn good for the effort involved.  If you want to do more damage, 2hb is better, and by the time you can get a 1hb better than the epic, chances are you'll be on a mount and won't want to use it.<br />
<br />
I have 200 pierce/2hb and like 134 1hb, but I never melee while I'm riding Moo, which is most of the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Also use ds potions or get a druid / wizzy / or item to put one on you.  Everytime a mob hits you with a ds on you get a chance to get a skill up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Damage shields only give a chance to increase your offense, you can only gain weapon skills by actually swinging the weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I went from 10 to 195 in piercing in just over a month (lvl 49-52).  All I can say is &quot;just do it!&quot;  Be grouped so the tank has agro, and just keep beating away.  Get your strength/dex up as high as you can, and &quot;just do it!&quot;.  I was surprised at how fast it went up.  Oh yeah, get a fast weapon, so you get in more swings.</div></div><hr />

Agreed, this is the way I'm doing it. I've got my piercing and 2hb up pretty far(Not sure if its maxxed though) but my 1hb was only 74. I got my soulstripper and am just buffing up my dex(HoS/Rage=Good :) ) and pounding away on the mobs. A lot of times I find myself proccing so much at the end of a fight I'm near, or at 100% hp. It's pretty cool being able to confidently cast cannibalize 3 every few swings.  :p</div></div><hr />

I was asking 'cause tonight I am going to hunt the Soultripper and I want to use it. :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Guntar Ghostdancer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Find another shaman and duel him. Hit only his pet. I hear this works for raising skill.  Also, max out Dex.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Eilderts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It gets easier in the 20s. Below that, you will be killing a mob in much fewer hits. IE, at lvl 1 it may take 3 hits to kill something. Good chance skilling up on that. At level 20, however, once you have root parked an add, you can melee it for a while if you dont have a chanter. Don't just forget about your group, but if the cleric has no complaints healing, go for it.<br />
<br />
Get fast weapons. A fast piercer can be found of fiends in PC. I know yall say yuck, but 3/24 with + 1 poison (or maybe disease) damage. Thats 4/24, which is pretty good for skilling. I use a Noble's Walking Staff that a friend sold me for 25pp. 8/19 +2 wis/int/str. I doubt you will get that lucky though.<br />
<br />
Once you get decent money, a Tarnished Driveshaft is good and fast for 2hb skill ups.<br />
<br />
Even with my 1hb maxed at lvl 19, my froggy does very little damage wiht his 8/19 compared to any other meleer. The object isn't really to do insane damage in low lvls, its to build skill so you can at higher lvls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Iksar beserker club will get you skill ups the fastest.<br />
<br />
18 delay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">IMO find a decent monk, put him against a wall /duel and go afk, he will be full health when you come back in 4 hours and look at your new skill :) (unless we can't skill off of dueling?)..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Can't skill off other players at all, dueling, in the arena or PvP. They made it that way quite a while back. Ya' used to be able to skill off other players pets while dueling, defense and weapons. The pet does need to be blue or better though. I haven't done this in quite a while so I can't confirm that it's still an option. Used to be nice to be able to get together with another caster, summon a few pets and then trade languages and work skills with the pets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Hildaorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">As said just Haste, Dex buff and Melee, I got my Soulsipper and in 5 days of minamal play time, I skilled from 123 to 195. I am currently playing Wack-a-Troll in Nadox. I just buff me, and DogDog, pull with slow, cripple, soetimes I epic dot, then melee till either troll is dead, or I am at 30% hp, then step back, Heal and finish it off. By the time a heal is needed Dogdog will have aggro well in hand, just make sure you back out before you would get low health aggro. Currently with Celerity being my only haste, and slowing the trolls I generaly get in 5 to 6 swings between his (of course 3 to 4 of them miss).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Weapon skills are easy, it's defense that will give you fits in the long run.<br />
<br />
The secret is to keep yourself at as high a DEX as you can (use Rage line of self-buffs) and group a lot; grouping means there will be a MT to hold aggro, so you can just wail away on the mob and get the skillups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Orgak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I used the Abandoned Orc Shovel to raise my 2hb.  It's fast fast fast.  It's also weak weak weak.   :p <br />
<br />
The shovel is a groundspawn in Lake Rathe.  As you enter LR from the RM zone, it's the Orc camp that is on the right zone wall beside the water.  It's inside one of the tents there.  <br />
<br />
I maxed all my skills by buying/finding the lowest delay weapon possible and then beating the mobs in the back while grouping/duoing.  If you are on a mount, shrink yourself to stay out of the way and make it easier for you to see the mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gabus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Yep, thats what I did. I went on alla's and found the lowest delay weapon I could find, then found one in the bazzar. Low delay, haste, stat buff, you will skill up in no time.</div></div><hr />
