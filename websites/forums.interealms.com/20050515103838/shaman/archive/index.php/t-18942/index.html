<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Akinwande</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I find it soooo amusing to read most threads where people who are top-tier planes equiped, discussing LDoN adventures.  Most of the time, at least once (usually multiple times) in the thread, these players will mention things about how &quot;even Paladins can be main healers in a LDoN adventure&quot; or &quot;the mobs die so fast that tactics xyz, class abilities xyz, or other xyz are useless&quot;.<br />
<br />
From my understanding of SoE's main goal when implementing LDoN, was to create content for the players who were more &quot;casual&quot; gamers and didn't have hours upon hours to raid constantly.  Of course a group of fully time-geared players are going to find even LDoN &quot;Hard&quot; Adventures to be rather trivial.  The content has been geared toward the players in which the Loot from LDoN adventures is actually usefull and not just &quot;toys&quot;.<br />
<br />
I guess I don't really know what my point of posting this is, other than to hear myself talk, or maybe to work on getting rid of my &quot;lurker&quot; tag by posting enough spew  :p .<br />
<br />
Just an observance from a part-time EQ player who wonders if he'll ever even see ANY end-game content prior to EQ2 comming out  :confused: .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">As a Shaman, you can run through a normal naked. You could actually do a hard naked and it wouldn't make a difference with the right classes.<br />
<br />
That's EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Except that you'd die if you drew aggro.  Naked shaman have 1 round of combat if you aren't lucky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>maccuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yep and those of use 65 that actually play at that level find it just as amusing that a level 35 Shaman would honestly think they have anything relevent to post on LDoN groups using 65 spells ;)<br />
<br />
Despite my gear and aa level I play roughly 5 hours a night.<br />
Midnight to 5am EST and I am currently guildless.<br />
<br />
Lowest LDoN group I did was when my Enchanter was 51.<br />
I got a whopping 19-21 points for a win...<br />
Did not do many of these until he leveled more.<br />
Not much point exp was better elsewhere and the points per level ratio sorta sucked imho. They really should give the lower levels a slightly better point ratio.<br />
<br />
A 65 Paladin without Elemental gear could easily keep up with the heals in a LDoN easy as well as a Shaman without Elemental gear.<br />
Their heals are about equal to ours and they have a GROUP heal making it actually easier for them to do so.<br />
The only real difference there is we have better mana regen usually.<br />
<br />
Comparing spells is not comparing gear if you compare those same spells with chars of the same gear level you really have the same results.<br />
<br />
60+ tank with a 65 Paladin healer pulling singles in LDoN easy at 65?<br />
Doable in buyable gear = to Shaman buyable gear.<br />
<br />
Don't mean to be insulting or harsh but your the pot calling the kettle black.<br />
Cant say what a LDoN is like at 35 for a Shaman I am not there.<br />
You can't say much about 65 groups either as your not that level.<br />
I can only speak based on my experience.<br />
Not everybody plays at your level of play either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">LDoN normal adventures are a joke for any 65 who's not mentally handicapped.  I purposefully train the group to add spice sometimes.  I only group with guildmates though, so I may be jaded, since none of us are idiots.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Right on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The necros do most of the healing in our guild LDoN groups, followed by the bards, usually.  Sometimes I might Q on a named or something, but thats about it as far as healing.  Zeaphir's (sp?) group lifetap is that good.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well SOE did say in their advertising blurb that LDoN was aimed at the casual gamer.  But lets see - two out of three options are not for the casual player, and the remaining one has a number of features that are casual player unfriendly.<br />
<br />
I think the marketing people at SoE wanted an expansion for the casual player - catering for the majority of players makes commercial sense.  But the Devteam chose to ignore this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your gear is probably as far above a normal level 35's gear as mine is above a normal level 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>TPFKAFaern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Given the right MOB placement, a level 64 + Enchanter could solo a LDON Normal. * MAYBE * a hard, but would be tough.  There is a thread on this over at Casters Realm. <br />
<br />
Was in a LDON Normal tonight with a Time-Geared Monk tanking. He has over 9K HP buffed.  Perhaps &quot;tanking&quot; isn't the right word. (I was on my Enchanter so I got hit A LOT even with G Fetter).  Heck he told me to not even bother with slows.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Depends on your definition of end game.<br />
<br />
Vox and Nagy? Once the end game now all can kill them<br />
The kunark dragons? Once the end game now solo stuff<br />
VP? Could be done solo but that key is a pain<br />
ToV and Kael? Once end game now 1 group material.<br />
Sleepers? Again only a key stands between it and farming by all.<br />
Ssra, LIS? Once end game now material for smaller guilds<br />
VT? Recently the end game now only the key prefents it from being a farm zone.<br />
Tier 4? soon open to every guild for farming<br />
Time? Will follow the same pattern <br />
<br />
And to answer your question, LDoN design has a few flaws that make that casual gamer claim a joke.<br />
Normal is so easy any semi decent group has no trouble in it and Hard is to hard for most non end game raiders. LDoN clearly misses a third option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>tewdogs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Which hard mode adventures have people tried?<br />
I've found that the hard ruj dungeons in particular seemed to have mobs that were very well spaced for single pulls, with the occasional double. Mobs had pretty weak mr so were easily controlled.<br />
Maybe change your goals for the hard adventure, go slower, and use the full allotted time to go for a named, instead of going for the points. If you luck out and get a dungeon with close packed mobs be prepared to pull out and try again.<br />
With some skillful cc and some good healing, items such as these from hard ruj might be obtainable (for the higher level casual players anyway).<br />
