<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KriFos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heya, I am about to go kill Lord Ghiosk. <br />
<br />
I know that killing the black reavers will spawn him, but i wondered which black reaver that spawned him, and if he spawns every time, or just randomly?<br />
<br />
Any additional help that you think will be useful is appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Padraic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The very first reaver you run into spawns him.  Right behind the locked door inside the castle area.<br />
<br />
Think of him as a slightly harder Reaver.  Oh, and he always spawns from that reaver.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Heelah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">is having a rogue a must for the ghiosk reaver or can he be pulled through the door somehow?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You could try firing AOE spells through the door ... but then you'd get the whole room.<br />
<br />
Here's another idea - instead of going in though the door, go the other way. Use GFlux to get up onto the roof of the goo house, then levitate onto the second floor walkways. From there you can fight your way down to the throne room.<br />
<br />
I've never tried it that way but it might be possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Heelah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ok how about this....<br />
57 cleric 54 monk 55 mage 50 druid and 52 shaman and maybe 59 wiz<br />
what are my options then? lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Shh, secret: at the temple, go up the interior ramp to the top and jump onto the flag, then jump onto the wall. Large races may find lesser bear form helpful for standing on the flag. It takes a bit of practice, requiring some patience and coordination for a large party.  Once you're all up on the wall, you have an unbarred path into Ghiosk's castle.</div></div><hr />
