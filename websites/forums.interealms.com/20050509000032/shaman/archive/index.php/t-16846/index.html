<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shokar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was in a group this weekend, with a 65 Shammy chain pulling, safely, and singles.<br />
He had 7500 HP, buffed, so I guess that was part of the reason.<br />
<br />
Here is my take on it.  I was tanking with my 61 Paladin.  Usually, I have been doing all the pulls with Pacify, but these guys, you could just tell they knew what they were doing.<br />
<br />
Shammy pulls, I assume with root, we get two, but spread out.  The dungeon was Ruji, and a higher one, as the mobs were huge, (I thought I was shrunk) and the ceilings were high. On success, I got 44 points.<br />
<br />
Shammy sticks around long enough to slow, and off he goes again, always running in the main hall.  We kill our mob or mob as the case would be, and he has already announced directions of where to follow to.<br />
N, S, E or W as needed.<br />
<br />
EVERYONE stays behind me.  Please make a note of this next time you group.  STAY BACK.  I come up to Shammy, who has a new mob, I take it, and off Shammy goes.<br />
<br />
The mission was 55 mobs, we finished with 41 minutes left.<br />
<br />
Now, the reason for this post, is exactly, what and how was he doing this and so successfully?  My guess is he and his gang of pets would root a mob, and root whatever was near, using root as a mezz.<br />
<br />
I know as main puller, if someone even spits at an intersection without me getting my pacifies in, I get mobs from both sides.<br />
Please explain his GREAT tactics.<br />
<br />
When I first saw a shammy pulling, I was thinking...&quot;oh my god, why did I take this group...&quot;?  By the end I was thinking....&quot;Oh my god, how do I get back in the group everyday.&quot;?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have been doing alot of grouping in Rujark lately since I wanted to get the +40hp aug asap and I did it pretty much identically like the shaman you describe; pull with greater immobilize, sneeze a mob if 3+ mobs run toward me. I then bring them to camp and slows everything etc. I have a bit over 7550hp buffed so I don't mind tanking a couple while the melees kills them off.<br />
<br />
I try to keep at least 2 mobs in camp at all times and with 5 melees they die pretty quickly :)<br />
I usually complete an adventure with 60-65 minutes left unless I get &quot;Arena of Chance&quot; which takes a little bit longer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Outkast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hehe had a group like this the other night. Didn't have a Shaman pulling but had a BST slowing and they basically said &quot;Just heal when needs and add DPS&quot; Wasn't even sure why they got me as I'm sure they could've had a Druid with better DPS. I think I healed the MT like once every 3 mobs and we were droppin MOBs in less than 20 secs in most cases. Movement was very efficient and even when we got 4-5 adds people were rock solid on CC (no ench) and we just burned through the MOBs. I was hoping I could hang with these guys all night but alas only 2 adventures. Was great while it lasted though!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">In response to why he wasn't getting ganged up on as much as you seem to experience... lvl 65 vs lvl 61 : higher level means smaller aggro radius and more likely to get less adds on pulls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">on the slaughter missions the mobs are more spread out, less mobs per room etc<br />
<br />
makes for easier pulling</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">With creative use of root, VP, and pet, I can pull ok in most places.  Wouldn't touch guk though.  h8 guk!!!1<br />
<br />
It's good for the shaman to pull if he(or she ;) ) can, that way the other 5 can keep doing dps.   :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you want the tactics, I already posted em here (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=16640&amp;highlight=pulling).  Sounds like he was doing exactly as I and now all my guildmate shammies do :)<br />
<br />
  Having a slower with no appreciable DPS do the pulling makes for the best chain pulling groups around.  And by parking a mob somewhere safe to rot it we can even use the limited DPS we possess while keeping up chain pulls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">LDoN arent really too difficult to pull singles, depending how spread out rooms are. I did two missions with my 55 warrior today and he was puller both times and he got singles quite often, even in spots where I was expecting to get 2 or more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>smashie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">one strategy to pull a big room where you are sure to get 3+ mobs is to send in sacrifical doggies and debuff while they get killed. I would use Spirit Call 3 to pull, and slow targets one at a time while they beat up the summoned pets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>CamaenMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Root and Maps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Used Car</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Root and Maps.<br />
And Tigirs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I've always pulled for our group, and my HPs suck.  :p  Caanus started a thread on how to do it and it was pretty bang on. Can easily get a controlled 3-pull by rooting one, sneezing at the second and bringing the last in. While the party kills their mob, go back and nuke the sneezed one and it should break and head in. Tank grabs agro and you have the choice of helping them drop it then moving to the third, or going and breaking root on the third to bring that in too. The only times you maybe get a nasty pull is if there's a crowded room and you've got mobs behind corners that you can't target, but even then that's usually doable if you can get a Q off before you pull and a Tigirs off once the leftovers are in camp. It's not really News at 11:00 - I doubt if they're still even screening the repeats these days tbh.  ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
VP = Virulent Paralysis<br />
<br />
the message you get when you cast is the mob sneezes violently, which I guess they must as it causes a knockback effect</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">ahh thanks  ... VP on my short list just of AA but I gotta finish ND first</div></div><hr />
