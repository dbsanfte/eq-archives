<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone got any logs or parses of executioner trial fights?  I'd really like to know the following information (even your best guesses much appreciated if you don't have logs):<br />
<br />
1.  How many HP do the wave mobs have (rocks, aliens, nameds)?<br />
<br />
2.  Roughly how much DPS do they put out unslowed?<br />
<br />
3.  How fast do they hit?  And for how much Average?  Max?<br />
<br />
4.  How are their cold, poison, and magic resists?<br />
<br />
5.  What is the minimum realistic level to get the boss mob slowed?<br />
<br />
Any thoughts on how well this strategy might work:<br />
<br />
* the usual full preparation (buffs, pets, mod-rods, etc)<br />
* magician damage shield on everyone (35 points)<br />
* kilva's skin of flame potion on all melees and priests<br />
* paladin tanking all 4 mobs of each wave (unslowed) - no mezzing<br />
* Heal over Time spell from cleric on paladin just before wave spawns<br />
* Heal over Time spell from Shaman on Cleric just before wave spawns<br />
* CHeal on paladin timed to go off when he's down roughly 5000 hp<br />
* gimp-CHeal on cleric timed to go off about 5 seconds later<br />
* Assume the heals bounce agro, so CLE/PAL/SHM near one another<br />
* Wizard/magician/ranger assisting MA's first target and getting it dead asap, then on to next target, etc.<br />
* Paladin uses either healing wave of prexus, taunts, or stuns to get mobs back after priests get heal agro<br />
* mobs beat themselves senseless on about 75 points of damage shield<br />
<br />
Will a cleric, shaman, and paladin MA be able to keep up with the healing on 4 unslowed mobs?  Will the paladin be able to get mobs off the priests fast enough after they get heal agro (assuming they do)?  Will MAG/WIZ/RNG combo be able to kill the mobs fast enough?  And will a 58 shaman realistically be able to slow the boss mob?<br />
<br />
I'm considering the following trials group since it's the people I know well and can probably get:<br />
<br />
65 paladin (1400-1500 ac, 6000-6500 hp, good gear)<br />
65 magician<br />
64 wizard<br />
60 cleric<br />
58 ranger (about 60-70dps hasted using windblade + nukes)<br />
58 shaman (don't have tigir's insects)<br />
<br />
Given that I don't have tigirs, it feels like a damage shield strategy would work best.  If the mobs hit about once per second, they'd each be taking about 75 dps just from damage shield.  Should be really easy to kill the last couple as they've taken like 3000-4000 damage from DS by the time we get to them.  Only problem I see is keeping up with the healing from the unslowed mobs and managing the agro so nobody gets smeared.<br />
<br />
Thoughts?<br />
<br />
If something like this won't work I'll probably just cop out see if I can get an AoE group gimp the ranger and I through one at a time.</div></div><hr />

Get KEI'd of course, and have the magician summon the rods in advance.  Really just comes down to having the dps.  Without tigirs, and especially since the mobs all mitigate slow, I'd just concentrate on helping with heals as a shaman.  A pal, ranger, kei'd mage &amp; wiz should be able to put out enough damage.  You will need to slow the executioner though, and its not the easiest thing around, unless I was just unlucky...  Took a malosini and tash and in between them he bounced 2 or 3 turgurs.  Hits 700ish.  I was 61 at the time.  Group I did it with was well equipped 65: war, ranger, magician, enchanter - then me and a 62 cleric, neither with great gear.</div></div><hr />

The mobs have about 4000hp each and you have 25 secs to drop each to make it through to the next round. Mages are gods of the exe trial and make sure you get you mage some star rubies (68pp) each to cast on the rocks.<br />
<br />
Our typical group when getting through a friend would be a big tank that can keep agro. SK/PAL/WARRIOR, 62+ cleric with SE (due to is low agro on the spell),  Mage, Shaman/Bard/Enchanter, Rogue and the person we want to get through.<br />
<br />
Our shaman tactic is as follows. There are 4 mobs that pop. The intention is to use DS potion + Mage DS on the MA and 3 of the mobs beat on the MA (DS does wonderful damage). The shaman will slow one of the mobs off and solo it. The cleric will SE the MA to delay the first big heal bomb and hence try to avoid any agro.<br />
<br />
This works rather well. As the other 5 finish off the 3 mobs, Shaman and alpha puppy beat on the 4th. Bane + Ebolt + Hasted pet with any 2 1hand weapons will drop a mob in the same time as the other 5 drop the 3 other mobs. <br />
<br />
The key to any fight is to get rid of rocks ASAP. 68pp per banishment and loss of xp on that mob is well worth the effort. These are enchanter mob and they toss around slow like candy. It must be prevented.<br />
<br />
We had 6 named pop on the way to exe one time and our cleric still finished the fight with 60% mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just looked at my logs -- no mitigate messages on the first wave, but darned if they weren't on the other waves.<br />
<br />
They are in the &quot;slightly&quot; category, which puts slows around 15% max.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>mcast12</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Don't even think about DSing the mage/wiz/cleric. imho you may make it with this setup after about 10 tries, but it will be touch and go. The cleric will be LOM by exe so you need to kite him. As said before your biggest asset is the mages banish get them to use it asap. You will probably be able to slow the exe, in the 5 or 6 times I got to him before I passed I slowed him &quot;slightly&quot; first time everytime. To make this trivial swap the ranger for a 62+ wiz.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">To me it sounds like you would have a pretty good group. My strat for exe trials goes like this. Have everyone in the group go to the back left corner on entrance. Have the MT stand on the bench closest to you. You stand right behind him and have Tirgirs loaded (very useful IMO). Since you don't have Tirgirs, I would not worry about the mob the tank is on, but slow one that is off to the side, and dot it. Then pick a new mob and slow it and dot. If this takes alot of mana, maybe just slow, but I found dotting the &quot;adds&quot; speeds up the process greatly. The last mob is pretty tough. My first trial was at 63 and I had malo. After Malo, it took about 2-3 casts to get Sini to stick, and then slow stuck the first time. He of course mitigates, but to me, even 2% would help. Paladins make the best tanks for exe trials imo so looks like you are set. Once you get slow to land, do whatever you have left with your mana. Dot or nuke like there is no tomorrow. <br />
<br />
Hope this might help a little bit and good luck to you =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I just finally made it this weekend, with 63 warrior, 61? mage, 61? cleric, 62 chanter, 61? monk, and myself at 61.  Took us three tries, but the first was my VERY first trial attempt and I made some dumb mistakes.  Second try the mage LD'd on the first wave, so we didn't even really try.<br />
<br />
I didn't bother attempting to slow, Tigir's or otherwise.  I blasted with spear of torment (you'd probably want ice strike rather than blast of venom, for mana conservation purposes) and tossed sup heal to help the cleric keep mana up.  I topped off everyone's health between waves, to avoid healing agro, even though it sometimes meant doing my mana recovery during the actual waves.  The mod rods were a BIG help.  On the boss I landed slow first or second try after Malo, then epicced and settled in to heal, slinging just a few DD's during the whole fight.  Cleric was using CH only, so I started tossing sup heal when the tank was half life to keep her alive until the next CH landed.  It was close, I was OOM (after going OOM and canning enough for a couple more heals) by the end and the tank had only a couple bubs left, but we won. :)  With the additional levels of most of your folks, I'd say you should be able to do it.  Don't feel bad if it takes some tries to get the hang of it.  It takes some practice to get the rhythm and the tactics down.  And it's great exp in the meantime, so you're hardly wasting time even on failures.<br />
<br />
If you're worried about resists on the final slow, you might want to invest in Mystical Aptitude potions that raise your effective casting level by 3, giving you the same chance of landing as a level 61.  With the mage to Mala (or whatever their unresistable one is), you should have a good shot at it.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Forgot to add that our chanter was mezzing.  Unless your paladin is really good at pulling stuff off fast, I don't think you or the cleric would survive the beating you'd take before the first couple mobs go down.  I'm fairly well equipped but nearly died a couple times in our first attempt after I broke a mez (doh!) or took healing agro early on.  If your cleric has to heal you from low health more than once or twice, he's not going to have enough mana for the final fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>JomoMojo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I casted spear of torment about 6 times before un memming it, ever single one was resisted.<br />
<br />
Tried three attempts at the trials, with a 64 ench, 62 warr, 65 mag, 62 mag, 60 clr and myself 61 shaman.  Failed the first one because the tank was having targetting problems.  Failed the second one on the last mob of the 4th wave, server hiccup'd and we all had 90% packet loss.  Third attempt we got the executioner down to 19 % life, cleric went oom from quick heals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ice nukes are resisted on those mobs; poison nukes work well. 61 Spear of Torment is your best damage along with 61 pet. On my trial I used 54 Blast of Venom which is not as mana efficient. 2 nukes per mob if your mana holds up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">* Paladin uses either healing wave of prexus, taunts, or stuns to get mobs back after priests get heal agro<br />
<br />
Yes, absolutely, Ive done trials as a shaman and a cleric and a strong Paladin is a fabulous trial MT. Let him use group heals to hold aggro becuase direct heal aggro is immense, even tnargs will get you summoned, cleric uses low aggro HoTs when theres multiple mobs about, CH's are safe toward the end of a wave. Last few trials I've clericed with a strong paladin MT I've not gotten aggro once provided I've not landed a direct heal with multiple mobs present.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Thanks everyone for the strategy tips.  Any of you remember how fast the mobs hit and what their max or average hit is?  Do the mobs have to be slowed and/or mezzed for clerics to be able to use exclusively heal over time spells?<br />
<br />
I'd guess that 4 unslowed mobs would pack a punch which only well timed CHeals would be able to keep up with, but most people are saying use heal over times, which either means that the mobs don't hit as hard as I'm thinking or all of the people recommending HoT have either slowed or mezzed some of the mobs.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty much trying to determine exactly how much damage the damage shields are likely to do (thus the how fast do the mobs hit question) and how much healing is going to be required to keep up with the mobs damage output.<br />
<br />
I'm being kind of a &quot;fight planning geek&quot; here.  I even put together a spreadsheet.  At the moment, my working assumption is that the unslowed mobs will be hitting a well-geared MA about 3 times a tick each for an average of 150 damage.  That would be 300 dps until the first mobs dies, then 225 dps, then 150dps, then 75dps.  To keep up with that, you need some SERIOUS healing.  I don't see how heals over time could keep up, so I must have a bad assumption somewhere, since obviously they do keep up, according to a number of you who've used them successfully.</div></div><hr />
