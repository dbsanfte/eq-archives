<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gaky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i was hoping for a little advice.  just wondering how those of you that have it use it.<br />
<br />
do you keep canni4 up and use it when you aren't using much mana?  have you given up on canni4 completely?<br />
<br />
i hit the button and it takes 70% health and gives me 30 mana.  i have torpors so this isn't a big problem.  also working on getting more hp gear now.  thing is, i've been hitting my canni hotkey constantly since i was, what? 24? 26? and this is a very hard habit to break.  i HATE having full hp and not being fom.  is this something i should just get over now? <br />
<br />
any ideas or examples of how you use canni5 would be appreciated</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gaky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">thank you.  this board moves too fast sometimes and i don't see all posts.  the other thread helps  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've had canni5 for a while, on most raids now I can take down canni4 and not have problems</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Pumyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I always keep Canni 4 loaded too. Canni 5 is great, but often simply not enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">With my current gear, Cana 5 gives me back 28% mana. So basically whenever I get below 70% on mana, I use cana 5. Sometimes thats everytime it pops and sometimes its a few times every half hour. Just depends on the situation.<br />
<br />
I also keep cana 4 up at all times. I would much rather work on being at full mana for a pull and than to get caught by a bad pull and only have 75% mana.</div></div><hr />
