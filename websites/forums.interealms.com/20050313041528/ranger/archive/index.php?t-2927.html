<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sorronn</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 03:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On Povar there seems to be developing the ugly habit of camping HOT from the front lobby of HOT and then trying to claim all of HOT as a &quot;camp&quot;. Recently even one GM supported this viewpoint but I seriously doubt that if raised to the head GM such a view would stand scrutiny.<br />
<br />
However, assuming someone was camped in the entry room of HOT on your server and did not move, how would your guild handle this situation? If I was the raid inside, I would certainly let the other guys &quot;play through&quot;, so to speak. But if I was outside and the inside people didn't allow us to pass through in a reasonable amount of time, I'd be damned tempted to just open the door at random times. :D</div></div><hr />

I would just move all of my guild past the other guild while they are engaging a mob and deeper into the halls where they don't pull from (and where good armor drops!).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Feeldary</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 03:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">completely dumb, not wondering why GM agree with that</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tilianAran</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 03:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild allways clears hot from the front lobby.  We clear the whole place from here with 1 or 2 monks pulling.  If a guild wants to move in deeper and pull its up to them we can't realy stop them, however, they will not find many mobs up and don't expect our monks to make on consesions for them.<br />
<br />
And if someone starts opening the door to cause wipe outs I would make sure they get band<br />
<br />
If there is a guild allready in Hot wether they are clearing the whole place or not we go somewhere else or wait till they finished.  Less messing about and bad blood that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alexzander</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 04:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We don't really do hot anymore, but we always used to just go do something else if hot was camped. Unless maybe doze is up and the guild there can't kill. We usualy camp the first pit and pull everything to there. I guess someone could have walked past us if they wanted too, but they would not find much up.<br />
<br />
As far as I know, generaly on prexus if one guild is in hot they are left alone. I could be mistaken though, I havent seen that end of tov in while.<br />
<br />
And frankly, openning a door on another raid shows no class.</div></div><hr />

I don't see how a guild could prevent you from moving further into HoT if you really wanted to, but I've never seen two guilds in HoT farming armour at the same time. &quot;X guild is in HoT&quot; usually leads to &quot;what else is up?&quot; rather than &quot;How many people do they have?&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaelikk</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 04:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, in my experience,  2 guild can camp HoT without ever having problems;  one does the north, one does the south.  I think it is classless to camp the pit and not allow another guild to pass buy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crydee Ossiriand</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 04:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Although ARo is a FFA server, some of the +COV guilds make side deals so as to not all be in TOV at the same time. All deals are off when Dozekar is up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elmarnieh</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 04:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Every guild Ive been in has done HoT from the lobby and we complain about not having enough spawns up. Well we used to, no more HoT farming anymore but why would anyone walk through the place when you can have a few monks pull everything right  to the easist place for cr if you need to?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alexzander</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 04:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">btw, this bothers me every time I see it posted<br />
<br />
FCFS = first come first served. First to the mob buffed and pulling gets it. This doesn't mean that another guild can't wait to see if you wipe and try after. FCFS is with in the rules provided by verant.<br />
<br />
FFA = Free for all. Free for all includes training, sending in KS teams, or directly tring to ks a raid that is already engaged on a target. This is against verants rules.<br />
<br />
Maybe it is just a difference in the way different servers comunicate, but on prexus when people say FFA they mean breaking rules.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The pit, Dozekar's room, various alcoves in the maze.   The zone out in the maze.  You need to pay close attention to respawn time in the maze or Dozekar's room or be working with the group camping the lobby or you may have the guardians in your face on respawn if you're not careful.</div></div><hr />

It's true that I know a couple of decent folks in IL, but they're rare.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tiluvas</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 07:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We've had up to three guilds camping HoT on Tarew Marr, one guild in dozekar room, one in west wing and the other in east wing(yes, in Halls of Testing).<br />
<br />
Fortunately the guild in doze room wasn't very experienced and went a bit slowly, so there was still plenty of stuff to kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sirenia Brighteye</div><div class="date">05-14-2002, 07:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree. There is nothing wrong with 2 guilds (more seems a bit...you get my drift) in HoT at the same time.<br />
<br />
Let eachother pass, have respect for one another. It can work out easily.</div></div><hr />
