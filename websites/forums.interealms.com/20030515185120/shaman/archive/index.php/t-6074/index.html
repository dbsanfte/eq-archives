<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Keladwen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My friend and I both had our epics at lvl 1. If you see pics of these things it's really not that hard to figure out that they are Using EQ Emu. That's how friend and i had our epics at lvl one. lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Whats that I smell..... Oh yea its BS<br />
<br />
Turning in the items alone even if you was MQing and such would still ding you. So you would not be lv1. Thanks have a nice day and go BS someone that might belive you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nubok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Actually its possible to be level 1 and have epic...... bind near some BIG KOS mob and attack it, go make some coffe etc. until you have undinged to level 1 :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can't unding past 6 (or used to be the case) isn't it true now that you don't lose exp below level 10?<br />
<br />
In short absolute load of hogwash thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Xelnag Ashenpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just group with a level 50+ character while you do the quest. You'll get no exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>GrindleBashmeister</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Next time read the part where the original poster says they're using the EQ Emulator to get epic at lvl 1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Keladwen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Jeez i can't believe a mature EQ player would go off on such a thing as not being able to read.</div></div><hr />
