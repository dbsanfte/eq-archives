<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Eonowyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is how I foresee many of the new AAXPs for PoP - my ideas in italics. <br />
<br />
**** GENERAL SKILLS ****<br />
<br />
Planar Power<br />
(10(61) + 10(62) + 10(63) + 10(64) + 10(65) = 305 stats)<br />
<br />
Will this be available outside of PoP? <br />
<br />
Planar Durability<br />
(5% + 5% + 5% + 5% + 5% = +25%) HP<br />
<br />
  I would imagine you would have to have Natural Durability 3 a prerequisite (since it became available to every class), unless this is only active while in PoP. <br />
<br />
Advanced Innate Strength/Stamina/Dexterity/etc.<br />
(4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = +20) STR<br />
<br />
  I would imagine you would have to have maxxed the normal Innate Stat from Luclin as a prerequisite, unless this is only active while in PoP  <br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
**** CLASS/ARCHTYPE SKILLS ****<br />
<br />
<br />
Advanced Healing Adept<br />
This ability increases the maximum effectiveness of your healing spells by five percent per rank. You may train in this ability once each level, upon reaching levels 62, 63, and 64.<br />
<br />
  Should have to max regular Healing Adept  <br />
<br />
Advanced Healing Gift<br />
This ability increases your chance to score an exceptional heal by two percent per rank. An exceptional heal doubles the healing value of the spell. You may train in this ability once each level, upon reaching levels 62, 63, and 64.<br />
<br />
  Should have to max regular Healing Gift  <br />
<br />
Coup de Grace<br />
This ability gives you a chance to immediately slay an NPC that is below ten percent health and fleeing with a single, well placed strike. The first level works on NPC's below level 55, the second on NPC's below 57, and the third on NPC's below 59. You may train in this ability once each level, upon reaching levels 62, 63, and 64.<br />
<br />
  Should have to max Finishing Blow  <br />
<br />
Fury of the Ages<br />
This ability further increases your chance to score a critical blow against your opponent. You may train in this ability once each level, upon reaching levels 62, 63, and 64.<br />
<br />
  Should have to max Combat Fury  <br />
<br />
Flash of Steel<br />
This ability further increases your chance of doubly riposting your opponent each time you score a successful riposte by ten percent per rank. You may train in this ability once each level, upon reaching levels 62, 63, and 64.<br />
<br />
  Should have to max Double Riposte  <br />
<br />
Lightning Reflexes<br />
This ability further increases your chance of completely avoiding incoming melee damage. You may train in this ability once each level after reaching level 61.<br />
<br />
  Should have to max Combat Agility  <br />
<br />
Innate Defense<br />
This ability further increases your mitigation of incoming melee damage. You may train in this ability once each level after reaching level 61.<br />
<br />
  Should have to max Combat Stability  <br />
<br />
<br />
 Now here is where it gets tricky  <br />
<br />
Guardian of the Forest<br />
This ability transforms you into an exceptionally bloodthirsty wolf that attacks with lightning speed, for a brief time. You may train the three ranks of this ability at or after levels 61, 63, and 65.<br />
<br />
There isn’t a clear-cut Luclin ability that is related to Guardian of the Forest. This would be Rangers’ first damage discipline. Possibly Ambidexterity? Combat Fury?<br />
<br />
Ferocity<br />
This ability grants you an increased chance of performing a double attack in any given combat round. You gain the ability to train an additional rank at levels 61, 63, and 65.<br />
<br />
The only thing similar to this in Luclin is Ambidexterity or Double Riposte. I could see them making ambidexterity a prereq but not the latter.<br />
<br />
<br />
Vanishing Blade<br />
The ability allows you to strike your opponents with such speed that they are frequently left dumbfounded, not entirely certain of where the blow originated. You gain the ability to train an additional rank at levels 61, 63, and 65.<br />
<br />
Innate jolt of sorts for Rangers. I can’t see a prerequisite for this<br />
<br />
Unstoppable Force<br />
This ability grants you the chance to score an additional attack with two-handed weapons. You gain the ability to train an additional rank at levels 61, 63, and 65.<br />
<br />
This is available to Monks, Rangers, and Warriors – Not sure if this will be innate or a timed ability akin to a damage disc. Also, this is identical wording given to “Speed of the Knight” which is only available to Paladins and Shadow Knights – only reason I could see these being different is if the Pal/SK version was using a different % increase.<br />
<br />
<br />
Knight's Advantage<br />
This ability grants you an increased chance of performing a double attack with two-handed weapons in any given combat round. You gain the ability to train an additional rank at levels 61, 63, and 65.<br />
(Paladin, SK)<br />
<br />
Speed of the Knight<br />
This ability grants you the chance to score an additional attack with two-handed weapons. You gain the ability to train an additional rank at levels 61, 63, and 65.<br />
(Paladin, SK)</div></div><hr />
