<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arroe</div><div class="date">01-08-2003, 07:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok, i was thinking about this when reading the post about what a ranger should be like in EQ2, and thought of this.  kinda like combining AA with skills as you lvl.... let me give an example.<br />
<br />
you start off by picking a main class; either warrior (fighters), wizards (int casters), or druids/clerics (wis casters)(maybe not that name, can't think of anything else though).  So you go into the game as one of these 3 classes at lvl 1.  As you progress, let's say every other level or so, you are alloted a certain amount of points, let's say 10 points for every 2 levels.  Then you will be able to collect points, or use your points to buy upgrades that physically make you better.  I like this more then AA because you don't have to stop your regular lvling to get specific advancements, but instead build your character uniquely, to fit your idea of who you want him or her to be.  Here's what I think a list for the Warrior line advancements leading to a ranger could be (what you could put points in to become a ranger, but this is just one way, there can be many different variations of rangers):<br />
<br />
Lvl 1:<br />
    Start off as a warrior with just hand to hand skills, taunt, tradeskill abilitys, and begging.<br />
<br />
Lvl 2:<br />
    Sense heading (4 pt)<br />
    Basic Foraging (40 cap) (8pt)<br />
    Defensive (8pt)(minor defense upgrade)<br />
    ONE OF THE FOLLOWING FOR PRIMARY WEAPONS SKILLS:<br />
         Secondary Hand to Hand (10pt) (This would lead towards monk type classes) <br />
         Slashing (10pt) (This would lead to slashing focused classes, this is what we're picking in this example)<br />
        Piercing (10pt) (Rogues, rangers who want to focus on daggers as primary weapons) <br />
        Archery (10pt) (Mostly for rangers who want to use their bows as their primary weapons, or archers)<br />
        Blunt (10pt) (Another option for monk like classes) <br />
    Ok, so we picked Slashing as our choice, we want a blades focused character.  We have no points left over, but if we want another skill from this list again later, we can always go back. <br />
<br />
(Now this is where we want to start thinking about what else we want our character to focus on.  To become a good archer later, we want to pick Archery so we don't miss out.  On the other hand, if we wanted to become a 2hs massive critter, 2hs would be our choice.  Getting it?) <br />
<br />
Lvl 4:          <br />
    ONE OF THE FOLLOWING FOR SECONDARY WEAPONS SKILLS:<br />
        Secondary Level 1hs (8pt)<br />
        Secondary Level 2hs (8pt)<br />
        Archery (6pt)<br />
        Piercing (8pt)<br />
        Throwing (6pt)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
..... ok, and that's all i can think of for now, lol.  but does anyone understand what i mean?  it's kind of like one of those tree diagrams, where you can work your way down branching off, but in this case, some branches join in.<br />
<br />
Or this is another way of seeing it.  As you pick a weapon style to skill in, your title changes.  Like from choosing slashing, our title changes from warrior to &quot;Sword Carrier&quot; or something like that (hey, it has to sound crappy cause it's a low level skill).  Then when we buy Archery, we become a &quot;Ranger Apprentice,&quot; which is also obtainable by other combos such as primary archery and secondary slashing or piercing, or primary piercing, secondary archery (even though they perform differently).  Let's say only &quot;Ranger Apprentice's,&quot; and other druid/bard like character apprentices could get tracking too.  That also keeps the classes in order and logical, so that you don't have shadow knights who can detect who's near them as easily as a ranger can.  Later you can turn into a &quot;Ranger&quot; or into a &quot;Scout&quot; or a &quot;Watchman&quot; depending on what you focus on.  And what's wrong with having over 100 different tittles for JUST the warrior line?  Nothing.  It makes the game much easier to role play in.  But the beauty of it all is no body is exactly alike, or few are as close.<br />
<br />
You wouldn't have to be a ranger to shoot bows with deadly accuracy, nor a ranger has to be able to do that anyway.  What if you really have dreaded not able to wear plate, but are glad you picked a ranger though because the awesome output they can do with their bows (at the high end at least, but hopefully it'll be different in EQ2)?  You could start off with the archery line, then go into secondary archery, and just focus on archery the whole way (eventually you will be given the right to wear plate armor).  You could make your way up to becoming a &quot;Keep Archer&quot; or &quot;Tower Bow Guard&quot; (heh, i suck at coming up with names), and could wear plate, shoot with bows with maximum output, but are limited to only bows, although you do have strong protection to live long enough for someone to kill the mob on you.  <br />
<br />
Which leads me to my next point, armor.  Because you build your character, armor can only be upgraded in stages.  Everyone starts off with just cloth; no matter what the mother class is.  By picking their weapons upgrades, they are essentially picking what armor they want to wear as well.  By picking piercing, slashing, or archery at lvl 2, you are allowed to upgrade to  leather armor, however hand to hand and blunt are limited to cloth only still.  Instead of having specific race/class combos on item tags, it will instead be race/parent class/primary skill (weapon type, god for druid and wizzy classes)/armor type.  This should also help prevent some twinking, keep armor with appropriate classes, and also help the game be more diverse.<br />
<br />
Last, fighters do not get spells.  That means no spells for rangers.  However, skills should be added to make up for no spells at a low point cost.  I think skills little skills are important to adding diversity aswell, maybe even make cool effects for advanced dodge moves (how cool would it be if monks could press a key to do some cool karate move and dodge a hit while flying up to kick an enemy in the head), or an extra-powerful bow shoot (equip a torch in one hand and press a key to light your arrow ablaze and send it soaring at an enemy).<br />
<br />
Ok, this is getting really long, heh.  Don't tell me I'm crazy, this has to make sense to someone!  Just an idea.....</div></div><hr />
