<br />
check the magelo link for my pally, it will give you a good template for twinking.  (admitedly i am lazy and can a get a few nice easy upgrades for him, but meh. so lazy....)</div></div><hr />

i got him the hooked so'shar, amazing aggro weapon, just slightly under BoC.<br />
i also got him the parry blade, wich is very good aggro also.<br />
once he hits 45, he will be using the stone hilted thingy from natimbi<br />
and the branacle covered axe (wich is amazing until 56 for aggro)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">King Dronan and Earth Seer in Droga for very decent weapons.<br />
<br />
Veksar for the following, make some IVU potions, get pet weapons, suspended minion, and you're fine:  Nobles/Highborn area, you're going to need to kill as you move, as mobs see invis.<br />
<br />
48 AC BP<br />
Kylong Shinguards<br />
Nobles/Highborns for gauntlets<br />
Soulscream belt.<br />
I believe you can find some decent arms and boots here, too.  Haven't camped those mobs, though.  But most likely doable.<br />
<br />
UP for Raldukan helm, or Veksar for Kylong darkmetal coif.<br />
<br />
AC for face off high priest. <br />
<br />
Those should give you some very nice items to twink the warrior, and you should be able to solo all of them.  Those items would actually be workable all the way to 65 and beyond.  You might consider an SK, though, if you're planning on doing a 2-box.  SK shines in dungeon crawling with their snare/dot.</div></div><hr />
