<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Waran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well folks, I'm still in shock here.  But I will try to put that aside and let my feelings show :)<br />
<br />
I logged into the Bazaar and ran into Grizz, Cshae, Zelf, Aliera and one more (Was it Than? Sorry I missed whoever our 6th was) and Cshae wanted to go to East Karana to see the Warrior Epic NPC.  Supposedly she wanted to see where it was so we headed out and got there.<br />
<br />
Then she said if she were to summon a Green Scale would I be ready to complete my Epic.  I said of course, starting to think this was some kinda joke, but then she /emote Summons a green scale and dropped it on me.<br />
<br />
My jaw about hit the floor and I started shaking when I saw &quot;Green Dragon Scales&quot; appear in my trade window with Cshae.  After lots of &quot;Waran says, !!!!!!!!!!!&quot; I completed my last few turnins before heading out to East Freeport to pickup my Red Scabbard.<br />
<br />
In front of all my family and friends in KOE, I started to have a speech but were summoned away to kill Lodi out in Iceclad.  Voting for &quot;Let's go!&quot; in our polls, we jumped at the chance and took the big turtle down. Grats to all the recipients of great loot.  Plus we didn't need any coffins ;)<br />
<br />
Anyway, after the kill, I combined my 2 hilts and 2 blades and created the Jagged Blade of War, which separates into the Blade of Tactics and Blade of Strategy for 1HS.<br />
<br />
I'd like to thank ALL KOE and friends who completed this AMAZING accomplishment.  This isn't an accomplishment for just little ole me, it's just as big for KOE!!!<br />
<br />
&lt;h1&gt;THANK YOU AUSSIE CREW, KOE AND FRIENDS!!!&lt;/H1&gt;<br />

Also, I want to thank Buri/Rox for spotting Sev and sending out the call, and to Barain for kiting Sev around for a couple seconds before anyone showed up.  :D <br />
<br />
And of course, thanks to the Aussie Raid Force (tm) for showing up quickly and in force to help in the fight, we couldn't have done it without them.<br />
<br />
Oh, and one last thanks to Axis for getting wiped when they tried to beat us to the punch and engaged early.  :eek:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>erolz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Congrats Waran!  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Jlove Fizzboom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Once again -- KoE has demonstrated how determined we are to kill that stupid dragon.  Belle said Sev was up (great job) - and within a few minutes every KoE online about was there, including ToV aussies, and everyone else who was doing other things.<br />
<br />
The warrior epic is by far not JUST about Sev, but he/she has been our biggest obstacle - and by gosh if we aren't knocking it down more often these days!<br />
<br />
I tip my hat to:<br />
<br />
1) Waran, of course.<br />
2) Taninn and Mekil, the only Koe warriors there, who didn't even peep about their rights to the scale.<br />
3) Bellevue my honey love 3cp sweetie, for making the sighting and the call.<br />
4) Cshae the only officer online who called in reinforcements.<br />
5) Belammar from CoE who, to my knowledge was not pressured to award the scale to us, but I believe did so from his own mind's belief to our rights to it.<br />
6) An unnamed Axis player, who seemingly trained Sev on us before groups were made, after they tried to gank him and got wiped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Wynnie Walaryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">i dunno about that, I got the impression that waran was so happy with his new toys that he just jammed that red one through his head.  heh heh<br />
<br />
gotta love the EQ graphics engine :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Barain ni Melangell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Most people will tell you that they can run faster scared then you can mad.....well I found out this is not true when dealing with Sev.....:D <br />
<br />
Congrats Waran...I was so happy when we got awarded the scale.....and you have no idea how hard it was to keep quite about it.....:eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Tannin Steelblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Well well my St. Louis wet willi sweety  it is about time you got your sticks :)   I must admit i am very envious of you .. wait a minute your an ugly barb .. never mind  <br />

I'm closing in on 46 with my thane and the cap is 50.  Midgard is under heavy siege recently.  Last night Albion and Hibernia both were attacking us for about 20 hours straight.  They got through the first door of our power relic keep (which is holding the Mid, Alb and Hib power relics!).  We turned back 3 full blown assaults.  All is quiet for now. ;)</div></div><hr />
