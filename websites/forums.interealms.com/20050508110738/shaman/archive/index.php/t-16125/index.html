<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My brother's been bugging me for months to start making these with my gnome alt, and just now I've been making them.  They're soooo niceee...<br />
<br />
You can get all the components you need from one small area in PoK, and they're only about 18-19pp to make, each.<br />
<br />
You get five instant charges of Eye of Zomm that you can click from inventory... and I swear, I think they last longer with SCRM, but I'm not sure.<br />
<br />
After using all five charges, you can sell it back to a vendor for 14pp.<br />
<br />
Talk about savings!<br />
<br />
Now if only I could convert to the gnome race so I could make them myself. hehe.<br />
<br />
Doh, what am I saying?   Blasphemer!!!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>greatmilenko_00</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">holgresh beads were never nerfed. Its the drop that was nerfed, on inny they are going for somthing like 150-250k, damn necros like em alot</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hrm, I was of the impression they still drop but now have charges...<br />
<br />
  Guess I'll have to look at that one, if they still drop chargeless but are simply rare I will happily hunt a couple for my friends.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For shaman they are a scouting tool, they are very powerful when combined with vision though as you can safely reach a lot further.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">aye, it is purely scouting, but think of how little you have to move while you are working over a mob, and imagine using all of that time, or all the time you are rebuffing/medding, to wander the area and see the spawns.<br />
<br />
<br />
 I solo a LOT, and being able to scout out the next pull, or watch the nearest wandering mob has quite revolutionized my ability in dungeons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah use to have the spell back when EQ was new with my wizzy.  Then they made the big Pet agro change and the Eye spell became kinda dangerous to use as wizard.  Now that pets once again do not cause agro I can see how they can be useful.  Got few more questions. <br />
<br />
1. Are you able to use them while you have a pet up or does it count as your pet?<br />
<br />
2. When casting spells does your charactor still have to have line of sight to target or just the Eye?<br />
<br />
I'm just wondering as I can see myself getting a couple stalking probs for those new places I am not very farmilar with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Uthgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">For scouting you can use assideous Vision. I will chain it off mobs and It seems to have a very long range for casting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Eye of Zomm doesn't count as your pet, you can use it with a pet up.  But it's rare that I can't bounce as far as I need to see with assiduous vision.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Can you use the eye to target stuff?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yes, you can target things while using the eye, and the eye can open doors as well, hence being better than Assidious vision.   Both used in conjunction are amazing :)   The fact that I have no limit on my eye casting and no need to wait for the recast of Assidious Vision makes me love the things :)<br />
<br />
  Another nice thing with the eye is that if you cast it while up against a wall, it will go to the other side of the wall if it is thin enough, and in most zones if they wall has no other side it pops the eye randomly to a place in zone (good for scouting out NToV/VT/ST in this way)</div></div><hr />

<br />
For necros it is a safe heal. You can lifetap/tapovertime an Eye of zomm to heal yourself out of combat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actully those always droped. When doing the iceforged shaclks quest for my pet rog and my girlfrinds bard we had 1 of the zoom beads drop. And about 4 of the grim aura ones. This was befor the nerf tho and I cant say if the Eye of zoom ones still drop or not.</div></div><hr />
