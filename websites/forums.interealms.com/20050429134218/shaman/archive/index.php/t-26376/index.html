The following is an actual transcript on our guild channel last nite. It just shows you how brutal the World of Warcraft can be. Warning! Content may not suitable for young children: <br />
<br />
[Winkles]What Up? <br />

[williesproblem]you can't just say that... <br />
[DestinyWank]dude you just can't say 'ding' for no reason - it's like against the rules <br />
[SkelterHelter]saying 'ding' without leveling is like calling Santa Claus 'Jim' or something... <br />
[briansleftshoe]Horde in Dun Modr <br />
[pivotsmelter]shut up brian! <br />

[toxicfumeguy]West - if the guild had a spanking machine you'd have to go through it <br />
[insanityschild]yeah - spank him! <br />
[xxxyyyzzz]the Guild has a spanking machine? <br />
[winkles]spank him -- can I take a screen shot? <br />
[briansleftshoe]can anyone enchant my new bracers? <br />
[childrenofthecorn]shut up brian! <br />
[westofnothingness]DING DING DING DING DING DING DING! $%*($&amp;$(#% you DING DING DING DING DING DING DING!! <br />
<br />
...uncomfortably long pause... <br />
<br />
Westofnothingness has been removed from the Guild <br />
<br />
(Editors Note: the use of the word DING brings with it serious connotations. Please use extreme caution and discretion. We don't want this to happen to you!!)</div></div><hr />
