<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>vindicus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i just started a shaman bcuz i was borred from my sk.. and i took a iksar.. IMO they look cool lol<br />
<br />
but i did /who all sham 65 on my server and 11 on 14 were barb :\ other 3 was 2 ogre + a cat<br />
<br />
well.. is there any downside with the iksar?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No Jaundice Bone Armor. Particularly the bracer, of course you will probably never see one anyway.<br />
<br />
That is it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Iksars have the highest base wisdom of all shaman races (including the soon-to-be froglok shamans), and they have innate regeneration, infravision, and a mild AC bonus. All nice advantages. <br />
<br />
Drawbacks; faction and cant use the JBB (if you ever got one, as was stated). <br />
<br />
Iksar is a fine choice, especially since you think they look cool. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>GeddarRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Iksar is a fine choice, 3rd best for a power gamer imo... only behind Troll's due to JB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Advantages?<br />
<br />
1) Faction. Honest to god, having awful faction just means you have more places to hunt. As a barbarian shaman I've ruined my faction in Freeport hunting, High Keep hunting, Ak'Anon, Felwithe, and Kelethin. I'm working on getting at least dubious in Cabilis for the conveniance of it, however.<br />
<br />
2) Regeneration. Not really that astronomical (can barely notice it on my Ikky Beastlord), but it IS better than what everyone else gets.<br />
<br />
3) AC bonus. Very noticable, and pretty useful.<br />
<br />
4) High Wisdom. the +10 you have over Barbarians means that you'll never ever have to mourn the fact you can't wear GEB's.<br />
<br />
5) You look pimpin'. Seriously.<br />
<br />
Disadvantages?<br />
<br />
1) Faction. However, the fact that you have SoW will save you from everyone except Ogguk bouncers and Holly Windstalker. Being hated allows you some interesting veiwpoints. You learn very quickly what NPC's dwell where in what zones.<br />
<br />
2) Gear. Not a HUGE problem. the only thing you're likely to miss is the cheap AC of Jaundiced Bone. Everything else is either chain or race: ALL. Your Plane of Hate armor is miles ahead of Rune etched.<br />
<br />
3) Exp penalty. This is the BIG penalty for Iksar. You lose 20% of the exp from every kill you make. It adds up.<br />
<br />
4) Low Stamina. As we all know, Stamina = Hp = mana. Iksar get a larger mana pool with their high wisdom, but don't get as many HP to work with, at least not until some of the better gear.<br />
<br />
5) Crap newbie zones. You'll be lucky to afford patchwork.<br />
<br />
6) Finally, 50+ spells. These aren't sold in Cabilis. And to my knowledge, they're not sold in Shadowhaven or Plane of Knowledge, either. You have to get friends to pick up such gems as Turgur's and Malosini.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The race you chose is not nearly as important as how you play. Every Shaman race has their advantages and disadvantages that you have to compensate for. I don't think I've ever heard anyone say that they wouldn't take someone because of their race/class combination, though.<br />
<br />
Iksar just aren't as popular as other races, for some reason. They make perfectly decent Shaman. If what's important to you is choosing the absolute best Shaman race, I would personally tell you to go with a Troll. But I also think that people who constantly hop around looking to be the latest and greatest Race/Class combo will always find themselves disappointed, because balance in EQ is always shifting. If you pick a role that you enjoy playing just because you think it fits you well, you're bound to have more fun in the long run.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">crap newbie zones?  you're mad~  the field of bone is hands down the best newbie zone there is (and since he has a level 65 sk, i doubt money and knowledge of places to hunt will be hard to come by).  Kurns, lake of ill omen, dalnir, city of mist, sebilis, chardok, and howling stones are all no more than 3 zones from cabilis, and some of the best hunting pre-pop there is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ogath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ive got an Iksar monk, and bst, the only things i dont like about them is the XP penalty, and the damn monk nerf, <br />
<br />
i made a barb shaman, because.....well i wanted one, and i like barbs, <br />
no other reason. <br />
<br />
i dont care about bad faction, there are many ways around it now, and now more then ever!<br />
so if i so choose my shaman will soon have the same faction as my Monk =)<br />
except in a few places.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The often repeated advice of play what you like really is the best advice.  It’s certainly worth investigating each race to see what you’re getting yourself into, but if you like your character you’ll learn to deal with any shortcomings.  Personally, I don’t like evil faction.  Its just the way my psyche works.  Heck, even my gnome necromancer is trying to for good faction in every city in Norrath.  So I chose a Vah Shir shaman.  I like the look of the cats and I like their faction.  They don’t have some of the advantages that some of the “evil” races get, but I like playing my character and that’s what counts.  So if you like playing a lizard, go for it.  Just be careful around characters that like to bake. Lizard-on-a-stick is extremely tasty and the temptation may be too much for some bakers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>GroutRavenPaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If I could start over I'd probably go Iksar, but only for the look. The &quot;upgraded&quot; ogre model is go god awful...<br />

The innate AC is pretty nice too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>GeddarRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hmm... if I could start over I'd go with Ogre purely for the Sta and Non-stuntal from the front advantages.  Like Toktuk said though, race is not nearly as important as how you play your shaman... thats what will make you stand out in the end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">From a powergamer standpoint, ogres are the best race.  However, they are not the best race by much of a margin.  The #1 priority for picking a race is &quot;Does it look cool?&quot;  Pick something you aren't going to get tired of, because you're going to be looking at yourself a LOT.  For me, the only real choice was barbarian because I wouldn't have much luck cybering the female clerics if I was a troll or ogre.</div></div><hr />

Too bad that has never happened to me ever.<br />
<br />
I do get stunned a lot more against PoP mobs than I ever did in old world, but it still doesn't happen enough to warrant being ugly.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Jinheim nailed it.  Ogres are the best, at least at 60+, but the difference is not at all huge.  All the races work well, so if you have any kind of looks or RP preference, you should go with that.  You will be looking at that avatar a long time.<br />
<br />
As an aside, the best thing about an ogre's &quot;unstunnability&quot; isn't their immunity to stuns, it is the fact that when an ogre is bashed, they don't have to make an automatic channelling roll.  I get immediately interrupted on bashes semi-frequently, even from greenies, which is damn annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">If I had to do it again Orge would be my choice.<br />
<br />
But back before the spires and PoK faction was an issue.  My last main was a troll and I got tired of faction quests so when I started my shaman I picked barb cause they were the only light race to pick.</div></div><hr />

I am a 55 Iksar shaman and I can honestly say that I wouldn't be anything else.  Though I do admit that I would love an Ogre's sta, or to not see friends level past me due to 20% exp penalties- That's a lot of exp up to 55!!  But pre PoP and pre Luclin I really had fun trying to work my way around the world.  And yes we do look cool.  Just my 2cp.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Iksar is a fine shaman class and other then faction, easy to play on a budget.<br />
<br />
I think the best advice is to play what you like to drive around.  I played an iksar to 52 but deleted him when I quit the game.  Then I played a troll to mid 30s but I hated the new models.  Now I have an Ogre and he is just great.<br />
<br />
Play whatever race you think is the coolest.  The fact that iksar is rare on your server is nice if you ask me.   Lots of people playin Ogre now :(.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">My guess is the lack of sta is a huge negative as an iksar.  Especially till you start getting the real good gear.<br />

Thats true to a point, but in PoP at lvl 65, I definitely don't solo &quot;In teh face&quot;. I root rot. :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Very true grout but that really isnt an option till 64 when we finally get a dot that doesnt break root. (and yes i know epic also doesnt break root)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>GroutRavenPaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">No, I solo whenever I can't get a group, and the only 63-65 spell I have is Petrifying Earth (lvl 64 root). Use bane + ebolt + epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Barbarians..../snicker. That last stun while you try to heal or torpor yourself kills you when soloing every time.<br />
<br />
I rarely get stunned, and when I do it's most often because the mob was hitting me from behind. I've noticed the same with most of the tank classes I've played...the most frequent time they get stunned is when running back to camp with mob(s) chasing or trying to run for their life.<br />
<br />
I dont ever remember dying from a situation like you described, but I've died plenty of times (on many characters) trying to run for the zone and getting stunned from behind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>matumboo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Ogre is the best shaman race imo:<br />
<br />
No exp penalty<br />
Evil race but who cares really, we rarely go into cities, and faction doesnt matter in PoP<br />
Immunity to stun: this is a feat you CANNOT gain with any other items. And i dont agree Rathelon... We get stunned more than rarely when some mob hit us in front. (i am a barbarian) Especially when a mob charge you...<br />
You dont have the regen of iksars and trolls but who cares the regen is just crap and nearly useless when u get torpor / quiessence.<br />
Ultravision ! (blind barbarian suck)<br />
More stamina at the creation !<br />
<br />
Yes definately ogre is the best race for a shaman imo.<br />
<br />
Anyway the difference is not that great, so choose the race you like imo. The argument on JBB bracer for iksar is just crap. 9sec casting time (or something like that) for 263 dmg (if it lands!!) is just bull**** in PoP, even more in solo since it break root. (get the new PoP dots they are REALLY worth it for solo, no DD component). Just nuke or dot the mob, not like we run easely oom... I gained a JBB bracer, i sold it the next day.<br />

Just my 2cp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I serve Justice. <br />
<br />
I am heyokah, a spirit friend. I call down the plauges and poisens of the natural and unnatural to weaken and kill those that would do me harm. I can call up the winds and frost of my homelands to strike with a great and furious anger to those that oppress me and my brethern.  &lt;Grins in the moonlight showing teeth filed to points&gt;<br />
<br />
In Times of crisis I can heal the wounds of many. Quickly, with a blast of some green substance that the wigglefingers call clorophyll, or more slowly by calling on the spirits to take the wounded into a slowly healing trance. Or more recently with an incantation from a man named Tnarq. Fast and mighty it heals well. But is a drain upon me.<br />
<br />
I weild the Spear of fate, or a hammer crafted by my brothers to smite the foes of justice where I walk. I use a sheild crafted from the bones of some foul beast. I have a shirt of Fungus covering my chest, it speeds healing in some way that I do not understand. <br />
<br />
I have the skin of a dragon covering my legs. Protecting me better than it protected him. The skin of some long dead Grey beast on my arms. Hardened like steel yet black in color. <br />
<br />
I have silvery boots protecting my feet from the ravages of the world. Taken from some spider in the bowls of an icy maze. I have a veil made from the shroud of some undead beast. To allow me to commune with the spirit wolves that I call brother. <br />
<br />
On one Wrist a bracer made of Jaundeced bone. Cold to the touch even in the brightest flame. It strikes frost and fear into the hearts of many. The other rist is a blood red chain, taken from the accursed temple of the god of fear. I walked the place with my friends and carried the tribunal into the temple of fear itself. <br />
<br />
I have a medallion crafted of shadow itself. Bound by some majik that I do not posess. But it protects me the same. <br />
<br />
I have walked with dragons and gods, and slain them both. I have talked with giants and rulers long since dead. I have taken justice to all the corners of the world, showing that might does not always make right, and that the long arm of the tribunal carries a very large hammer. <br />
<br />
I am a shaman. Spirit walker, ghost talker. The rock upon which armies break. <br />
<br />
Halas is my home, and one day when I retire from my adventuring ways I will carve a dwelling upon the permafrost. And in the nights when the cold winds blow, when the howls of my brother wolves, the growls of the sister bears, split the night sky. People will feel safe. <br />
<br />
Because the silver hammer of Snoww will protect them. And Justice rules in the far north. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
/ooc Why they hell would a few point of regen match that. The game is about fun not a number crunching mathmatical problem. Walk hand in hand with the spirits of wolves and you will understand. <br />
<br />
Play what you find intresting. there is no best shaman Race. All have small advantages. and weaknesses.<br />

<br />
As for faction, I'm slowly ruining a lot of them :) Hunting in PoG and Felwithe means I lost a lot of elf faction but I don't lose any sleep over it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Hadd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">how come nobody talked about the sweet snare necklace yet ? <br />

side note : can't ogers quest the snare necklace too ? <br />
<br />
oh and barb = no ivandyr earring ( it made me cringe pre velious ..)<br />

i play a barb , its all look . if i were to powerplay i'd have done an oger . they are the most efficient stat/benefit wise ... but i don't have people making jokes about how smart i am every 2 days ....<br />
all about the look :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Matumboo, ogres do have an exp penalty. All large races do.<br />
<br />
And you may get stunned a lot, but I rarely do. And I get hit frequently by mobs, as any shaman probably does. Fact is, I dont get stunned that often when I'm facing them. Interupted, sure. Stunned, no.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Picking the race based on whether the JBB is useable or no is the stupidest thing I have ever heard. I never had JBB, I could buy it at any time if I wanted, but I see no need. Been OK so far and will be without it, there's more useful bracers out there what I would rather use.<br />
<br />
I chose barbarian because back then there were only 3 races to choose from: barbarian, ogre and troll. Last two choices were just too butt ugly for me to even try them, so I didn't. Also the general &quot;neutrality&quot; of the barbarians in most parts of the world suited me well. I didn't give a damn about the good faction, but I did like the fact that I could just pass an area without having to meddle with some pesky locals.<br />
<br />
Other then that, just play what you want. There is no &quot;uber&quot; race for the shaman and if I would play again, I'd probably be still a  barbarian shaman. Never had any issues with the &quot;stun and die&quot; as someone pointed out there. In most cases when I do get hit I still channel through, i.e. from 10 times I get smacked from front, I still channel through 7 times at least.</div></div><hr />
