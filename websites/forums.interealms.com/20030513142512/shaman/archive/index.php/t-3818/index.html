Only choice is to get another Tear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's been a long time since doing the epic myself, and I don't remember if you get faction when handing in the tear to Rak or not.  I'm assuming so, but either way, you should also be able to have a shaman that's completed their epic turn in a tear for you if they have one and carry on as normal.<br />
<br />
You don't get the True Spirit faction hit after killing Rak, right?  *wracks brain and fails miserably*<br />
<br />
Unless I'm misleading you somewhere here, this is another option, at least.  Maybe it wouldn't be too hard to find an epic'd shaman with a Tear sitting around in their bank.  I'd keep the Tear again if I ever came upon it and it was going to rot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sheymalra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You do take a faction hit when you turn the tear in.  If you did, but did not kill him, you can MQ it with another shaman that has the tear.  S/he will turn in the tear as you would have, then after the fight you loot the corpse.  I think that still works.  Been a while.<br />
