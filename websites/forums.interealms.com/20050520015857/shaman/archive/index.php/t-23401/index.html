<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Today I was fighting a necromancer in the bazaar arena. When he landed the fire resist set of DoTs on me (Pyro, Pyre, Night Fire etc) I attemped to self dispelling using cancel magic. Usually this would dispell the top slot spell (in this case where the dots were, i anticipated him only being able to land those so i left the top 3 buff slots open).<br />
<br />
Everytime I tried to self dispell it randomly dispelled some other buff but not the DoT.<br />
<br />
Are these changes recent? I'm certain Cancel Magic always used to remove buffs/detrimental spells with no counters in order. I'm not on a PvP server.<br />
<br />
Oh, if anyone cares the duel ended in a draw, not bad considering the Necro was from the top guild on my server atm :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">All the times I've been dispelled, it's taken something at random. Pretty much makes &quot;junk buffs&quot; a waste of effort</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It used to be like that but it was changed some time ago.  It now dispells buffs in random order.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The necro should have been able to kill you...<br />
<br />
Either youre a good or he was bad.<br />
<br />
Probably it was both :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">He had 3 of the fire resist dots running on me, pet (slowed) chaining the 1k nuke. Q + a few tnargs saw me through, with a drogmor up I pretty much stayed FM, going to 60m at worst. Lasted about 25mins I would have guessed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">lately, dispells seem to be a little buggy, but I'll tell you my experiences with them.<br />
<br />
Cancel Magic: This spell will(sometimes) take off 1 buff, and only 1. The buff it takes is random, and most of the time it takes nothing off at high levels. I believe that this dispell takes off counters and not actually buffs, but I can't in any way confirm this.<br />
<br />
Nullify Magic: In my experience, Nullify will always take the top buff and 1 random buff. It will also take off negative effects. Use this one in pvp on other people, it will take off buffs they have buried occasionally.<br />
<br />
Annul Magic: This is the best of our dispells for PvE and (defensive) PvP. This spell will always take off the first 2 buffs/debuffs that you have on. Use this when fighting necros/druids, or any other class that will debuff/dot you. I've noticed this spell being somewhat buggy as of late, with it skipping over the first buff/debuff that I have on and going to the second one. I think this has to do with the fact that EQ is not recognizing that I clicked my buff back on because I did it too fast. Again, I can't confirm it, but I believe that's where my problem is at.</div></div><hr />
