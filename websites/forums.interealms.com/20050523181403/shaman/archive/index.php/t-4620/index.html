<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Do we have any feedback from the Test server yet on how the 75% CH spell actually works?  I.e., which of the following is it:<br />
<br />
1.   Add 75% of player's max HP, capped at 1950<br />
<br />
2.  Add 75% of player's current HP, capped at 1950<br />
<br />
3.  Take player to 75% health, capped at 1950<br />
<br />
I am betting it is #3, for balancing reasons.  The heal would never take the recipient over 75%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">from that long post, it clearly a 1950hp heal spell but cannot heal pass 75% hp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">How about different feedback from Test...<br />
<br />
Is anyone actually using it? ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">So considering I have around 4k hp on raids/groups with aego that leaves me with ~3000 &quot;healable&quot; hp.  <br />
<br />
Heals on the CH in grouping seem to go in at 20% which is about 800 hp leaving ~2200 hp to be healed.  which is in itself over the heal limit. <br />
<br />
So essentially we have a heal we need to use at about 25% with ~4000hp to be used effectively.  That leaves us of course 1.25 bubbles down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I heard there was a 2 minute recast, anybody got a confirmation?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">hm, or does it heal a player to 75% OR 1950 hp if recipient already has 75%+ hp? i just started thinking :) nah, that would be too good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">This line says it all...<br />
<br />
08-21 05:05 Changed Slot 1 from &quot;Unknown #147 (100/50/1000)&quot; to &quot;Increase Hitpoints by 75% (1950 max)&quot;<br />
<br />
Increases Hitpoints to 75% with a max of 1950 hp healed.  So in my last example if the spell fizzled twice and the heal was delayed till 10% (400hp) that would leave the person at ~60% (2350hp).<br />
<br />
Edit.  That is my interpritation.  Any test people can correct me if I am wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">So Verant is trying to do something about how CH affected EVERYTHINNG or is this just some freak spell that they are adding to the very very underpowered clerics?<br />
<br />
Or even better is it a shaman/druid spell that is supposed to drop from the same sources as Malo/Torpor/Pox/VoB? Go go MB!<br />
<br />
Edit: If what Hrothgar quotes is true then the only logic result of this spell would be if you had 1000 left at the time of the heal &quot;hitting&quot; you it would heal 750 hps . Anything else would be silly but since its VI I'm not taking any bets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The line from Lucy still seems vague to me.  Increase HP &quot;by 75%&quot; of what?  Or is it &quot;to 75%&quot;?<br />
<br />
Just wondering if we have anybody who has tried it on test to see that you cant get over 75% health with this spell, regardless of when you cast it.  That observation would rule out #1 and #2 of my original post.<br />
<br />
If it is #3, then the implication for use on yourself with canni would be making it a priority to get your self-buffed HP well over 2600 by level 54.  2600x75%=1950, so you would get full efficiency if you cast at almost zero HP, which is not so safe on a 10 sec cast, so you want to be well over 2600 by then.<br />
<br />
This will be very interesting for self mana regen if it goes live.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think it sounds like #2. The other two options require far less skill (exactly like CH!). I really REALLY think VI needs to try to implement more skill required and not just add to mobs hitpoints/regen or something lame like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">CH doesn't work on percentages, CH heals 10,000 hp, flat out. That's why you see critical CH's for 21,000 instead of 200%. And why when Vox CH's, her hp goes up to about half, rather than full.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jonaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The effect is &quot;Increase Hitpoints by 75% (1950 max)&quot;. That means (by logic) that if you're at 25% hp it works as a complete heal but it won't heal more then 1950 hp.<br />
Otherwise it would be &quot;Increase Hitpoints TO 75%&quot;.<br />
<br />
Unless someone from test server can disprove that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I will put pp on it being 75% of current max hp, i.e. if I was at 500hp and my max was 2k then it would heal me to 2k.  The other definitions just dont really make sense.  It would be reasonable to wait until someone has got to 25% of their hp to cast a heal on em.  If it only healed you to 75% full health then to get maximum efficiency you would have to try and time it so that you hit em with the heal as they were about to go unconcious.  If it healed 75% of your current hp then if you got a heal in when they were at 100 hp you would only heal 75hp.  I dont think even verant would be crap enough to implement either of those 2 options.  <br />
<br />
In fact, thinking about it, they already have a percentage heal in there - Mend, which works as I would expect our heal to work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ghanimaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">This is not bandaging here. Do you know how useless a heal that would put you at 75% would be? <br />
<br />
It will heal either 75% of your max hps (i.e. a character with 1000 hps would get healed for 750 every time) with 1950hps being the maximum it can heal.<br />
<br />
Reading for comprehension....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I think Kronenburg and Ghanimaa are right - a heal that took you to 75% of your max would be silly - I always read the description as meaning heal BY 75% of your max HP or 1950, whichever is less.<br />
<br />
But, we won't know for sure until someone from test tells us! Come on, testers! :)</div></div><hr />

New 75% CH spells for Druid and Shaman are on Test!<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Druids and shamans have a new heal spell on test.<br />
<br />
Quote:<br />
<br />
A slightly scaled down version of Complete Heal is being tested for Druids &amp; Shamen. The spell is currently set at Level 54.<br />
<br />
This spell has been very clearly marked as Test Only however and may not go live at all.<br />

This is what I am hearing...if so I, personally, am annoyed Druids would gain a better ability to heal than Shaman.  If they balance us by adding a new DoT or DD, I might not be so annoyed but this is an extreem difference in the amount of HP's that the new CH spells can cure.  We should get the same new healing spells as Druids IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Hiho<br />
<br />
I can honestly tell you that all the clerics that I have met  since I am lvl 50 NEVER got any problems to get into groups. It is more the way that they complain about getting too many tells to join a XP group and they have to chose constantly.<br />
<br />
How often did I zone into Velks (crappy zone, I know, but sometimes I just want stupid XP grind in UD/LD/US) and the interesting camps where looking for a cleric. They all kept the last spot open for a cleric to arrive. I cannot really understand why (I can fill the spot of a cleric in this easy zone anytime).<br />
<br />
Maybe now is the time that we will see clerics going LFG, if those downsized CHs make it to the real servers.<br />
<br />
How many times did you have to stop raiding (for example HoT .. just some easier raids, not stuff that cries for CCH) because you had no cleric available? We had those times. Now we could at least try to go on.<br />
<br />
Let the peeps on Test Server try it, let us hope that Verant listens to them and does some fine tuning in the end. Hopefully the end product will please all classes.<br />
<br />
So long<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I hope you are right that it is #1 -- 75% of max HP, because that would make it heal to full health in most situations if used early enough.  <br />
<br />
But I don't think it would be useless or crazy to have a heal that takes you to 75% of full health.  It would allow the shaman to  heal a 4000 HP tank at 25% and bring him to 75% health--a lot better than I can do with Superior Heal.  Losing that last 25% would keep us forever inferior to true CH'ing clerics.<br />
<br />
C'mon testers--let us know the truth about this spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>howjan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">To comment on the effects of this spell in anyway is totally premature at this point.  It's readily avalible on a vendor by the bazaar on the nexus side for 6+pp, along with a few other spells.<br />
<br />
Give the devs some time to iron out the kinks and see how the spell will effect the game.  Right now on test avatar doesn't stack with focus, but I don't see an uprising about that going live.  (yes it's a bug, relax)</div></div><hr />

Maybe in Sebilis. :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
Increase HP by X% means one thing: It looks at your current maximum HP, knocks off 25%, and if that number is less than or equal to 1950/2925, it heals you for that amount; if that number is more, it heals you for 1950/2925.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>snow79</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I play on test, have a 60 shaman there with no torpor/malo. Today when i logged on there was a message about new shaman spells in nexus so I went up and found Spell:CH shaman, level 54 to use. <br />
<br />
First impression, slow cast, massive heal and soo much better than chloroblast. I dont have torpor yet so i cant really compare.<br />
<br />
The spell will heal 1950 hp max or 75% of the targets hp, whichever is greatest. Mana cost was 400 and cast time 10 sec, no recast delay.<br />
<br />
My rogue didnt have enough hps to get the full 1950 so...<br />
[Fri Aug 23 17:52:55 2002] You have been healed for 1761 points of damage.<br />
[Fri Aug 23 17:52:55 2002] This spell is a test spell and may not go live!<br />
<br />
So far i like it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">So Snow, you were able to heal your rogue to full health?  If so, then it must be #1 not #3 in my original post.<br />
<br />
BTW, I assume you meant 75% of targets max HP or 1950, whichever is less.<br />
<br />
Thanks for reporting in from Test!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Hmm yah non &quot;test&quot; spells on Test server have to be really tuff to get.  Torpor and Malo especially.  <br />
Ah well thanks for the input snow79.  <br />
At least that cleared it up for some of us who are reading comprehension challenged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Snow:<br />
<br />
Can you buff your HPs, canna down a ways &amp; see what kind of results you get on yourself?   You should easily be above the 1950 hps :)<br />
<br />
Taladaen</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>snow79</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I need over 2600 hp buffed and be at lower health than 26 percent to get the full 1950 heal out.<br />
<br />
If I canni down to 1 percent health and cast heal, it will only heal up to 76 percent. As long as i have over 24 percent health it will count as a complete heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">So it is confirmed from Test we could use this spell like a real CH to full health, if applied soon enough.  I think the following is interesting--how far you can let your party member drop in HP and still use this spell as a CH:<br />
<br />
Target /         Spell   /        % of Full Health<br />
Max     /         Max    /        at which to land<br />
HP       /         Heal   /        for CH effect<br />
<br />
1500            1125               25% (375HP left)<br />
2000            1500               25% (500HP left)<br />
2600            1950               25% (650HP left)<br />
3000            1950               35% (1050HP left)<br />
4000            1950               51% (2050HP left)<br />
6000            1950               68% (4050HP left)<br />
<br />
If you waited until target health was at or below these figures, you would get full efficiency from the spell for that particular target.  This is pretty close to a full fledged CH for healing folks with 2600 HP or less!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I've said this elsewhere, but could someone please explain why the druid heal will be greater than the shaman heal?<br />
<br />
I thought we were equal on the healing totem pole. We get SH and GH at the same levels. We both are cleric backups. So why do the druids get a greater heal than shamans? Aren't shamans witch-doctors? Druids just run naked through the forest... <br />
<br />
Sigh.<br />
<br />
I'd rather see this not go live at all. Poor, poor, clerics. They have a hard time soloing, they don't stack in xp groups, they have some totally obnoxious levels where druids or shammy can replace them for healing until about mid-40's... and now a druid can replace them at 54. <br />
<br />
Poor, poor clerics.</div></div><hr />

I've said this elsewhere, but could someone please explain why the druid heal will be greater than the shaman heal?<br />
<br />
Because druids can't cast Torpor. Oh and we are also superior to them in many other ways.<br />
<br />
Poor, poor clerics. <br />
<br />
*blank stare*<br />
<br />
Riiiiiiiight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Well, druids get group regen/chloroplast, too.  In fact, we don't get it at all until Regrowth of Dah Khura.   So they're a tad ahead of us on the heal-o-meter already.<br />
<br />
Ever seen a cleric solo in a place full of undead?  They're in their element there.  Besides, if they get their updated Yaulp and improved hammer spells, they're gonna be nothing short of awesome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Comparing regen with instant heals is like comparing a hand-push grass cutter and an &quot;Ultimate3000 Riding Mower&quot; on a 10 acre grass land.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Because we have better mana regen capabilities than they do. So even with only a 2k heal, we can still heal better than them. <br />
<br />
Plus we have slow was is an indirect heal....<br />
Plus giving us a 3k heal for 400 mana would actually increase our mana regen capabilites, because it would have a better ratio than torpor.<br />
<br />
Does that answer your question?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>mieky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">or perhaps they are just seeing the effects of both spells at the same time, since if both spells were available to both classes only the superior would be used.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Visiting_Cleric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Ever seen a cleric solo in a place full of undead? They're in their element there.<br />
<br />
sorry for going off topic here, but have you ever seen a cleric solo in a place full of undead? i sure did and it was pathetic.<br />
<br />
for one there is no zone with just undead which makes IvU not so good (lguk has live frogs, grey has rockfiends,ME has a bunch of non undead crap, etc). when i solo in the grey for example, i try and pull and i have rockfeinds and xakra sei's (unrootable) spawn on me and force me to zone. xakra sei's despawn but rockfiends perma camp the place they last had aggro and i can't zone back in.<br />
<br />
now lets say i do  pull a mob, soloing efficiently with root/rot takes awhile seeing that my best dot at 60 is 750, when them ob is dead I used maybe 1.5-2 bubs of mana. this is the best a cleric can do solo and the light blues plus the non undead mobs spawning on me really slow down exp. if i nuke, 325 mana per nuke and I go oom by the time it's dead.<br />
<br />
<br />
again i'm sorry for going off topic.</div></div><hr />
