<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Diashan Malkier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ive seen countless ornate patterns and molds for plate silk and leather, (2 plate BPs dropped off a BoT minni just today) but not once have i seen chain drop, the one time i got close was when i decided to log before a PoTactics minni, and chain pants dropped.<br />
  <br />
  Is there a noticable lower drop ratio on chain or am I just unlucky?<br />
<br />
Are elemental chain drops more common than ornate chain?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Anything other then bp / legs is going to be rare as hell. Rare drops off uncommon to rare spawns = dam rare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Chain seems to be the most frequently sold on the nameless.  I've seen no less than 15 ornate chain bp's sell in the bazaar, and a few pairs of legs.  I've yet to see any plate armor there, it's rare as hell.  Silk bp's seem pretty common, but nothing else, and leather gloves + bp's are up often enough too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The breastplate drops 1 in 3 from The Diaku Overseer in tactics.<br />
<br />
<br />
Straightforward mob just put 1 tank on him and used range damage for he AE rampages for 1700 (and hits for that too). Mitigatable slow, need 2 clerics and about 2 groups... or 1 groupable with a chanter.<br />
<br />
<br />
In alot of Overseer kills we have maybe 5 or more BP's, I got mine on the 4th kill or so but i understand they drop 1 in 3 to 1 in 5. (forgot to include it was the second bp dropped)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Chain Pants drop off the east wing named in BoT. WIth the change they are very rare but still do drop.<br />
<br />
<br />
Personally I think it is a waste of time trying to hunt for ornate other than the BP, as it is disgustingly rare. You might try hunting for some easier to find things like Tae Ew e.t.c. shrug but ornate is very rare :(<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh and seen the bracer off Ellif Whitewhind i believe they drop off any level 64 named in BOT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chikarsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The Chain BPs and legs are indeed the easiest pieces to get, as odd as that is. I've gotten the gloves and boots as well, and am still trying to get the bracer and arms... not even sure if there is a hat, much less where it'd drop. I've sent /feedback about this, I don't think it's overly balanced to get 2x Chain BPs every 24hrs and not even see a bracer or arm pattern in over a month. Hopefully they upgrade or fix the boots too soon, they suck badly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kytra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">PoP seems to be opposite ToV. BPs and Legs are common. The small pieces are rare. In fact, after a LOT of time in BoT and such, I have only gotten one non-BP/Legs piece. A bracer...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Diashan Malkier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">so it seems ornate chain do be dropping on other servers, be it Bps or bracers. on Karana with all the mobs we gank ive seen none of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm waitin for elemental myself.  Not interested in wasting DKP/pp on Ornate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Alot of the ornate seems kinda lame compared to some NToV/Ssra/PoP boss loots ( lower tier bosses )<br />
<br />
Seems better suited to gear folks up that havent been around as long, skipped things like ST/NToV...not bad but not that great really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I generally agree with Lend, but the boots would be pretty nice if they worked.  Stats roughly comparable to vindi but mana preservation 4 is a pretty useful focus effect that would make them a worthwhile upgrade for most non-VT shamans, especially seeing that you can get ornate patterns in one group.  Sadly, the focus is broken and is currently effect:doesnothingwhatsoever.  /rude VI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Diashan Malkier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'm waitin for elemental myself.  Not interested in wasting DKP/pp on Ornate.<br />

Ornate chain does not count as loot in our current loot system, it has become the new standard armour, replacing Kael.<br />
<br />
Only peices i would use would be the bracer and legs, but it would be nice to see our newer shaman get some nice upgrades with all the peices.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Chikarsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Just a note here: Ornate Chain is by *far* the most common Ornate available. The BPs especially are insanely common; my guess is that the loot table for the mob that drops them is currently broken/unbalanced. Hopefully it'll get a revamp.<br />
<br />
My guild (Minions of Kaer Baar) on Tarew does not assign points to any Ornate pieces, I don't see why a guild would bother to do so given the minimum number of people needed to obtain any piece of Ornate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Rizlona dropped ornate plate legs today so i assume another mini in srt drops ornate chain legs also.</div></div><hr />
