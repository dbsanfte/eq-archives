<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Only just been getting into LDoN after a long break.<br />
<br />
Last night's group was fun:<br />
2 necros, 1 wizard, 1 war, 1 bard, me.<br />
<br />
Finished a hard Mistmore LDoN with about 10 mins to go. No deaths. Had 1 named.<br />
<br />
We alternated kiting and tanking in the face.<br />
<br />
Group before was a warm up:<br />
1 necro, 2 wizards, me<br />
<br />
Finished an easy Mistmore with 40 mins on the clock.<br />
<br />
Try the unexpected. Sometimes it works!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">&quot;Hardest&quot; Hard Ldon i think I've ever done was setup somewhat like this:<br />
<br />
Warrior<br />
Enchanter<br />
Bard<br />
Beastlord<br />
Rogue<br />
Me<br />
<br />
I've healed alot in normal ldon's or for exp groups, but this was really a new tough role for me. Most of the time the bard got singles, but there was a few times he was lazy and pulled a few. I don't think I was ever above 15m the entire adventure. I was praying for CanniV and spam clicking it hoping for it to refresh, which mashing CanniIV as quick as it would refresh.<br />
<br />
It was pretty exciting and probably one of the more difficult things I have done in EQ, but we won in the end and everyone was happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>sudamor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I generally group with a Mage and Necro to grind out hard modes in both EC and EF.  We kite whenever possible; however, when we run into a mob that is not snareable we pull out the Earth Elemental pet to tank and I heal.  Great group and we've only lost a handful of times.<br />
<br />
Also, we've found that the drop rate seems to be better when we only have a group of three.  When adding a fourth (e.g., another Necro) the drop rate became almost unbeatable.<br />
