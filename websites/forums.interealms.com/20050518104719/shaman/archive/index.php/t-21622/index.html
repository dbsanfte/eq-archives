<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Being the only person on the server.  Or any server for that matter.<br />
<br />
Happened to me this morning.  Read the patch message here, and decided that I really didnt want to lose the ability to use EQW (new login screws with it) so, I didnt patch.<br />
<br />
But I was still able to log in.  And when I logged in, I was the only person on the server.  It was just after 9AM, so I figured that I must be one of the lucky few to get in early and beat the log in server jam.  So went to the bank and unloaded some crap, and did a few tradeskills while I waited for a few more people to show up in the hopes of getting an adventure.<br />
<br />
But after 45 minutes and no one else showing up, I began to get curious.  I mean, its all well and good to be able to run around PoK without 200 mindless /ooc's running through my chat window but to be utterly and totally alone on the server gets old quick.<br />
<br />
So I logged out and tried another server that I have some characters on.  And I was alone there to.  All told I tried 21 servers, and every time I was the only person there.  Was genuinely an odd experience.<br />
<br />
But I decided to make the best of it.  I ran over to droga and hit the king (hello CHoS) and a few other named that I could find up (not great drops, but good tribute stuff), but even that got boring.  I had now been logged in for about 2 hours, and was really starting to get bored.<br />
<br />
Just as I was tossing the stuff in the bank and getting ready to camp, I got a tell from GM Yinpus.  He(she?) asked if I could log out, because the server was not availible for play.  When I asked how I was able to get in if it wasnt supposed to be availible, GMYinpus said that I just must have been lucky.  I told him(her) that I had not patched and (s)he said that could have been it, but I still should not have gotten past the log in screen, as the servers shouldnt have been allowing anyone on yet.<br />
<br />
An odd experience, to be sure.  I did manage to make some plat from it via drops.  Im wondering if they will still be there when I log in next.  /shrug  With all the rollbacks my server has had in the last week or so (6 that I can remember) Im not holding my breath, but time will tell.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">How are you logging in?  There's a special login server that GMs can use and a method to change your login in your EQ folder to use that server instead of the normal ones ... <br />
<br />
It will let you log in even when the primary login server is down or offline.  However, usually GMs aren't friendly with players caught using the GM login server.  Normally it's transparent and can let you (bypass the rush), but it can get you noticed fast if you're the only person there.</div></div><hr />

I didnt do anything special.  The important thing is that I didnt patch.  I havent patched my EQ files since early May (May 12?)  So I dont have the new Log-in interface which seems to be the cause of some peoples log in problems.<br />
<br />
The GM I spoke to didnt seem upset or cross in any way; (s)he said (s)he was suprised to see someone online when no one else had been getting in (indeed, before they let the log in server accept players).  I made it clear that I wasnt doing anything I shouldn't have been; I was just using an older version of the EQmain.dll file (because I hadnt patched).  I was told I had nothing to worry about, but had to exit the server.  (S)He also said I would probably have to patch later this afternoon to be able to play.</div></div><hr />

How do you log in without patching?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You can bypass the patch server by clicking on the eqgame.exe file instead of the everquest.exe file.  It will send you straight to the login server instead of the patch server.  This is how people like me have been still able to use EQW this past week.  There is also a way to redo the two files that were changed with the advent of the the new login page but that is explained in another thread here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Makelike</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Change the targeted file on your EQ shortcut from &quot;C:\Blah\BlahEverquest.exe&quot; to &quot;C:\Blah\Blah\eqgame.exe&quot; patchme. You can do this simply by right clicking on the shortcut and choosing properties. Works like a charm and cuts out on the sitting around waiting for the patch server to respond telling your system it doesnt have any new files.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Lol that's some funny stuff Thor :)<br />
<br />
Once, back when test server was first released, and you could do a /who all count, I was once the only person on the entire server during a time when it was up.  It was very eerie, and only lasted about 4 or 5 minutes, then there were THREE people!<br />
<br />
Lol think it's funny that you were able to get in though :) did you hear the twilight zone music in yer head?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The reason you could login was because you didn't patch the login stuff. EQHOST.txt now points to a different IP address, and I bet they forgot to stop the old one and only stopped the new one.</div></div><hr />

Closest I ever came was WAY WAY back on March 31, 1999, the night Bertoxx opened. I was sitting in chat, watching the messages, and the INSTANT they scrolled &quot;Bertoxx is now available&quot; I went and created my guy ASAP. I hit the ground in G Fay with my new level 1 HIE PAL, and typed /w all and got &quot;There are 12 players in all of Everquest&quot;. I then did /w and ther was 1 other in G Fay, and by the time I typed /w all again, there were almsot 200 on the server, heh. <br />
<br />
I often wonder if any of those other 11 people that &quot;beat&quot; me onto Bert still play.</div></div><hr />

I only stayed on a for about 15 min though and there were not any npc's up either.  I just ran around Thurg a bit and then out into GD to see if any spawns were up.  Velks was also empty.  Logged at the Velks zone thinking I was bugged and then couldnt get back in.  /shrug.  I felt like the Omega man. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Balthag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I've had this happen multiple times, it's my understanding that sometimes they accidentally enable the login server, before all the servers are up, so there's a small window when you can log on.<br />
And yes, it's creepy, but i got my regal band of balthezid because of it :).</div></div><hr />

There are 4 players in Everquest.<br />

Was absolutely crazy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>MrKnowItAll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I think im missing something, whats the use of EQwindow anymore ?<br />
EQ has long ago been able to be played in a window without a 3rd party program. Just alt-tab and you can surf or whatever you want to do that you used to be able to do with EQW.<br />
<br />
Hell ya can even log in 2 accounts on the same comp no problem, so what use is EQW anymore ? Or does it just do a better and smoother job of sharing the resources between the 2 accounts ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">EQ has never been able to share computer rescources.  For some unkown reason EQ will use as many compute cycles on your PC as you let it.  Its horribly inefficient in its use of memory and CPU time.  Its a hog.<br />
<br />
EQW is much more efficient than the EQ windowed mode.  And, when using EQW in conjunction with EQPlayNice EQPLayNice (http://teqim.sourceforge.net/?p=eqplaynice) link ) EQ uses only about 25-30% of my PC's rescources.  And thats the same if Im running one instance of EQ or 3.  When I get 4 or more EQ instances running my machine gets really bogged down, but Ive never been able to run more than 4 characters at a time and do it well.<br />
<br />
I use EQW even when Im only running one character.  To me, its just quicker and more efficient.  WHy should I have to patch every single time I log in?  IF there havent been any patches for 2 weeks, why do I still need to see if I have all the current files?  I know I do. and EQW allows me o bypass that wasted time.  Its invuable to me when I'm tradeskilling, because I have a horrible memmory for recipies.  /shrug<br />
<br />
If I couldnt play with EQW, Id be very upset.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I use EQW to play with 2 accounts primarily because of the black screen issues that EQ has. Sometimes when you ALT - TAB between windows with EQ alone a video reset is not sent, or not sent correctly, resulting in a black screen. One the Shaman I can deal with this if I am just going to him for a heal with keyboard commands. But you do need to see when the mob is running so you can root him before his friends crash the party.  :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">EQW is also much better.. because you can release the mouse before you zone, and you can do other things.. plus you dont have to unrelease the mouse whenever you want to use a window of eq.. can just click between them at will.. dont even need to unrelease it to play.. just use the keyboard</div></div><hr />

single player EQ.. just create a local server :P <br />
<br />
Q1) Would I get in trouble for using this? (Don't know how * they * would find out - but you're not really paranoid if people are really after you.)<br />
<br />
Q2) Could I give or place items on a particular MOB for my toon to whack? (Shroud of Longevity on an Orc Pawn?)<br />
<br />
Q3) Could I give myself AA's?<br />
<br />
Q4) Since it's &quot;local&quot; could my buddy use his computer, wire into mine and we both play?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">1- really not sure.. but if youve payed for all your expansions like me.. the only thing they could bust would be the servers.. but since the servers dont actually distribute sony's files (with the exception of a few) i doubt they can do anything about it.. either that or it just isnt worth it to go after them<br />
<br />
2- you can. but would be easier to just summon the items to your cursor (personally i find using #level and #summonitem to be boring after the first 5 minutes.. but its interesting to see how much hp you can have unbuffed :p)<br />
<br />
3- not unless you use an earlier version of the server (which would also require an earlier patch of live.. which is hard to get.. if you can get it at all).. because GoD broke AAs after a certain version, they cant seem to get enough people to packetsniff when buying AAs.. so i think its going to be broken for a long time.. i believe its 5.4 that still works with AAs, i can check though<br />
<br />
4- i know you CAN do it.. since i dont use eqemu for local, i use ethernalquest.. since it doesnt require you to mess around with mysql like eqemu does (but ethernalquest isnt compatible with live.. since the author is taking a vacation).. but i honestly dont know how.. youd have to read FAQs.. im sure its not hard to deal with mysql.. but i dont feel like using it when i dont have to lol<br />
<br />
all in all its not perfect.. but i really like the server ive been playing on lately.. its called winter's roar.. it has AAs.. and chainmail is uber :p its completely custom.. there are very very very few items that have the same name as live.. and i doubt many of them have the same stats.. there are no &quot;godlike&quot; items.. i think the uber tanks on the server have maybe 6-7k hp fully raid buffed, and the best thing is that ive yet to see a twink! lol.. its fun to group with a tank thats using leather pants.. chainmail bp.. cloth veil (im only level 15.. lol, but its pretty hard to level.. maybe i just have the wrong class) apparently just before i came on the server it was too easy to level.. so they tweaked it too far.. then its going to back to too easy.. and so on and so on</div></div><hr />
