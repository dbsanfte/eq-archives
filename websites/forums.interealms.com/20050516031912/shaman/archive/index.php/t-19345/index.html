<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shadrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I currently 3-box with a mage/enchanter/cleric, and am planning on swapping the cleric with my 59 shaman.  Right now, I don't even both slowing the mobs with my enchanter.  He just can't take the hits, and my mage earth pet holds up well enough that I don't need to bother.  But when I swap out the cleric with my shaman, my healing ability goes downhill.  I'm thinking I may need to start slowing mobs to keep my pets alive.  I wouldn't think of playing my shaman without slowing right off the bat - it's just kind of instinct at this point.<br />
<br />
So I have a few major questions, for anyone who's got experience with this type of setup.  <br />
<br />
First, will my shaman pull agro every time when he slows?  My earth pet does ok holding agro, but I can pull it if I nuke too quickly.  And nukes don't generate any kind of agro like slows (I used to 3-box my shaman with a warrior and druid, and pulled agro all the time when I slowed).  So, is shaman slow eliminated as an option when using a mage earth or air pet as a tank?  My shaman can take a hit or two, but it just doesn't make sense to have him tanking every mob for half the fight.  So if I can't slow until the fight's half over, or can't slow at all, it's not going to work so well.<br />
<br />
Second, if I summon my pet, will that pet pull agro because he's got to get closer to the mob than my mage pet?  I've heard that's the case, and that dogdog will end up tanking even with a rooting earth pet or stunning air pet.  If that's the case, then there goes one of my dps options.  Boo hiss.<br />
<br />
Third, is it true that stamina buffs on pets don't increase hp totals?  I've always thrown stamina buffs on my dogdog, just assuming it helped out.  But I heard recently that it doesn't do anything.  <br />
<br />
Fourth, has anyone found it to be worthwhile to summon a set of the phantom plate for dogdog?  I always give it to my mage pet, but I've heard some speculation that the armor doesn't do any good for shaman pets.  I will definately summon the elemental shoulder item and daggers, for the resists.  My mage is only level 52, so that's it for good pet toys.<br />
<br />
Overall, I guess I'm looking for advice from shamans who've grouped (or better yet 3-boxed) a mage/shaman/enchanter.  I'll be mostly doing dungeon crawls like Chardok, Nurga, Sebillis, etc., or 3-boxing LDoNs.  So I'll pull with the enchanter almost exclusively.  In that scenario, what tactics can I use to maximize my shaman's effectiveness without taking too much agro and winding up as the tank?  If I can't slow, and can't use my pet, I'll be nothing but a 3rd-rate necro throwing in DOTs.  And, come to think of it, since DOTs generate such stupid amounts of agro, I won't even be able to pull that off.  <br />
<br />
Or, would I be better off sticking with mage/enchanter/cleric, and saving the shaman for when I dust off my shadowknight, warrior, or monk?<br />
<br />
Thanks all.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Geoid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I 2-box a Shm/Mag frequently so I can address some of these points.<br />
<br />
1.  Use the earth pet.  With the earth pet I can pull with slow and DoT once mob is in camp while rarely having to worry about aggro.  With the air pet aggro is a pain and usually I wind up running in circles waiting for stun to land and the pet to gain aggro.  Air pet is way too unreliable, best to go with earth pet.<br />
<br />
2.  Shm pet almost always gets aggro.  I have tried shrinking Mag pet while growing Shm pet and vice versa, turning Shm pet taunt off, talking to him sternly, etc and nothing has worked.  Lately I don't even use the Shm pet because he drains too much mana keeping him healed and his DPS stinks.<br />
<br />
3.  When I cast Stamina buffs on PCs their HP bar moves, the same does not happen when I cast Stamina buffs on pets.  The only bit of evidence I have that Stamina makes a difference on pets is that the Mag summoned girdles have +sta.  I think that is shaky evidence though.<br />
<br />
4.  I only give the Shm pet two summoned weaps, muzzle and a girdle.  At a minimum give him two weapons.  I wouldn't bother with the armor as his mitigation/avoidance is so bad that it doesn't seem to help.<br />
<br />
5.  I can slow, DoT and heal the Mag pet without gaining aggro.  If I'm really laying on the DoTs I may get aggro on a root break, just gotta wait a few seconds for root to stick again.<br />
<br />
IMO use the Shm to slow, DoT and heal if you are not charming with the Enc.  If you are charming use the Clr because charmed pets really need CH.<br />
<br />
Also realize that a Shm requires a lot of attention to be most effective.  Mana regen is active on a Shm not passive as it is on a Clr.  I'm not sure how you use your Enc other than pulling, but it seems like that setup would have 2 high attention toons in the Shm and Enc.  So if you can't give the Shm enough attention then the Shm and Enc overlap too much and the Clr is a better option.<br />
<br />
Or totally off-topic you could 3-box a Enchanter, Cleric and Ranger and be a charming machine.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>hukt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I duo mage/shammy all the time.<br />
<br />
I use air,epic or earth pet and never have much of problem with aggro transfer to shaman except when I try to slow the mob on inc and not after pet is initially send in on mob. (most of time initially pets cast gaining large aggro). The only other time I get aggro is when I drop 2-3 dots on a mob right off the bat. Do not use water on this though as I think it has harder time gaining aggro. I do always ahve the upper level pet weapons which may affect things to some extent.<br />
<br />
My shaman pet (L61 pet) never gets aggro unless I am using earth pet which then it is proximity problem and not level or anything just dog is closer to mob. With air and epic I never have had a dog die or get hurt that I remember.<br />
<br />
<br />
I usually pass on stamina since have never seen the effects of it.<br />
<br />
The only items I give to dogdog are the 60+ weapons and the girdle for more dex.<br />
<br />
<br />
I camp locations though so don't move much so no info there. But I always slow with may shaman as soon as mob is in camp and pet on it and no problems I cna think of. Actually one if you get two resists if chain casting then my shaman gets aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm going to repeat some of what's said above, and contradict other parts.<br />
<br />
I spent a few months doing little other than duoing with a mage, and here's what we learned.<br />
<br />
Earth pet will always result in dogdog getting root-proximity aggro.  You don't want to use the earth pet.<br />
<br />
Air pet - this pet is just great for so many reasons.  He's able to keep aggro from me and the dog unless I really let loose.  We found a pretty reliable way to make sure I didn't end up tanking too often.  Slow, of course, gets aggro - now, whether or not the air pet proc's or casts his stun, I can shed that aggro the moment the mage lands a nuke.  So, pull with chanter, mage sic's pet, shaman slows, and mage nukes as soon thereafter as he can.  As soon as that nuke landed, I was able to step away from the mob, who focused on the air pet.  It seems that just putting the mage directly on the hate list is enough to get him to stop following me around.<br />
<br />
Don't forget, also, that the stuns from that pet are going to significantly lower the DPS of the mob.  My shaman spends a lot of time being slower and healer for dungeons - and the difference an air pet makes is phenomenal.<br />
<br />
Pet preparation - both pets get 2 weapons, focus, and diaku - more dex = more proc's.  (I would just infusion the dog instead of focus, because nothing will make him tank well - but since focus is up, I just give him that).  Both pets also get muzzle and belt.  Stamina buffs do nothing.<br />
<br />
Oh, and if your mage doesn't have the focus item from Takish - get that ASAP.  The regen on the pet with that thing is ridiculous.  Especially when he's out of combat.<br />
<br />
edit:  I've never found that giving dogdog armor makes a ton of difference, but I believe it DOES make a difference.  The mage would toss armor on the dog if he thought the situation was risky enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If your mage is 52 and shaman is 59, depending upon what you are fighting it is likely the shaman slow will dominate on the aggro side.<br />
<br />
But, if you are fighting in Nurga, Seb and similar dungeons - so what. These are 59 shaman solo areas. Unless you are very under-geared, getting aggro will be a minor issue. Frankly, you mitigate incoming melee damage lots better than a 52 mage pet (or lower depending upon which pet) and Rover. Slow, dot if you want and tank. If you need to heal then root, step back, heal.<br />
<br />
If you fighting mobs that are more in your level and high to the 52 mage, expect aggro and lots of heal time as you will have to slow to keep mage pet alive and aggro from it.</div></div><hr />
