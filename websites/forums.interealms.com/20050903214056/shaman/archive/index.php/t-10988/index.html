<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The trainers for each respective classes armor is who you turn it into.  <br />
<br />
Iskars have to turn in thier armor to the someone else iirc.<br />
<br />
You CAN turn in other classes armor if you go to that classes trainer.<br />
<br />
Obviously these trainers are all in PoK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sshiverr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The npc's that take iksar planar armor is on the second floor of oneof the buildings on the evil side.  Not sure what the building is but its not the one that connects to the library.  You have to go up a ramp that raps around the outside of the building.  You need to make sure you go by the npc's name and not the text they give you when you hail them because the last time i was there the shaman npc asked for the sk armor even though he took the shaman armor.</div></div><hr />
