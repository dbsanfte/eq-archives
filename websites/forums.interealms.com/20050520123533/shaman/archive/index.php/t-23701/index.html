Did anyone buy the retail version and get the object which is supposed to provide a particle effect around the person? <br />
<br />
If so, describe it! Or better yet, post screenies! <br />
<br />
Please!</div></div><hr />

<br />
The water is amazing, not only is the surface much prettier, but it has way more transparency, and you can see to the bottom and the mobs in the water too.<br />
<br />
Thumbs up from me.</div></div><hr />

Apparently there is a gnome in PoK that you can trade off your fire one for an ice one, and I assume Vice Versa</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hmm, suprisingly unimpressive =\<br />
<br />

Anyone got osme more screenies of the uber graphics, i was kinda excited about them from the previews, but i dont see much in tha timage to excite me. Not to mention i noticed in the backround that the bear model is STILL the same old one heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Too funny.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Seem to be just visual trinkets without any real use to them. Some other trinkets from previous expansions had some faction modifier at least, don't know how useful it was since I have gotten my expansions through downloading. But the one what was linked by a friend was some fire crystal, stats were marginable and just added the effect, which served really no purpose.</div></div><hr />
