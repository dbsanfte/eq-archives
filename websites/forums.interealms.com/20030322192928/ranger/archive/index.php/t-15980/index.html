<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>MeeChuSUh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">umm first do rangers need 2hs?<br />
if rangers do need 2hs. whats the easiest way to raise skill in it and do 1hs at the same times.<br />
also what do you think is better.  1hs and 1hp. or 1hs and 1hb?<br />
<br />
                                 thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dartaniun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">work em all up. for 2hb and 2hs just find a faster 2 hander for each skill. and get a dex buff from somebody to help with the skillups</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jelanen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yeah, train them all up while you are leveling, don't be like me and wait till 40...I'm now 46 and STILL working on 2hb and 1hb in DL and the exp sucks.   I could be anywhere else soloing and getting decent exp, but the weapon skills are more important right now.   Like what happens if yer on a raid and a nice 2hs or 2hb drops and you win the roll...the leader asks what yer skill in that weapon is and you say &quot;uhhh...10.&quot;   That nice weapon is going somewhere else right away.   This hasn't happened to me cause I'm not in a good guild (or any guild for that matter) but my friends who are have seen it happen.    AND just because I'm just a little bit of a perfectionist, I'm also working on hand-to-hand and throwing  =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rakhal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I personally worked on 2hs 'cause it was a good way not to attract aggro and I also wanted to use Swarmcaller effectively. Around level 46 or so I got a Swarmcaller and was generally unsatisfied with the proc so I ditched it along with my intention to max 2hs skill at each level . I was unaware of the fact that the slowing rate of the proc increases with levels. <br />
<br />
Within a few weeks after the release of PoP I got a Weighty Polearm for next to nothing and as a result my 2hs started going up again. At level 56 while soloing mobs with panic animal in PoP zones, I found myself badly in need of something that could slow the mob so that I didn't get hit as much between when panic animal wore off and my recasting it - bear in mind that there is still (at level 56) a significant chance of panic animal being resisted by mobs such as the festering rats in PoJ. This is where I took out my Swarmcaller again and found a great use for it. At level 56 it slows for much more (and lasts longer) than it did at level 46. It's cut my downtime by a huge amount. So unless you have an Earthcaller in your main hand when you're level 55+, Swarmcaller is a very viable option for slowing mobs while soloing. Granted, my dex isn't low. <br />
<br />
Even if you have no intention of ever using a Swarmcaller for slowing at higher levels, surely it's worth keeping 2hs maxed for those times during hunts/raids that one of your guildie knights lets you borrow his/her Windblade! Major eye candy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Celt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Work all your weapon skills.  It never used to be a problem when the game was in it's infancy, it was sooo difficult to level quickly back then, was a snap to have all your skills maxed foryour level by keeping a weapon of each type in your pack and swapping when your skill went up.<br />
<br />
Keep pluggin away, even in the world of level 50 in a week.   Try to keep all your skills as balanced as possible, but always keep 1hslash maxed (or whatever your best weapon combo is for dps).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aethien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">OK, I'll try to set a good example here. Well, at least, this is what my skills are now at 27:<br />
<br />
1HS - maxed at 140<br />
2HS - working on it - 70 <br />
1HB - icky, only 21<br />
2HB - a little less icky - 26<br />
Piercing - also working on this one, now 55<br />
While we're at it - Archery is at 116<br />
<br />
I intend to get one of those 2HB Ranger only weapons (what's it called again?) - I see them for sale cheap in the Bazaar on occasion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Celt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Natures wrath maybe from karnors?  Heh just a guess :)  Keep pluggin away they'll all max eventually.  Dex helps weapon skillups, so buff it up if you can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Aethien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yes, that's the one, Nature's Wrath.  29/44, plus a proc (that won't go off for quite a while for me...)  Saw one for 500 plat the other day, but I'm still upgrading some armor slots for now.<br />
<br />
Here's a funny one - grouped with a Paladin the other night who was using an Argent Defender. Nice 2HS weapon, a bit better than the BABS I was using.  At one point he says that I should switch from my 2HS to dual-wielding 1HS because, and I quote: &quot;Only class that can really be 2 hander is pally and thats only because we cant use 2 1h swords'  <br />
<br />
OK, turns out this is his first character, ever, so I can forgive him.  But it was funny to hear someone say that I shouldn't bother with my 2HS.  Just to humor him, I did switch to 2HS weapons, and started out-damaging him so fast that we almost heard  &quot;Ranger down.&quot;  Went back to 1HS and a Piercer .  <br />
<br />
So, long story short - do it all.  2HS will be useful if you don't want to attract attention.  Dual-wielding two fast 1HS weapons for when you're soloing and want something to die quickly, or get aggro off a caster (along with some spells).  Nice way to train is to Panic an animal and beat on it from behind with the weapon you want to train in...</div></div><hr />
