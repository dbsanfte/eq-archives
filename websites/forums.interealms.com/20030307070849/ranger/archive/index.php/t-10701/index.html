<br />
  The Happy Hermit of the Mountains<br />
<br />
   &quot;You see me now a veteran<br />
         of a thousand psychic wars.<br />
         I've been living on the edge so long<br />
         where the winds of limbo roar&quot;<br />
<br />
                -Blue Oyster Cult _Veteran of the Psychic Wars_<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
   Before I say anything else, I want to say I love this zone. A LOT.  For a ranger with the tendancy towards solo play, this zone is a playground of infinite possibilities.  The zone contains a variety of animals of all lvls from cute and fluffy bunnies all the way up to titan sized representatives of the various species. A spiritualistic race of cats lives on the mountain in the middle of the zone.  The Kejekans believe that all things have a spirit, and the imposition of contraints on those spirits is heresy and against nature.  They very happily coexist with the native species of the area, but the kobolds that have spilled out from  the warrens and setup camps scattered here and there around the perimeter of the zone are not welcome neighbors.<br />
<br />
   The zone is rich with background information if you take the time to talk to the Kejekan NPCs, and from them you discover the origins of everyone's favorite moon based cat people, the Vah Shir.<br />
<br />
   I've spent a lot of time wandering around this largish and open outdoor zone, and can say its one of my favorite areas in the game. Because rangerin' is all I know, this guide will contain a lot of ranger directed information, but should still be valuable to all classes.<br />
<br />
   I've spent 10 full play days in this zone, earned 3 levels (95% of that time spent was sitting still and tracking for a single mob type, so don't take the time/lvl ratio seriously), and killed nearly 90 heretics.  The various guides on the net all contain what has turned out to be kernels of truth, but each contain information counter to my experiences there.  What is scribed below is as near the gospel truth regarding stonebrunt as a single minded obsessive hermit of the mountains knows it.<br />
<br />
==================================<br />
<br />
  Getting There    (taxi!)<br />
<br />
<br />
   The nearest nexus station and druid circle is in the Toxxulia forest south of Erudin.  In order to reach Stonebrunt, you must pass through paineel to the south (not the city, just the zone) and the kobold infested warrens.  The path through paineel is easy to describe, but the warrens are aptly named.  Frankly, the smell of kobolds offends me, and if Stonebrunt is your destination, I recommend getting a map and spending as little time in the warrens as possible.<br />
<br />
   The trip through paineel is easy.  Take the tunnel until it opens up into a LARGE hole (THE hole, actually) and take a left (before you step off the edge, ask anyone, getting your corpse from da Hole is a pain in the arse ;-) follow that tunnel until it opens up into a small little hunting ground.  Don't stop running.  The guard there is a fairly surly high lvl necro that likes to throw fears and engulfing darkness spells.  Just run straight out and over the hill aiming for the peak.  There's only one exit ahead of you (probably just to your right).  That tunnel will go down into the ground to a room with a kiddie pool in it.  The left hand tunnel out leads to the warrens, the tunnel straight ahead leads to the hole....<br />
<br />
<br />
==================================<br />
<br />
  Surviving    (Awww, what a cute panda.. Hey!  He ate Fritz!)<br />
<br />
<br />
   The entrance to the zone is in a little appendix in the south west corner; there is no other entrance or exit.  Stonebrunt is a dead end zone and because of this, the population is very low ALL of the time. The highest number of people I've ever seen in the zone was 16.  A more normal count is anywhere from 3 to 7 people.  Thats it.  There's plenty of mobs to go around for anyone thats brave and smart enough to survive in this zone.<br />
<br />
   Every animal in this zone is hostile to players, and since they all get along in this happy little Kejekan utopia, they have no issues with throwing in next to a neighbor and trying to rip your throat out.<br />
<br />
   Level 30 rangers should have no problems with this zone.  Just keep SoW up at all times so when things begin to go... weird (and they will), you can run for the exit.  The mobs hit for an average of 50 pts and most can double attack with claws, either both or a claw and a bite. Its not unusual for me to take a 100 pts in a tick.  So when you get a bunch on you, running is one of your few options.<br />
<br />
   This is where panic animal and snare shine.  I cackle with glee when an uppity gorilla decides to join in on the fun when I'm trying to pound a panda into paste.  They look funny running away.  I've yo-yo kited 5 animals at a time here at lvl 36.  Snare your main target and let the others do their Forrest Gump impersonations sprinting back and forth away from you in panic until you're ready to start carving on them.<br />
<br />
   The animals roam the zone from one end to the other, back and forth, but with an overall migration toward the southeast.  In the south is a spot I call lemming point.  The animals seem to get stuck in a smushed conga line trying to squirm further and further into the corner.<br />
<br />
   And last but not least, this is a zone where learning how to dive to the side when you sprint over the crest of a hill is a good thing. What looks like a gentle slope on one side could be a steep drop on the other.  If you need to get to the bottom, take the hills in switchbacks to save yerself a couple of bulbs of life when you're running for the heretics.  Unless, of course, you've already got levitation...<br />
<br />
<br />
==================================<br />
<br />
  Things to do for entertainment   (I spy with my little eye...)<br />
<br />
<br />
Want a Wakazashi?   (do you get fries with that?)<br />
<br />
   Apart from the normal occupation of slaughtering everything in reach, there are a couple of notable quests to do in stonebrunt.  First is the quest to find a cure for a diseased Kejekan native, Yuio Kaliio.  Her husband Jali is distraught and sends you to Khonza Ayssla, the High Shaman of the village who in turn sends you out to gather ingredients.<br />
<br />
        2 asp poison sacks (From oasis) <br />
        1 Kejekan Palm Fruit<br />
        1 Bamboo Shoot<br />
        2 Panda claws<br />
        2 Tiger skins<br />
<br />
   Khonza then brews up her potion and gives it back to you to take to the worried husband.  He's so grateful for the elixir that he rewards you with a Wakasashi of the Frozen Skies, a 6/22 1HS weapon that procs an 81pt DD.  These are good for low/mid players as they begin to show their special property at lvl 20.<br />
<br />
   In my attempts to do the Swiftclaw Sash quest (described below) I managed to do this quest twice.  The fruits and shoots were easy to forage up at a skill of 135.  The hardest was getting the panda claws, and even that wasn't that odious a task.  All the panda types drop them, though rarely, but the cubs hit the softest of them all... not exceedingly soft, but one swipe won't take a leg off.  The tiger skins are from the yellow kejekan tigers.  I've looted two skins off a single tiger, so you might get lucky on the first kill.  I've never gotten more than one claw off a panda.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Swiftclaw Sash   (Yes, virginia, there really IS a sash...)<br />
<br />
<br />
    As I mentioned before, the kejeks believe that any subjugation of the spirits is an offense against nature.  Those who practice the black art of Necromancy are the worst of all for they bend the spirits of the dead to do their will.  The Kejeks strive to keep their lands a safe haven; one of purity and safety, and enlist your aid to cleanse their lands of the evil that sometimes ventures forth into it.<br />
<br />
    Shazda Kaekwon, the leader of the tribe, describes the trying times they are facing.  When asked about the heretics, he gives you a satchel and charges you to collect four heretic heads.  When the heads are combined in the satchel and the satchel returned to him, Shazda rewards you with one of two items.<br />
<br />
Kejekan Tribal Headband<br />
<br />
        +3 Int<br />
        +3 Wis<br />
        +12 Mana<br />
        +2 ac<br />
<br />
        all/all<br />
        slot: head<br />
<br />
- or -<br />
<br />
Swiftclaw Sash<br />
<br />
        +2 agi<br />
        +2 ac<br />
        Haste when worn (net consensus is about 15% haste)<br />
<br />
<br />
  The reward is random.  Do not be distracted by combinations and ratio of the types of heads you collect, it doesn't matter.  Any 4 heretic heads will do, because once combined into a &quot;sachel of heretic heads&quot; its a single item that you return to Shazda.  If you get a headband and you really wanted the sash, don't be discouraged. Give it another go.  The item is worth a few attempts, perhaps not as many as I made, but its still a worthy item.  Three of the four people I know that have done this quest got their sashes within 4 attempts. Stonebrunt is the zone that forced me to confront and finally give in to my obessive side.  It took me 22 attempts to finally get my sash...<br />
<br />
  Now, with that said and everyone firmly discouraged, here's how to bring the heretics to Justice!!<br />
<br />
<br />
==================================<br />
<br />
  Heretic Hunting   (NO one expects the stonebrunt inquisition!)<br />
<br />
<br />
  The secret to hunting the heretics is knowing their spawn schedule. They have none.  None, that is, except for the fact that they come once a day.  Could be straight after midnight, in fact 1/6 of them were located on track right at 12am.  This random occurance can lead you to get bored and start fighting with the local ruffians (aka Upitty Gorillas) and be drained of both health and mana when that long awated heretic shows up on your radar.  When that happens, just remember that its likely going to be another 72 RL minutes before another one pops, so you may as well just go camp someplace safe and make dinner.  Every once in a while you'll find two, but thats only because one spawned at the tail end of the day and the other spawned right at the beginning.   <br />
<br />
  The only safe place to camp is right at the zone entrance.  No animals wander in there of their own accord, and most trains will break from their quarry zoning into the warrens long before they see you around the corner.  That said, the best spot to sit and wait and track for heretics is very near the dead center of the zone.<br />
<br />
  To the SW of the kejekan city is a small glen with two lone pine trees.  Immediately to their west is a boulder.  I sat on the edge of the boulder nearest the trees with camo up and was able to catch 99% of the heretics on my tracking radar - at a tracking skill of 185... the heretics normally spawned to the south of that location, so it might be more track efficient further south, but no where near as safe.   The location of the boulder and the prints of my butt that I wore into it is +580,+22.<br />
<br />
   Another safe spot to track from is the dock on the southern edge of the zone.  That way an industrious ranger could work on their foraging, fishing and tracking all at the same time, but that location is more distant from the average spawn location than the one I mentioned above.<br />
<br />
   There is no one location that they spawn, but none spawn near the perimeter of the zone.  Every one I've found, I've found within the central 1/2 of the zone, and most, as I said, in the southern part of that.  Here are the few entries in my logs about time and place they were dispatched.  I tried to be studious but after a while it got too monotonous to continue to write them down )<br />
<br />
  <br />
        2pm     -3407, -633<br />
        8pm     -2146, -650<br />
        4am     -1626, -1174<br />
        3am     -494,  -2209<br />
        5pm     -2351, +159<br />
        4am     -1165, +630<br />
        4pm     +446,  -2360<br />
        11am    -1879, +306<br />
        12am    -1413, -1500<br />
        6am     -1484, +219<br />
        6am     +74,   -1101<br />
        2am     +292,  +684<br />
        8am     -1567, -2142<br />
        11am    +863,  +657<br />
        9am     -2838, +967<br />
<br />
        and so on...<br />
<br />
<br />
  Once the heretics spawn, you have little time to reach them. Not only do you face the possibility that someone else is trying to hunt them, but the tigers and kobolds are hostile to them.  There may be other animals in the zone that agro the heretics, but those are the only ones I've seen chewing on them.  Animals, however, seem to dislike YOU more than the heretics, so don't count on them paying attention to the heretic if you get near.<br />
<br />
  Trackers should do a quick combing of their track list at the start of the hunting session to verify that they're not lucky and one is up and unhurt (three times this happened to me, once zoning in, and twice as I signed in to start my hunt).  Once its been investigated and none are on track, change your /tracksort to normal - this will show you, roughly, the newest spawns at the top of your tracking list so you don't have to waste time scrolling the whole thing looking for &quot;a heretic invader&quot;.<br />
<br />
  I setup a hotkey that flipped my /tracksort to distance, paused for 5 seconds, and flipped it back to normal.  I used this when I was about to engage a heretic to make sure I wasn't completely surrounded by high lvl mobs that were likely to drain the life out of me from behind while I was concentrating on my heretic.<br />
<br />
  A few more notes regarding the swiftclaw quest:<br />
<br />
  Faction has nothing to do with the reward that I could tell.  It took me 16 quest completions (including the waks) to raise my faction to amiable with the Kejeks.  The lucky sods that got their sashes within 4 tries where unlikely to have anything better than indifferent faction with the Kejeks.<br />
<br />
  Just keep trying, you'll get it ;-)<br />
<br />
<br />
==================================<br />
<br />
  Stonebrunt for brutish fun and profit <br />
<br />
<br />
  Snare and panic are your friends.  As I mentioned very early in this guide, I've been able to chew 5 deep blues at a time solo by yo-yo kiting them.  Choose a main target, and snare it. Then cast panic animal and carve away at its back, recast as needed.  Any adds, simply switch target to them, cast panic animal, and go back to carving up victim #1.  Rinse, repeat, heal, camo, med.  I've made 2 lvls at a rate of 1 lvl per 5 hours solo play and around 100plat per lvl from the loot.  Thats plat from the vendors in kejek, not the amount that you can sometimes sell the panda claws or tiger skins for.<br />
<br />
  Its not as high as you can get from hill giants in a group, but its not squat either.  A good duo here could rake in the money and exp, I think.  Since the animals have set game trails they tend to follow, there will usually be another to come along in just a little while.  If you find a good spot out of the way, but within bow range of a trail, you can sit and pick and choose and keep as constant a supply of prey as your health and mana will let you handle.<br />
<br />
<br />
==================================<br />
<br />
  Some additional notes about Stonebrunt<br />
<br />
  Killing the titans (the named animals) in the zone WILL hurt your faction with the kejeks.  You've been warned.  They're good exp, and have good loot - you will, as trackers, likely be courted to help other players locate them for quests they're working on.  I helped plenty of mages track down titans, and made them quite happy (I can't imagine how frustrating it has to be to try and locate a specific mob in a zone without tracking.  My hat's off to those who live without this skill).  Just don't kill enough that the kejek's won't talk to you anymore or you can't do the quest.  The only things you can do to raise your faction with them, as far as I know,  are the quests you get from THEM.  Remember, you're already indifferent to begin with.<br />
<br />
  If you're hunting heretics, you may as well use the kejek merchants. Its a run and four zone curtains to the merchants in Erudin.<br />
<br />
  Use camo, not the hide skill.  The hide skill is for last resorts (like skidding around the corner into an oncoming tiger with no time to cast camo and pray he didn't see you).  Don't hide when you're camo'd either, if you fail at hide, your camo may as well not even be up.<br />
<br />
  The kejeks won't help you fight mobs.  I think they take bets on the outcome and pose your corpse in amusing positions. <br />
<br />
  I have been attacked by gorillas while sitting in the middle of the Kejek village.<br />
<br />
  Gorillas are FAST.<br />
<br />
  Pandas fight slow, but hit hard.<br />
<br />
  Tigers are afraid of very little.  And when they are, they aren't for very long.<br />
<br />
  Panic'd bunny rabbits run slower than Gorillas.<br />
<br />
  Snakes are only there to get in the way of your targeting.<br />
<br />
  20 headbands take up a LOT of room in your stash...<br />
<br />
  Heretic heads are heavy.<br />
<br />
  Even though there's 12 people in the zone, you could still be the only one hunting for heretics.<br />
<br />
  Guild chat keeps you sane during extended hunts in the wilderness. Thank you Golden Eagle Trading Co.!!!<br />
<br />
  Be safe in the mountains, and more importantly, have fun!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bindamel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Very good writeup.  Perhaps I should do a kobold one to complement it.<br />
<br />
The only thing I might mention is that I noticed recently that I'm dubious to the bigger cats.  Don't honestly know why, and don't know if it's always been this way.<br />
<br />
You may also want to mention at  the upper end for getting experience in Stonebrunt, although I don't know what that is yet :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shenlong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Umm, I was hunting there for a while and none of the kitties were agro to me, I don't think.  Everything else was, but not the kitty's...  Also, you can tell wich pandas have the claws if you can get close enough.  I noticed that they kinda &quot;wear&quot; them, and they stick out of the inside of thier paws.  I was trying to get 2 final wak's before I left the other day and a panda happened to walk by and I noticed the claws (only needed one more claw), so I attacked that one.  I was medding at the time, almost oom, and about 50% health.  Got a few adds, and had to root them then run out of agro range of them, while keeping the panda on me, then run around till I could get enough mana to root the panda long enough to med so I could snare and fear it.  and sow ran out in the middle of all this :D .  but I ended up pulling it off and getting the claws ( I was about to give up on that last wak), so it's kinda nice to know you can actually see the claws.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Wow, heck of a guide!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I myself have made the Swiftclaw Sash quest  about 5 times and got 2 sashes. I once got ripped out for a 'FRSS' (flowing red silk sash) at the time was new and while testing I found that it was a very bad item and after comparing with FBSS I found the Swiftclaw Sash reasonably close to the FBSS (FRSS is useless).<br />
<br />
Hunting Heretics is a 'meditation'. The best advice as given above is to track a nd only track. And be preparded for frustration as it happens sometimes that a Heretic is being eaten out by an animal. If the Heretic is down 50 percent helath already Panic'ing the animal and killing the Heretic is too late : his /her corpse will poof/.<br />
<br />
My best tip for tracking the Heretics, is like I did, to begin there at around level 33-34 so that Heretics appear at least lowblue.. at level 34 I think I once saw a named Heretic that was an even con.<br />
This way, you can filter off all the green, red and possibly yellow from Track, it saves a LOT of time scrolling down the Track list. Even better,  your little 30ish ranger does not have to worry about the 50ish Druid in the zone because this way you will always be the first to spot a Heretic on track ! :)   Just make sure to sit near the center of the zone, a little bit southward and you should reach them first everytime !<br />
<br />
When I quested my Sashes, the Heretics spawned about once an hour,, sometimes two within 15 minutes, sometimes NONE within a few hours.... patience. Keep hitting trak and you will turn into Buddha mind mode :)<br />
<br />
The Swiftclaw Sash quest is an absolute must for every young Ranger who does not twink and possibly an even greater quest on Firiona Vie!<br />
<br />
Last but not least it is always so much more rewarding to get an item on your own instead of going to the Bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fierackas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just a note on the named Heretic. I tried to take him on as an even con and got a good kicking. I would advise leaving him alone until he's very blue to you. He drops a nice SK only sword as well as his head - I'm still trying to sell the sword. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Blythar Jones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Great Job. I would like to add one thing.  While all animals agro'd on me normaly at least one, Gorillas, did not agro on me while in Wolf form.  But don't go into the town in wolf form.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Anduyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">One thing about hide.<br />

<br />
Someone here on the glade posted a way that you can see if your hide was successful or not.  If it was, you'll see a message that says &quot;I don't see anyone by that name around here...&quot;<br />

Hide is awesome for medding, when you don't want animals to aggro you.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Aethien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Have spent the last week or so in Stonebrunt, before the anticipated crowds show up with LoY.  Nice, peaceful place - although on Sullon, there have been three or four people here at a time. That's actually kind of crowded, by our standards.  But I've been the only one interested in Heretics, apparently. <br />
<br />
Anyway, quick question - is it common for the animals that you panic to just wander off and not come back? Had to panic a gorilla last night, and I never saw the thing again (unless it was one that I killed a half-hour later).  Same thing happened with a Tiger on the first night - I snared it, paniced it, and ran back to a nice safe spot, thinking I'd pump arrows into it as it approached. But it wandered off - had to track it down and make it start chasing me again.<br />
<br />
Or is this just an aspect of the infamous pathing problems here?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tyrolene</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Sometimes they will sprint out of agro range, only to wander back into it when you're quietly meditating and jump out from behind a rock and shout BOO!  If they're snared and they don't come back... its a pathing issue.  They're trying to get back, really.  Its just another case of &quot;Can't get there from here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gorillas tend to do this more often than most anything else because they move so darn fast at a run.  <br />
