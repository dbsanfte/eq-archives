<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Opinion:<br />
<br />
I saw Fungi tunic for 128k tonight it was a serious offering.<br />
<br />
Here is what I think. Fungi was 40 to 50k pre bazaar. Bazaar made them 60 to 70k almost immediately. A Fungi starts at 65K, guy sees it says to himself I can sell that for 5k more and buys it and sells it for 70k, another guy sees that and says to himself I can sell that for 5k more buys it and sells it for 75k and so on. Not once in it's travels did the fungi benefit a person as equipment it was bought and sold for the sole purpose of making money. Does this sound familiar? Look for the &quot;fungi&quot; bubble to burst soon. This is true for other items too.<br />
<br />
Just my opinion and would like to hear others.<br />
<br />
ADDED: BTW saw one this morning from a different person for 100k, this is what got me thinking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vargo Hoat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">meh. it also made lower end items incredible available for newbies. you can buy equipment which will let you get to 20 in a few days for a mere 100 plat. made a little wizzy and got him some +hp and AC items for about 100 plat. he can put up his radiation aura and tank 3 guys at once. just don't ****ing pay rediculous prices for equipment and it will go back down. its the retard who actually pays 100k for a fungi that is ruining the economy. after a few of these guys get burned doing this it will stop happening.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">/agree<br />
<br />
But it also makes our old stuff worthless but good for newbs.<br />
<br />
What I said about the fungi, it isn't fools who are buying at high prices, it's speculators,  they are driving the price up and then someone who has one for sale in the normal way sees the speculative prices and thinks 80k is cheap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vargo Hoat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yeah, i think over time it will even back out again. if people just refuse to pay the rediculous prices set by speculators they will have to either lower the price or eat the cost out of their pocket. if they get burned a few times i think they will give up.<br />
<br />
bazaar has radically changed the economy and when that happens it takes time for things to return to a normal level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>ergomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">On the nameless, they are being sold for 40-55k, im selling one for 50k</div></div><hr />

I've seen a few even sell for 35k on The Nameless. I've also been seeing a drop in prices on Shaman Spells ( Except for Malo and Torpor that is =p ).</div></div><hr />

<br />
So then maybe something is going on. Maybe not purposely but some effect has happened. I would say the price has climbed 5k every 2 or 3 days. This is bazaar only, there may be reasonable prices in /join auction which I haven't been following much.<br />
<br />
Ikky BP's have gone from 4.5 to about 8k now.<br />
Shadel Bandit Rings from 4k to 6.5k.<br />
JBB is stuck at 30k now.<br />
<br />
I think there is a lot of monkey see-monkey do. If one guys sets a high price others come in just below him, once the high price guy is gone maybe the price will normalize.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>ergomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I payed 18k for my jbb a year or so ago, reguardless of the asking price you find a way to get it, its worth it in the long run, ive cast my jbb more than canni.  Heh i used to solo the wurms in SF at 53 with nothing but root and jbb when i couldnt find a group.  I dont recommend this, its quite time consuming but still it gets the job done.<br />
<br />
As for the fungi hey  if you can get one for 35 feel free, 48500 is my lowest selling price :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hail,<br />
<br />
If you are ever-present in the bazaar, you can get some really good deals on some things.  <br />
<br />
Some low level items are often sold at BELOW the sell-back to vendor price, offering the savvy buyer a chance to pick up an item, sell it to an npc, and make a little cash in under a minute.<br />
<br />
Some old popular items that are now obsolete with the advent of Luclin can be purchased for very little money.  Much of this is still good gear for mid-level to mid-50's characters that don't have the benefit of a guild backing their equipment upgraes.<br />
<br />
There is a booming discount resist gear market on old JC made jewelry, with BD bracers and such often sold at LESS than the cost of the BD at current market values.  /boggle<br />
<br />
You can get some fantastic deals on some common drop spells that you don't have yet, and many of the turn-in quest spells are sold at 50pp or less, giving you a chance to fill out a few of those low 50's spells without a lot of the heartache that I went through.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately though, the rare spell market has some rampant inflation going on, with spell prices sometimes changing HOURLY, and not to the customer's benefit in many cases on upper level (shaman in particular) spells.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the very small minority of professional traders generally snap the good deals up and then immediately resell them at a higher price, often grossly inflated. :(  I can relate to the &quot;uber&quot; guild's desire to unload their spell vaults for good cash, and even if they offer at a reasonable price, the sharks snap them up and put them up with an extra 20kpp tacked on for their profit.   /sigh<br />
<br />
My advice.  Cultivate contacts in the most powerful guilds on your server, and try to negotiate a fair pricing scheme face-face or in /tells instead of with a level 1 unguilded rogue named Benduoverforspells.  :p<br />
YMMV<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

Yeah I saw that and thought of buying some up but that'll put me in a crazy place where I don't want to be. Im sure some enterprising individuals will become virtual millionaires due to the bazaar.<br />
<br />
I'll just go out and smoosh stuff, that's where I'm happiest, I don't need the &quot;did I miss something good?&quot; monkey sitting on my back. Har.</div></div><hr />

How do you write something like &quot;Look for the &quot;fungi&quot; bubble to burst soon.&quot; without er bursting out laughing? <br />
<br />
With a case of Cruex and Micatin by my side. :D<br />
<br />
I don't know was in a hurry to get to work and this was on my mind, seemed insulting that when I FINALLY get enough pp to buy a Fungi at normal prices the prices go nutz on me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">A few observations:<br />
<br />
First and foremost, the bazaar is not the place to be looking for high-end gear.  Generally most high-end gear that's up there is priced waaaay too high, due to silly speculators or people like me... who, when setting up their trader before going to bed, fill the remaining slots in their satchels with their main droppable gear- priced high enough that if someone actually buys it, I'll be able to quickly buy a replacement and make a nice profit.  I sold a bracer of sense for 18k the other day (paid 10k three days before), and no one was more stunned then me !<br />
<br />
Really it's nothing more than the economy at work.  If the fungi is not worth X, no one will buy it from the speculators.  If it is, the speculators will make a profit.  Over time, those that speculate and overinflate will find themselves with excess inventory they can't get rid of.  In the meantime, as perceived normal prices raise, people with that gear in their inventory will be more and more tempted to sell it (&quot;I can get 70k for the fungi I've got that sits in a pack most of the time since I got torpor?  Wow, I paid 30k for it only six months ago!  I'll sell it for 60k to get a quick sale and try to find Malo!&quot;)<br />
<br />
I've done some speculating (although almost exclusively on mid-level items, and driven by buying super low- my rule of thumb is no more than 33% of the regular market price- then selling low- generally 66% of the market price) and think it's a great way to make some cash.  For that matter, buying from the /trade channel, and reselling in the bazaar can be a nice way to generate cash while you sleep.  :)<br />
<br />
That people take the high-end gear to ridiculous prices and that high-end people take those prices seriously is indicative of the huge disparity in wealth between the mid and high level game, and the similar disparity between the high and uber level game.  There was a guy a few hours ago in /trade saying &quot;Paying 200k for X, 150k for Y, 100k for X, 150k for ZZ&quot;, etc. - people see that and think &quot;Why not try to make a few bucks off a guy like that?&quot;  (Of course, he's probably a guild buyer, and those speculators will get stuck with their excessively priced inventory... c'est la vie!)<br />
<br />
If there are X of some item available for sale, and more than X people want it... and no other prioritizing factor (friendship, guild membership, etc.) comes into play, why not money?  It's a self-correcting system.<br />
<br />
Also, don't be afraid to send a tell to a bazaar guy &quot;Would you take 60k and an iksar BP for that fungi?&quot; - you might just be surprised.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Don't forget that Fungi prices also shot up when it went from the common to the rare drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Here is what I think. Fungi was 40 to 50k pre bazaar. Bazaar made them 60 to 70k almost immediately. A Fungi starts at 65K, guy sees it says to himself I can sell that for 5k more and buys it and sells it for 70k, another guy sees that and says to himself I can sell that for 5k more buys it and sells it for 75k and so on.<br />
<br />
I completely disagree.  Most high end gear was sold by way of message boards and an auction type system.  Someone would post WTS Fungi and let the people bid away till they got &quot;the best price&quot;.  With the Bazaar you can't do that.  So people are putting higher prices on high end items since there is no bidding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Well 100k is too much for an extra 10 regen -10 dex -10 agl and 2AC. I'll stick with my Ikky and hope PoP pushes prices down.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">On Rallos Zek prices have dropped. Example, Lodi shields went from 25k to 16 - 19k. Ikky BP 5k to 3 - 4k.<br />
<br />
Guess it is just the smartest people arent on the blue servers. Poor bluebies.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Occasionally you see something priced real low but it's usually snatched up before you find the dude but as a general rule on Xev JB and below has gone down a hellin' except for the bracer and the rest up and higher everyday, except for the guy who was selling Iron Rations for 100k. Trade skill items have hit an even keel a bit lower than pre-bazaar, although BD resist stuff is getting real cheap and diamond resist stuff is dirt cheap as compared to before. <br />
<br />
<br />
OT: Anyone know the price of Fuzzlecutters with about 150 Cha? Lousy Gnome won't sell to me and I don't believe Trolls can faction him. I've finally been able to buy the stuff in the bazaar for about 15 to 20 pp per stack. I just want to see how bad I'm getting ripped off.</div></div><hr />

This way they are forced to put up or shut up, they must list a price.  If someone is stupid enough to pay that much for an item. its nobody's fault but their own.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok to pull back to my intentions for this. Whatever the reason that prices are high, however they are sold and whomever buys them it is my contention that playing around with prices in a much more public way will eventually cause the de facto prices of wanted items to increase above and beyond prices set by supply and demand. I think perceptions of what an item is worth will become established by bazaar prices and people will expect the lower prices or accept the higher prices.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Bazaar has really helped me out on Rodcet.  Low-end items are actually buyable now - nobody bothered selling a lot of them before.  I can sell a Forest Loop for 350p, for example, whereas before I'd have sold it to vendor for 285p.<br />
<br />
Middle- to high-end items are often very expensive in the bazaar, but then again at other times they are reasonably priced.  The only JBB I have seen for sale was 15k.  There was a REIF the other night for 1500p (!) and another for 3k.  Barbarian Spiritist's Hammer for 500p.  Bane of Nife for 1700p.  The list goes on.  It's just a matter of watching and waiting until the item becomes available at the price you want to pay.</div></div><hr />

Prices seem to stabilize now on the high end, but you could get a lot of great deals in the &quot;emptying out that stuff in the vault phase&quot;.  I run a second machine with a 24 h trader, and snoop around for gear a lot while playing my main.  So far nothing I bought I couldn't resell for a higher price when I found something better.  You just have to know your prices, and bite fast if you see what you want.<br />
What amazes me again and again are the differences in prices between the servers, fungis from 30 - 100, jbb from 15 to 30, and spell prices all over the landscape.<br />
I made my cash with pottery items in the bazaar till the market on Xev crashed, right now my wishlist is reduced to malo and a pair of those FTIII boots, and I can go back to leveling again.</div></div><hr />

Heck before the bazaar it was hard to find what the going rate was because nobody was actually willing to give you a price you just sorta had to guess and just accept getting screwed by the seller. <br />

The best thing bazaar has done on tunare is it has brought most spell back from lala land to the land of what real people would be willing to pay. Spell prices on tunare before bazaar were fricking crazy my mage was charged 1kp for his superior invis and 1.2k for coth. Now in bazaar the superiour invis for mage sells for 300 p and coth from 300 to 600 plat.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">prices have actually gone down on MOST things on my server. some things are getting more expensive (ikky bps for some reason), but fungus has gotten cheaper and i've gotten insane deals on eq i never thought i'd be able to afford. so i think this is a good change. all that eq people didn't want to sell to vendors but really didn't want to take the time to sit in EC either is now in circulation. better for all of us!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Carrieanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Well on Tunare - JBBs are farmed to oblivion, hence only go for 13-15k. Fungi I've seen on sale from initially at 35k+, normally 50-55k now..<br />
<br />
I would prefer VI just make fungi no-drop. That would solve the problem in one foul swoop.<br />
<br />
Mage spells are exceptionally cheap. Druid spells are too (well Moonfire hits 35k.. but that's the only exception). KEI has dropped in price, yet:<br />
<br />
Bane - 5-6k (I bought mine for 400pp...)<br />
KFoS - 8-20k<br />
VotB - 9-15k<br />
Tirgir's - 19k+<br />
Malo - 35k+ only seen this once for sale<br />
Torpor - I don't think I have seen this for sale.<br />
Avatar - 8k (seen this at 4k once, which is sounds better)<br />
<br />
<br />
Melee normally have a few weapons, these can normally be resold for upgrades. Casters have lots of spells that aren't upgradable but can't be traded. So when a melee spends 100k on a new weapon they know that this can be traded so the money is not lost. Casters can't and guess which class' spells normally occupy the top five most expensive spells in /bazaar... you've got it.. shaman.<br />
<br />
Hell, even KEI has dropped from 35k to 22k.. and the cost of peridots to clerics is cheaper..<br />
<br />
<br />
We'll I can't afford that personally so shaman have to rely on drops from contested mobs such as Sev, Gore.. hmm.. on tunare they last a matter of minutes after spawning. <br />
<br />
Perhaps making torpor/malo etc drop off a few more mobs..</div></div><hr />

There are no fish scales sold anywhere on the moon.<br />
<br />
You're wrong there - there's a guy in Shadowhaven, in the area with all the dorfs. He's under a little tent and he holds a fishing pole - can't remember his name, sorry. He sells an endless supply of fish scales, also fishing poles and bait.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">The Bazaar has been extremely convenient for people like me who sell stuff for guild fund. I've sold quite a few high level spells and WW dragon armor in the last couple weeks. Normally that stuff is incredibly hard to sell without Bazaar. I also sold a Horn of Hsagra for 100k the other day. Took me about 3 or 4 days to sell it. I'd never have the patience to /auction that for days. Even if I did, I'd have to deal with annoying people offering &quot;15 items that suck +25K&quot; for my Horn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>RrumofXev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">128k for a fungi?  I dont suppose there was another for sale, or one had just been sold .. <br />
<br />
Lets say the jbb is worth 25k.  I put one jbb on an alt for 45k, and another jbb on an alt for 35k.  I know darn well the jbb for 45k wont sell, but the 35k jbb will appear to be a good deal.  I bank an extra 10k, and repeat with a never ending supply of rbb's, rbg's, jbb's, fungi's, and all the other little trinkets there seems to be a never ending stream of people willing to buy.<br />
<br />
I create inflation in an economy the size of Lithuania's all by myself with a copy of EQW, which is sort of a neat thing if you think about it ..<br />
<br />
Of course i'm not saying this is happening on your server or in this particular case.  It's an interesting scenario to consider however.</div></div><hr />

An excellent feature of the bazaar that is rarely mentioned is that sellers do not have to entertain stupid offers. I usually just set my afk message saying my loc and just leave the comp running through the nite.<br />
<br />
&quot;Most high end gear was sold by way of message boards&quot;<br />
<br />
Not entirely true (at least not on TP server), a lot of guild banks do not advertise on the msg bords and usually only log their bazaar mule after raids. One good way to find that high end spell or high end equipment to put &quot;ubahguildtrader&quot; on your friend list. When you see them log on, go to bazaar and check out what they have. Lots of decently priced stuff. Maybe even Torpor. I am still hoping.<br />
