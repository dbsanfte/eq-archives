<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I downloaded a Drakah UI instead of using my own custom T.King, and decided, while loading it on my characters, to give Gandwer another spin.<br />
<br />
So I logged on. Plane of Growth was silent as ever, and I gated before having to deal with the damned PoG's, so, there I was in PoK.<br />
<br />
Well, first off, I check my guild. Yup, all there, get a warm welcome and a few confused questions from the latest crop of newbies we've recruited (&quot;who the heck is &quot;Gundy?&quot;). I put up LFG (no LDoN, please), and shouted out for a group in PoK.<br />
<br />
Then in PoT. Then Valor, Storms, Nightmare, Innovation, Disease, even Torment and CoD! Three hours, nothing, so I head to the Bazaar.<br />
<br />
Well, I have no money, but I see Torpor selling for 9k. Yep, 9k, hell is indeed frozen on the Shaman class! So, now I'm sitting in the Bazaar, all my melted down twinks in my bag, waiting to get some merchandise out.<br />
<br />
I've sold a single orc fang earring. 5pp. Woot. There's 200 traders, it's like the bubonic plague just hit.<br />
<br />
While doing that I reset my spell lists for the new computer, played some Gems, and tried to do a little trader-hunting. To no avail. <br />
<br />
I dunno what my point here is, but I got a wild hair going to play my Shaman again, and, unless I solo, it's not looking like it will happen. Oh well</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have had much the same experience lately.  Over the last month there has been a serious drop off in the amount of groups that have been looking for shaman.  2 weeks ago spend 3 days 3 hours each LFG.  Soloed a little, but thats so dull.  <br />
<br />
Have logged my shaman in once in teh last week, and that was to make sow potions for my wizard who is enjoying a new surge in popularity.    Everyone sees to want the damage, and I actually am relishing not being able to buff a damn person with anything.<br />
<br />
/shrug<br />
<br />
Its a wheel.  Shamans day will come back sometime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>diwahabulin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I must agree that there is a lack of action on servers.<br />
<br />
I play on the Torvonnilous Server and no matter what character I play the people lfg are just not there anymore.  There are never over 400 traders in the bazaar anymore.<br />
<br />
PoK is less than 75 almost everytime I go their.<br />
<br />
Sony needs to suck it up and allow free server transfers or combines.  I can 2-box to keep progressing my twinks but I had a 49 Warrior come up to me in POJ when i was PLin my Beastlord saying how groups do not exist anymore.<br />
<br />
I also do a /w of the largest guilds on my server and see numbers under 10 and soem of the times nothing but alts being played.  I also see members from bigger guilds taggless (and not anon or role :P).<br />
<br />
If server action doesn't pick up or is forced to pick up by combining then I see more players who depend on groups to progress quiting the game.<br />
<br />
It does not matter what character I lfg with the wait time is unbelievable.  And there is rarely enough to put together your own group.<br />
<br />
Sometimes in business you need to know when your licked.  Right now most servers have had it.<br />
<br />
Sigla - 65 Shaman Torv<br />
Higante - 55 Berserker Torv<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Plat prices have plunged, if you check out the sites.  Like, dropped by 2/3 in a week or so.  Nothing on my mules is selling pretty much regardless of how much I discount it.  Whoever is staying, doesn't have much money or want to spend it.  Nobody is buying plat either.  The market is VERY dead.<br />
<br />
As to wanting shamans -- I haven't seen that since people realized months ago that BL and chanters do just as good a job as we do, but add a lot more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have to agree with Blarg.<br />
<br />
Log my shaman Binter, go LFG.  And wait...and wait...and wait...and wait.  Get frustrated after soloing while LFG, log my enchanter Auli.  She's level 65 as well.  Go LFG.  Usually she has a group inside 20 minutes.  There's a major overpopulation of enchanters on Vazaelle right now, so for a while it was taking her an hour to find a group.  But that rarely happens anymore, since Auli has built a reputation on the server as a skilled enchanter, and those who have grouped with her in the past will quickly pick her up before someone else does.<br />
<br />
When I look for a replacement, I go out of my way to find a shaman.  Not only does it give a fellow shaman a group, it also teaches these people that shamans aren't useless.  A well played shaman in tier3 PoP and below is still very powerful, but the crop of people I group with now that I'm guildless have no clue at all what shamans are about, or what they can do.<br />
<br />
There's 2 reasons for this that I can see.  Firstly is the dramatic plunge in the shaman population on Vazaelle.  There are probably only about 10-15 65 shamans left that will put up a LFG tag, though there are more shamans than that around.  Obviously, not all of them are LFG at the same time, so you might see one or two shamans LFG at the same time at any given moment, when compared to the 4-5 enchanters and 6-10 beastlords.  Secondly, because of this shortage of GOOD shamans, most people have either had no contact with or have forgotten about the abilities of a well-played shaman.  They've become blinded by the dps of the BL slower or the crowd control and mana regen buffs of the chanter slower.  Shamans may not do much dps, but a well played shaman is still a formidable force anywhere outside GoD/high-end raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Maitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Haven't been LFG for a long time since there are allways guild EP groups going or i'm soloing my necro, but last time i went lfg i was surprised by the lack of tells and i logged eventually. Havent been lfg since so i can't judge if situation is allways like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>wakonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I log on pretty much to just raid anymore, but when I do get a group it is almost always with the guild. I actually felt appreciated today, my first trip to Uqua. OMG people want stat buffs! =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cronikk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm concentrating on EC LDoN right now - almost got my BA4 aug! - and some nights I can be waiting half an hour or so for a group. Irrespective, I can always be guaranteed to get a half-dozen 'Want a BoT group?' tells in that time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Its the SUMMER!<br />
<br />
Always, always drop off of people in the summer. September rolls around and everyone is back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Predicus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have ran into a slightly different atmosphere on the Brell Server.  Activity seems pretty dead, but I am still getting steady tells from groups.  The odd thing about it is many are from EP/Time guilds.  It seems a lot of the upper tier shamans are only logging on for raids and are either logging off after or switching to alts.  My friends list has increased steadily over the past few weeks because of this, but I tend to get stuck in Sol Ro most of the time- seems very few are messing around with LDoN currently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Benadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have to agree with you Blinter. Anymore on Vazaelle I log in both my Shaman and my Warrior and head over to the boats in LoY or IGs in Everfrost. Atleast there I can farm some cash while both toons have LFG up. It is really sad that my main is more often than not relegated to the role of buff bot for my tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I dunno what my point here is, but I got a wild hair going to play my Shaman again, and, unless I solo, it's not looking like it will happen. Oh well<br />
<br />
<br />
This was the final strike for me in EQ that made me decide to end billing. I feel shaman are no longer needed or wanted and i cant seem to get into any other class like i do my shaman. I mean i have a plethera of 30+ toons from a necro to a warrior and wizzy and BST and druid and so on, but nothing fits me, nothing brings the tribal flavor of playing my barb shaman.<br />
<br />
So with no guild, no one to warmly welcome me on, no one to take pity on me and ask me to do something, it became painfuly clear how much my class has fallen behind and at the time SoE had 0 feedback and it was looking bleak. Well its still looking bleak but anyway.<br />
<br />
Its a shame they feel we arent broke and that we are pretty much fine cause when you look at the kunark shaman and compare him tot he shaman of today, its a ****ing joke, excuse my french. But if we were so over powered we had to be left back for multiple expantions, then *** is up with enchanters and other classes of the like? You mean to tell me that charming mobs for insane DPS and soloing things in half the time it takes a full group to is not powerful? Bards arent monsters?<br />
<br />
No i dont want enchanter nerf, i want shaman empowering. They need to go to kunark and redo our progression line and bring us into a power of our own.<br />
<br />
I remembe the cathc phrase for a shaman in kunark/velious and it was &quot; Walking fortress&quot; once you hit 60 and got torpor and can5. Today its  &quot; well atleast they take a while to go down&quot;. We arent even a buff machine anymore. I use 2 buffs in my line up. FA and Focus. Occasionaly i get asked for stam, but not much.<br />
<br />
Meh, dont mean to get rolling again, but its really saddening to see how we have fallen and how SoE doesnt want to pick us up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I see a lot of the same thing in this thread, 'I log on and go LFG', thats it.  I see no one talking about forming their own group or going out of their way.  As a shaman you sometimes have to work at it a little, the chances of you finding a group that needs one person, let alone a shaman in particular is pretty slim when you think about it.<br />
<br />
When I have trouble finding a group, as in I log in and '/gu looking for group if anyone has any space', and I get no tells or whatever, I start my own group.  I then tell the guild Im starting a group, again if I dont get replies after a couple of tries, or dont get a complete group, I start checking for who else is LFG out of guild and on very rare occasion can I not complete a group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">My situation is similar to Predicus. Activity seems dead but I am getting requests to join groups in places like Earth, Fire and Sol Ro, which I'm not flagged for.  I used to get regular requests to join Valor, Tactics or LDON groups, up until a month ago.<br />
<br />
Added on edit: I used to make my own groups a lot last year but got a little burned out on that for now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I have no problems finding something to do.  Put up LFG and plenty of people send tells to come join BoT group.  LDON gets boring after 2 or 3 runs on normal risk.  On high risk it gets boring tryin to find that right person to fill in last slot.  Or someone will leave so you gotta spend another 15 20 mins replacing that person.  Sometimes end up hittin droga, which is made for shamans imo.<br />
<br />
Guess I can see how the complaint is, but I just don't see the extreme that is being described here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Emarr seems about the same as far as getting groups for my warrior is concerned (haven't played the shaman much lately.)  <br />
<br />
As to PoK having substantially less than before - I bet that's due to the bugs in that zone.  Monday night we had 18 on a guild raid - 9 died (ok, tough raid night but we had fun :p ) - of those 9, 6 crashed at least once trying to get through pok.  <br />
<br />
About the plat...I've been noticing the same thing.  I've seen ornate molds drop in price by nearly 50% in the last few weeks.  I'm not sure if that's due to summer, lack of plat farming, natural mudflation as new gear is discovered, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Aikoiko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I dunno...<br />
<br />
I stopped playing my Shaman a while ago.  Just got discuraged.  Same deal as most here... log on and spend an hour with LFG up and spamming the LDoN channel LFA while soloing.  Gets old real quick.<br />
<br />
I recently logged to a different server (Innoruuk) and created an SK, and I'm actually having fun again.  Could be 'cause I have several RL freinds on the new server as well, but attendance is way down in the guild overall.  Attendance on the servers is down overall.  Not so long ago I remember logging my baz mule at the end of the night and waiting for someone to leave trader mode while I constantly clicked the &quot;begin trader&quot; button.  Now, I never see more than about 300-350 traders up at a time, sometimes fewer than 200!<br />
<br />
Despite it all, I'm having a blast exploring content that I missed while leveling my Shaman.  Heck, I got excited over melee'ing for over 100 dmg for the first time!<br />
<br />
My only mistake was selecting another gimp class for high-end content, but hey!  At least I'm having fun now.  Don't get me wrong... The Shaman is still my favorite class.  Things just started to stagnate a bit for me, so I'm trying something different.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Fozy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Hmmm I don't seem to have any trouble when I go lfg unless I am looking for a group fairly late at night, people are usually sending me tells for groups when I am not /role infact.  I have noticed that there is fewer people late at night but that is about it.  Oh lots of the group invites I get are for places like PoV and such with 55+ group members, generally in those cases I just pop my rogue in the group and slow/buff with my shaman outside.</div></div><hr />

Well, I did that sort of thing before. Honestly. First question was always &quot;got a cleric?&quot;. ALWAYS. And then I say &quot;not yet&quot;, and get &quot;call me when you do&quot;.<br />
<br />
I think the time I did that and got asked &quot;Who's slower?&quot; in reply (No, I wasn't anon or /role) is when i started questioning myself  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">A decent Enchanter with DC is impossible for even the best played Shaman to compete with.  Mana regen on demand for your casters, and the best CC in the game is even tough to beat out.  But adding a DC pet that outdamages most of the melee in the game is the icing on the cake.  I'm not suggesting they nerf DC, but Shamans have nothing that can even remotely compete with it.<br />
<br />
A Shaman &amp; Enchanter in the same group is having your cake and eating it too.  Unfortunately, having a BL and Enchanter in the same group is just a better cake to eat.  We only have one defense, but we are getting attacked from all sides.  <br />
<br />
Stick with friends and Guildmates and leave the ignorant players to their PLd Chanters and BLs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">It definitely feels like numbers have dropped, and with them grouping opportunities. The number of non-soloing classes, especially pure melee, going LFG is small, I guess they're also finding groups very hard to come by.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, seeing as how my Beastlord is 55, and my shaman is 62, I can't argue there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Trazzaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">LOL  I  dont ever  go  LFG now .. I dont dare or i would have  5 to 7 tells in  that many minutes<br />
<br />
I  can  be  anon  and  people just  know me and  send me tells for  groups  from PoV  to  Koda'Taz and anywhere in between..  Like Predicus I too am on the Brell Serilis server and  get  tells  from  the &quot;uber&quot; guilds asking me to join them  in GOD, elementals, Sol Ro, or Hard Ldon's quite often.    so  /shrug  maybe it  is a  summer thing on some servers  but to me at least  brell seems to be  alive and  kicking.</div></div><hr />

<br />
DC is viable in Kael.  Even in PoI you're better off charming something else.<br />
<br />
A skilled Enchanter can use CoD (Command of Druzzil) and TD (Total Domination) to make it look easy - but charming is not something that comes naturally to all. And yes in normal LDON's a Charmed pet is a nice addition to the DPS of the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Spring is here, summer soon.  People need to get out and live a little, so not as many groups.  Add to this all the talk about how useless shamans are, theres not as many groups left for those that are playing.<br />
Prices and slow selling have happened each of the 3 summers I've been around (just over 2 years).  A lower quantity of casual people buying gear coupled with a high percentage of the population farming for items to sell drops the prices severely.  Schools are letting out so count on a lot of kids playing eq endlessly, creating a lot of items to sell.<br />
Has happened every year that I've seen.</div></div><hr />
