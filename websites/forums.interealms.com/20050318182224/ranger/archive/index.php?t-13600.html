<br />
I've got lvl 1 now and sure it jacks my attack up nicely.  But before I sepnd it on lvl 2 and 3 is it worth it?  What's the atk/speed increase?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taewedar</div><div class="date">11-08-2002, 04:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The haste increase is 5, 10 then 15% on level 3. I believe the atk goes 100,120, 140.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BelzarQuickfoot</div><div class="date">11-08-2002, 05:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks Tae:)<br />
<br />
Any thoughts on if it's worth it to get guardian 3?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hopwin</div><div class="date">11-08-2002, 05:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Versus what? 140 atk, 15% above the cap haste... I cannot think of any other AA's that are even comparable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jennalynn Rubyblade</div><div class="date">11-08-2002, 05:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Remember thought that because we are Melee, we get a bonust % to any ATK increasing items.<br />
<br />
I found that this also applied to this AA and at first lvl our 100 ATK adds about 130 ATK.  I haven't increased my lvls in this yet since I've been working on Defense AAs.<br />
<br />
So, if this bonus melee % (estimated 30% from the 100 to 130 increase from lvl 1) applies to the 2nd and 3rd lvls, then you should get 156 and 182 ATK respectively.<br />
<br />
I will eventually train in this more and when I do, I'll post the numbers if no one else has done this yet :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dlaritan</div><div class="date">11-08-2002, 05:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well, since v3 haste is overwritten by an AE bardsong, it doesnt seem worth the 6aa points to get another 52atk after you buy level 1.<br />
<br />
This skill still seems pretty worthless to me.  Ferocity is FAR more useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">valphoo</div><div class="date">11-08-2002, 06:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">what dlaritain said...<br />
<br />
if you have a bard this skill is a flaming pile of......<br />
bard givs you 30% v3 haste<br />
forest gives 15% v3 haste...<br />
<br />
I would rather have 6 AA point spent someplace else andmore haste ) <br />
<br />
<br />
BUT.. this skill is pretty cool is normal pick up groups and when you solo. however, due to the reuse timmer I see pretty much no reason to bother with this skill till you have about 200 AA points.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The fact that you can activate it simultaneously with Trueshot and that it stacks with every ATK buff I can think of is just too lovely for words...<br />
<br />
edit:  There are bards in this game?<br />
<br />
/em looks under rocks for the elusive bards.<br />
<br />
Seriously, I'm on the least populated blue server of them all, and bards are rarer than hens teeth.  I think I can name TWO 60+ bards, and neither are in my guild.  I'm thinking I should probably level a bard bot for raids to stand back quietly singing a damage shield song.. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deadman</div><div class="date">11-09-2002, 09:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would rather have taken a change in the reuse timer instead of the change in speed/attack. 15 min at lvl 1, 10 min at lvl 2, and 5 min at level 3. The skill doesnt last all that long to make it overpowering at a lower reuse timer if kept at level 1 stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dlaritan</div><div class="date">11-09-2002, 10:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If the haste was where it was pre-release, 30-60-90 it would be worth it maybe because it would be better than an AE bardsong.<br />
<br />
The issue is that the bardsong that GoTF cant stack with is an AE song... so... if you have *one* bard on your raid, you get more haste from the bard</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Treant</div><div class="date">11-09-2002, 10:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess bards became so rare noone even knows what songs do they have :). <br />
Bards have NO AE haste song. Warcry of the vah shir - luclin song  (25 % haste which allows you to go over cap) was made AE when Luclin just came out but it was nerfed very fast. Now this song and PoP upgrade for it - Riziona's call of flame ( 30% haste allowing you to go over cap) are group only songs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dlaritan</div><div class="date">11-09-2002, 11:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know that when im not with a bard, I still have war song of the vah shirr</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Relv</div><div class="date">11-09-2002, 12:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got level 1 but will finish the rest up later.  It's ok, but the main reason I bought it is to have wolf form without the illusion in outdoor zones :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dargathi</div><div class="date">11-09-2002, 01:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">it stacks with all haste (including bard haste) and all atk buffs..<br />
<br />
that means ytou get 5/10/15% above any other class over the haste cap</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Icye</div><div class="date">11-10-2002, 09:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think if you had all AA's then you would rock  so get 3 in ferocity and in Guardian</div></div><hr />

what is refresh time?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ziguld</div><div class="date">11-11-2002, 08:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do not confuse 'bard haste' with v3 haste.<br />
<br />
EQ has 3 forms of haste.<br />
v1 is item haste, FBSS or Swiftwind for example<br />
v2 is spell haste, VoG or DotB<br />
v3 is the weapon haste, this 'raises' haste cap, or rather directly effects the delay of your weapons thus increasing your total haste.<br />
<br />
Warsong of Vahshir or its lesser Battlecry have conflicting v3 hastes as well as the new Rizola's Call of Fire.  This is why some people are saying its not worth it.  Up to you, quite often on raids a bard is put in the ranger group for increased DPS, thats my guild.  Yours you might never see a bard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BelzarQuickfoot</div><div class="date">11-11-2002, 09:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild isn't smart enough to listen to me and give us rangers a bard for increased DPS.<br />
<br />
/shrug oh well thanks for the idea's guys working up crit3 atm then probably finish off my nd's or o for ferocity.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kianwan</div><div class="date">11-13-2002, 10:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dargathi you are wrong, it doesnt stack with bard haste songs that go over the cap (ie. v3 haste)<br />
So if you have a bard in your group its worthless, if not its a bit usefull but due to the way haste is calculated anything above 100% is only half as effective as that under so if your a cap it will be hardly noticeable haste effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shooteneq1</div><div class="date">11-14-2002, 02:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">your right only 15 slots, thats what i get for posting at like 6am from playing EQ all night hehee my mind not allways here, anyway 15 means EVEN LESS slots for buffs lol =P<br />

Burning through potions on raids...or end up not using the skill. Not using it is a waste. But the shrink nazi's won't let me be! aaaaaah!<br />
<br />
Really need to address that. Reshrink every 15 mins is insane. and VT isn't really Archery-friendly, I have to melee most of the time. /sigh<br />
<br />
The Bard stacking is annoying, but can be easy to work around. Don't just blindly hit the skill while the song is playing. I hate it when that happens! =/<br />
