<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nurakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Looking for a place to 2 box my warrior and shaman for decent experience.  any suggestions?<br />
<br />
65 warrior <br />
5800 unbuffed hp<br />
BoC / Primal for weapons<br />
41 haste<br />
<br />
60 shaman<br />
JBB<br />
3k mana pool<br />
torpor enabled</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Smasherr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">hmmm<br />
<br />
warriors are kinda mana sponges.<br />
<br />
i would think that you could do first tier planes...CT...that type stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I can dualbox my wife and myself, 61 WAR/61 SHM, in tier 1 planes without difficulty.  With 65 WAR/60 SHM you should be able to add HoH and PoS/PoV trash to your repertoire.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">experience in CT at 65 is lousy at best, while everything is dblue you get about a couple of blue of aa an hour.<br />
I'd suggest desert trash in PoS. Malo on pull, get slow in and you win. Don't try that without malo, you will get too many resists on slow, and then you can't keep up healing fast enough to get a second chance to slow.<br />
A decent spot outside PoP would be luggards in Nadox, at 65 you can single or max double pull those, and they slow easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>lordkaldron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You should be able to do tier 2 planes no problem and then some. I duo-box a 63sk and 62shm, we can do BoT np although it's not usually worth it without a stunner (damn gating mobs, having to beat them down 4 times until there dead isn't worth it). Then again I should try loading up some stronger nukes on the shaman and seeing if I can take him down fast enough .. I rarely use DD's though. Tactics seems duo-able too.. I just haven't had time to try it out yet. <br />
<br />
For a faster rate of kills PoS desert is my favourite spot so far. Much less crowded than PoV. I loved PoV undead skele's but they're a pain to split most of the time. PoV frogs on the river shores are pretty good too, or anywhere up near dragon door etc.<br />
<br />
Damn there's a million places you can hunt. Shaman + strong tank make a great combo. Not sure what else to say, just explore pop and you'll find some great places - no zones outside of PoP compare for exp.</div></div><hr />
