<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Orecets Ellrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So i Tried handing the gem to the Female ogre, she walked around poofed near the water. So I ran to the loc the guide told me to, with invis to animals up and swam down to the bottom of the ocean.<br />
<br />
Now I am DEAD SURE I had invis to animals up, and STILL a killer shark being true to his DAMNED named killed me dead to death.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind i am level 29, but I SHOULD be able to do this quest right?<br />
<br />
Can I just skip this step and hand woe and envy and Marr's promise to the WK Spirit? Or would that be a waste of quest pieces?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help,<br />
Ellrick</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I honestly don't know about minimum faction for the test of Wisdom.  The faction bump from turning in the gem you get from the test of Patience is larger than the 1st 2 gem bumps.<br />
<br />
I died to a Killer Shark my 1st time, too.  2nd time was fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Orecets Ellrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">oh yeah and can i hail the npcs needed underwater with inivis to animals up?<br />
<br />
or do i need to drop it?<br />
<br />
Is the killer shark the only one who can see thru the invis?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kervin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Did it a few days ago.<br />
<br />
You CAN hail all npcs with Invis vs Animals active.<br />
<br />
Regular Sharks conned indifferent with IVA active. They scowled otherwise.<br />
<br />
Never ran into a Killer Shark; so cannot give you my inout there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I did the quest a week or so ago, using invis to animals. I saw a couple of killer sharks and they weren't the slightest bit interested. <br />
<br />
The spirits aren't animals, therefore you are not invis to them and can hail and talk to them just fine.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't skip this part of the quest, as you might later find you don't have a high enough spirit faction if you do. I'm not sure about this though.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>snt_asher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Did this just the other day at lvl 39  had IVA up the regular sharks were indiff, was there about 15 or so min and the killer shark atk me even with IVA up i think he can see though it.
