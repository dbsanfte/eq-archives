<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Birus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi. I haven't bought this game yet or beta tested it but it was just wondering what ya'll thought of this game? Is it any good? Does it suck really bad? Imo it just looks like doing boring chores for hours on end and doing stuff you could do in rl online but hey i could be wrong!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thantu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I beta tested for it (I live to beta, heck I bought a PS2 just so I could beta EQOA).  It IS cute, and a lot of fun.  If you like the SIMs, you will probably love it, though I did miss the sending them off to work to get easy money (I'm antisocial, so I forced my SIMs into the &quot;virtual-slave gnome making workshop of despairTM.&quot;  I don't think I'd let my kids play it (assuming I had any) without me though.  The whole time I was playing the words, &quot;We met on the internet....&quot; kept ringing in my head :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Meener</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">How do you get involved in beta tests like that?</div></div><hr />

Well, ok.  If there are upcoming games, hit the designer's forums and front pages.  Try to be active in the forums if possible, ask intelligent questions and provide a few ideas.  Fileplanet is a good place to find betas if you are a member, sometimes companies will mail me from previous beta's, sometimes friends find them on the web and PM me (and I do the same for them, buddy just messaged me with Horizon's beta signup, actually).  I also try to get a pretty good demographic spread as I have 1 Intel system and 1 AMD system, both pretty current, and my wife being a female gamer is often a good tip in.  Of course, the Dark Elves can be very persuasive as well... :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My prediction:  The SimsOnline will surpass EQ's subscription totals in about 3 days.  From there it will blow every other online game out of the WATER for years to come.  <br />
Face facts people, it has got way more appeal than EQ or any other such &quot;Dungeons and Dragons&quot; nerdy type game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>chouka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I Hated the sims &quot;offline&quot; I will not like the online version any better. This said, I am an exeption since everybody else loves the games so I agree, it will be big. Good anything that makes the gaming industry and the online industry bigger is good for gamers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rafeeky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My wife is addicted to this game.  She has all of the expansions and she was personally invited to beta it.  Now I have to share my 56k line...sob sob</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">As long as they continue to add content, ways to interact, and keep it balanced so new items dont far outweigh the older itesm... I can see this game going great distances.  I was too in the playtest and I enjoyed the game well enough.  I had a few roomies and we had a small-medium house with pizza machine (heh), pool and some other skill items.  Plus I built a bedroom and everything.  There was some problems with the big popular houses and charge zones but all in all the game is fun if you like the Sims.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Armak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Now if EQ is a graphic mIRC what is not online Sims - OMG people are going too try to set up dates and other stuff they cant handle in RL.<br />
<br />
Baah pretty disgusting in my own little opinion...<br />
<br />
...and Land is right, this game will be bigger than everything else in the online gaming industry.<br />
