<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I hadn't seen an update posted here in awhile, so I figured I'd make a quicky post for those of us who try to avoid the SOE class boards like they're the plague. The list below was posted Dec. 17 by Kytherea.<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Fix Shaman healing! We need larger, more efficient single target blast heals to deal with GoD mobs as well as group heals (perhaps group HoT is more in line with our class) to help in raid situations (MGB Option would be very helpful).<br />
(currently being evaluated)<br />
<br />
2. Improve shaman DPS and burst DPS.<br />
(currently being evaluated)<br />
[DPS for all classes to be re-evaluated in the future]<br />
<br />
3. AE Malos or lose the insane recast delay on Malos. <br />
(currently being evaluated)<br />
<br />
4. Make FA less of a hassle, 25 minute duration, 5 second recast. <br />
(currently being evaluated)<br />
<br />
5.An upgrade or addition to Cannibalization, allowing (at the same ratio), greater or more frequent conversions of HP to Mana. <br />
(currently being evaluated)<br />
<br />
6. Add direct combat effects to all of our level 60+ stat buffs. <br />
(currently being evaluated)<br />
<br />
7. Reduce DoT aggro! <br />
(currently being evaluated)<br />
<br />
8. Endurance regen buff. <br />
(currently being evaluated)<br />
<br />
9. Shaman Survivability, Shamans are the least durable of the Slowing classes. This makes it highly risky for us to fufill our role. Please increase a shamans ability to survive the inevitable agro that slowing often draws. <br />
(currently being evaluated) <br />
*community suggestions added below*<br />
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A. AAs:<br />
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;- VP AA — reduce resist, increase duration and lower casting time.<br />
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;- implement a defensive buff that lasts for 5 ticks (30 seconds) and procs and unresistable or lure-based 50% slow.<br />
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;- implement something similar to the beastlord Protective Spirit discipline.<br />
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;- implement an avoidance similar to the monk disc.<br />
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;- implement aconcussion type ability that reduces aggro.<br />
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;B. Improve the root spell line.<br />
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;C. Increase AC/HP of pets.<br />
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;D. Increase dodge cap.<br />
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;E. Allow shaman to block using a shield.<br />
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;F. Increase shaman mitigation/avoidance.<br />
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;G. Better shaman itemization.<br />
<br />
10. TGB &quot;Target Group Buff&quot; Group shrink spell that effects people out of your group. <br />
(currently being evaluated)<br />
<br />
<br />
Also from Kytherea:<br />
The next update to class your list will be 1/7/2005 and will then be changed to updating on the first Friday of each month, so the next update will follow on 2/4/2005 and so on.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Predicus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I am still catching up on the current trends of the shaman community, so disregard if they have already fixed some of the issues I bring up.<br />
<br />
-Raise ATK spell cap-  I was running into this issue w/ some rangers.<br />
                              They were capping out on ATK w/ self-buffs,<br />
                              thereby not needing/wanting the Avatar line cast<br />
                              on them.  I can see the devs not wanting to raise<br />
                              the worn ATK cap level, but possibly allowing<br />
                              spells to stack.  Just a thought.<br />
<br />
-Allowing ID focus line to affect AOE's-  Either this or create a new<br />
                                                      focus.  I gave up on the cold<br />
                                                      dd's long ago due to the<br />
                                                      ridiculous cast time attached to<br />
                                                      them.  This goes along with<br />
                                                      the &quot;raise shaman dps&quot;, so its<br />
                                                      already listed- figured I would<br />
                                                       give an example of an<br />
                                                       improvement.<br />
<br />
Just a few thoughts for now- will add anything I come up with later.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
As a ranger, I can tell you that this doesnt happen.  Self-buffed w/ focus my attack hits 1950ish.  Add in Avatar, Ferocity, chanter haste, and a bard in group and I can hit 2500+ attack.<br />
<br />
FYI, if that ranger was using a primal for avatar proc, then the avatar cast from primal goes against worn attack cap while all other forms of avatar do not.</div></div><hr />

Can't raise something that doesn't exsist. There is no cap to attack from spells only from gear. As mentioned avatar proced from a primal weapons counts in the worn gear cap and is the only spell that does.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The rangers in question were not using primals.  The only other thing I could think of was they possibly being maxxed out on buff slots and not wanting to pick up avatar.  I know this happened a few times on raids, but I swear I ran into this problem with rangers that I was grouped with.  Is there an issue with avatar possibly not stacking w/ a ranger self-buff?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grokii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think some of these items might be out of date, and others I think we're asking for the wrong things.  So you know where I'm coming from, I think OoW has partially addressed things like upgrade to healing (ie, group heals), upgrade to canni, combat stats on stat buffs.  So some of those things we shouldn't be asking for.<br />
<br />
Secondly, I believe we're asking for some things that will change class balance in other issues.  These things take time and Sony is famous for dragging their feet or not chaning things other then nerfing.  So, I agree they'd be nice, and possibly even needed.  But why are we asking for things we really don't have a flying chance in hell to be changed?<br />
<br />
I move that the following issues get removed from the list completely:  1, 2, 5, 6, 8, and 9.<br />
<br />
My reasoning is as follows:<br />
<br />
1)  We already got group heals through OoW and their idea of 'class balance' means we won't be getting healing upgrades other then what we got in OoW any time soon or ever.<br />
<br />
2)  They've already stated that they will be evaluating all classes DPS, and it's just too general in what we want changed.  Perhaps we should focus on a specific spell line (ie, ice or poison nukes?) and ask for specific changes instead?<br />
<br />
5)  We got an upgrade to Canni in OoW both in spell and AA<br />
<br />
6)  We got combat effects or over-cap in OoW spells<br />
<br />
8)  Ever since they changed Melee to use Endurance for skills they've been very picky about this.  Its been sitting there for a long time, I'm thinking its not going to happen so why not put in something else?<br />
<br />
9) Too general and touching on the class balance issue.  Perhaps we can take some of these specific suggestions and add them as their own issue?<br />
<br />
Here are some new ideas off the top of my head or already listed in #9 that we could use to replace them:<br />
<br />
A)  Change or provide an upgrade to VP that has a resist modifyer<br />
<br />
B)  Upgrade the Rabid Bear AA so we could use it when we get unwanted aggro either by shedding aggro when we change or by giving us decent tanking ability so we can survive a bit until tank can get aggro back.  This would solve shaman survivablity and make bearform something fun instead of nearly never used.<br />
<br />
C)  Give us group heals similiar to a paladin's of similar level<br />
<br />
D)  Our poison dots create more aggro then our magic dots of similar damage both on the inital cast and per tick.  Please lower aggro of the poison dots or give us a way to lower our hate like how necros, SKs, monks, rangers, or rogues have.<br />
<br />
E)  Reduce casting time and increase damage of our DD spells, but increase recast time so they could only be used once or twice during a fight.<br />
<br />
F)  Change spirit of cheetah and scale of wolf to work with today's content.  Scale of wolf to stack with other forms of SoW for the faster movement speed until broken by the normal rules.  As for spirit of cheetah, reduce the recast time to 1-2 minutes and allow it to stack with SoW.  With mounts that allow anyone with plat to go at almost bard speed this shouldn't be a balance issue.<br />
<br />
So, there are my 6 issues to replace the 6 I listed.  I'm pretty sure there will be pleanty of people that want to keep generic things or class balance things... but my new ideas are more specific and do address these things as well.  I just needed to get this off my chest, I expect flames but am cautiously optimisitc that perhaps others feel the same way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>cosikfin-eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">the spell canni from oow isnt a upgrade just a copy of of the GoD spell</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tenien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">&quot;Is there an issue with avatar possibly not stacking w/ a ranger self-buff?&quot;<br />
<br />
Doesn't stack with Greater Wolf Form/Feral Form spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">1) We already got group heals through OoW and their idea of 'class balance' means we won't be getting healing upgrades other then what we got in OoW any time soon or ever.<br />
<br />
If they want to continue to nerf slow, then I'm going to continue to ask for a higher blast heal ratio relative to druids and clerics.  It has been proven that our heals were directly balanced by our ability to slow 75%.  Since PoP, our heal ratio has remained the same relative to other priests, but slow has steadily been nerfed to the point we are at now.  EVERYTHING mitigates.  <br />
<br />
<br />
2) They've already stated that they will be evaluating all classes DPS, and it's just too general in what we want changed. Perhaps we should focus on a specific spell line (ie, ice or poison nukes?) and ask for specific changes instead?<br />
<br />
While it might force them to evaluate a specific area, it might also be easier for them to decline that specific area.  I'd much rather just say &quot;more dps please&quot; and let them figure it out.  Personally, I'd like to see our curse line back up to necro levels, and our ice nuke faster casting and harder hitting, but I'll take dps wherever they give it.  <br />
<br />
<br />
5) We got an upgrade to Canni in OoW both in spell and AA<br />
Agreed.  I feel fine mana wise now.  The new bigger biting canni is saving me tons of in-combat headaches.  <br />
<br />
6) We got combat effects or over-cap in OoW spells <br />
Still don't feel like they addressed this.  Well.. they did.. but I still don't see any noticeable affects.  Then again, I haven't seen any good parses yet either.  Sta seems ok, but is the new agility worth it?  Likewise with the 5% dmg modifier.  My complaint more along the lines that we just have too many buffs to cast.  <br />
<br />
Add the dmg modifier and 7% avoidance into focus, and I'd be happy.  The druid HP buff does mana, AC, adn HP.  Why can't ours do Dmg modifier, avoidance, and HP??  So.. on one hand we have buffs of still dubious value, and way to many of them to cast and still have fun.<br />
<br />
8) Ever since they changed Melee to use Endurance for skills they've been very picky about this. Its been sitting there for a long time, I'm thinking its not going to happen so why not put in something else?<br />
Agree.  I think what the community was feeling was the uselessness of our buffs.. and we reached out for something that might be truly meaningful.  Something that would make a melee group say &quot;we MUST have a shaman&quot;.  If endurance isn't it, then a rework of our existing buffs, including additional attack/effect buffs, would be in order.<br />
<br />
9) Too general and touching on the class balance issue. Perhaps we can take some of these specific suggestions and add them as their own issue?<br />
<br />
I don't think its at all vague.  Both clerics and druids got spells that directly increase their personal survivability.  Shaman do not.  Its like a cruel joke of SOE to give us some of the highest aggro spells in the game and then no way avoid trouble in an emergency.  Giving Druids the fast cast dmg mitigation spell was still, at least to me, a slap in the face.<br />
<br />
Upgrade the Rabid Bear AA....<br />
<br />
When I hear the word &quot;Rabid Bear&quot; I cringe.  Dear god just let that stupid AA die...:)<br />
<br />
One thing that I think might replace the canni issue from the list, is a new bihili.  Make bihili 30-40 attack, up its speed some, and that would make it worth casting again.</div></div><hr />

they have shrinking devices and shrink potions in game. they even have items that drop in game that allow one to shrink themselves.<br />
<br />
shrink rods that mages can AE summon for 2750 mana a shot prolly would go very well with them. let's add that to the list, make it #11.</div></div><hr />

that's probably the best solution. it would be 2 new spells (single target and AE). maybe they can make it fun and have us quest for them. i miss questing for spells.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
2. Not really just a shaman issue but it affects us the same. Why is remove greater curse so rare of a spell? I would like to see the spell drop off other mobs or lower the cost of RGC in ldon. No way a lvl 54 spell should be 800 points when other lvl 50-ish spells are like 450. Hell make it a quest like blood of nadox is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Agree.  While they are at it, would it be a game breaker for our wolf spirit, to have Spirit of Wolf speed?????</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Balkamp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">1. Better burst healing for certain. With Yoppa, Marr's gift, Haste of Mithaniel &amp; AA's I'm getting some fair results, sometimes... A group heal or group HoT would be nice. Guessing that new spells are out of the question now that OOW spellsets are here. Perhaps increasing potency by 15%.<br />
<br />
2. DPS. I can sustain pretty fair DPS in places like MPG &amp; RS. This is with focus &amp; aa's considered. If I avoid aggro, &amp; use rains, which requires some fancy positioning if mezzed mobs are in the camp. Which is all to say &quot;hypothetically&quot;. Tank aggro, timing, positioning &amp; of course resists.... A LOT has to gell. I have to work my ass off.<br />
<br />
3. Reset the recast on Malos to something sane. When you don't have a TA or Nihil, you are totally dependent on this spell.<br />
<br />
4. FA. Sheesh this kills me. It's so good, I have to keep the melee covered with it. A longer duration OR shorter recast would be nice... I wouldnt ask for both.<br />
<br />
5. Woot pained memory. No need to envy those lucky shaman with Chaotic Pain anymore.<br />
<br />
6. Done, but needs work. the overcaps are quite nice. 5% dam. modifier my butt. We've figured out it affects the Base damage, reducing the desired effect. Avoidance could stand to be upped a few % too.<br />
<br />
7. Please fix dot aggro. It directly affects #2 &amp; #9. I don't expect to chain DoT's with impunity, none of us do. I don't expect however to have to be grouped with server top 10 tanks in order to maintain something close to achieving &quot;good&quot; DPS. Epic focus effect is not noticeable. I'm hesitant to spend the aa's for SCS. I'm not a druid, wizard, or mage. My damage doesn't come from the the initial tick from any of my &quot;go to&quot; spells. That's all SCS works on.<br />
<br />
8. Please. Why introduce this factor to the game without also including a way to enhance it? Did SoE intend it to be the melee equivalent of mana? I believe they did. I can get a buff to increase the amount &amp; regen of my mana pool, why isn't there the same for the endurance pool?<br />
<br />
9. See 7 in addition to the excellent ideas put out there by the community.<br />
<br />
10. Meh, low priority.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Guess I will put in my 2 cents. First off, I agree with a couple posters here that our &quot;List&quot; needs re-evaluating. Here are my thoughts on the current state of the list:<br />
1. Fix Shaman healing! We need larger, more efficient single target blast heals to deal with GoD mobs as well as group heals (perhaps group HoT is more in line with our class) to help in raid situations (MGB Option would be very helpful).<br />
(currently being evaluated)<br />
I am farily content with the status of my healing ability. My blast heal is adequate (nothing spectacular), but with all AAs and a good focus, its solid. I crit 1 in 4, or so, it casts fast, its big enough to save a tank, and certainly will save a caster. However, my REAL healing power lies in HoTs. Serenity is just the bomb. Now that they new OoW buffs have put me near the 10K hp mark, its a simple matter for me to canni and take damage until I can make FULL use of the spell on myself, and honestly, combined with our new Regen, popping it on a tank is enough of a saftey buffer for Clerics and Druids to use their more efficient CH spells, rather than their expensive blast heals. I ALWAYS work it out with the clerics in my groups, and I generally cast Serenity as the mob is inc, since my groups usually have a differnt person pulling than the MA. Giac, I know you think this type of thing is a trivial contribution to a group, but I beg to differ. Combine my new AA group HoT, and my Epic group HoT, and I have some very solid healing power at my disposal. Only POSSIBLE change I would request here would be &quot;Give us the Ancient Heal as a Regular, 69 spell&quot;. Honestly, healing upgrades are WAY WAY down on my list. However, I have never made it a secret that I do not WANT to be a &quot;main group healer in the highest cutting-edge content&quot;. <br />
2. Improve shaman DPS and burst DPS.<br />
(currently being evaluated)<br />
[DPS for all classes to be re-evaluated in the future]<br />
I wouldnt mind a bit of a bump here. Someone on another thread pointed out a general lack of &quot;poison nuke damage&quot; foci items (basically, only the foci that affect ALL nukes affect poison nukes) and I agree. I GOOD, common poison nuke Foci, that affects both our blast and our rains, would be a wonderful upgrade. Combined with the full nuke AA's, it would make our burst DPS at least RESPECTABLE. Overall though, I am satisfied. Not elated, or even &quot;happy&quot;, but satisfied. New pet, with new mage toys (easy enough to grab 2 sets in the bazaar before running off to group), the new Curse, the new poison and ice nukes and rains, all combine to make us &quot;fair&quot; instead of &quot;dismal&quot; in teh DPS department. I also think that our over-cap and +damage buffs are a reasonable help. I havent seen any official parses, but I know my friends LOVE the overcaps. Rogues ask me to Ancestral Aid for the stats, not the heals, LOL. <br />
<br />
Funny story, its a running joke in my guild as to who does the most DPS on Quarm. The joke is, BLAZZ does the most DPS on Quarm, because I am always the &quot;rogue group shaman&quot; so I keep them FA, Slow Cured, and overcapped. Me + 3 rogues probably do 70% of the overall damage to Quarm on the first 3 heads, LOL. The amount of DPS I add by curing the rogues and keeping them FA, etc, is pretty fun to see. These guys always tell me their numbers (do all rogues parse like my guildies?)<br />
<br />
Anyway, DPS wise, a good, solid poison nuke focus, equal to the Ice versions we can get, would be a nice idea for us. <br />
3. AE Malos or lose the insane recast delay on Malos.(currently being evaluated)<br />
/shrug. We are fairly powerful de-buffers now. An AE malos would be way overpowering IMHO, unless it was both resistable and lower than Malo in effectiveness. Sorry. I really dont want the farm. A HUGE part of our downfall was the incredible power of our class in the Kunark-Velious days. This request is meaningless to me, if anything, I am against it. <br />
4. Make FA less of a hassle, 25 minute duration, 5 second recast. (currently being evaluated)<br />
Champion is a decent compromise. I have learned to live with FA as it is. In groups, its easy enough to time to my pet, and cast it on the 2-4 other group members (including caster class pets) that are there. The spell slot doesnt bother me anymore either, its my &quot;9th&quot; spell. There IS an upside to short-duration buffs, makes us a bit more desirable in groups. Since I absolutely notice an improvement on pets DPS when hes FA, I am sure there is a decent increase for melee DPS as well, even on Warriors. Not an issue for me.<br />
5.An upgrade or addition to Cannibalization, allowing (at the same ratio), greater or more frequent conversions of HP to Mana. (currently being evaluated)<br />
Sorry, this one needs to go. Between the new canni (yeah yeah, I know its the same &quot;ratio&quot;), Cannibilization (canni 5), and Channeling, mana is not even remotely an issue for me. I dont care what other classes can regen for mana, like necros. This is fine, not even CLOSE to an issue for me.<br />
6. Add direct combat effects to all of our level 60+ stat buffs. (currently being evaluated)<br />
OK I gotta agree with a couple of people who are pusing to have some of our buffs combined. Perhaps a &quot;new&quot; buff that is a combo of Sense, Fort and Might, no HPs (other than the overcap STA), both a single-target and group, MGBable version, would be the ticket. I LIKE my new buffs. I dont REALLY mind the fact that we have 3 or 4 &quot;desirables&quot; these days. I think they help. I think every little bit helps. Thats why I bid on items that have +30 hps from my previous items. 30 hps isnt gonna ever save me, but 8-10 such upgrades will. Every little bit helps. <br />
<br />
Of course, I may be on the biased side, because my guild has 3-5 very active raiding shaman, so there is NEVER a lack of buffers. Each raid we assign 1 buff to each shaman, and other than very special situations, THOSE are who do the buffs. Works out great. No mem-remem-mem-remem. My only exception is the MA, SA and puller. If they ask me for a buff, they get it, ASAP, regardless of who its assigned too. Otherwise, if I am on Wunshi, and someone says &quot;fort please&quot; I refer them to the Fort buffer. <br />
<br />
SOE isnt stupid with this kind of stuff. They created a few nice, desirable buffs, and then, they created AAs to have a place to put them. I personally have maxxed my new-buff-slot AAs. So has most of my guildmates. Mini-goals, and mini-time sinks to achieve them. Keeps us playing, and I dont mind. I felt a great sense of achievement when I finished that 5th extra buff slot, and if it was something I could do in a couple hours, it wouldnt have been nearly as gratifying. Just my opinion on such things. <br />
7. Reduce DoT aggro! <br />
(currently being evaluated)<br />
This is now NUMBER ONE ISSUE for me. Period. I want to be able to stack Curse and Blood of Yoppa on a mob without fear of being summoned or getting aggro.<br />
8. Endurance regen buff. <br />
(currently being evaluated)<br />
/yawn. Who cares. Might be nice, but honestly, I could care less. <br />
9. Shaman Survivability, Shamans are the least durable of the Slowing classes. This makes it highly risky for us to fufill our role. Please increase a shamans ability to survive the inevitable agro that slowing often draws. (currently being evaluated)<br />
NUMBER TWO ISSUE! I dont have the new AE slow yet, I understand it helps in this department somewhat, but I am definitely on the side of the &quot;We need an ability to save our lives in certain situations&quot;. I have a hard time coming up with a reasonable one, but I wouldnt mind a &quot;Stonestance&quot; type AA with a reasonable re-use. Even a -resist modifier on VP would almost be enough. <br />
10. TGB &quot;Target Group Buff&quot; Group shrink spell that effects people out of your group. <br />
(currently being evaluated)<br />
I honestly dont understand why this hasnt been done yet, however, its hardly an issue I consider &quot;make or break&quot;. Keep it on the list, but its not near the top, thats fur sure. <br />
<br />

(currently being evaluated) <br />
/yawn. Who cares. Might be nice, but honestly, I could care less.<br />
I am with you on your post Blazz, all except the above quote.<br />
<br />
To melee, Endurance is their mana.  As a 70 rogue with Daggerfall I use 625 Endurance at the onset of a fight.  Not to mention the use of Frenzied Stabbing Discipline which has a refreshtime of 15 minutes and the other 2 main DPS disc's Deadeye and the favorite of all rogues, Duelist both with approximately 20 minutes reuse (epic 1.5 has a reduction of 1 minute to Duelist only).  I am often out of Endurance even with a fully buffed Endurace pool of about 6500.  I do not have the luxury of sitting around waiting to regen my &quot;melee mana&quot;.  <br />
<br />
I could not use Daggerfall, Frenzied Stabbing Discipline, Deadeye and Duelist all in one fight because I simply do not have the endurance to back to back all of these disc's, even regening 30 points per tick.<br />
<br />
I am aware that I must be causious and conserve my &quot;melee mana&quot; but just as there is a Clairity line of spells to keep you going, I would love the Shaman to play the role of melee buffer and have a spell that kept us going.  I would like to use all of the 4 disc's as soon as I was able, but Endurance regen is simply no where near enough<br />
<br />
Number 8 on the top 10 list is fine with me as it is not a priority, but indeed something that is 'due' to the Shaman.<br />
<br />
And yeah.... something about 300(+/-) DPS sustained that makes rogues all warm inside, parsing is a must  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I could not use Daggerfall, Frenzied Stabbing Discipline, Deadeye and Duelist all in one fight because I simply do not have the endurance to back to back all of these disc's, even regening 30 points per tick.<br />
I wasnt trying to trivialize Endurance (well ok, maybe I was a little) but overall, I think SOE designed it to function in a specific way. There is a reason you cant use all thes discs in one fight. They dont want you to. Its fairly obvious to me that SOE has the whole END system where they want it. Excess regen might be considered unbalancing to them, or at least something they dont WANT to balance around. Otherwise, we would almost certainly have seen SOME form of END regen by now. <br />
<br />
Personally, if I HAD to make this a choice and HAD to pick an implementation, I would go for the original idea of our Ward thingy being for END regen, Clerics for HPS, and Druid for a little HP, a little mana (like paragon), and all stackable. That would be in line with out &quot;theme&quot; of Shaman buffing melee, Clerics healing, and Druids Nature-Po9-Oakskin line.</div></div><hr />

As soon as clerics and druids get some form of slowing, ill agree with this. Yes, lots of mobs nowadays mitigate and are immune. Far too much. <br />

One or the other. I agree here.<br />
<br />
4. Make FA less of a hassle, 25 minute duration, 5 second recast. <br />
<br />
FA is powerful enough as it is, and any decent shamans FA lasts 11 mins, which is enough for anyone swinging a weapon in a group.<br />
<br />
5.An upgrade or addition to Cannibalization, allowing (at the same ratio), greater or more frequent conversions of HP to Mana. <br />
<br />
Nope. Canni is fine. Pained Memory is awesome. Any decent XP group can have a shaman as sole slower/buffer/healer with canni5 and PM with NO mana regen spells.<br />
<br />
6. Add direct combat effects to all of our level 60+ stat buffs. <br />

<br />
1. See #7.<br />
2. Um, lessee the slowing classses: <br />
Enchanter: fold like the silk classes they are when their rune fades<br />
Ranger: Earthcaller is spotty at best, and tho, they tank better then shaman (snap aggro with Tangling weeds and Weaponshield) dont really fall into the 'slower' category<br />
Beastlord: Low mitigation like the leather classes they are but their avoidance is waay too high. BLs got the sun, moon and stars when they were created.<br />
That said, equivilantly geared Shaman tank just as well as Beastlords.<br />
If youre getting aggro where you dont think you shouldnt and worry about getting beat on  then a: dont have suck gear and b: see #2 and #7.<br />
<br />
10. TGB &quot;Target Group Buff&quot; Group shrink spell that effects people out of your group. <br />
<br />
Ive had the cool idea of class quests for useful/fun/interesting/community desired spells for each class. Something on par with epic 1.0 quests (duo-able to 1 groupable and takes a few days to a week or so for lvl 65-70s). <br />
The reqards would be the spells that each class has been crying for forever. Nothing game-breaking. Nothing even really powertful. Just something good/fun/desired.<br />
Shamans would be an AE shrink.<br />
Rangers would be a pet akin to the lvl 30 druid 'boo-boo-bear' pet, but a wolf.<br />
I dont really play or follow any of the other classes so im not too familiar with what would be cool for the others.<br />
And since they are quests, and the rewards are somewhat small, they are totally optional if you think they suck.<br />

<br />
I will address a couple points.<br />
Uuh... when did shaman become a DPS class?<br />
Its not about being a DPS class, its about being able to contribute reasonably to a group. Shaman are NOT a specialty class anymore, therefore, we need to do ALL our things &quot;better than average&quot;. No one is asking to Heal like a Cleric, Nuke like a Wizard, DOT like a Necro or Tank like a Warrior. We just want to be able to &quot;toss in&quot; these things, adjust to what the group needs. If the group doesnt need healing, then what good is just being a slower? Most groups can use us for Slow + Heal, or Slow + DPS, with healing being strictly for back-up. Its not unreasonable to ask for a bit more DPS to help us with group utility. <br />
??? What, like procs? Accuracy? Strikethru? Um, that stuff is best for effects on gear. Stat cap increases is plenty.<br />
They gave us some decent combat effects (avoidance, damage modifier,  overcap stats) but NOW the problem is it takes 4 or 5 buffs to get em all on there. What I think a lot of us would like to see is some form of &quot;combo buff&quot;, similar to the Diaku line, maybe that combines Sense and Might, or Fort + Sense + Might in one buff (no new hps, other than from overcap STA, so it stacks with Wunshi). <br />
Teach your tanks how to maintain aggro!<br />
This line here is a pretty strong indication that you have not had much experience trying to stack DOTs on mobs. Very few tanks can maintain enough aggro for us to stack more than 2 DOTs on a mob, which is one BIG reason we cant contribute much in the way of meaningful DPS. Even on raid mobs, its a game of &quot;lets see how many I can get before I get summoned&quot;. Theres a major bug here. Always has been. One poison DOT generates 10 times the aggro of wizard-mage nukes that do 10 times more damage. Thats not right. <br />
<br />
With regards to the emergency survivability issue and aggro, sometimes, its just not possible for tanks to get the proper aggro when you need to cast your spells. Slowing adds, for example, or the ability to drop a slow on a mob early in the fight for saftey purposes. &quot;Teach your tank to keep aggro&quot; isnt any kind of an answer to the DOT issue or the emergency survivability issue. Clerics have DA for cases when they get heal-aggro. I dont see why we shouldnt have something related to that, not invulneribility, per-say, but something. I also think you have no idea about the emergency abilities of some other classes, like Enchanters. Perhaps before you say Shaman dont need anything, you should do some research on what they have. <br />
Ive had the cool idea of class quests for useful/fun/interesting/community desired spells for each class. Something on par with epic 1.0 quests (duo-able to 1 groupable and takes a few days to a week or so for lvl 65-70s). <br />
The reqards would be the spells that each class has been crying for forever. Nothing game-breaking. Nothing even really powertful. Just something good/fun/desired.<br />
Shamans would be an AE shrink.<br />
Rangers would be a pet akin to the lvl 30 druid 'boo-boo-bear' pet, but a wolf.<br />
Fantastic idea. Would allow them to add a few spells without disrupting the current OoW Rune Turn In situation. I enjoyed the LoY quest spells. I was working them through myself, then they got solved so I just finished them, but it was a nice little addition to the game. Temp and Stoicism are now staples of Clerics and Shaman under 50. I dont understand why we dont see more quested spells, honestly. <br />
<br />
So other than the DOT aggro and &quot;teach your tank aggro&quot; thing, the post was fair enough. I think that part is what has people annoyed though.</div></div><hr />

This is a difficult question for me to judge, but I honestly do not think that there should be any &quot;walls&quot; from 60-65 whatsoever. Given the sheer QUANTITY of new killer gear available, and the fact that this new stuff has made older stuff (LDoN Hard drops, Ornate, etc) more affordable. 61-65 spells are extremely cheap as well, so getting yourself equipped with both armor and spells is easier than ever. Some OoW zones have very solid XP for these levels as well, and there are still some great XP-Loot spots in PoP.</div></div><hr />

Gotta agree with Blazz here except on 65 spells on BB lately as not many seem to be in PoP now the 65 spells are once again becoming horrendously expensive.<br />
Would also add that 60-65 has not been the problem.<br />
Its been when youre 65 and you try the harder content.<br />
With new gear etc plus a couple of OoW zones id say youd have no problem 60-65.<br />

Ok forgive me but I have no problem with aggro.  Up front yes my shaman is a bot.  2 boxxed with a 70 monk.  If my shaman gets aggro he is dead cause well he has poor gear.  Now as I said no problems with aggro.  I malos on incoming, slow as soon as gems refresh, cripple (66 version) epic 1 dot, blood of saryn, then breath of wunshi after that.  I never get aggro from my monk who is my tank.  You guys should know that monks are very poor at keeping aggro.  Granted he does tank with a SoT from time and I constantly use ID for the fear aggro. Also my shaman doesn't have his curse dots since most are from ldon (or I have no clue how to get them) Again my shaman is a bot but other then a few fights once in awhile he never gets aggro.  So if the reason he doesn't get aggro is cause I happened to pick out the low aggro spells then disregard this post but I have yet to have any problems with shaman aggro and I do these same things when I play him alone.</div></div><hr />

it is not the tanks job to get agro, it's your job NOT to get it.<br />
<br />
<br />
i think it was said that we have too many buffs. maybe we could combine them or something.<br />
<br />
when Oow first came out and i saw all these buffs that might be desirable i was thinking teh same thing.<br />
<br />
not anymore.<br />
<br />
the only buffs people ask for are wunshi, fort and haste. since they used to ask for focus, stamina and haste it's nothing new. i still cast sense though and i don't have might but i would also cast that.<br />
<br />
that's just in my experiance. yours may differ.<br />
<br />
as for dots and agro, i cast bane and anethima (sp?) only. i only get agro if the tank is a warrior with crappy weapons and if the tank can hold agro well i only get it if i proc too much with HoH. i adjust my DPS output depending on the tank in the group. 1 dot and no melee, 2 dots and no melee, 1 dot and 0 melee, etc...you have to be able control your agro since you have no way to directly lose it, short of gating, zoning or dying.<br />
<br />
also, more than 2 DoTs is overkill in almost any group i am in. rarely do all 3 DoTs fade. high DPS or low DPS groups, makes no difference.<br />
<br />
again, your experiance may differ.<br />

for me, the bottom line is, we are already the best class in game. let's get other classes up to our standards.</div></div><hr />

I get asked for Sense and Might all the time. Add in FA or Champ and thats a lot of buffs for one class. A Diaku type that combines Sense and Might would be enough for me to drop it though. <br />
as for dots and agro, i cast bane and anethima (sp?) only. i only get agro if the tank is a warrior with crappy weapons and if the tank can hold agro well i only get it if i proc too much with HoH.<br />
The Curse line, being the &quot;newest code&quot; is the one that generates the least aggro. Try stacking Bane and Blood of Yoppa, thats tricky with a &quot;mediocre aggro&quot; tank, and Blood of Yoppa + Blood of Saryrn is practically guarenteed to get you summoned. Sorry, but I shouldnt HAVE to adjust my spell choices around obvious game bugs. <br />
...you have to be able control your agro since you have no way to directly lose it, short of gating, zoning or dying.<br />
Thats the whole point of the &quot;emergency survivability&quot; request. Robe classes and Clerics have a TON more than we do, melee DPS classes all have something, Shaman is the ONLY class that is specifically designed to generate a HUGE amount of aggro with no way of getting rid of it. <br />
for me, the bottom line is, we are already the best class in game. let's get other classes up to our standards.<br />
I agree that we got a major power kick in OoW, but we are hardly the best class, as we once were. We arent in the bottom of the pile either though, so thats a good thing. <br />
<br />
Class balance and evolution is a process, not an event. We need to keep letting SOE know where we need tweaks and modifications, or we will be back in the same boat we saw a while back, when we were SO goddly we got &quot;nerfed by ommission&quot; in expansion after expansion. The LAST thing I wanna see is the next expasion to come out and have SOE think &quot;Well Shaman are all good, so lets not give them much&quot;. Been there, done that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">i said it once and i'll say it again...<br />
<br />
it is not the tanks job to get agro, it's your job NOT to get it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
True but also not 100% true.<br />
So to you a tanks job is basically to get hit,a tank shouldnt worry about Anger augs etc ?.<br />
Should i not be able to use BoS because its basically broken and generates fearsome aggro.<br />
<br />
Most groups im in (pick up groups lots of times) I can also Bane and Anathema a mob and have most times no problem with aggro.<br />
If i cast Bane and BoS then its virtually guaranteed aggro.<br />
Now you may say thats because BoS is more dmg than Anathema.<br />
Try stacking Bane and BoN which is a lot lower dmg but still produces horrendous aggro.<br />
Why should i not be able to do half the dmg a wiz does (no im not suggesting we should get wiz dps before anyone says it) yet generate a lot more aggro without any way to lose that aggro.<br />
From what i know of a few other classes if they get aggro they have ways of losing it ie FD,Jolt, etc but a way for a Shaman to lose aggro doesnt exist.The only way we can get rid of the aggro is by someone else getting it.<br />
<br />
As for your comment about Shaman being the best class if that is a personal opinion then i agree 100% with you there.I have never enjoyed (to me that is the key to why i play this game) any other class half as much as i have my Shaman.<br />
Now the other side of the coin is i bet you i could roll a cleric and progress a lot further into the end game than i could now.(No wish to thanks healing bores me ****less).<br />
Cleric,Warrior,Chanter (maybe not post OoW),Wizard,Ranger (especially with their new Harmony),Beastlord (ack that hurts),Pally,Bard,Necro.<br />
These are the classes i would say are more sought after than Shaman in the sort of game style i play (exp grouping rather than raiding.).<br />
SK,Mage,Rogue,Drood, I would consider to be on a level with us (Drood maybe higher ref lack of clerics).<br />
Monks are pretty much left behind in grouping game as their biggest asset FD pulling has been marginalised by Pacify etc.(yes their dps is good but other dps classes also bring more to a group).<br />
Berserker hmm well as Barm once said my only knowledge of a berserker was i once saw a Big axe with a Vah shir attached to it.<br />
<br />
Sure ive missed a couple of classes out but cant be assed to look it up at mo.<br />

what other classes are better than ours?<br />

well, how does a tank get hit? they get agro. so yea. i think warriors should have an AA ability that allows them to proc more than any other melee class. a warrior only version of 'WA' (i believe is the abbreviation).</div></div><hr />

From a purely subjective standpoint, I also think Shaman is the &quot;best&quot; class. But if I want to look at something like this objectively, then we arent quite there. <br />
<br />
&quot;Best&quot; is a relative term. EQ has become a game of specialists. The &quot;Best&quot; tank is a Warrior, but Paladins and SKs are occasionally adequate. The &quot;Best&quot; healer is a Cleric, but Druids and Shamans are sometimes enough to fufill that role. The &quot;Best&quot; DPS is Rogue (melee) or Wizard (spell), but other DPS classes are just fine in most situations. <br />
<br />
Slow used to be a MUCH bigger deal than it is today, and we were the &quot;Best&quot; at it. Now however, the importance of this specialty has been greatly diminished by mitigation and the upgrading of other classes. So now, being the &quot;Best&quot; slowers doesnt make us the &quot;Best&quot; overall, in my humble OBJECTIVE opinion. <br />
<br />
Now if you wanted to qualify your statement, and say that Shaman are the BEST adaptable class, or the BEST Jack-of-All class, or the BEST at filling whatever need a group might have class, then sure, I will agree with you. But the &quot;Best&quot; class in all of EQ is kinda diffficult to put your finger on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i agree, but try and set up an exp group with 5 melee and a chanter. see how much EXP they can get. try an exp group with 5 melee and a druid. 5 melee and a cleric. 5 melee and a beast. then try 5 melee and a shammy.<br />
<br />
see which group gets teh most exp without wiping and/or needing med breaks using the same 5 people in each group just rotating the slower/healer 6th spot. *added* to make it even more interesting only use the buffs that the slower/healer can cast. no virt in the shammy group, no kei in the cleric group, etc...<br />
<br />
p.s. i use 5 melee to simplify it. can easily put in caster classes that can't slow or heal.<br />
<br />
anyways, this will prolly never happen but i will put money on it, the shammy group will outlast the others. that's where i come up with the shammy being the best class.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Rogue is the best class imo. Put 1 Rogue with 5 Clerics or 1 Shaman with 5 Clerics or 1 Wizard with 5 Clerics and see who gets the best exp of those 3 groups. <br />
<br />
Clearly the rogue is the best class, because the 1 rogue group will outlast the others and do the best DPS.<br />
<br />
The biggest downfall of EQ was to allow every idiot to level up a character, seriously.<br />
<br />
Just in case somebody wouldn't see the sarcasm, above statement is just as foolish as the one about all melee + Shaman group being the proof that Shaman is the best class. Likewise you could be saying that a Cleric + melees is proof that the Cleric class is the best simply because it would be allowing the group to obtain more loot.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Where are those threads?<br />
<br />
Since Omens the threads I have been reading have been saying that Shamans are much better off now than they were for GoD. I know for sure that's the same thing I have been saying since the first week of Omens and so have others, so I wonder where these threads are you are reading this in.<br />
Anyway, Omnes content was designed better than GoD content. Omens mobs have a lower damage output, which allows generalists across the board to function better. That's practically all that has changed for our class.<br />
Still, there are quite a few things that are wrong with Shamans(DoT resists, DoT aggro, Survivability and slow mitigation/dependence are the major things coming to my mind). <br />
Despite all that, Shamans are &quot;middle of the pack&quot; currently, but you are actually saying that Shamans are not just &quot;fine&quot;, but the &quot;best class&quot; in EQ, which for me, based on your flawed argument above, is a perfect proof of you not understanding game mechanics.<br />

I am sure you will disagree, which is your right.</div></div><hr />

<br />

Dead wrong, on so many levels<br />
<br />
The threads that you are likely refering to were the rain of them during the run of GoD.<br />
<br />
Shaman are upset because they were neglected.  Up until OoW this was entirely true, and there are a lot of threads stating that a great deal of Shaman are pleased with the changes.  Prior to this, most run-of-the-mill-Shaman™ could no longer do their job and were even less desired as they were in PoP, which was a big hit for most of us.<br />
<br />
Shaman will never heal like Clerics, and if you read the old threads, most of them understand that they will lag behind Clerics by a lot, and Druids by a margin.<br />
<br />
Shaman will never nuke like Wizards, and I don't think that anyone seriously ever asked for that. <br />
<br />
Most Shaman are proud of our class, damn proud.  But just because you are proud of your Cadilac™ doesn't mean that you call it a Bently™.<br />
<br />
There are improvements that can be made to make us more desirable in groups / raids without overpowering us and the top 10 list reflects it.  As a matter of fact, if you look at #10 this is a good indication that  we are coming close to being satisfied.  Wish lists are just a guide and Shaman need fixing.</div></div><hr />

more than half of the improvements on that list have alraedy happened. 3,7, 8 and 10 are the only ones that haven't happened yet.<br />

I think thats the reason so many shamans want there aggro reduced on there posion DoT's i was in fire today and kept taking aggro from the necro who was kiting and i was only using 3 DoT's kind of annoying when i have to kite for a bit.</div></div><hr />

Dude, stop talking please. <br />
<br />
We were asked to list 10 items we'd like to have adressed and the SoE correspondents themselves are keeping the 10 point list every update for every class including ours, whether you think they have been adressed or not is moot.<br />
<br />
more than half of the improvements on that list have alraedy happened. 3,7, 8 and 10 are the only ones that haven't happened yet.<br />
I don't see how #9 has seen any improvements by the way. When did I miss an improvement to Shaman's survivabilty? <br />
In fact, the only points that have been adressed are 4, 5 and 6 and maybe 1 in part due to Ancestral Aid, if you consider that none of the upgrades are disproportionally high. They are just simple upgrades perfectly in line with what others got due to the new expansion and level increase.</div></div><hr />

Bah why do we always hear this about Shaman being upgraded.<br />
Yes we did get upgraded in the strict sense but only in line with other classes.<br />
Plus we only got upgraded through buying an expansion.<br />
Yes our heals got improved but so did clerics etc etc.<br />
If it wasnt for OoW,which i consider an upgrade for Shaman more because of the content rather than what Shaman were given then we would still be in the same boat.<br />
You should not have to buy an expansion to make yourself useful which is really what Shaman had to do.<br />

honestly, i can't. not easily anyways. the guild i'm in is presently rebuilding from the losses taken after WoW and EQ2 went live. i spend a majority of my time in PoF. it's easy for me to form a group there. just get a tank and 4 other people.<br />
<br />
i've been to RS. it's a lot of fun. there just aren't enough 69+ toons in the guild presently and even fewer 69+ tanks geared and AA'd enough to handle the mobs. but that will improve. :)</div></div><hr />

I think the improvement thing would be if they would change Tnarg's to 1.7k, Daluda's to 2.3k, and Yoppa's to 2.5k or something. Without changing the mana, or at least not much. A slight base HP boost on some of our old heals, and the newer upgrades.<br />

<br />
SPangaloid in your scarasm about improvements you are partially right. They are only improvements if the other classes dont get improved as well.  It is fine if in a new expansion if all the healers get a new heal but in our  case the heal would have to be a larger upgrade to bring us in line with the other healers. If all the healers heals were increased by the same amount (or the current SoE method of determining heals) then the heal is not really an improvement. <br />

<br />
(I mean poison base detrimental spells with counters.)<br />
Yeah, I believe this as well.  <br />
<br />
If Enchanters have a way of dealing with the agro that they get from Tash, it would be nice it we in turn got something to help deal with the hate generated from our detrimental poison spells.  I am sure that it would be a great addition to our fine class and give us a lot less too ask for to be on par.   O well, dare to dream.<br />
<br />
Who knows.... maybe they will make a potion that we hit a dose (and take a spell slot  :rolleyes: ) the would give us a similar focus.  Personally though, I am a fan of a quest for an augment that would have Innoruuk's Sarcasm or a similar effect.... and of course make it availible to our Enchanter friends.</div></div><hr />
