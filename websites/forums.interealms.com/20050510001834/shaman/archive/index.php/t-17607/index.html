<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>LostSK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well I needed to take a break from my shaman, I can't stand the 50's.  I have decided to make a DE SK as a alt, but I can't seem to find any good websites for them like we have for our Shamans. Also what kind of gear would you put on a SK? I have a fungi that I will let him borrow, but other than that what other gear should he use?  Do I go for AC or HP or what?<br />
<br />
Thanks everyone<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just some advice.  Make sure you use search first on the SK boards.  Not a very nice place to ask questions, if there are 40 posts already on the same topic.  Also, if you hated the 50s as a Shaman, as an SK it will be your worst nightmare come true.  SKs start getting better when they get their 58 pet.  At 60, death peace helps greatly, over that fizzle prone level 30 FD.  But they dont really come into their own until mid 60s, and even then, they dont truely get powerful until you get maybe 150-200 AAs under your belt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I dunno I got a 61 sk who can ditch out 60 dps on melee while tanking - which he does better than my monk.

My main is an SK, with my shaman as a box.  While I no where consider myself an expert, feel free to PM here or shoot me a tell in game, and I'll try and answer any questions you have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You'd equip a SK about the same as a shaman, with INT instead of WIS, and a touch more emphasis on STR/STA.<br />
<br />
Of course you, as a SK, would have access to higher AC gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hp is the only stat you want to worry about, AC will come with higher HP. Higher HP (dropppable too) plate armor has high HP that comes with it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Don't make a DE if you are anywhere serious with having this as a twink. Make an ogre because of the front stun thing. It is very,important to a tank. Also, troll and ogre cultural is alot better than DE cultural.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thirdly, you will get alot more groups as a shaman, and can solo alot more than SK. So i don't understand why you would make a Sk if you were tired of your shaman. Paladins and warriors generally get groups easier and you are till a second rate puller vs. bards. Your dps is like 50.<br />
<br />
If you are tired at lvl 50+, make a warrior. THey are super fun, and you can play them semi afk with your shaman.<br />
<br />
2boxing these levels would make it alot more fun, and a warrior is much easier to play than a SK, not to mention more DPS and easier access to better hp gear.</div></div><hr />

I hope you ignore most of this advice, as most of it is wrong.<br />
<br />
Balance your HP/Sta/AC to try and keep all about as high as possible.  Sta affects HP, so when you start maxing Sta with buffs, you can pick other gear appropriately.  Also, you dont want to totally neglect resists either.  For the most part, HP is most important, but not at a great sacrifice of AC.<br />
<br />
You would be a 2nd rate puller.  But keep in mind, as an SK you are 2nd rate behind monks, who are 2nd rate behind bards.<br />
<br />
Cultural armor is kind of lower end now.  Its more of twink gear, except for a few pieces.<br />
<br />
First person I have heard that say warriors are &quot;fun&quot;.<br />
<br />
If you want a dps class, make a monk, rogue or ranger.<br />
<br />
Unless you are in a high end raiding guild, the weapons you will use on a warrior will be mostly for aggro, and you will often do less damage than an SK or Pally using a WMBS.  So DPS has to be the worst arguement to pick a warrior over an SK/Pally<br />
<br />
As far as race, pick what is fun to you.  Dont pick an ogre because someone says frontal stun immunity is &gt;&gt;&gt; ALL.  Because it isnt.  Seen more problems because stupid ogres run backwards, and dont position mobs worth a darn, because they dont want to risk turning their backs to the mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Copper hammer of striking and sword of the bloodsworn are the midlevel agro weapons of choice on Torv, and both are very good dps and agro weapons. Not sure where ya feel warriors need to sacrifice dps for agro. At least not if they dual wield to begin with. I'd personally go with pally over sk, pacify line makes pallies better pullers than sk's imho and their utility is more group/dou friendly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Peloquin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Listen to Mardark, Suddail obviously doesnt have a clue about SKs. My main is a 62 DE SK and I have no regrets about it. We can tank, pull and have quite nice DPS with the correct AAs and equipment. We can solo easy till 55 and I never had a problem geting a group after that.<br />
<br />
Send me a tell if u play on AB and ill be happy to help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Grixx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">My main is a 65 Ogre SK (elemental planes guilded) and I'd disagree with some of what has been said here.  I often pull right along-side the monks on the pull team and I'd be happy to hand you a few pointers.<br />
<br />
1. Choose the race that you'd enjoy looking at most for 65 levels +  Although some argue that certain races are better suited - in the end, it all equals out really.  I personally prefer Ogre because being stunned drives me up the wall.  We have 3 other SKs in the guild (all 65) - Troll, Iksar, and DE - similarly equipped, and all of us are roughly equal.  The only thing that is going to distinguish you in the end is your skill.  Race really won't matter.  Choose what you think looks the best.<br />
<br />
2. As far as gear is concerned, whatever race you choose, imho, HP is the most important stat you have or will ever have.  STR, STA, AGI - all good and worthy stats, but in the end, the factor that will determine whether it's you or a mob standing will be if you outlasted them.  SKs are tanks (hybrid tanks admittedly), simply put, and tanks are about HPs.  At lvl 65 with over 100 AAs, I have ~8400hps.  Going back to the race comment above, the other SKs of differing race in my guild have similar HPs.  Most folks at lvl 65 (who are guilded, etc) are going to have max STR, STA anyhow - obviously it will vary a bit depending on your gear and Planar Power AAs.  However, when grouped, chances are that you'll be tanking (I find that I'm the tank 90% of the time in exp groups) and in raids, you may find yourself split-tanking adds from time to time when warriors and paladins aren't available/are tied up with other mobs.  In a raid situation, you may even find yourself pulling once in a while - depending on the guild you're in and the mob.  Bottom line, HPs are king.  Get your STA as high as possible during character creation, and then get you some Cultural armor as you near level 45 (that's the recommended level).  One caveat: If you choose DE, I'd probably put the points in STA; If you choose Ogre, you might consider putting some points in INT or AGI (just to get it above 75).  Again, however, everyone is going to have differing opinions.  Cultural armor (the Ogre version anyway) can last you til Ornate if necessary - as the AC/HPs on it are quite nice.  Hell, I still wear my cultural greaves and will until I can get enough AP's for the Takish greaves (I've spent most of my guild points on non-visible slot upgrades and weapons). <br />
<br />
3. Suddail had a good idea when it comes to 2-boxing.  I recently restarted on Firiona Vie and have a 49 SK and 59 Shaman on separate accounts.  It's a fantastic duo.  I recommend it if you'd like a change and the ability to take on some mobs that perhaps you weren't able to in the past.  <br />
<br />
Again, choose a race that best suits your idea of your character and stick with it.  Whatever you choose, have fun with it.  I am continually amazed at what SKs and Shamans can do at high levels.  Teamed together, they are an amazing combo.  Whatever you do, I hope you enjoy it.<br />
<br />
Shoot me a tell ingame sometime if you'd like to chat about it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Namurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I'd agree with much of what Suddail said, but because of my playstyle, I'd suggest Troll over Ogre.  I tend to solo a lot, due in part to not being a very social person and in part to liking and often being in ghost-town old world zones where I couldn't find a group/partner if I wanted one.  A Troll's regen is huge in this situation, especially at 51+ when it goes up by quite a bit.  Iksar have innate regen as well, but you don't have the easy cultural armor option, afaik.  Not only do trolls have relatively inexpensive cultural armor available, but their cultural has a 3:1 hp:mana ratio on most pieces, unlike the 2:2 on most hybrid-useable cultural.  Mana's great and all, but imo not at the expense of hp, especially for a tank.  Other races, especially small/medium races, are viable.. but without a decent-sized budget they'll suffer from lower stamina (less hp) and other less important, but still worthwhile stats.  Additionally, small/medium races can't bash while wielding a 2handed weapon without spending a few AA points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Larsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Made a DE SK to 2 box with my Shammy.  Made DE because Erudite's have dildo heads (j/k) and Int is the only stat my Shaman can't buff up.<br />
I'm trying to catch him up with the Shaman so I chose a small race for no exp penalty, but I can see the Ogre advantage, don't need no stinking Troll regen with a Shaman .  Used Larsson as an aid station and racked up the levels.<br />
<br />
Got A Sword of Pain with some guildies for him and and after level 40 spent moderate plat on him.  Mainly for Architect's Jewled Breastplate (or what ever it is).  1HS and shield for now, kept 2HS up for later.  Medium range Bazaar stuff.<br />
<br />
At 44 now with SK and my Shaman at 51 they can group and do pretty cool stuff.<br />
With Shaman buff/heals/JBB/root/dot and SK tank/tap/snare and dogdog/alpha/haste I'm having as much fun as I've ever had in EQ (and I have maaaany alts).<br />
<br />
Kinda off-topic but I really recommend the SK/Shaman duo route.<br />
Best of both worlds.<br />

Edit: spelling and grammar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>zolexa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">/agree with Grixx<br />
<br />
There have been some levels in the past I wish I had chosen a different starting race, but in the end I wouldn't change my human SK for anything.<br />
<br />
As Grixx said, my sta/str etc is also maxed when buffed, boxing a shaman helps, since you are always buffed  :D <br />
<br />
HPs are your main concern, no one ever died from running low on CHA or AGI, but you run low on HPs...the ever popular &quot;Loading...&quot;<br />
<br />
Of the guilds I see in the elementals on my server (mine being one of the newest ones /cheer) SKs are a rare breed, but there is a very diverse racial combo.  The 3 we have are ogre, troll, and human.  I know of a few DE, an erudite, another human...<br />
<br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
Iksar/troll have the innate regen <br />
Ogres the frontal stun thing<br />
DE/Erudite have good mana pools<br />
Human/Iksar balanced middle road stats<br />
Ogre/troll slam<br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
Iksar/Troll xp penalty<br />
Erudite/Human blind as newbs<br />
DE/Erudite low starting str/sta<br />
Troll/Ogre HUGE (get stuck in tunnels/doors)<br />
Gnomes...well we dont count them at all <br />
<br />
<br />
Just as all the debate over what shaman race is best, us SKs have the same thing, boils down to what race you like and see yourself playing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">A point about AGI. If it is less than 75 you WILL take huge AC hits. I had a buddy who went all WIS and I think DEX (hey who knew back pre-Kunark) with his Dwarven Cleric. AGI Buffed him one time with Faern and he was like: &quot;My AC just jumped 62 (Or some ungoldy no way AGI buff does that number).&quot;<br />
<br />
And you might get dispelled. (Murphy's). <br />
<br />
My baaaaby SK is a Troll, loads of fun, one of an army of alts and well, fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Coccyx Oracle of Thule</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">HP &gt; all for tanks. (although since this is a twink we are talking about, regen is actually more important, but that is the only exception to the rule) After that, you have to generate aggro, so a good weapon, good haste and some way to prevent yourself from going OOM.<br />
<br />
Everything else is unimportant till you start raiding.<br />
<br />
And don't let anyone tell you what race to play. Grixx is 100% right on that point. Yeah, ogre's no stun from the front is nice, or the troll's extra regen, or the iksar's AC bonus, but none of them are big enough to justify you choosing that race because of them. (Although the Iksar's inability to wear plate armor IS a valid consideration, but there's a fairly large pool of all/all twink gear that is perfectly suitable instead.)<br />
<br />
I'd reccomend (depending on your cash reserves) picking up the best haste item you can afford (They have high versitility, so they are a good buy even if you don't end up keeping the SK), a decent 2-hander (like blackened acrylia halbred or something similar) and a set of cheap armor (Sentient comes to mind, or maybe Crustacian). <br />
<br />
This is nowhere near what would be considered a &quot;good&quot; twink package, but it's enough to get you through your first 35 levels or so fairly quickly, and give you a taste of the class without breaking the bank.<br />
<br />
If you end up liking the class, or if you don't feel like taking the reccomendation above, go for broke. Get a Cowl of Mortality, a Windblade, a good 1 hander / shield combo (I don't know any off-hand), a full set of Dark Prince armor and whatever uber non-visibles you can get your hands on.</div></div><hr />
