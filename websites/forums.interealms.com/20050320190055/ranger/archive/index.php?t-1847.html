<br />
on another note how many of you will still play EQ 1 when it comes out will you really keep both of them on your computer at once I'm not even going to think about it too much. not untill next year we all know verent they'll probley justy change there mind and make it another expantion like they did with luclin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telloran Treehugger</div><div class="date">04-24-2002, 03:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll most likely stop playing EQ for EQ2. I'll just take the same name so it will be easier for the people I knew to find me hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gilgalon</div><div class="date">04-24-2002, 04:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Depends upon what my guild will do.  If they stay with EQ 1 then I might dabble with EQ 2 a bit but not  play it seriously.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lasalle Stormreaver</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 07:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not buying a new system again in order to play EQ or EQ2 for that matter.  We'll see what the minimum specs will be upon release (we know they change, and we can be sure they WILL change).<br />
<br />
You've seen the screenshots, right?  As someone in my guild said, if you think your lag sucks for luclin zones right now--just wait until you try playing EQ2 with their uber graphics.  How they're going to pull that off when they can't even squelch server-side LDs remains to be seen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sorronn</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 10:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem appears to be purely a server load issue. I have numerous friends from Bristlebane who moved to Stormhammer. Stormhammer is far less populated than other servers and my friends tell me that they almost never see lag issues or link deaths even on full up TOV raids and such.<br />
<br />
One way to improve performance for customers is to lower the population caps on servers. However, servers and bandwidth cost money so spreading that cost across a smaller player base = higher costs.<br />
<br />
So there is your answer. They can offer &quot;premium&quot; servers or tiered service servers with lower population caps so that performance is better.<br />
<br />
As for client side graphics, what did you expect? As we get closer and closer to photorealism in online gaming graphics, it will take larger and larger mathematical resources to do the required computations. Thus client side hardware requirements will go up. And as polygon counts rise, so will memory resource requirements.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Durgen</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 12:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It depends on how its all coded I suppose.   In the mostly zoneless land of DaoC I don’t ever recall seeing screen lag.  Which is odd since with the exception of the capitol cities and dungeons it is all one continuous zone.  <br />
<br />
I will give Verant the benefit of the doubt on this one.  You can make better graphics with more polygons and textures if you code it right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wanerile Shadow</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 01:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">.As I understand it, Verent has created EQ2 is to correct some in-game problems that could not be corrected in the original EQ. If Verent is like ever other Software Developer I have worked for, they will stop supporting the original version to cut development/support staff, not immediately mind you, but they will. <br />
Example: Windows 95, Microsoft couldn’t correct the mutable problems with the OS so the developed another from the ground up, then dumped the support of Win95 even though Win95 was still in wide use.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VaderJM4</div><div class="date">04-27-2002, 09:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorronn, I find that a little hard to believe considering a certain guild likes throwing 80+ people at a monster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sorronn</div><div class="date">04-27-2002, 04:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Um, Vader, you find what hard to believe? Your reply was rather vague. I can think of at least two interpretations in regards to my original post and possibly a third in regards to my second post.<br />
<br />
Clarify your comment and maybe I will elaborate. And then again, maybe I won't bother.<br />
<br />
By the way, Vader, exactly how much experience do you have in design, implementation and debugging large scale distributed computer systems?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VaderJM4</div><div class="date">04-27-2002, 08:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What was vague?<br />
<br />
My post was about Township Rebellion, I don't know where you're pulling this multiple interpretations from.<br />
<br />
I fine it hard to believe that there would be no lag with 80+ people clustered together, no matter how good the server.<br />
<br />
As to your last question, diddly-squat! What's the point?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tolore</div><div class="date">04-28-2002, 01:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I;\'m not gonna bpother buying this game, i am very happy with EQ and i think they should fix it p so that the poeple are happy with eq 1 then upgrade and add features for eq2, i am probobly gonna buy star wars galaxie or shadowbane and stick with eq 1, from what i have heard eq 2 LOOKS impressive but the game mechanics seem like other games that i have played and not like</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xaen</div><div class="date">04-30-2002, 12:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">EQ content will be old news by the time EQ2 comes out. People will be bored out of their minds with nothing new to kill after PoP. In comes EQ2 to save the day. Whole fresh world to make a name for yourself.<br />
<br />
I cant wait.<br />
<br />
Also, everyone pretty much agrees that item decay is a bad idea. Anyone who has played DAoC knows it's a pain in the ass, and leaves little economy (Great strength of EQ). MAKE YOUR POINT KNOWN ABOUT THIS. I've already emailed Verant multiple times stating why item decay is a really bad idea, and that if they dont allow hand-me downs, then their replayability is also shot along side of their economy. Especially in a game with 100-200 levels that no one if familiar with. What if you get to level 50 and decide you want to try something new because the class you picked just flat out sucks. Starting over once or twice isnt too bad, but a lot of us have checked out other classes many times (At least, I have) before they picked a primary that they were happy with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tanolas</div><div class="date">04-30-2002, 02:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm definitely looking forward to this. It sounds like they are going to be implementing a lot of the original ideas they had for EQ1 back in the day. If its everything I think it will be, its gonna rock hard. I'll be there  :)<br />
