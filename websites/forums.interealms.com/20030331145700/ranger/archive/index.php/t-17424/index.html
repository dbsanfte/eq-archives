<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Noron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all<br />
<br />
My guild is raiding Many places at the moent e.g. Kael and Skyshrine. But we are clearing these places easly untill we reach the real hardmobs(in my eyes anyway). Any of you got an idea what mob we could kill at the end of a dungon link to guild is www.raidersofvirtue.com and look at members list to see our levels etc. Really want to find a new place to raid and have a main ghoal at the end which is hard but doable.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Paldaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">For a level 45+ range guild, the typical places to go were Hate/Fear and then Kael IMHO.  You could try something like Radir in UP also.  <br />
<br />
I think most people who have progressed through that range started farming armor and refining raiding tactics  in the 3 places mentioned above.  I'd look to farm the arena in Kael for armor drops, and some other nice items.  I'm not sure where the 'really hard mobs' start in Kael for you, but as you begin to get comfortable with the Veterans and Adjutants (healing and gating mob) around the arena, you can start pulling Protectors of Zek.  As you start to gain more levels and get a defensive Warrior as MA you can then pull the Guardians of Zek.  I like the progression of difficulty that Kael provides, and, at least back in my day, the armor drops from there are great for a level 45-55 character.  You'll probably even get a chance to practice complete healing chains on the guardians of zek when you start pulling them.  It'll also gain you CoV faction and allow you to move up to Halls of Testing in ToV when you find that Guardians of Zek just don't provide much of a challenge any more.<br />

Hope that's what you're looking for.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Noron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks i just announced to guild that we shall try kael. Are there any stratagies for pulling Protectors of Zek? We have an experianced monk you should do the trick but need to know if anything could go wrong if not known about before hand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Paldaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I haven't pulled there, but from what I've seen most of the PoZ's are fairly easy to pull.  There is a combination of Kallis and 2 other mobs that might come together and need FD pulling.  After you pull the mobs to the north before Vindi, you'll need to go in the door on the south side of the arena.  I think that's a location that helps to have a couple of capable FD'ers pull until you learn aggro radius and pathing tendencies.  Our monks would bring 2 or 3 out into the main arena area and then tag them apart until they single pulled one of them.  Of course, once you get higher in levels it isn't as big of an issue.  One group of 60's can pretty easily solo most of the stuff in the arena, so pulling 2 or 3 giants isn't hard to beat as you level up.<br />
<br />
I remember my first Kael arena raid we didn't even make it up the ramp into the arena.  We pulled to the bottom of the ramp on the right side.  And still wiped out.  And had 2 drops the whole night.  As you increase your knowledge there you'll be able to pull more and more and get more and more drops.  Good luck!<br />
