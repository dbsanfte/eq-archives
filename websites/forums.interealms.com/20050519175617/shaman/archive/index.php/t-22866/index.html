<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know that when they increase the level cap theres always new problems introduced. Currently my big worry is ldon's and I've seen this expressed by some people in other threads as well. Here's my take on the ldon problem:<br />
<br />
Since LDoN is based off average level, once the group level reaches 68 it would give you what is currently a 65 hard as a normal lvl 70 mission.<br />
<br />
I can do normals fine, but my group would get creamed in a hard adventure at 65. Orinally in ldon beta hard 65 adventures followed the same progession as all the other ldons and the mobs hit for about 475. Since that wasn't hard enough for the people with raid gear they made it 1k+. If a normal lvl 70 adventure is 1k+ hitters then its going to shut out a lot of people from doing it that can do normal missions now or require them to have a tank where ldon normal pretty much anyone can tank. <br />
<br />
Judging by the spell line up for 66-70 and the hp gains from 61-65 just getting to 70 will not be enough to handle ldon hards as they stand now. I already have most of my defensive AA's except for ID5 and there is no way I can tank a hard dungeon.<br />
<br />
Currently the progression goes something like this:<br />
<br />
60 (55 hard) 275 ish hitters<br />
65 (60 hard) 375 ish hitters<br />
70 (65 hard) 1025 ish hitters<br />
<br />
In beta it originally followed the same progession for the last level<br />
70 (65 hard) 475 ish hitters.<br />
<br />
They added the huge jump to give people with elemental gear+ a challenge, its not really hard mode because it doesn't follow the same progression in damage as all the others, it is more of a super hard mode.<br />
<br />
I think the correct way to fix it would be to make 65 hards/ 70 normals what they originally where and make the current 65 hards the 70 hard mode (just add 3-5 levels to the mobs so they are doing damage more in line with their level). I don't really think they will though and it will basically shut off ldons to anyone at 70 that doesn't bring a well geared/AA'd plate tank with them just like GoD now. Personally I hate being forced to have certain classes in my groups I like being able to go with whatever friends happen to be around (all pet ldon groups are a blast). The original damage progression for mobs would allow the same groups that can do normals but not hards at 65 to do normals at 70.<br />
<br />
What else do you think needs to be addressed as far as issues with the level cap increases?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">At least not till a month or 3 after release of OOW when they are &quot;finished&quot; working out all the bugs that were released with the expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you think the designers for the game have ever had a clue about the implications of raising the level cap..<br />
<br />
They've hosed the game every time they do it, and never learn from their mistake. Don't worry, in 2 years they'll have the game half balanced around a level 70 cap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I do not think that LDoN will scale above level 65.<br />
<br />
They will force us to buy Another Lost Dungeons of Norrath (ALDoN, aka LDoN2) for it to scale to level 70, and have scalable raids for smaller guilds.<br />
<br />
What are we doing giving SOE ideas to bill us for our good ideas?<br />
