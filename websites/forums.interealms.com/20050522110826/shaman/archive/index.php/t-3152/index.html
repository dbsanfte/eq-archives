<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Here is my question:  Fully buffed, with bearform, I am at 898 AC and 166 wis, 1471 HP (lev 45).  I have saved a little money, and am wondering what to spend it on.  Here is my question:<br />
<br />
Should I, a.)  get a med totem and a Ivandyr's hoop, thus swaping out my Slime coated harpoon and Forrest Loop. (gain 9 raw ac and 3 wis)  <br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
Should I, b.)  Get the cheapest horse and just stand and let the JBB rip.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your input.<br />

<br />
do you have your defence maxed? if not get the horse and max it, if you do have it maxed then your decision might be harder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ya, Defense and Offense are Maxed (Since Lev 41).  I am just really questioning what upgrade path I should follow.  <br />

Thanks for everyones imput.<br />

<br />
Is getting to 900 ac or over 900 a big difference from 898? Ask cuz without major buffing (hos and stam buff) my ac sits at 899 and wasnt thinking anything of it. Agi buff would put it over 900, or one of the ac buffs and i could probably swap something out just wondering if 900 was a magic number or just looks better to break that barrier before the trek to 1k?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Scarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">900 is much better than 899.  Similar to 75 in a stat instead of 74.  I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Shilzah:<br />
Conventional Wisdom here on the boards (and it is supported by a lot of informal testing) is that the benefits of AC 'jump' in increments of 50.<br />
<br />
So yes, if your AC is hovering within 10pts of 900 (or 950  or 1000, etc) you should try and get your AC up to that next plateau...up to around 1250 for shamans, I believe.  That is the soft cap.</div></div><hr />

Get 900AC +</div></div><hr />

It is a huge power increase, especially with the JBB, and ESPECIALLY at level 45.  <br />
<br />
Getting your AC to 900 (which you should do, also, but not with your horse-cash) should be easy- just swap your slime harpoon for a goranga idol- you should at least break even plat-wise on the trade, and you'll find that losing 60 mana doesn't hurt that much.<br />
<br />
I've found that when horse/JBB'ing, though, AC isn't as important as you think as you won't be getting hit much.  I even stopped slowing (although at 52 it's starting to look a little more mana-efficient again as things hit a little harder.  Wurms suck.)<br />
<br />
To summarize:  <br />
Definitely... definitely... DEFINITELY get the horse.<br />
<br />
Definitely.  :)</div></div><hr />
