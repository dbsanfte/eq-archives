<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shakasa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Last night I tried to by my JBB.  Had two people offer to sell, when I asked price and started to negotiate based upon what I had on me, and what I could steal, borrow and rob to get this is what I found out.<br />
<br />
Apparently on our server Vazaelle, the JBB is being pushed to the 30k - 35k PP price limit.  I have spoken with many other Sham on our server who have stated they paid anywhere from 12 - 20k for the JBB just a few months ago but based on last night...the cheapest I could have picked one up for was 26k.  Of which I could only come up with like 17 - 21k.<br />
<br />
My question is this...is Vazaelle on crack or am I?</div></div><hr />

The pricing on that server is wacky and, depending on the day, you can either get a fair deal or get completely screwed. Probably not what you wanted to hear but coming from another server to that one, well, it's been enlightening not to mention entertaining watching some of those prices ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Verata</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Something like JBB isnt going to be bought in a day.  If you set a price... say 14k or something, and auction for it, be patient and wait for a week or so before declaring your server on crack =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Oogg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">/shrug<br />
on TP you'd be hard pressed to find a JBB under 252K</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tienen Crazywolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">hmm, i think id consider selling mine for 252k Oogg ;) Im guessing you meant 25k?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I picked a price of 15k and stuck with it.  Turned down 3-4 offers for 20-30k.  Finally found one after about a month of trying.  It's not going to be a short-term effort, but it can be done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shakasa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">WOW great ideas guys.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bulx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm on Vaz as well and if you think you can wait out getting a JBB for 15k ..you'll be waiting for a long long time.  <br />
Being one of them i know alot of manaburn wizards are starting shaman twinks ...and this and that fungal regen stick ( forgot the name ) are at the top of their shopping list.<br />
I auctioned for a week to buy one at 25k and finally got it.  I would suggest binding at the tomatoe and sitting LFG in seb.  A couple days of crypt groups should get you the bracer and maybe a few spells....hell you make get lucky and grab an ODS while pulling zone in trash while waiting for a group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Oogg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">/bonk self<br />
yes Tienen, i meant 25K</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>dananar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">just speaking from personal exp....but i got to 60 minus a JBB. its a darn handy tool, but i dont feel not having it hampered my lvling that much. i got it just as i got 60, so i use it for AA exp, but i also waitied till i could go spend a month in seb and hunt mine down.  guess it depends on the server. but i wouldnt pay more than 14k on karana. better yet go to seb and get one yourself.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">JBB is expensive on Vaz but price can change a lot.<br />
<br />
I would not bother doing the /auction WTB JBB 20k thing.<br />
<br />
I would simply watch the /join market chanel and check price each time one comes up for sale.  People either have one for sale or not and somtimes it can be a weeks between JBB for sale.<br />
<br />
My personal exp on Vaz with the JBB market was baught one at 18k then sold it at lvl 42 for 40k....  did not find another for sale untell lvl 47 and baught it for 23k or 24k...  normal price seams to be about 25k or so witch just stinks.<br />
<br />
On the positive side, both Malo and Torpor are fairly cheap and show up about as often as the JBB does.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shakasa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Thanks all...I agree it is not worth more than 20k though just out of the pure fight of it I would pay up to 22k.<br />
<br />
I will see what happens and post my results...us Sham have to stick together.  FYI if any of you sham on vazaelle get one and want a fast sale give me a shout.<br />

I've bought 2 of them in my life, 1st of whihc i sold to buy other gear, then bought another one later. Selling the 1st one was the worst idea i ever had. I didn't realize how much i used it till it was gone :D</div></div><hr />
