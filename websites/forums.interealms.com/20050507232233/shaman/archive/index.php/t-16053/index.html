<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Looking for advice on a PoTa. Last night was only my second time there. We went to the LA and to a corner to safely buff up and I notice not everyone is there. As I'm in the middle of buffing those that are near me somebody had aggro'd a diaku in the hallway. So I rush over there and slow it and then comes total chaos: People are screaming &quot;STAMPEDE - KILL YOUR PET!!&quot; Ok I killed my pet and a majority of the stampede went right past us except for two pigs which aggroed. So being my natural instinct I slowed them and then rooted them both and moved to the other side of the hallway and told the group that the pigs were rooted. I then notice a piglet has aggroed the druid so I slowed and rooted it also. Well nobody has moved from the otherside so they are all getting whaled on by the diaku, 2 pigs and a piglet and everyone dies.<br />
<br />
So...I come back from my death and everyone is screaming about you shouldn't root the pigs. Then some ahole says something about trying to root the piglet for phat lewts and getting everyone killed. I'm like scratching my head and saying &quot;huh?&quot; I was just trying to keep the piglet off the druid. It was very clear everyone was blaming me but I'm trying to figure out what in god's name I was supposed to do? It was ****ty timing getting the stampede right after someone had accidentially aggroed a diaku before we were ready and I only rooted the pigs after they had aggroed on us but they kept screaming at me and as soon as we were all rezzed, 3 of them made lame excuses and logged.<br />
<br />
So just what are you supposed to do when a stampede comes by just as you are fighting a mob in the hallway?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you are in that hallway, just stay near the wall, and the stampede will pass you by without agro.  If you do get adds, you kill them.. just like anywhere else.  It sounds like your group was a bit clueless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah, I wouldn't worry about it too much. My experience with pickup groups in Tactics is everyone tends to go a little wiggy when the stampede happens.<br />
<br />
All of a sudden half your group will run off to try and root the pigglet, in the process often agroing one or two stampeding boars and/or regular pit mobs. The healer will be too busy trying to get the pigglet back to camp to worry about the MT who's still tanking the mob that was in camp when the stampede happened (hopefully he's got lots of hitpoints). When the pigglet is enroute to your camp, the other group that's been exping in the pits will try to KS the pigglet.<br />
<br />
Eventually the pigglet will be dead along with one or two of your party members. There will be /oocing between your group and the other group in the pit about who's the biggest jerk. You'll get rezzes, rebuff and then be able to enjoy an hour or so of exping before it happens again.<br />
<br />
Welcome to Tactics :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What Z said.  Tell your gruup to shut the hell up and quit whining.<br />
<br />
The stampede is easy to handle, you sacrifice one person to root the piglet and kill it after the stampede leaves.  I say sacrifice because sometimes the stampede pwns the person who did the rooting, it is about a 50/50 chance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The stampede never kills the person who roots/snares/mezzes the piglet as long as they are far enough away. I've probably soloed the piglet 20 times now with zero deaths. In groups you'll see a lot of problems because everybody's falling all over each other to be the one to get the piglet and someone ends up aggroing the stampede.<br />
<br />
As long as you're the only group in the pit, there's no reason to go crazy when you see the stampede message, as it's easy to grab the piglet as he's coming out, as he's running around the pit, or after he's looped back around and is about to depop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well, this certainly sounds like an interesting zone.  Can someone explain the &quot;piglet&quot; and the &quot;stampede&quot; to me?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Weissblau, in tactics there is a pit filled with mobs. Groups xp down in the pit, which can be exciting and stressful as the proximity of the mobs, the amount of wanderers, and the high level of them can make a single pull all of a sudden become interesting.<br />
<br />
About once an hour you will see the message appear saying:<br />
<br />
&quot;You hear the pounding of hooves&quot;<br />
<br />
At this point pretty much everyone should back up against the wall. A huge herd of boars stampede around the pit in a circular fashion before heading back out of the pit. In amongst the herd is a small piglet that is the mob of choice to get hold of.<br />
<br />
It is a really fun zone, but there can be some real jerks in there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The piglet is a buggy bastard.  If you try to root him and pull him off, sometimes he'll take off in a random direction and cause all sorts of problems.  Sometimes he'll follow you anyways with no problem.  In general, stay as far away as possible when trying to yank him out of the stampede, you don't want to agro all those boars, they cause quite a mess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Why do you want the piglet?  Does he drop something special or something?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dread</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">We don't fight in the tunnels for this very reason.  We usually setup shop in the SW corner of the pit.  When we hear the stampede message, I will go over to the tunnel ( but not right next to it or you will get big pig agro ).  After the piglet comes out of the tunnel, he will pause for a second before/as he turns to run in another direction.  Root him then, but do it from close to max spell range.  If you are too close you will agro the big pigs and that can be bad.  If you do get a couple of the big pig adds, just let them kill you and get a rez, it is better than getting your group killed.   Or you can run them out into the pit away from your group and sometimes you can lose them if they get too far away ( they go back to their pre-set path through the pit ).<br />
<br />
Once you got the piggy rooted, then malos and slow him.  Then get very close to him before you break root.  His agro range is extremely small and if you aren't right next to him when root breaks, he will still run off.  You can tell if he is agrod on you by which way he is facing.  If he is facing you, everything is good and break root.  If he is facing the other way, melee him for a sec until he faces you after you back out of melee  Then just break your root with a velium strike and walk him back to your group.<br />
<br />
I have been able to pull the piggy without other agro the last 10 or more times, no problem.  It is really all about positioning, then just watch which way he is facing before you break root.  Too bad bulwarks only go for 8k or so now on my server. <br />
<br />
Some other tips:<br />
If there are mobs close by when you get the stampede message send a cleric or enchanter to pacify anything that may get in your way.  The time between the message and the actual stampede seems to vary some, but you should always have at least a good 30 seconds or so to pacify that stuff.<br />
Once you get the piggy rooted, have someone else snare it before you break root.<br />
Figure out who is gonna be responsible for grabbing the piggy before you see the stampede message.<br />
To figure out about where you want to pull the piggy from ( if you are camping in SW corner ) use the diaku that hangs out in the mouth of the tunnel to figure out about where max spellcasting range is.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Here's how to handle piglet:<br />
<br />
First of all, killing your pet is probably a good idea.  If you get hit once and your pet charges in, you could have the whole herd on your hands, which would be a wipe.<br />
<br />
Second of all, the whole group needs to sit in the safespot.  On my server we call it &quot;SS&quot; but appearantly it is different on yours.  If you were standing in the stables looking in to that room, it would be the back right corner.  I think it is the NW corner but I'm not positive.  Everyone stands there.  When piglet spawns, one person waits until piglet is about to go out of sight through the first hallway, and then roots him.  The root will land with piglet in the middle of that short hallway.  Usually you'll get him solo, but sometimes you'll get two adds (whenever I get adds it is always two).  As soon as the stampede has passed, everyone in the group runs in to the hallway and engages piglet.  STAY IN THE HALLWAY.  Once the stampede passes back through the safe room and despawns, you can move piglet.  Just DON'T let him get to the stables, because he will despawn if he reaches the doorway.<br />
<br />
Usually it is best to pull piglet back in to the safespot in order to avoid roamer adds, but if you have a full group it shouldn't be a problem.<br />
<br />
Finally, you can solo this easily with a little practice.  I made a decent bit of cash soloing daikus in the wee hours of the morning when tactics is empty.  I would get the occasional highly polished gem, and whenever I saw the stampedge trigger, I would invis and run down there, abandoning my daiku I was fighting (he won't follow you down).  Piglet is an easy kill for you if you don't get adds, it just takes a little practice to not screw up.  Good luck to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">singling piglet is easy.  Just get range on the stampede when u cast root.  If you chance to aggro the pigs in the stampede with your root, immediately run away fast as you can.  You'll distance them easily and they will return to the stampede and go away.  The distance/forget range on the stampeding pigs is very small.  U can root out of that range easily.  But it's best if only one or two ppl with root/snare attempt to get piggy each time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's exactly where I was too. I was hugging the wall and 2 pigs still aggroed. That's where I then rooted and slowed. The group was under the false impression that I had rooted the pigs as the stampede was coming through. <br />
<br />
Oh well, I'm tired of thinking about it. Thanks for all the responses. :)</div></div><hr />
