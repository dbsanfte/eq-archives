<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Icebreaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone tried duoing in CoD with slay undead pally? Just wondering if or how well this would work, thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jedediah Bloodmoor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've played many hours in CoD, unfortunatly the undead mobs in here hit for 600+ and keeping up healing can be a problem esp. when a slow is resisted, I have always had better luck just killing the pulslings (watch out for the damn greater ones, they cant be slowed and will kill you with speed without a defensive warrior).  The added bonus that SU3 gives pallies is not a big factor in here as you cant count on it from fight to fight (though a 5k crit is always nice to see).<br />
<br />
  The other problem with killing the undead in this zone is the necros... you will have to fight every 65 charm-enabled necro on your server for this camp, also note that necros die/train often charm killing in here and you dont want to run into a 70 percent hasted undead ex-necro pet (trust me).</div></div><hr />
