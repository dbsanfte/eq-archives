<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Krakur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hullo. Currently am a 51 Troll Shaman, can't find any XP spots at all :( Have been soloing in DL but is just too slow now, lots of greenies too. Can't hunt KC because of outpost faction issues, and can't (or very rarely) find groups in Sebilis / Chardok / Velks. Any other places I could try to get a group, or any solo spots I could try?<br />
<br />
Tnx for the helps :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Those places are all in the past.  It's all about the planes of power, now.  Try PoJ and get a few more levels, then group in PoN until 60 then get flagged for PoV.<br />
<br />
Sorry I can't be of more help, but I cannot for the life of me remember where I leveled back then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Seafury Clops in OOT. Good cash items, pretty easy mobs. Plus Gornit camp if its free. Pretty good exp as well up to level 54ish</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Meener</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">City of Mist</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">As mentioned before OOT is great until about 53 or 54.  Burning woods giant fort until 53 or 54 is pretty nice too and rarely used.  Around 53 or 54 it should be easier to get groups in Nightmare which is insane experience in the mid 50's I would bet.  Also, Maidens Eye was pretty good solo experience in the mid 50's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>veggi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You could try jagged pine Gnoll caves, great XP till 56-57.  It's safe to solo down there, no adds and if root breaks mobs path into wall.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps some<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ganoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">/agree City of Mist is very good, and usually empty.  Try the Gazebo's area right before the locked door.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jarren Icewulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I would try CoM (Gazebos) or Hole (Zone in). But, if at all possible get into a decent group in Plane of Nightmare or Plane of Disease. You just have to Malo (lvl49 version) before attempting to slow, unless chanter tashing in the group as resists are fairly often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Seafurbies and HHK except they're oftentimes camped.   Jagged Pine Forest was great exp and decent amount of vendor loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>fenwyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Akheva Ruins - Unless things have changed in the last couple months, that place was a goldmine.  Great rare drops too.  You will need a good group at 51 though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gorg Grimm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Also the though leech's in Mons Letalis give good cash with minor item drops...can be pulled solo if u inch forward...only problem is with slowing them..may take multiple times but the off setting xp is well worth it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Spiroc Isle in Timorous Deep(between Oasis and Overthere, the isle with the ogre on it) is fantastic experience at 51.  Drops off very quickly at 52 though; the most sudden drop-off of experience I can remember.<br />
<br />
Cyndreela at the portal to Fear is good experience, and she drops a fair amount of bronze and gems.<br />
<br />
The wizard brothers(and their necro friend) deep in the Third Gate section of Neriak are very very good experience at that level, but you'll need to bring some resistance jewelry.<br />
<br />
Cheetas and lightcrawlers and sunflowers in Scarlet Desert are good experience and it's almost impossible to run out of them.  If you move along the zonewalls, you'll see the mobs get higher and lower in certain sections.  Moving right from the entrance from Twilight, mobs get higher level.  There are also aliens and tribals, both walking around and in the many caves.  You can also go up on the plateau and kill aliens and revenants.  A piece for the shield of bane warding drops off a named here, and you can also get a shard for the Vex Thal key.<br />
<br />
I can't say I've ever been impressed by COM as far as experience goes, though it's a great zone just as a zone.<br />
<br />
The Hole entrance is fantastic at 51 but I doubt you could solo it there.  Mobs often come as doubles, and sometimes it's hard to find space to root them.  A full group is great there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Xahra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I did 51-53 partnered with a monk friend, killing the dwarf guards in Butcherblock and Kaladim.  Nice XP.<br />
<br />
But yea, it's all about the planes now.<br />
<br />
<br />
edit: ack lol, fixed carriage returns in my sig &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Shouldn't this be in the hunting grounds forum? What they have all listed above is accurate tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Krakur - what is your equipment like?  I know when I break Faern out he &quot;borrows&quot; the Fungal from the Monk.  Equipment makes a huge difference.<br />
<br />
Faern has soloed the Hole Entrance at 52. Lot's of fun, but he has Epic, JBB, and the aforementioned Fungal.<br />
<br />
CoM is good if you can get a melee partner. MOBs have low health for their level (it seems).  IIRC CoM has a 13% ZEM. The reason it seems like good exp is because you can kill so fast.<br />
<br />
The Tier-1 planes however have a HUGE ZEM. (I've read on the order of 150%). Combine this with the fact you are fighting MOBS even - red to you and you can see why at your level = awesome.<br />
<br />
If you do go planes, try Innovation first. Generally the folks there seem less hung up on the min / max paradigm and just want to have fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Krakur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Thanx for all da good ideas. Got 53 now grouping in PoI, PoN and got into two PoG groups as well :)<br />
<br />
Went to city of mist and to the gnoll caves, both were good xp but got old so tried the PoP zones, good fun there with groups so i dont feel alone all the time :)<br />
<br />
And here is link to my gears GEAR HERE (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=451920) it is ok stuff for my level i think... sence im not in a guild that goes raiding and stuff yet.. IM trying to level fast so I can get into my friends guild.<br />
<br />
Want to thank u all for the ideas and everything again :)<br />
<br />
TNX!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I loved Howling Stones and Chardok.  But if you can get a group in PoP, you'll find the exp anywhere else piss poor.</div></div><hr />

Ugh... Freeti Booties :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Zulan Spiritshifter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Wow, to be honest, I'm suprised that you stuck around The Dreadlands for that long.  I'm hunting there now, at lvl 40, and the XP already seems to be moving slowly, whether I fight at the ent to the Lost Vally or near KC.  I ran into a few low 50's Shaman that were soloing out in Mons Letalis, Stonegrabbers and Hoppers, though I imagine they hit way too hard to be considered efficient.  <br />
<br />
I haven't had the opportunity, as of yet, to experience any of the PoP zones, but I imagine that they're outrageous xp compared to old world zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>foolbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">by your lvl I was in burning wood killing the zone trash by the runes (area where gullerback) spawns.  You can make some nice plat there and melee most of the mobs.  Headed there to max out my melee skills.  But I'm sure you want to level :).<br />
<br />
If you can get a lvl 60 friend to come along they can single pull the shrooms in fungus grove.  We took our med breaks after we'd clear all three patches, think each patch contains five shrooms.  Started my aa one weekend and in two days I had run3 out there.<br />
<br />
Checked out akhevia ruins lastnight for the first time with my regular group.  We made it to some mob that was lvl 60 and casted a huge AE spell, the effect was your eyes roll back into your head.  The enc's soothe line of spells failedl when breaking the mobs room so it agro'ed onto us.  We came to the conclusion that it was better to hunt right outside akhevia's entrace then in it.  The mobs are higher conning there and have better drops.  Plus a PH for a named mob spawns right off from the ramp.  All of the mobs were blue to me (lvl 52) that we came across while inside the dungeon, except for a few named of course.<br />
<br />
No clue on PoP, I've been waiting on 55 till I head there.  I'm still green behind the ears so take this lightly :)</div></div><hr />

Aye, seeing those made me weep salty tears :(<br />

At 51 i did OOT and COM.  at 53 i did HHK to 55.  HHK is much better exp at your level the pickup POP groups, and far more stable.  55-60 is all about POP though.  Best exp in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">PoJ will be the best exp you can get at that level.  Get a melle like a monk and you tank while he deals out the damage.  The rats and guards near zoneout would be very easy at that level and were good exp solo in the upper 50s.<br />
<br />
I was doing groups in PoN at 52.  On my server it is much easier to get groups in PoN then PoD.</div></div><hr />
