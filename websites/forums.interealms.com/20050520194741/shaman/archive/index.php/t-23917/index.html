<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i F-ing hate this game.<br />
<br />
no no.  i don't hate it for the big things.  i don't hate it for class balance, or slows or heals or ever questing.<br />
<br />
i hate it for the small things.<br />
<br />
that splinter that regardless of the digging with a sharp needle, you just can't get out from under your skin.<br />
<br />
i have run 3 shaman to lvl 40+.  42 on Vallon.  52 on Sullon, then 65 on Prexus.<br />
<br />
and each one tried to solve one quest.<br />
<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=647<br />
<br />
yah, it is newbie (or lower), it is lame, you can buy better in the bazaar for 20plat, and the splinter has driven me nuts for over 2 and a half years.<br />
<br />
Bludletter disagreed with me 100%, when i said they don't fix the game.<br />
<br />
so, i looked at this quest again, and it seem solved.<br />
<br />
2 nights later, i started to realize that stuff listed on Allakhazam is not as accurate LUCY.  <br />
<br />
Lucy doesn't list any of the stuff.  i just wasted 2 nights.<br />
<br />
over two years?  broken quests?  heck with the needle, get me a hack saw.</div></div><hr />

On my trader for 500k, I have petitioned it I have bugged it I auction it I joke about it.<br />
<br />
But for some reason it just plain bugs the hell out of me.</div></div><hr />

Honestly man, if they sit there and spend mroe than 2 hours of a programmers time to fix this quest, I would be annoyed. This is one of thosse &quot;scratch it off the list because only 10 people would EVER do it&quot; things, and if you say &quot;well what about those 10 people&quot; I will say &quot;What about the gazillion other things that the 400K people are waiting to be fixed&quot;. <br />
<br />
The needs of the many bone, come on. Find a big broken quest and rant about that, and I am in with ya. This one . . . ugh.</div></div><hr />

I guess the only thing to consider is how much time it would take to fix this.  I'd sooner a dev take an hour or two fixxing a little easy item for good than spend that time beating his head against his desk trying to solve a temp quickfix to say make a boss encounter work around a less mitigating mob and somehow breaking bards in the process (no never played a bard, just that they always used to get broken with every patch ;)).  It's a matter of opinion though and sooner or later the tougher stuff does need to be fixed, still it's nice to see some results rather than a top 10 list that never seems to be addressed.</div></div><hr />
