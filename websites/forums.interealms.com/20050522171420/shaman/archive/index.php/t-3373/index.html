<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Torelorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This was a new mob when I hit the firepots today.  The info goes something like this:<br />
<br />
Cursed Traveler regards you Indifferently -- You would probably win this fight.<br />
<br />
From a hail:<br />
<br />
The eyes of the skeleton are bleak and dreary as though the essence which keeps it standing are not really there, a surreal look into the future for those who make their stay in the immediate room around you.  The ominous figure does not make any sound but nods in your direction as if to tell you that he died here a long time ago by resting in the nearby fire for too long.  In your mind you hear the eerie thoughts of this undead figure, alluding to the fact that it is unwise for you to remain here for too long, lest the might water dragon overtake you, as it overtook him.<br />

Sorry, but I typed this from a SS since I forgot to turn logging on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Same on innoruuk, although it was blue to a level 43, and some people were attacking it, with 2hb and afk, i think they were raising skill, and it wasn't getting hurt nor was it attacking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I noticed him as well, immune to changes in attack speed, green to lvl 60, cast bane of nife, epic dot, JBB on him.  He didn't turn, he didn't attack, he didn't take damage.  Was still indifferent to me after attacking him.  I also tried several lines of text to try to trigger something, but nothing worked, I was really hoping to be able to spawn Fay on top of myself too......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thantu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Kind of nice of Verant to post a sign that says, &quot;Hey morons, move along because we aren't rezzing you after Faydedar comes along and whacks you.&quot; :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This is a LONGshot guess, but maybe it's a soulbinder that can bind those who can't bind themselves; but you have to do a quest that triggers the bind effect. So melee's can bind there like everyone else. Chances are I'm wrong, but who knows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>grumpeehead</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i agree with thantu, probably just a warning for those who go afk i guess... i don't think it'll be a soulbinder cause what does a melee need to get bound there for... if you can get a TL to bind you can probably get TL or port to where ever you died *shrug*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Deian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Just a warning for those who haven't figured this out:<br />
<br />
If you wanna whack this guy for skill increases and go afk, don't bind there beforehand. If you're afk whacking and the dragon spawns, you're in a death loop (which may last a LONG time) until you return.<br />
<br />
And the GM's will probably laugh at you too ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ding! Lvl 1!<br />
I seriously wonder how long that would take . . .</div></div><hr />

Just like Verant to accidentally make a new development buggy/exploitable :P</div></div><hr />

Faydedar used to path quite regularly over the fire pot room, and with the return of the bindability in the room (was an error the first time) it's just a little reminder about the dangers of binding here.    - Vaslin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tytann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Ah, the rogue msg board mentions something about Ring of Scale faction making you non kos. Guess I will farm MM for faction real soon. =)<br />
<br />
Funny story...everytime I gate to Firepots and if I see someone chilling/medding...I &quot;Hail&quot; the curesed travelor, the /laugh at him. I usually mutter something about his story being false tall tale story. hehe.<br />
<br />
Well what do you know, heard Fay was in the firepots last night. Sure nuff was....it was no tall tale for the people there medding. =D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>AlynaRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I saw faydedar munching on people in pot room. It's not really hard to click a fire pot and get out if this happens.. <br />
<br />
You resist dragon roar!  <br />
<br />
I just clicked a pot and left without hesitation. But I doubt that's going to be the case if i'm lacking gear.  <br />
<br />
Binding on the spires, means a longer swim/run to a pot to get out.</div></div><hr />

Just like those shop owners to not make their stores secure enough so looters could break in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Xalbus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I thought Faydwer was now a triggered spawn. I have been using the firepots since level 20 many levels later I have yet to see or hear Faydwer near there, nor have I heard of anyone getting killed by him there. I also read on Castersrealm's forums that they made it a triggered spawn.<br />
<br />
In regards to the traveler though. Be warned he does ocassionally riposte. Even though he doesnt attack he will riposte and you better be able to take 177 points of damage (now thats in totemic armor at level 32 with a pretty decent defense rating) because he will nail you hard. I got hit 3 times in a row and almost died when I went to check on the rumor that he doesnt attack  you (supposedly there is a merchant in SF that does the same)</div></div><hr />

<br />
LOL pwned<br />
<br />
One poster was dead on right tho. It's safer to bind in the room for a quick escape than on the spires, even tho you don't have access to TD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>greatmilenko_00</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">to aviod ripostes, just stand behind a mob,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Xalbus, there are 2 different faydedars.<br />
<br />
one of them spawns and roams for 2 hours every week before the iksar master kicks his ass, and one is spawned by dolgin codslayer for the druid epic. that also roams to the iksar master and gets his ass kicked after a while. usually after it's too late to rez your party trying to kill him :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Xalbus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Cool thanks for the info on the dragon. I have yet to see him in all my travels to TD and I frequently run to the various islands to hunt, usually invis. So here is to hoping  he cant see through invis! /em raises his stein in a toast.<br />
<br />
As for the traveler. I really want to try that out, now call me a wuss but I don't want to end up getting a warning from verant for doing this. I keep my nose pretty clean when I play so I haven't dealt with the GMs more than once or twice in the almost 1.5 years I have been playing. Do they consider this an &quot;exploit&quot; (/em waits for the groans from the old timers) if not I may just bind myself in Oggok so I dont end up getting the Fay death spiral and whiping out ye ol 1hb that I have neglected and getting it up to where is should be. The improved skills would be worth the trip. Again I am sorry if I sound like a noob but like I said my chanter has pretty much kept his nose clean during his travels but now that I am playing on a PVP server I can use all the edge I can get, legally of course ;).</div></div><hr />
