<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>garguren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">welp i started the task of Plign a cleric.. i regurely group with a 62 war 61 wiz and me 60 sham..<br />
<br />
we decided we'd like to have a cleric  so we twinked her out (250wis lvl 1 :)  allways has C3 as well as sham buffs but now the question is how to pl...<br />
<br />
i staretd at lvl 2 useing the orc camps in EC used a druid alt would pull with low lvl spell/snare and DS the cleric and cleric bash it once then mob kills it's self question is there a better way?<br />
<br />
it worked ok but takes long time seams per kill..<br />
<br />
<br />
any advice would be greatly apprecaited</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Waredan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, you said you had access to C3 which implies you have a chnater lying around. If that is a chanter that you can log on yourself or one of your close friends, get the warrior to fight stuff, then have the chanter memblur. After memblur, have the cleric do a coupla hits and whola, easy exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>garguren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">it is a friends chanter... and yes coeming i can log it on at any time... but have been asked to not take her out of nexus... i'd prolly kill her :)<br />
<br />
so far DF belts been good</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Blaand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">make a melee char like a monk, give him some crappy gear buff the poop outta him and then grp the two and let the monk do the dirt work.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
*edited b/c i have a podymouth</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">use the warrior to beat the mob down to a sliver then have the chanter mez and wipe.<br />
<br />
then let the cleric swing at it till he actually hits it and breaks mez.  then have the chanter root it so it dies to the DS.<br />
<br />
remember,  no mob can ever give more than 12.5% of a lvl no matter what lvl it is.</div></div><hr />
