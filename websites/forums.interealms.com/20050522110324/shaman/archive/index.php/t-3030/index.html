<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Syrenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just wanted to tell everyone that I have finally found my class and am sooo happy being a shaman!  After messing around with almost every other class there is I finally found satisfaction being a barb shaman.  I am only level 12, carry around a torch and my quested hammer of justice, but I am just so happy with that.<br />
<br />
Last night me and my friends crawled around Befallen and it was so much fun just me, a druid, a rogue, and a necro all level 11...we camped the second floor and we all got our new level just wacking away on the undead and it was a blast...even after I got a little tipsy from the beers I was drinking.<br />
<br />
I love my red braids, my huge tits, and my massive thighs...and the dorky positions I stand in with the Luclin graphics as well as the way I wave my hands in the air like I just don't care when casting...it looks hilarious like I'm trying to wave down a plane.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I just wanted to share my appreciation of the class with those who know it best.  Take care and may you always have mana.</div></div><hr />

Who cares if they can cast spells or not ?  I'd like a right clickie item that has unlimited charges of &quot;Summon Barb Red Head&quot;...you know for those down times after buffing and what not...no pun intended ! <br />

<br />
Hi, I am also in Oly and have just begun my search of others seeking the path of Shamanism.<br />
<br />
Out of the blue, I created a series of Bizarre Pen &amp; Ink, well... Talismans I guess you could call them?<br />
<br />
This has since Progressed, to giving into being compelled to create a weird line of Talisman type of Sculptures (small sculptures made with natural materials, with a hint of Movie Making Special Effects Materials, resins, and blow torches, etc...).<br />
<br />
The Creation Process is Nothing Less than Bizarre!!!<br />
<br />
These, well... Creations, seem to bring good luck to people, but none to me.<br />
<br />
Absolutely No-one can figure them out! smile...<br />
<br />
But hey, at least they bring someone good luck. <br />
<br />
Am I creating Karma?<br />
<br />
Am I missing the point of Shamanism?<br />
<br />
Who knows, but I want to walk my Own Path, and feel a nagging need to seek others walking their own paths, so that I can feel that I am not alone at least.<br />
<br />
Look forward to your answer, or anyone out their who has answers.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />
Your friend, Tony LN</div></div><hr />

EDIT:   Bleh, I had no idea that some weirdo bumped a 2 year old thread.  My apologies...but we did get to see Glori's new 'equipment'!</div></div><hr />

<br />
My signature artwork was given to me as birthday present by a friend some years ago. Im attatching it. In it you can also see my planned surname wich means Wolfsdaughter (wich got rejected and ended up in Whipmistress)...  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Also attaching the other barbarian female portrait she has made, its called Wudora Winterqueen.<br />
<br />
Here is her website if you wanna browse her other pictures:<br />

<br />
Vigdis: Did you try with &quot;Vargadottir&quot;? Sound more nordic/Viking that way. Atleast that is what I allways seen us shaman as, priests from the old Norse religion...  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think that Vargadottir might be either Norweigian or Icelandic spelling. Vargsdotter is the modern swedish spelling wich i opted for.<br />
<br />
Oh btw we used to have a Finnvairdottir on my server, but i think she was a Woodelf... not sure...<br />
<br />
Im swedish myself btw  ;)</div></div><hr />

Thats the dragonsnails first character on Vallon Zek, a rogue that only made it to lvl 14 before she decided to move to a blue server.<br />
<br />
We played together back then, but when she changed servers and moved to germany we havent played. Now we both more or less quit EQ. Its good she hasnt quit drawing :)</div></div><hr />

That was the first thing that popped into my head when I saw the Olethros picture there.. instantly thought of the ***? Comic appearances.. good stuff there..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Jhaiisiin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">http://www.formula119.com is where that Olethros pic originated.  Gotta love the artwork there.  I do my own but (me bein' a huge self-critic) it's in need of some serious fine tuning.  If what I'm workin' on now comes out half as well as I'm hopin', I may just toss a pic up.  <br />
<br />
Completely off topic, my magelo background was done by me.  First and only ogre I've ever drawn, and I'm rather happy with it. :)</div></div><hr />
