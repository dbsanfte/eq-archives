<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>hamani101</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i guess i'm looking for a clarification here<br />
<br />
topor/Q is 24 seconds<br />
<br />
SCR + SCRM so 24x.5=12, so 2 ticks for a total of 36 seconds<br />
<br />
Crown Of Ambivalence is a additional 15% and the way i have been told it is a garrenteed 2100 with a rare 2400 tick but when i do the math it just doesnt come out<br />
<br />
24x.65 (.3 for SCR + .2 for SCRM + .15 for crown) = 15.6 seconds for a total of 39.6 seconds (need 42 seconds for 7 ticks garrentted)<br />
<br />
15.6/6 = 2.6 ticks<br />
<br />
so i can see where it would make a 2100 tick more comman but not garrentted like people have said, and i dont see it ever doing 2400<br />
<br />
even if you take the math like this it doesnt get to a full 3 extra ticks ..<br />
<br />
24x.5=12 12+24=36<br />
36x.15=5.4  36+5.4=41.4 still not enough to make it a garrentted 7 ticks<br />
<br />
so could anyone clarify how Crown Of Ambivalence makes topor 2100/2400 garrentted like people have said, maybe i'm just missing something<br />
<br />
(on a side note, sorry about my bad spelling)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lyzzt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Healing Adept only effects Heals.  Torpor functions as a &quot;buff&quot; which is why SCR and SCRM act upon it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Walknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I guess since you are dealing with 2.6 ticks, you could end up with 7 or 6 ticks depending on when you cast the spell.  If you cast it at .3 before the first tick then you will end .3 after the last tick or in this case, tick 7.  I think in this case people are casting the spell just before the first tick lands in order to take advantage of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>JenamdarAL</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The one thing you are missing is all over time spells get 1 extra tick past what they are listed at. I have never heard a really good explaination on why this happens, but it does. Thats why everyone says they get 2100 always...cause you get 2100 with scrm. The crown gives you a chance at 2400, and very rarely 2700. I don't have the numbers in front of me from the tests I did last fall, but it worked out somthing like...2100 50%, 2400 40%, 2700 10%. That was out of 30ish tests.</div></div><hr />
