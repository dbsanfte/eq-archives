Two men are driving through New Jersey when they get pulled over by a State Trooper. The Trooper walks up and taps on the window with his nightstick, the driver rolls down the window and &quot;WHACK&quot;, the Trooper smacks him in the head with the stick. <br />
<br />
The driver says, &quot;What the hell was that for?&quot; <br />
<br />
The Trooper says, &quot;You're in New Jersey son. When we pull you over, you better have your license ready when we get to your car.&quot;<br />
<br />
The driver says, &quot;I'm sorry, Officer, I'm not from around here.&quot; <br />
<br />
The Trooper runs a check on the guys license, and he's clean. He gives the guy his license back and walks around to the passenger side and taps on the window. The passenger rolls down the window and &quot;WHACK&quot;, the Trooper smacks him with the nightstick too.<br />
<br />
The passenger says, &quot;What'd you do that for?&quot; <br />
<br />
The Trooper says,  &quot;Just making your wish come true.&quot; <br />
<br />
The Passenger says, &quot;huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
The Trooper says, &quot;I know that two miles down the road you're gonna say, &quot;I wish that asshole would've tried that shit with me</div></div><hr />
