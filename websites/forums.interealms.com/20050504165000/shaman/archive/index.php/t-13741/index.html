<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What in all of gods great creation were verant thinking when they made the Cann2 quest. Can someone please explain this to me ?<br />
<br />
This is a level 39 spell that you need friends that are 50ish to get. I did this with Litgruv and lucked out on the warlord bones and the clay but im on a new server with Setriak and i have very lil help for anything. I just spent about 3 hours tonite and 2 hours last night camping the Army behemoth at he temple. Guess where he spawns... On the second floor behide the reavers.  what is that about ? I just happened to have a friend farming reavers and i lucked out and they got it for me, but how in the world is a levle 39 group going to get behind reavers to the second floor ? And the warlord, i cant get a group to go in and kill this thing for me for the life of me. KC is bare these days cause the XP sucks, each time i zone in there is like 7 people. No one will try it unless a 55+ enchanter comes to help and you can guess how many times that happens anymore.<br />
<br />
I mean i like difficult quests, i really do, but this is insane if you ask me.<br />
<br />
ok i feel better<br />
<br />
/rant off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I feel your pain man. <br />
<br />
I helped a friend's new shaman do it a few months back....<br />
I spent 4 FULL days trying to find a Yun Shaman.<br />
Some days I used a tracker.<br />
Some days I didn't.<br />
Most days I offered 1kpp reward to find a Yun Shaman and/or to loot powder.<br />
<br />
Eventually I started /auc WTB Black Yun Shaman Powder paying 2kpp (in PoK/Nexus/Bazaar).<br />
That got me some about 15 mins later /ROFL<br />
<br />
Yes the quest sucks and yes it is WAY too hard for the level of shaman that can cast cana 2.<br />
<br />
The sad thing is that Cana 1 starts to REALLY suck badly and it becomes downright painful towards the levels where you get Cana 3...... though maybe its not so bad now that you can get KEI anytime you want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Salas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ummm,<br />
<br />
Why are u doing this quest?<br />
<br />
This is one that really gets me i didnt get my copy till i was lvl 50<br />
and by then cann 3 was right around the corner. Most shm i know just skipped this spell and waited till cann 3 its really awsome spell if u can get it at lvl 39 specially now with stocism but only twinked shm get it at 39</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I was doing the quest at 49 when I found the spell for sale in the bazaar for 2500pp.  Well worth it to avoid KC.<br />
<br />
The army behemoth does spawn in a few other places but it's very rare.  I have seen him in Llranc's house, the loft in the stables and below the temple.  With a lot of people soloing there for XP the clay is pretty common in the bazaar though.<br />
<br />
I agree that a quest for a level 39 spell should definately be done by at the most a full group of 39s.  I can't imagine a group of 39s doing either of the warlord camps in KC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I did it at 50 or so with my ranger when my shaman was 39/40. The clay dropped on a Reaver run, but from a mob outside the locked door. I got the bones in an exp group, the yun shaman is easy if you have tracking, and the crushed diamonds were just a run away. Of course, this was around 2 years ago when KC was heavily populated, but there are still several groups in there most times on Xev. The bones are the only nodrop bit, and can even be MQd.<br />
<br />
It's a bit much for a level 39 spell, I agree, but you should see the wizards' Concussion spell quest. It's a level 39 jolt-type spell, but the only wizards I know who've got it did the quest at 60+.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>sharookan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Is it just me or is the Stoicism Spell quest 1 million times easier ?<br />
i needed 6 Days for canni 2 but like 2 hours for stoicism.<br />
Not to mention i needed grps for KC but could do Stoicism solo.<br />
Sonys Idea of Quests is just sick</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bailie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">*mumbles* Not even going to talk about canni 2.  I had it done, but realized I had the wrong bones. *rolls her eyes* thats what I get for listening to someone who claimed to know what they were talking about.  Next time I confirm before turn in on the net.  Think im just going to skip it and wait for canni 3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Angryor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Army Behemoth is a fairly common spawn in the Gazebo's before the Reaver house.  <br />
<br />
When I was doing the right side of the bowling alley I would grab the gazebo's when bored.  I'd say 1/3 spawns would spawn the AB.  Also seen him pop twice in a 4 hour period at the temple. <br />
<br />
This was probably 8 months to a year ago though. /shrug<br />
<br />
Ang</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well i did the quest for 2 reasons. This is my second shaman and i really wanted to enjoy all the quests, i really dig quests that arent impossible.<br />
<br />
Secondly, i did this on Litgruv and it took me like a day, this was before c3/SoL/level 65. I was unguilded and pretty much friendless,i just played more casualy and for fun. I would meet people, we would be friends for a few levels, then either i would move to a new spot or they would. I did this whole thing solo with much easy. The only difference was the clay was given to me so this is my first time with it.<br />
<br />
bleh, cann1 is already being usless at 45, i always thought can2 was useful, pray to our ancestors my fellow shaman that i get some help in KC lol ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dasgood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">yeah *** is with this quest ..<br />
<br />
I did at 46 with a lot of help.  <br />
<br />
Clay I shouted CoM = lucky<br />
Yun got a tracker = easy<br />
KC i shouted and grouped for 4 days ... finally got 55 warrior to go to the jail by the hands and he was there .. killed and looted<br />
Diamonds = in TD .. just pick them up off the ground (get a druid tracker with succor and knowck out TT and TD)<br />
<br />
I have had it for 2 weeks .. havent cast it once =) C3 is so nice =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Army behemoth can spawn on any of the higher level spawn points in CoM. There's two of those relatively close to the front. In the stables, at the back of that little courtyard there's a ramp leading up to a little platform. He can spawn up there. <br />
<br />
On the temple side, he can spawn in the middle on that little stage. As well as any of the 6 gazebo spawns if you head toward the reaver house. Basically, any spot that can spawn a wraith, and a few more of the higher lvl mobs (Greater warbones and phantoms?) can pop the behemoth. I do agree with the rest of your rant though!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Biggest problem with the quest is lack of people hunting in KC and CoM nowadays.  I did it at 40 and it was a cinch.  <br />
<br />
Shaman powder I got with a group of friends hunting in Traks teeth and we were xp'ing the whole time so no problem there.  <br />
<br />
Army behemoth spawns in the first temple and was good xp at 40 with a decent group so that was another easy part.  <br />
<br />
TD was just a ground spawn so no problem there.<br />
<br />
KC was the one part I couldn't get with a group of ppl at level 40, but back then KC was so overcamped it was silly.  Most nights you had more trouble finding a mob alive and pulling it before someone else than anything, so you could just shout from zone in, while dodging trains, what you wanted to loot and typically within an hour at most one of the CY groups would have it drop and rot until you ran up....<br />
<br />
/shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>em2johns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'm with Sciek.  I had gotten the KC part of this quest long enough ago where KC was the place to be just after lvl 50.  The Shaman in TT was pretty easy to come by.  There was a shaman already there whining at the time, since he couldn't find a druid to track for him.  I showed him the error of his ways, when we wandered around the zone randomly without a tracker, and came by two powders in less than 2 hours.  Good stuff.</div></div><hr />
