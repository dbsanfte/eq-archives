<br />
Ok...how do I see past the tier 1 effects? <br />
Tjose are all things that i didnt want but I bet I can use the tier 5 or 6 stuff.<br />
And also......I know the high tier stuff is very expensive and uses alot. SO can you turn off tribute when you need to go AFK so you dont waste it?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

To answer your 2nd question, you can not turn off your tribute effects.  Once it's on, it wears off when you run out of points.  To get tier 5 tribute effects, I think you have to have enough points.<br />
<br />
Im not 100% sure on tier part because I've never used tributes before.  But I have heard numerous people say that you can't turn on/off tribute effects at will.  There is no on / off switch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You can turn them on and off at the tribute master, I don't recall the other stuff off the top of my head as it's been several months since I logged on :) (I think you can turn them off anywhere via the tribute window).  Try doing a search for tribute to find out everything as I know its on the board somewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">1. Go to tribute master in your home town. Give him platinum or loot. Some loot does well as tribute--search these.<br />
<br />
2. You can set the tributes you want at the Tribute master.<br />
<br />
3. Once a tribute is started, it can only be downgraded once you leave tribute master, that is you can turn them off.<br />
<br />
4. This is especially great for deciding whether or not a focus effect makes a great difference in an encounter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kryscha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">To 'downgrade' your tributes, use ALT+U to bring up the tribute window (once you've left the tribute master) and simply select the tribute effect and click downgrade.  If you've changed the default key mapping, then obviously you won't be pressing ALT+U.  You can keep downgrading until the effect is removed.</div></div><hr />
