<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>phuber</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering what you all think is the best buyable shaman boots out there.. Would these be considered the best? (non no drop) They seem very desierable, I recently got torpor and was wondering how flowing thought items effect shamans=) Seeing that mana has been relatively easy to keep high.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ciele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well depending on your server if you can get a White Dragonscale Helm and turn it into White Dragonscale Boots, those are probably the best boots money can buy.<br />
<br />
On the otherhand Boots of Flowing Slime are real nice.  I wear mine when soloing, where the extra mana starts to add up.<br />
<br />
Personally, I love Flowing Thought.  I really think it adds up, being able to cast an extra Bane of Nife every 10 minutes or so starts to show up, especially if you are just soloing or duoing with someone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I wore a pair of the slime boots for a while, but I never really noticed much benefit to the way I work, although the FT is nice.  Course, that was the only Ft I had too, so I imagine it would have been more noticeable if I had some more besides it.  Don't particularly like the ac on the boots though, plus it doesn't fit my mental image of myself to be wearing those :cool: <br />
<br />
I'd rather have the Vindi boots, or POM boots myself, I know most would say the White dragonscale boots, but I'm an oddball to start with anyways :p</div></div><hr />
