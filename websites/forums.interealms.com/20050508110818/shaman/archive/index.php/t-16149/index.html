<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sullon One</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">To correct this issue, we will be removing the flag requirements for entry into the following Planes of Power zones:<br />

Bastion of Thunder<br />
Plane of Tactics<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Tactics is a unique zone. When guilds go in to fight RZtW, the pit area, which many people exp in, becomes the staging grounds for the final battle. And unless you are there for the RZ fight, you wouldnt want to be anywhere near the pit at that point.<br />
<br />
Its best not to have too many people there... I thinks anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Here's a snippet from the patch when they opened up the planes...  Doesn't mention Tactics, so it still requires a flag, as you'd expect:<br />
<br />
- Planes of Power access - Planes of Power has provided us with valuable insight into the group and guild dynamics that are involved in large scale games.  The way that we had expected guilds to advance through the story of Planes of Power has become a problem for some guilds as some members have fallen behind and found it difficult to catch up.  Obviously this was not our intention.  We want people to play with their friends and guild mates.<br />
 <br />
To correct this issue, we will be allowing characters to enter the following Planes of Power zones by meeting a simple level requirement:<br />
 <br />
Level 55 and over<br />
Plane of Storms<br />
Plane of Torment<br />
Plane of Valor<br />
Crypt of Decay<br />
<br />
Level 62 and over<br />
Bastion of Thunder<br />
Halls of Honor<br />
<br />
Characters that don't meet the level requirement may still enter these zones using the existing flags, and raids may still bring additional unflagged or lower level characters with them.  All other planes with flag or story requirements for entry will still require those flags, and those flags can still be obtained as they always have.<br />
<br />
This will make the majority of Planes of Power zones available to characters over the minimum level, and will allow their guilds to travel and adventure together in the planes.  We understand that those that have already earned the entry flags for these zones have put some effort into that accomplishment.  We will be giving a reward to those that have done so, though you'll have to wait to see what that reward is.</div></div><hr />
