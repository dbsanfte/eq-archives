<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Moglyzok Moogleman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was level 31 at the time, and i was getting restless about hunting Ry'gorr orcs, so i decided id try to get a group there.  Of course i did, but death of course struck, the puller wanted to pull an elite guard, but of course it ended up being 5 and the oracle of ry'gorr or some MOB like that, he was about as tough and had SOW (ick) so when they came before i could even begin my heal the tank was dead, we all began to run, but they came for me...<br />
<br />
Ry'Gorr Elite guard hits YOU for 102 <br />
Ry'Gorr Elite guard hits YOU for 57 Ry Gorr Elite guard bashs YOU for 15 <br />
You are stunned! <br />
Ry'Gorr Elite guard hits YOU for 114 <br />
<br />
and so on, but luckily with half a red bub left i ran away, and made it, of course i had a train of alot of orcs, a snow griffin, and a cougar, no one was hit by the train though, so i was somewhat happy.  Later that night we took out the chief with a little help... and i got my spine chill spear!</div></div><hr />
