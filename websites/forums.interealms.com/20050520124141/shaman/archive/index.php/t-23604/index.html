<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Lets just pretend for a minute that your a bit bored with playing your shaman.  What class would you play and why? I have a few different alts, most of them are pretty twinked, I have a necro-22 he seems to be a lot of fun, but it gets boring after a while.. I have a 41 Ranger, who is super twinked..To the exteme.. Lots of fun, but blah, pretty boring after a while. a 42 Sk, lots of fun, worthless pet, but not to bad, and a 52 Barbarian Warrior, a ton of fun to play, super twinked, but sadly, he seems to die the most due to the time I play and the folks Ive been running in too... <br />
     Maybe IM just getting bored with the game..who knows...I guess time will tell.. What toons do you play when you get a bit bored with your shammy?  And what class would you play if you were bored with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Banana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">you say twinked to the extreme what items does your ranger have ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ive been playing a alt lately.<br />
<br />
Work, TV, Movies, Books, anything thats a &quot;alt&quot;ernative to EQ and more so SoE.<br />
<br />
Sorry i couldnt resist. Hope i didnt ruin your thread mate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">To me, a Rogue is a fun Alt.  Lots of fun abilities and skills, and of course big damage numbers that don't require mana!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>jratkins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I, like most shaman in my guild, have more alts than I would like to list but I do have a 65 Rogue and 65 Ranger on one accnt and I also have a 65 Cleric on his own accnt.  I rarely 2 box anymore so when I get tired of playing the shaman I load up one of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Draconis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I love my necro level 52 atm but have not played him in a while do to working on the skyiron quests with shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I had a beastlord that I got to 62, but then I decided EQ was boring and repetitive so I quit EQ.  That was five months ago, although I do log on once every couple months to keep track of some friends (friend keeps my account active for 2boxing).  I wish my friends would all quit; until then, I just don't have the heart to uninstall EQ.<br />
<br />
Anyway, beastlord was definitely more fun than shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I like to 2box, yea, I know it's not an alt. After I two boxed for awhile it seems to boring just playing my single acount. For fun I powerlevel my other characters. <br />
As for a single alt, maybe try a mage, I guess there broken at higher levels but who cares it's something new. I haven't played a mage past 8 I just haven't had a chance. I like my necro, granted I've been powerleveling him most of the time he can hold his own though they are a pretty powerfull class I truely like the necros. I'm not much for any tank type classes, I have a monk, and I feel wierd when I'm in a group and someone is healing him besides me that's just because I'm so use to my shaman healing him.<br />
*disclamer*<br />
When I get a group that involves me doing more then just hitting slow and inc and tossing in a few nukes I just 1 box..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>tangurena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have a little gnome sk that I play on a totally different server (pun intended). No way of twinking that char, so its kind of odd being the least twinked in a group, or having some newbie quest armor in the upper 20s. I also tend to play that one when I get sick of the politics on my regular server.<br />
<br />
Almost 2 years ago, I got tired of the head games in a guild my shaman was in (and only the shaman was in that guild), and just camped my shaman for about 6 months. I played pretty much every other character in my stable, and mostly played my paladin (got up to the upper 50s) during that time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Faern was my first main.  I got frustrated with some Shaman things and made a Monk.  LOVED the Monk.  Then came the nerf and some other things (Mostly Mystyqe).<br />
<br />
So yes, I play an alt. Enchanter. Frustrating at times (other people's idiocy), but you aren't waiting to level 60 to reach your peak, nor do you top out AT 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Piwacket</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have a level 12 cleric<br />
a level 12 enchanter<br />
alevel 19 ranger<br />
a level 24 druid<br />
and I just created and started playing a beastlord..level 6 so far<br />
<br />
I still like my shaman best....<br />
I put a lot of time in her ..237 days played...and a lot of work on tradeskills.<br />
I just can't give her up :-/<br />
(have 3 GM trophys so far and am on the 8th shawl )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I got no empty character slots. Played a couple Paladins to 20ish, same with Berserker, Bard and Necro.<br />
<br />
Only characters I got up further in level is, my Shaman, of course, My warrior to 51, my original character I stopped playing years ago, and the other two are active alts. A 55 Beastlord and 46 Monk.<br />
<br />
The Beastlord is fun, definately very powerful in comparrsion to most any other class (if not all) but I just don't have as much fun playing him as my Shaman. When playing the Beast I miss the Heals Canni and especially Roots among other things.<br />
<br />
Though lately I've been having a blast with my Monk. I had him naked for a while after the mitigation nerf (though didn't notice much at his level, it was just discouraging) But with the new paci ability they get he's a blast to play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I've played monk, necro, bst, ber, rogue, wizard as an alt.<br />
<br />
By far, the necro is my favorite.  Love solo'ing with him, as well as being probably the most powerful two box char I have with the shaman.<br />
<br />
Second place for me is the zerker.  Very simple abilities, good aggro, fun to throw stuff.  <br />
<br />
For most the stuff I like to do (farming for firegiant toes, veksar, etc..) shaman can tank fine.  I suppose if wanted to try some harder stuff, beefing up the zerker, or shadownight, would be my best choice.<br />
<br />
But the versatility of the necro can't be beat.  FD pulls, group heals, mindwrack, harmshield, harmshield, harmshield.  Man I've been able to do some great pulls with harm+FD.  Not to mention, when I'm not paying attention, I can HS the necro if he's about to die and get the mob back on the shaman.  DPS is very very good with a necro.   And his mana regen is insane.  His pet can offtank well, so between you, dog dog, necro, and pet, you are basically a 4 man group in older content.<br />
<br />
I also have fun charming undead sometimes:) I can be a baby chanter for a bit.  <br />
<br />
I've also found that the necro dmg spells are a nice compliment.  For instance, in veksar, the undead near the haste belt are basically immune to poison and disease.  So the shaman becomes tank+healer. zero dps.  However, Necro fire+magic burns them down fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">63 Shaman, Gandwer as my main.<br />
<br />
I played a SK twink for a while pre-Luclin (deleted him when the bazaar opened, I needed to liquidate him to buy shammy gear.). He was pretty fun, but for some reason I've been unable to play one since.<br />
<br />
Currently, I have a mess of alts.<br />
<br />
- Level 55 Beastlord that someone keeps bitching at me about on the boards :) He's lots of fun, but at the current level, he sucks, haven't played him much.<br />
- Level 40 Druid and level 26 Necro on Rallos. Used totry to PvP, but I DETEST the new changes.<br />
- Level 30 Wizard and Warrior on my main account. The warrior was a twinked and leveled gift to my baby sister back when she played, the Wizard happened when I had too many robes i couldn't sell.<br />
- Level 34 rogue on test. Must fun class i've ever played, but yet, the hardest to get anywhere with. Even a warrior can solo very, very slowly...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Harmonisia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I have a rogue, but don't play it a lot. I prefer make my AA :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Got a 65 necro flagged for time and KT, a 55 beastlord with epic, pofire claw, wood elf crown, working on a bard now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">16 Gnome Pally, semi twinked (about 1k hps unbuffed).  She is my first and only alt I have had in over 3 years of playing.  I almost feel like I am cheating on my shaman :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Ive had a few alts.<br />
<br />
Played a ranger to 57.  Fun, had about 150K in gear for him.  Got bored of not finding groups and liquidated his inventory.<br />
<br />
Now the only alt that I actively play is a wizard who is 30% into 59.  Why wizard?  Cause I cant buff anyone but myself and my one and only job is to blow things up.  Very different from the shaman and good stress relief.  Just got him Tactics flagged, so now Im really starting to have fun with him</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Ive been playing WoW stress test this past week as my alt but before that I would play my warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Heh, I sound like Griz. I have a 65 ranger/paladin/mage with a few hundred aa between them and then I have a 61 monk/beastlord. I enjoy getting alts up higher level so I can box them with my shaman. My ranger is pretty decent equipped and is KT flagged and only missing a few for time. My mage and beastlord have almost every useable 1 group item from all the eps because I think its fun to twink. Yeah I play too much :\<br />
<br />
Even though some are more fun at times, I think my ranger is probably the best &quot;alt&quot; (if you want to call it that) I have had. I can do so much stuff with him that I just can't with others. Could be that he's the best equipped and has by far more aa's, but in the long run its nice to basically be able to do what I want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">If you all like low level pallies, solo with them in Unrest.  Best solo with a pally till level 39 and so much fun.  Talk about woah</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>psosnake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">56 SK and they are a fun alt to play, i think i play my shammy so agressively cuse of playing the sk 1st. only fun cuse of such a different style of play, root rotting a mob as opposed to fear kiting makes things intresting. fear kite is a fun to do in tight quarters makes it exciting lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I have a 65 cleric alt, was intended as a buff/rez bot, but sometimes I just play him. Sometimes I'll use him as a mana battery, duoing with my shaman. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">pinkurth is my alt warr, just hit lvl 51, so much fun to run around with spell casters hanging on your coat tails and step up to some smelly orc as a 8' tall ogre and pound his face in.<br />
i will two box him with kurth until WoW then, im going taureen shaman all the way baby :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Not that I am bored with my Shaman, but I have a 65 Rogue that I have been two-boxing as of late.  He is level 65 with 12 AAs.  Slowly, I have been working on his PoP flags for EP / Time / GoD.<br />
<br />
Why did I pick a rogue?<br />
<br />
At the time, it appealed to me.  It was something to do when there was downtime from raids, and I did not feel like working on my shaman.  As I played my Rogue more and more, I found that I actually liked playing him.  My friends would tease me if I started to jump for joy if I got a new max BS.</div></div><hr />
