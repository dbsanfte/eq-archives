<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>lordhiss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">well first off to start it off shammies are slower main healers, nuker, and DoTs. the main stat you want for this is Sta and keep it high enough to give u enough life to keep you alie.  then you need intelligeience becuase all shammies want to be SMAT when a sexxy wood elf comes along.  well when in a group this is what you should do<br />
1.  if a monk FD pulls nuke the mob andslow it and after slow lands nuke it again so you maintain agro.  since we can easily out tank any class even in Time.<br />
2. if you are pulling pull with slow and when mob cartches up to you nuke contantly to gain agro.  now if you go OOM you know u r doing a great job by keeping the warrior alive.  just sayi need 20 minutes to regen becuase i forgot KEI and i have to go take a shower.<br />
3. ifa warrior says assist this shows his weakness as a MT so constanly slow and nuke yo gain agro<br />
4. if cleric goes OOM and u have to heal..dont. this shows weakness in teh cleric and why should you heal for a cleric who cant keep mana.  <br />
5.  if a big train comes and chanters mexxes all hes doing is making a mob immobable so u cant nuke it dead so getyour best nuke out and spamm it.  <br />
6. if someone says TRAIN hes yelling at you to pull more mobs and pull em to camp so you can kill faster<br />
7.DoT every mob if their mzzed so themob takes damage while itsmezzed<br />
8. attack anger 3aug to your weapon so ucan keep agro from that warrior and keep him alive.  now if your mana is full go pull some more mobs maybe 3 or 4 and start nuking them.<br />
9. if you die from over nuking.  it aint your fualt its the groups from not keeping you alive and not killing the mobs you helped bring fast enough.<br />
<br />
nowwhen you solo.<br />
1. bring about 10 mobs to u and let pet tank.  if your pet dies bring it to a group near u and let them get the exp becuase you are too weak to kill them.<br />
2. if u see some one running to a group with a mob behind him hes running for help so go nuke that mob and take the agro so u can save this person<br />
3. do not root asit shows weakness in a shammy for not being able to out run a mob.<br />
4.constantly DoT tehn cancle magic the mob to make sure he has no buffs on it.<br />
<br />
when looking for a group<br />
1. showa group your pulling skills by pulling 4mobs into their camp<br />
2. if you get a group dont bother with a C3 or anything like that who needs it were UBER enough not to need one.  <br />
3. conatantly use emotes to spamm people and say you are lfg<br />
4. if people ask if your free say yes but you wil need a 1 hout afk to get food and eat.<br />
5. help a group by DoTing everything<br />
<br />
the use of canni<br />
1. constantly use canni toget your mana back even in a fight<br />
2. if u die form over cnaning yell at the other healers for not keeping you alive<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>ryoz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">spell check is your friend... seriously though, its bad enough that sony picks on us as much as they do... only class with set duration invis.. thats SELFONLY... the fact that we get a great upgrade nuke yoppa's spear 43 extra mana for 3 hp of dd over velium strike.. ya i know cast time cut almost in half.. not worth it imho.  oh ya we DO get the best haste in the game, rabid bear 99% haste.. for 6min and can use it ever 2 hours.. how nice... <br />

<br />
i think i might have to try the anger3 aug~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Froggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Anger 3 is war only I think :(. I was going to put one in my 1.5 so that I can piss off all my tank friends when I grouped with them, but then I was told they were warrior only. There were many tears on my part. My friends rejoiced though. I dont think any of them wanted to exp with me when I am procing anger and taking their aggro to the point where they have to work to keep it. Not that I didnt do that anyway. I always tested the tanks I grouped with's aggro management abilites.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ughbash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">As noted anger 3 augment from EF is Warrior only, our best aggro augment is LDON SRO augment 150 points and 0 second stun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>apocobring1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">nooo no anger 3 .. *cry*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Zeltaria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">*LOL*<br />
<br />
I always get piffy with tanks that loose agro over me, and I hardly ever do anything to get agro! hehe ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jenoah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">FNALLY!!! Soemoen woh nknows hw too played a shammy!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Dread</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Replace everwhere he says nuke with 69 Curse.  Curse is more agro!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Shlob</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Try your first DoT shamans get Tainted Breath and spamm it no one can take your aggrop if you get 4 or 5  cast on before anyone else has a chance i use it to kite in PoFire and PoV. not even a necro with all his DoT's stacked on him can take it. its fun to do that and then bitch about tank taking aggro :0) make sure you tell him you were just playing with him after so not to seem like to much of an *******.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">A word from the wise: Jokes are a LOT funnier when you spell them correctly. =)</div></div><hr />
