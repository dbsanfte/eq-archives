<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Antmf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What is difference in terms of desireability in grps and soloability from post 50 shaman to post 60 shaman. I am presently 56 and gonna grind hard to get 60 before the weekend is out and just wanted to here from you post 60 shaman so I can psych myself up to this this :) I did use the search but could not find anything I was looking for in terms of an answer. Thanks...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The difference I found was in ease of getting a group.<br />
<br />
i just hit 60 a few days ago.  Previous to that I could sit in PoT LFG for hours (seriously!)  I would get an invite to a group and then they would find I was only 59 (usually AFTER I traveled to the zone) and decide to keep looking (very annoying, and quite insulting).  <br />
<br />
After hitting 60 I get tells within 10 seconds of tossing LFG up.  The filter that people use (/who shaman 60 65 lfg all) is what does it.<br />
<br />
Since I cant afford any of the 60 spells besides focus there is no difference to me between 59 and 60.  Ill tell ya when I hit 65 though....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The 61 pet and 25 hps/tick regen made me insanely happy when PoP came out.  Still do, actually.  *grin*  After that 51 slow, I didn't seem to have a problem getting groups ever... but things may be different now.  A lot more shaman bots out there.  I still seem to hear from a lot of fairly desperate people in PoN, PoD, etc trying to find a shaman... *shrug*  There's an absolute glut of them hanging out in BoT these days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lorddaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">shamans are highly desired. i rarely sit in PoTranq very long LFG before i get a few dozen tells asking me to join them. <br />
<br />
last night i went to droga with a pickup group. i got 35% exp in 3 hours. at this rate i'll be 60 by friday.<br />
<br />
mySK is in the &quot;limbo hell&quot; of 57, he's got the gear and i've got the skill to pull in tier 2 pop, but people see the level and automatically assume he doesn't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">As soon as I disband I usually get an invite (62 shaman).  Problem is that when I'm disbanding I'm usually going to bed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kamorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">At lvl 65 I usually get invited into BOT or HOH every time I log in, so yes we are very much desired in PoP groups.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Xorraiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I did 56-62 in PoV with guild groups, there is a HUGE difference on slow landings at 56 vs 62+...the LC/RC mobs are all generally lvl 62/63, BC camp is all lvl 63 mobs. Most groups prefer a quick landed slow of a 60+ shaman to a shaman that may need to Malo first on every pull. <br />
HOWEVER, the exp at 56-60 in PoV is literally OFF THE HOOK!!</div></div><hr />
