<br />
this has come up repeatedly in group and guild discussions, and no one seems to have the right answer. I have a sneaking suspicion that the answer is not a cookie cutter simple one....<br />
<br />
so here it is, when a full group of 6 has levels varying from 60-70, who gets the better experience? (or as it has been said, who SUCKS all of the experience?) lol<br />
<br />
my thought is that all get a proportional ammount in varying degrees depending on the level of the mob VS char lvl. that would seem right...but is it?<br />
<br />
I know that many of you have researched this with all of the parsering and checks, and tables that have been player created. A search didnt get me the answer, so i ask=D<br />
<br />
thanks too, i will post the answer on the guild website for all to see!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Here's my understanding on a group made up of 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70:<br />
<br />
Say, for round numbers, mob is L 68, and has a base value of 10,000 XP.<br />
<br />
Each groupie starts with 1/5 of that (six-person bonus), so 2,000 as a base of XP given.<br />
<br />
Any of the toons might have 20% going to Lead XP, and some percentage going to AALP, and also might actually require more (or less) Level XP due to race. But this doesn't affect the initial 2,000 XP starting figure for any of them, just what impact it has on the various pools' percanetages.<br />
<br />
Every toon should get a gross 2,000 XP figure to start with. Since the level 58 toon was the same level as the mob (mob was white), that's it. 2,000 XP gross = 2,000 XP net.<br />
<br />
Since the level 69 toon was a little higher level relative to that of the mob, the 2,000 gross XP will be reduced somewhat (mob was blue) - we don't know the real number, but let's say to 1,800 net XP. <br />
<br />
Since the level 70 toon was even higher level, relative to that of the mob, the 2,000 gross XP will be reduced even more (mob was blue). Again, we don't know what, but let's say to 1,500 net XP.<br />
<br />
Now, the level 67 toon was lower level relative to that of the mob, so the 2,000 gross XP will be bumped up (mob was yellow), let's guess 2100 or so net XP.<br />
<br />
The level 66 toon was also even lower level relative to that of the mob, so the 2,000 gross XP will be bumped up (mob was yellow), let's guess 2250 or so net XP.<br />
<br />
Lastly, the level 65 toon was lower yet, elative to that of the mob, so the 2,000 gross XP will be bumped up (mob was red), so let's guess 2500 or so net XP.<br />
<br />
Note, however that these are just illustrative numbers; I don't think anyone knows the actual percentage bonuses/penalties for the relation between mob and toon levels.<br />
<br />
Note also that the raw amount of Level XP required for the lower level toons to get a percent (or bubble) of XP is smaller than that required to span the same percentage of the higher levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>leibeast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">thank you samanna! kinda what i suspected, and great to know=) cut/paste/posting on guild website!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm not even sure the gms or devs know the answer to this questions fully because there are so many things involved.<br />
<br />
Base exp for mobs used to be lvl * lvl * ZEM (zone experience modifier) and I don't think that has actually changed. It just jumps threw about 20 billion hoops after that before it gets figured out.<br />
<br />
The next thing that happens I assume is the grouping bonus. The more people in the group the more exp a mob gives. Going from 5 people to 6 people adds an additional 20% exp so that the last person is free. In that adding the player even if they do nothing automatically adds enough bonus so that everyone else is getting the same share. IE 100 / 5 = 20 and 120 / 6 = 20.<br />
<br />
I beleive at this point exp is just divided evenly among everyone in the group. It used to be based on how much exp you already had which ment higher level players got more exp and hybrids (which had exp penalty) got even more but that was removed.<br />
<br />
The next thing that happens is it starts playing with how much exp you actually get. It should at this point take off the 20% exp if you've got raid or group leader aa's turned on.<br />
<br />
I think then at this point it applied the level bonus for &quot;difficult&quot; mobs. I'm pretty sure this is only a bonus for difficult mobs and not a penalty for easy mobs. When they first implimented it people complained because it was a penalty for easy mobs (got less exp for shrooms in FG than before) and they changed it around so it was always at least as good as before the change. This should actually start kicking in on &quot;high blue&quot; mobs with in 4 or 5 levels of your own level if memory serves and gets bigger as they con higher and higher.<br />
<br />
The next thing I think happens is it splits what ever's made it to this point between regular exp and AA exp by what ever you have the slider set to.<br />
<br />
Final possible thing is that for hybrids they get an exp bonus applied to their regular exp to counter the exp penalty they were setup with.<br />
<br />
I can't say for sure this is how things happen but given all the adjustments that occur this is the way that makes sense and would seem to work out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>leibeast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">kinda what i was thinking, tho i could not put it so well=) good to know, and this will stop the whining from lower levels claming that the higher ups suck all the XP out of a grp!<br />
<br />
lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vivitron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm surprised the lower levels were whining about lost xp. In a practical sense grouping with higher ups usually means an increased kill rate on tougher mobs that more than makes up for any xp lost to the split.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>7ekno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Think its all been upped and changed quite a bit.<br />
<br />
We were in KT (started out 3 of us) just XPing .... <br />
<br />
In a 3some, each person got 2.5% of an AA level ... we knew this, because 1 kill it jumped 2%, the next 3%, the next 2%, etc ...<br />
<br />
We then added 2 more people to make it a 5some, it was a constant 3% AA per kill ....<br />
<br />
Then a 6th, and it went to 3%, 3%, 4%, 3%, 3%, 4%, implying 3.3% AA per kill ...<br />
<br />
And with 6 in a group, the kills were so much faster AND more XP per person ....<br />
<br />
Its worth grouping now days,<br />
Tek</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>leibeast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">yes it is worth grouping=) and, you are also so right! in a higher level group the XP flyas for someone 10 levels lower! some people just like to grumble no matter HOW much sugar they get on their cookies!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Xaas Boneweaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Last thing I saw, was your base xp is determined by total level of group divided by your level. This gives you the % of the mobs xp that you get. Now when your grouped with at least 5 people, you get the max grouping bonus, but if you add the 6th person there xp is free.<br />
<br />
So, if you have a mob with 100xp<br />
The 70 gets .205<br />
the 69 gets .202<br />
the 68 gets .2<br />
the 67 gets .197<br />
the 66 gets .194<br />
the 65 gets .191 &lt;- is free xp.<br />
<br />
This is created by your level / sum of the 5 highest in the group, in this case it was 70/340 for the level 70. The 65 is used in the same formula but there xp is free.<br />
<br />
Now after all of this, you apply all the bousus and such, like an pally/ranger/sk gets 1.4 times more xp per kill as they are nolonger effected by there class penailty, and grouping bonus.<br />
<br />
anyway that's what I remeber them saying after they revamped group xp.<br />
<br />
Xaas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>leibeast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">OK..being devils advocate that i am here...<br />
<br />
so if the mob is red to the 65, and DB to the 70, wouldnt the % be higher for the 65 because of lvl of the mob VS player lvl?<br />
<br />
Hrmmm...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If it does split based on level the level 70 would get a larger amount when the split occurs but when the bonus for difficult mobs is applied later the lvl 65 player will get a bigger bonus so it's possible the lvl 65 will get a large amount of exp numerically even tho they got a smaller percent of the split.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>leibeast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">That makes perfect sense to me ...cause i know a red mob gives a higher XP gain then even cons or DB....<br />
<br />
so  it follows that those in grp for whom the mobs are red would get a higher % then those that the mob is ...say DB to. <br />
<br />
even LESS reason to grumble!</div></div><hr />
