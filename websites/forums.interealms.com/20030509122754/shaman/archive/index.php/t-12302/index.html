<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Its early, so this could be an enormous n00b question....<br />
<br />
So over the last weeks we have killed the AoW and statue a few times, next thing I know, I am max ally to CoV! Blew my mind....so, of course I think its time to go big game hunting in WW for some fun. <br />
<br />
Now I have solo'd a few of the gimp nest dragons, yeld, hech, brav, no big deal. But I have always been KOS as hell out there and it was a huge pain in my ass. <br />
<br />
So im thinking, great im max ally, lets go smack Allyish ( tov trench dragon ). Buff up ( self buffs thx no kei you fiends ), summon doggie, pull, proceed to start giving her the beat down....<br />
<br />
..... Hmm....whats that purple dragon on the horizon doing? Looks kinda pissed...yep, Bufa just ate my dog....now she's trying to eat me..slow lands first cast and I am tanking 2 of them for a minute...screw this, run my port-o-matic druid over and bail.<br />
<br />
Try #2. Similar, except no bufa this time. <br />
<br />
yeah instead Zil Sarapa graces me with her presence...I didnt even see it coming....gflux for 1250 and chewed me up and spit me out quick like. <br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, point being is that I had always read that being non kos to CoV makes life 100% easier because the dragons wont assist each other. Obviously I am wrong and they do have social agro. I guess being non kos is just to help scout, which I will do and keel Ally sooner or later. <br />
<br />
Possible they were agroing my dog first and then attacking me? Or possible they just wandered near enough to get hit with Ally's aoe, thus pissing them off? I'm not sure. Or have they always worked that way?<br />
<br />
signed, your noob, krakster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Dragons will always assist each other unfortunately, as long as you are fighting one of them, or dragging a corpse your faction is meaningless.<br />
<br />
    However, if you are not directly engaged with a mob it seems that the aggro assists work a bit differently.   It is a lot safer to run away from a recent pull if you are ally then if you are KOS.   So tag the mob with slow/malo then run it over to a place where nothing will path near you (Over the cliffside down on the beach near boat is where i normally use).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well mobs in WW are social to each other , it doesnt matter if your ally or KoS if one is being attacked there is a certain radius that is established and once the wanderer crosses it they will assist. The only thing being ally should affect is your ability to scout the area. <br />
<br />
I remember my first shot at yeldema, i pulled her kinda close to the coast and was sitting way back on the edge letting pet tank with Q on him to see how he did incase i wanted to gate or whatever , was just testing it. Well a drake came and wandered by her nest which was a great distance i though from us , so i didnt think it would add, well i was wrong. Needless to say i learned to not let anything anywhere close to me when im fighting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hehe, you had Q on your first attempt at Yeldema?  You're even less adventurous than I am.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Caanus has it on the nail, the only dragon I kill in situ is Yeldema, she burns down nice and quick now so its not worth pulling her around, just wait for a window in the roamers (3 path near her) then just get in there and gank her =)<br />
<br />
All the others are far better off pulled to the shoreline outcrop near the gnome boat, I've had a fair few 25 minute + fights there and only ever had 1 add.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Lost the 1st time to somebody assisting Yeldema, too.  Learned to pull her to no-man's land (no-dragon's land?) to fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Adds are so bizarre in WW.  I've had a drake pass by so close while I was engaged with Yeldema that I was certain it would add.  Other times, I've had stuff add seemingly out of nowhere.</div></div><hr />
