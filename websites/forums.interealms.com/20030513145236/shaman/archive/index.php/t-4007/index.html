<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just finished the Coldain Military Wristguard quest.  It flat out ROCKS, especially with the extended afflicition III focus effect.  <br />
The quest is definately not broken.  Easy to do at 51 with a Troll warr twinky.  Two thumbs, way up.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>iamagator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I am about to do this quest myself and was wondering if I'd be able to do it solo being a 52 Iksar Shammy.  Sounds like a winner  :)  Grats on getting the goods  :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, it depends.  How is your giant faction, how is your dorf faction.   What I did, was team up with another shaman friend and duo the whole quest.  I made a lev 8 Troll War Twink (for the Kael portion). Here is a quick run through:<br />
<br />
1.) I started by killing massive quantities of Coldain Tracking Wolves until each of us had a Blood Wolf spawn and we got our harness (dropable)<br />
<br />
2.) Gave War Twinky the harness, ran him to Kael and turned the Harness in to Giant Wolf Tamer.  Received Giant version of it.<br />
<br />
3.) Ran to Crystal Caverns, had main shammy slaughter orcs until Bottle of Karsin dropped.  Twink looted bottle.<br />
<br />
4.) Twink ran to Turgadin and handed in bottle. Received Gem.<br />
<br />
5.) Ran Twink to Kael (not that hard, remember he is Non KoS to both dorfs and giants) and turned in gem, received giant version of gem.  Turned in giant version of gem and giant version of harness to same mob (Giant Wolf tamer), received Controll Harness.<br />
<br />
6.) Ran back to GD.  Ran main Shaman to Dorf miner cave and logged her there.  Had partner invis up my War twinky.  War Twinky goes into the Shardwurm Cave and turns in the Controll Harness to Broodmother. Log main Shaman back in.<br />
<br />
7.) Korf the Dorf respawns outside the miner cave as a &quot;blue to 51&quot; mob.  Wait until the Broodmother arrives, root him dot him nuke him.  He hits for up to 117, and is easily done with dog dog.<br />
<br />
8.) Loot your new bracer.<br />
<br />
Couple comments.  The final fight can be done rather easily solo 50+  When we did it the second time, two Korfs spawned and aggroed us.  That would have been ugly solo.  Only one of them dropped the bracer.  I think the quest can be done solo, only challenge is to get someone to invis you twink.     If anyone on RN needs help with the quest, my Faction Twink is happy to help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I did this one in a sickeningly short amount of time.  <br />
<br />
1) Make RZ Troll mule. <br />
<br />
2) Get port, bind, and sow in Thurgadin from a guildie.   15 mins<br />
<br />
3) Run Mule to CC and loot Acid from velium farmers. Death gate to Thurg and turn acid in.  15mins<br />
<br />
4) Get main to Thurg and drop off bazaar bought wolf harness.  5 mins with gate potion.<br />
<br />
5) Run mule to Kael for turn-ins. 15 mins<br />
<br />
6) Run mule to Broodmother cave with invis and camp.  15 mins<br />
<br />
7) Run main to Dwarf cave entrance and camp.  5 mins<br />
<br />
8) Logged mule on the next morning to find Broodmommy up.  Turned in harness of control and camped.  2mins<br />
<br />
9) Log Main, wait for broodmommy, whack dwarf, loot bracer.  10mins.<br />
<br />
I embellished on the times a tad, but the whole thing took less than 2 hrs.  Death gate with all items intact makes this quest trivial.  I also messed around exploring Kael while non kos for a change.  Good luck, it is a nice effect on a bracer with decent stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shjekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just to add:<br />
ANY RZ worshipper will do. I have a human atm muling(new word!) this for me. <br />
The giant harness is returned to you when you do the turn in for the control harness. All you need to do this repeatedly is the acid the the gem of persuasion. There are no faction hits on this either. Very little exp. My 1st level warrior has not even gained a level after completing this quset twice. Just FYI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Korman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm hoping you can clear up a couple of questions that I have about this quest.  I already have the bottle of Karsin Acid.  Is the Blood Wolf Harness the only other item that I need?<br />
<br />
I'd prefer not to slaughter Coldain wolves to get the harness if I don't have to.<br />
<br />
1st step is to use the Acid to get the Gem of Persuasion from the dwarf Edarf Restil in Thurg, right?<br />
<br />
2nd step is to get the giant version of the gem.  Who is the NPC that does this?<br />
<br />
3rd step is to turn in the Blood Wolf Harness to get the giant version of the harness, right? Who?  the Giant Wolf Tamer?<br />
<br />
4th step is turn the giant version of the gem and the giant version of the harness in to (Giant Wolf Tamer?)  get the Control Harness?<br />
<br />
5th step is give the control harness to the Broodmother?<br />
<br />
6th step is to follow the broodmother to Korf the Dwarf?<br />
<br />
Do I have the sequence right?  I would aapreciate any helpful tips, or corrections!<br />
<br />
I know Juventus and Widda both posted walk-throughs, but I'd appreciate some clarification</div></div><hr />

thier u go some good write ups on the quest from 2 sources<br />
<br />
o yea but u being only lv44 might wanna bring some backup w/o e-bolt and plague kinda hard to solo korf</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">the trickiest part is making sure the dwarves respawn twice after triggering the final stage.  Not just once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Twice?<br />
<br />
No need.  I just did it last night using the necro guide and comments posted here.  Took about two hours (had two accounts to use though, one a druid).  Having a druid for sow, invis, and a hp buff on your rz toon makes things much easier.<br />
<br />
This quest is seriously easy.  Bind in thurg the first time you port into gd and you are ready to go.  I actually only had one dorf spawn.  There were no dorfs outside the mines when I triggered the broodmother, camped and logged alt.  The light blue at 60 dorf then spawned and about 4 minutes later the broodmother arrived, the blue to 60 dorf spawned, broodmother was parked and he took off running.  Rooted him, slowed, sick pet, dot, etc etc.  Hes a little easier than the exposition guards in the mines so he is probably 47 or 48 ish.<br />
<br />
I wouldnt suggest pulling your own orcs in cc though, theres not too many near the zone.  I just followed some 40ish people around (traded buffs and a finishing jbb blast for loot rights).  Apparently the acid drops fairly frequently, only took about 10 minutes of them killing for one to drop.<br />
<br />
As for the greatness of affliction effeciency, it is truly great.  Throw both a poxx and bane on a mob and its a TON more damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Korman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">hmm......the dwarf that drops the wristguard is blue to a lvl 60?

Thanks for the offer.  Unfortunately, I'm on Drinal, so I'm gonna have to find my own help!  :D <br />
<br />
I'll do my best to try it out this weekend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kytra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Korf was light blue to me at 60 when I did the quest. Not sure if his level varies, but it can't vary too much. He was a simple kill at 60, so I would think doable at 49+.<br />
<br />
Also, make sure Korf runs away before you kill him. Don't just wait for Broodmother to show up. I know a few people that got overly eager and got no bracer. You only need to let him get a few feet. Just make sure he starts to run first.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">From all the posts, I have determined that the final step, the fight with Korf is the one spot that has potential to get things really wrong.   Here is my tip of the day to ensure success at that stage.<br />
<br />
<br />
1.)  Set up.  Face the Coldain Mining Cave.  Turn right 45 degrees. You see a hill, set up (dogdog, etc) on top of that hill.  <br />
<br />
2.) Korf.  Korf will spawn right outside the Cave at the bottom of the hill.   Target him (don't attack).<br />
<br />
3.)  Broodmother.  The Shardwurm Broodmother will come from the left of the cave (when facing it).  Do not attack her.  You should still have Korf targeted when she comes wandering.<br />
<br />
4.) Korf, the second coming.  A lot of people do not know when to start fighting Korf.  This is actually very easy.  Target Korf before the BM arrives, you will know when the right Korf is up as soon as you lose your target.  Retarget and root the bum.  Another advantage of your set up spot is that Korf is actually running towards you, no need to chase.<br />
<br />
<br />
I hope this helps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kervin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Awesome, thanks for the set-up info. If you have any tips for the set-up of the last fight of the leggings let us know.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Ehrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I gotta ask a dumb question.<br />
<br />
I wanna kill the Blue to 60 Korf, or thr LightBlue to 60 Korf?  That's the only part of this I don't know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>reaper23</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">the light blue 1 to 60 when u do the hand in the wurm will start heading to the caves @ that time korf will pop but that is NOT the korf u want to kill wait for the wurm to moap her way to cave around 5 mins i guess and korf will despawn (unpop,disapear) and a weaker korf will spawn in the same place than after about 30 seconds or so korf will start running that is the little bugger u have to kill for the bracer</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Korf respawns twice before you can get what you need.  Watch him in target and you'll see what I mean.<br />
<br />
Yes, it's an easy quest Jaidin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Yathandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Is there a way to get this bracer besides killing a dwarf?  Currently, my giant faction couldn't get any worse, so can I kill the giant for the parts I need?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Just completed this quest for a friend. It really is as easy as people say. Korf was light blue to me at 56, and went down easy, epic, bane of nife, other shaman's pet and an ebolt.<br />

Don't try and attack the broodmother afterwards though - the quest version is invulnerable! (well not quite but very nasty!).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>reaper23</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Yathandra u have to kill the dorf hes the 1 that drops the bracer i dont think the faction hit was that bad</div></div><hr />

I have access to a twink with giant faction but not dworf faction.<br />
<br />
Is the gem from the dwarves No Drop?<br />

Thanks.<br />

And will KoS dwarves mess up the final turn in?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>molgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">yathandra: it seems that the only dorf you have to kill for this quest is Korf at the end, should be a small faction hit. if you don't want to slaughter coldain tracking wolves (i don't!) then (according to allakhazam quest info -- can anybody verify that this is correct?) you can get the Giant version of the wolf collar right off the bat by simply killing drakkel dire wolves until you get a drakkel blood wolf; this will save you some Dorf faction and one trip to the giants with your level 1 ogre.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I used to be on Inno, so please wave to any oldtimer from me =)<br />
(Used to be in Order of the Black Staff, and Silent Justice).<br />
<br />
In regards to faction twinky.  The trick is to have a toon that is non KOS to BOTH, Dorfs AND Giants.  So if your Giant friendly character is KOS to Dorfs, it won't work.  My suggestion, make a nice little Troll Warrior (RZ worshipping), and PL him to 8 or 9 (not higher).  You should be able to do that without difficulties in a very short time (get a druid buddy and go to town in Guk).<br />
<br />
This is the only way to do it (without SERIOUS faction work)<br />

Thanks for the heads up....made a troll RZ mule and dropped some HP rings/earring/regen/weapon and ran him up to 5.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I tried this tonight with a bloodwolf harness I bought in the bazaar.  I have a lvl 25 Rallos Zek dark elf warrior.  I went under the bridge outside of Tormax's castle, and found a Kromriff Wolf Master, but no wolf tamer.  I tried to give him the gem of persuasion, he did not accept it. <br />
<br />
The only other npc under the bridge was a named Kromriff trooper.<br />
<br />
So is the Wolf Master the wrong npc?<br />
<br />
Edit:  Logged back in and the Wolf Master and trooper had poofed and in their place were the kromriff guy that drops the uber bow and the wolf tamer.  No one was there clearing them, very strange.<br />
<br />
A couple of bits of additional information:<br />
<br />
1.  When you give the giant gem and blood wolf harness to the wolf tamer, he gives you giant harness and blood wolf harness back.<br />
<br />
2.  Don't run quest if Korf is not up in the Coldain mining caves.  Broodmother poofs if this happens.</div></div><hr />

When Korf spawns outside the cave, he was blue to me (lvl 45), but when the Broodmother showed up, and respawned Korf, he conned even to me.  So the quest Korf that has the Coldain Military Wristguard is lvl 45.<br />
<br />
you take factions hits with Coldain and Dain Frostreaver.<br />
you gain faction with Kromriff and Kromzek.<br />

The Coldain hit didn't take me below indifferent, so it couldn't be that big of a hit.<br />

I tried useing the blood wolf harness last night and it was kinda funy. He gave me the harness of control for the brood motherbut also handed the harnessback to me. As far as i can tell all you need to hand him is the giant gem of persuation.<br />
<br />
As far as his difficulty i wold estamate around 7-8k hps on him. Used 2 ebolts 1 bane and a spear dot on him to kill him. All the ebolts and the bane where extended to do more dmg. Easy solo at 60. i'd say probably doable at 49 or low 50's solo if you where prepared for a fight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I used neither. I got the bottle of acid. Went to thurgadin and turned that in by it's self. Went to kael turning just the dorf gem by it's self. Then turned the giant gem and the blood wolf harness in but got the blood wolf harness back and got the right harness of control. As far as i can tell you don't need either to do this quest other than that turning in the war wolf choaker would lead to the text that got him asking for the gem.<br />
<br />
I'm probably gonna do this again for my druid and i will confirm my beliefs then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Did this quest twice today successfully, once for me once for buddy. Blood wolf harness and/or war wolf choker are not needed.<br />
<br />
Troll mule of Rallos Zek looted a bottle of karsin acid from an orc at the top of Crystal Caverns. Returned to Thurgadin and turned the bottle in to Erdarf Restil in the bar toward the cleric guild at the west end of town at (-370, 455) and received Gem of Persuasion.<br />
<br />
Troll went to Kael and found a frost giant wolf tamer at (-1100, 1720), under the bridge toward King Tormax. Don't cross over the bridge or you'll run into KoS giants. Did not need to turn in any blood wolf harness, in fact the wolf tamer has no use for one. Turn in Gem of Persuasion, receive Giants Gem of Persuasion. Immediately turn in the Giants Gem and receive Giants Harness of Control.<br />
<br />
Great Divide, found shardwurm broodmother in the back of the northernmost cave at (-3300, -1200). Had to stay clear of see-invis shardwurms on the way. Turned in harness, broodmother starts walking to the dwarf mine in the southeast part of Great Divide.<br />
<br />
Korf Brokenhammer spawns just outside mine entrance at (-6200, -3200), along with his friend Relik. In a few minutes, broodmother ambles up and attacks Relik. Korf respawns and starts running south.<br />
<br />
Killed Korf and looted wristguard, woot. Shardwurm broodmother walks back to her spawn point after the quest is over.<br />

Weird thing is -- soon after doing the quest for the second time, I caught broodmother walking to Korf again. Someone must have triggered the script, but never showed up to claim Korf. So I killed Korf again. Damn wristguard rotted since no one could get there in time to loot it (8 minute decay). Never figured that one out.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Tulson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">I completed the Bracer quest and Kromiff Leggins quest this weekend.  I completed both in about 3 hours of time.  <br />
<br />
A couple of notes:<br />
<br />
1)  Do both these quests at the same time.  Both quests utilize the Erhad (sp) in the bar at Thurg.  You need Broodmother for both.  <br />
<br />
2)  After I did the Bracer quest, I simply ran back and waited for BroodMom to return, then did the Leggings.<br />
<br />
3)  Erhad would not give me the quest because faction was only amiable.  I turned in the stuff and he give me the gem anyway.<br />
<br />
4)  Both Korf and Fergul run fast.  Have them targetted.<br />
<br />
5)  Soloed both at 57 with ease.<br />
<br />
6)  Made pet at cave for Korf, then just summoned him to me for Fergul.<br />
<br />
Note:  Why does the bracer go off when I cast root?  Interesting.<br />
<br />
Great quest.  Nice upgrade to the equipment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">I did the quest again for friends, and yesterday the Broodmother forgot to return to her spawn point, she just stayed at the dwarf cave after her battle. Her behavior is not reliable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">I did this today, wow, you guys are right, this is fast!<br />
<br />
I did the rz ogre mule, things worked perfectly. With a level 1 mule, I didn't give a damn when she died, which made things easier. Broodmommy turned up on cue, Korf respawned, happy happy joy joy, I get a new bracer :)<br />
<br />
This replaces my chipped bone bracer, which is a nice upgrade. I have and use Pox and Bane, so this only adds to my damage :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Broodmother stayed outside the mines when I did it too. But she didn't aggro anyone (except Relik) and Korf dropped the bracer so I was happy enough. Went back a few days later and she'd moved (or been killed)<br />
<br />
That was on AB . Hoping to repeat it for a friend this week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Smellious Oderous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">is this broken??<br />
<br />
On the Nameless, I did all parts to the broodmother, found Korf deep inside cave, not outside. Gave harness to broodmother anyway, she was under control and headed out. I had main at coldain cave ent, broodmother never showed up??? Korf never moved from inside cave. Did I do something wrong? I read all posts and did all in order....<br />
<br />
I can start over, np I have the blood wolf harness, just a pain to do.. Didn't petiton, had to go to work, not enough time...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Rafeeky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">This quest is very buggy.  Just try again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">I had Korf pop outside within 10 seconds of Mule turning in the control harness.<br />
<br />
I was parked on the hill outside, so I didn't check for Korf inside the caves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Smellious Oderous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Running on two computers, my mule on slow one, main on good one. I checked for him in the cave, had him targeted and stood on the hill, waiting for him to spawn. After my mule turned in the harness, the broodmother started walking out, I camped the mule. Korf never spawned outside the cave, and I never lost targeting on him. I waited about 20 mins, no broodmother. Korf is supposed to spawn right after turn-in? I will try again, maybe have a friend follow the broodmother and see where she goes..</div></div><hr />

Where were you watching at? I assumed it was the sw corner near velks when I first did it since that was the only dorf cave I knew of but after doing it I realized that it's actually in the se corner. Best thing to do is just follow the brood mother. It's also possible someone attacked and killer her thinking it was a named with phat lewtz.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Smellious Oderous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">I was in the SE corner. I didn't even think about anyone attacking her...I will shout out next time to hope no one does that. I have a very good ranger friend, I'll have her follow the broodmother and spam shout the zone for others not to kill her.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Jagara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">the first time i did it, the broodmother showed up but korf spawned in the wrong place and never ran away.  GM replaced my harness and it worked the second time.  This quest has known issues, but the bracer is soooo worth it.  I'd recommend doing the quest on a non peak time.<br />

Went to get the bottle of acid on Sun. after killing about 25-30 orcs at the ent of CC, finally got one to drop the acid. Looted with my mule, then death ported back to Thurg. Turned in the acid, got the gem. Got a sow and lev from my main, ran to Kael, found the wolf tamer, handed in the gem, got the giant gem, handed in the harness and gem, got control harness and blood wolf harness back. Death ported back to Thurg, camped for day outside shardwurm cave.<br />
<br />
Today grouped with my cleric friend. Invised the mule, snuck into shardwurm broodmother's cave, sat behind her. Had dog and cleric sit on hill where korf run past. Went back to cave to make sure broodmother wasn't molested on her way to Korf. Shouted to zone asking folks not to kill her. A Guild necro showed-up and joined us. Handed in the harness with the mule, broodmother heads out. My cleric buddy tells me Korf has spawned, necro and I follow the broodmother, all the way to the cave. She aggroes on Korf's buddy, and he runs like the little yellow dog he is. My cleric pal, roots him, I epic dot him, along with ebolt and plague. Send doggie at him, the necro sends in her pet, and blasts him also. A slight case of overkill on our part, but I didn't want him to get away. We kill him, I loot and YES, he has the Bracer.. I am a happy Shaman...<br />
<br />
Sorry about the long post, but I'm happy to get this, especially after it didn't work last Friday...<br />
<br />
BTW, my cleric pal decides we should try to kill the broodmother. I tell him, nope, I read that she turns into a difficult mob to kill, and that I have only 5 mana. Bah!!  He ignores me (he's Epic) doesn't worry about losing much xp, (more balls than brains) he attacks. The necro and I send in our pets, I go melee, she's resisting every spell, the 2 pets are less than half, I say we need to run. We do, the pets let us make our escape, so we get away.  No more ballsy cleric jumping to attack, since he's a RL friend, I gave him more hell about that, and told him I was going to post about him, LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Kaneras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">I just tried it last night.  Handed in the control harness, Broodmother walked over to the cave and just stood there, didn't attack either Korf or Relic and they just depopped at 5 minutes then Broodmother walked back to cave.  What a thrill, now I get to to spend 2 hours getting the harness again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>xDeMeNtiAx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">how hard is korf? soloable at what level? or group? looking for some statistics if possible, cuz i'd like to do this</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">I followed Nytmare's excellent post a few weeks back, and got the CMW for myself and my Chanter friend.<br />
<br />
I think Korf is level 45 He was dark blue to me at 57, but one bane and dogdog took him down to about 5% before I finished him off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Smellious Oderous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">Korf was blue to me at 51, my cleric pal is 54, and necro is 48. We handled him without too much of a problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">After Korf re-pops and starts running he is light blue to me at 55. I've done the quest 3 times so far, for myself and some friends, and never had any problems whatsoever. He's an easy kill at 55, I'd imagine 49 is probably about the right level for a shaman to attempt this solo, as you get EBolt and the new pet then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">I think I overkilled him. Pox, BoN, epic, dog, rooted. Didn't dare break root. He fell over fast.<br />
<br />
I think it would be a longer battle at 49, and with the worry of him running away, it might be tricky. 51 with the epic, yes, definately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">Once you agro him, his &quot;run away&quot; script ends (except of course for a mob's standard limping death march at low health.) So it's not necessary to perma-root him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Nasiir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">This was really easy at 49th. I had pet up and buffed (sow, speed, and hos). Rooted Korf when he ran, plagued, and ebolted (root broke) the pet kited him until ebolt faded, at which point I rooted, and ebolted once more. Cast the 44th ice dd on him twice and he went down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>xDeMeNtiAx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">did the entire quest in about 2 hours.....solo'd the dwarf that drops the bracer at lev49 with ease, he was blue con. Just malo'd(for safety), root, slow, send in pet, then i just ebolt'd and poison nuked till dead!</div></div><hr />
