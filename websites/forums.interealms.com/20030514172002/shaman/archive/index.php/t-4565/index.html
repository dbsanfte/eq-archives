<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>dirtybax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey Yo:<br />
<br />
I am not sure how many people have had a chance to visit Jaggedpine Forest, but it's a decent place to XP.  Now I was 58 when the zone opened so I didn't get to fully experience the hunting in this zone, but the experience is still pretty decent at 58 even with all the LBs.  <br />
<br />
I hunt the Darkpaw gnolls in the cave north of the little town where the zone to Surefall is.  <br />
<br />
The setup I use is as follows:<br />
1. Summon pet in town<br />
2.  Buff self and pet in town (I get: sta, kragg, agility, and regen; dog gets: haste, kragg)<br />
3. Mem summon companion<br />
4. Run into the Gnoll caves until I see a spawn that's blocking my path.<br />
5.  Summon Bitey and finish off the gnoll<br />
6. set Bitey to guard here and move on<br />
<br />
The place I eventually setup at is the mouth to the cave where Barducks Darkpaw spawns.  It can be reached by heading into the first room and turning left, then following these directions from each room: Straight (or left), Right, then left.   <br />
<br />
This will bring you to a large cavern with lots of gnolls in it.  At 58 only some of the warriors are still blue to me.  There are also Oracles, Curates (who CH), and Revenants.  These guys hit fast for around 100ish, but have very little hitpoints.  Once slowed they are pretty much trivial.   The respawn time is fast so you will have plenty of mobs to pick from.  There are two wanderers that path into the tunnel, but I was able to handle up to 4 at a time so I didn't worry about a couple adds.  <br />
<br />
Each Gnoll will drop ~5plat and change.  They also drop semi precious gems (peridots and stuff).  They also drop some low to midrange loot.  All of the weapons they drop have a visible graphic when the mob has an item so it's easy to know when you have found something.  <br />
<br />
I was able to get 1.5 blues per hour here at 58.  I think that rate should be higher at 56 or 55.  This is about the same experience I get in Katta doing guards.  For any Barbarians that have the Spiritstone of EF - this zone is really conveniently located.  Just run through Black Burrow and zone into JP.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Another location you might want to try, guaranteed to have no wanderers, is accessed by keeping to the right in the caves until you fall through a pit. Runners path into the wall, so even if you don't have snare you're safe here, and nothing wanders down here. MOBs are all the same level and variety as the ones in the big room (where Barducks spawns). Another spot that's good is at the bottom of the slope where Barducks spawns, provided he's been killed recently (respawn time seems to be about 24 hours). No wanderers here either and lots of room to operate.<br />
<br />
Also, at Level 57, all Warriors are blue, which helps with experience. Things slow down a bit at 58, as you said. At 59, my guess is it will be time to move on.<br />
<br />
It's also fun to group here: just keep moving and choose a different, loopy path each night, and it will take a while to get boring. If you want to kill Barducks the best bet is to take him outside, as he hits really hard for his level, and the MOBs around him will repop fairly quickly. But he doesn't summon and isn't particularly resistant.<br />
<br />
Also, if you're evil it doesn't take long to max faction with the pinky town in Jaggedpine, giving you a bank/merchants within the same zone. And before that there is another cave with gnolls who start out apprehensive to everyone, and they have a bank and merchants as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Heelah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i stared here at 52 and xp is through the roof...even with a full group i was getting visible blue per kill. an excellent spot imho. our cleric got 59 here.<br />
and if you do kill barducks be sure to fight the war, its damn fun!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ThrugaiSL</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just wondering, seeing as i am KOS in Surefall, will this make thing difficult in Japperpine??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Heelah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">after a few nights of killing gnolls &amp; turning in teeth they will love ya in surefall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Carrieanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">A friends war is KoS in surefall- just invis and run through.<br />
<br />
Once you get to the click portal and enter jaggedpine, the people are on ranger faction - that faction will go up, along with SF faction with killing the gnolls :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>ThrugaiSL</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Nice might have to try it out</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>em2johns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The secret to my success...enough said.  Go try this zone out... Oh yeah, with the new patch and nerfed exp for lower end mobs the 56-58 gravy train may dry up... Before patch YES, after patch dunno try it out.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Heigelyac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Group xp wasn't great here as a shammy necro duo, but all the necro was doing was sending pet.  solo I was getting about 1 blue-1.5 blue per hour.  This was in a huge cave where the gnolls were so far apart you had no trouble pulling singles with no wanderers at all...  I'm 55, gonna live here for a while, bought the everfrost spiritstone, bound in bazaar to get KEID.   I am not KoS in surefall, but I also don't go thru surefall to get to JP.  It's super easy to get there thru blackburrow and you don't have to zone a bunch of times.  Good tip for you barb shammys with your Spiritstones.<br />
Kill your way in, don't just run in willy nilly.  Lot's of See invis stuff.  Kill your way out, or gate if you are too darn tired.   The cave I was in, I could have camped there last night and logged on safe in the knowledge that I would catch no aggro.  Is nice<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I tried this place yesterday at 55. I found the little pit as the guy described, thanks, it is all you said it was - no wanderers, only one close pop, and the runners path right into that wall. That's the good bits.<br />
<br />
The bad bits is I found the xp slow here compared to HHK. At HHK I got a blue every 25 mins. Here, it was 40 mins to a blue. Not horrible, but not great. (that's 1 1/2 blues an hour). The warriors are easy, but there's some really funky pathing problems in the cave. For instance, sometimes I had to let warriors wack on me as I ran because if I outran them to the pull spot (where dog is waiting), they'd get confused and path back to their spawn point and loose aggro. Grr. The hill into the cave where the pit is is particularly bad for pathing and loosing mobs.<br />
<br />
Then there's the defilers. Annoying little critters. They are necros. They cast blood boil, plague, and venom of the snake, and yes, they like to cast all 3 while you're pathing them down the buggy path to dogdog. (If you run away, they still manage to land spells on you even though you are OOR, and then they do that go back to spawn point and loose aggro trick). Seeing your hp drop way down even with an iskar bp and regrowth, really is a bit unnerving.<br />
<br />
The oracles are another pain, they do cast venom, but not blood boil. Getting enstill stuck on you also is a big pain. <br />
<br />
The warriors are pushovers.<br />
<br />
But any spot can spawn one of the three. At 55, some where lb, some were db, I think it was a 50% mix.  Warriors are more common than oracles or defilers. They are all social, but with a low range, you have to be pretty close to get an add.<br />
<br />
So I went back to HHK and ground through the most boring level ever there, got 56. I am definatley going to find another place now, HHK is driving me crazy :). But I don't think Jaggedpine is &quot;uber&quot; xp, if half the mobs were turning blue at 55, I guess 75% must be blue at 56, and the xp wasn't that stellar to begin with. For starters, no &quot;dungeon&quot; bonus while in the caves.<br />
<br />
Loot was ok, I made about 150 plat, plus I got a gnoll ring with +5 int and +5 to two saves, fodder for my bazaar mule. <br />
<br />
But if you're looking for pure bang for your buck, do HHK. This place was a bit more of a hassle than it was worth.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>ZernSaintwinter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">This Place sounds intresting. My 55 wizzy wife and I (56 sham) have gotten chased out of SF now that Ragefire is triggered.(use to be 7 peeps in SF, now there is 70+) I have been looking for new quiet place to hunt. Can anyone tell me where i can get a Map of Jaggedpine? also how is the lag in that zone?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Dross</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Have any of our evil kin tried the Brell gnolls as an exp source?   I'm a barbarian, so I'll have to opt out, but just curious if it's any good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Largus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I don' tcon them too much anymore but  I always got a DB con on the gnolls in the drop-off area at 56. Defilers are easy when you get BoN at 56. Just hit with BoN and E-bolt (you can sub in epic but I don't have yet) and run back to med spot. Hopefully they will path back to their spawn point and about 30-45 seconds later, you get the exp message. Go loot body and fins next victim.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Finally ground through 56 and am now 57.<br />
<br />
I did a combo of here and HHK.<br />
<br />
The bad news: both are now heavily camped. Even the drop-off point is frequently camped by a necro. Grr. HHK is often monopolized by monks, other shaman, or yes, necros. Now that I'm 57, I am going to try to avoid having to go back there, I am sick of it, and waiting in line is boring. (Also defending your camp against all the people who want it tends to piss me off)<br />
<br />
The good news: 90% of the stuff is db at 56 in Jaggedpine. The teeth do raise your animal and guard faction, so I'm now threatening to the animals of jaggedpine instead of scowling. (This is after 20 teeth). I will try more as soon as more teeth are available. <br />
<br />
The other bad news: a CR at Jaggedpine at the dropoff point is a &lt;insert expletitive here&gt;. I was happily tanking a warrior when a curate (a cleric) popped behind me, ch'ealed the warrior, and then nuked my pet out of existance. Ok, so I was a bit sloppy, but ouch. I went down real fast, wasn't prepared for him at all.<br />
<br />
Then I got a 60 rogue and a 58 cleric to help me get my body and a rez back. Since the oracles and the mystics see through invis, I thought this was best than running in there blind... mistake, though, was not giving the rogue (who had never been in there) a map and letting her pull my body out. So when I got my rez at my body, we had to fight our way out (rogue couldn't gate), and along the way we got jumped by 6 gnolls.<br />
<br />
Ouch.<br />
<br />
2 deaths, mine and the rogues.<br />
<br />
So here's a word of caution - have a rogue, or someone who has camo or is indiff to the gnolls, pull your body out. Do not try to fight your way out! It's just not worth the risk.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>kiludan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">My 2 coppers:<br />
<br />
<br />
i spent some time in this spot.<br />
really nice xp indeed.<br />
<br />
Most often, i come here after a guild raid, so totally buffed.<br />
Or i come directly from nexus, right after a chanter friend KEIed me.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Many times, i had to fight curates in these spots, and very often (9O% i would say), they debuff me.<br />
and KEI always was the first buff to be cancelled, whatever spot it used.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, now i try to never tank them:<br />
- I root (instead of slow pulling for a warrior, shaman or SK)<br />
- doggy attack<br />
- slow<br />
- dot<br />
- jbb<br />
- refresh root each time it breaks.<br />
this way, i'm sure kei won't be cancelled.<br />
<br />
<br />
One last thing:<br />
Have a cancel magic loaded for gnolls shamans.<br />
They are sowed, and you can avoid many adds by canceling them right after pulling them.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Largus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Don't know about others but I have had no problem with the ones that can see through invis. I run past them when going to the drop off and they have never followed me. I am kos to them so that is not an issue. Maybe I run before a tick and they don't &quot;see&quot; me. I have made the run about 6-7 times and no defilers ever cast/hit me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Heelah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">run way out to the sides of the tunnels when passing a see invis mob, that should keep aggro down, since they always stand right in the middle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Here's another problem with this spot.<br />
<br />
If you use a horse, like I do, sometimes your horse &quot;Falls&quot; through the floor, and you're halfway out the world. You can be hit by mobs in hte world, but if you look down, you get a wierd smeary effect. You can also see the bottoms of all the tunnels.<br />
<br />
I have had this happen twice, but each time, running foward and jumping got me back in the world. But its' freaky.<br />
<br />
I've never had a curate cancel my magic, but then, I bane of nife them and then jbb them with dog hasted on them... or I pull out my howling harpoon and try to stun them so they can't cheal.<br />
<br />
I wish I had notification when dogdog is dotted or slowed, sometimes I only find out about it after it's worn off.<br />
<br />
Oracles are shaman, right? They cast plague and VoS and malaise.<br />
<br />
Mystics are.... ?<br />
<br />
Defilers are Necros, I believe, they blood boil, lifetap, and plague and vos.<br />
<br />
Curates are clerics, and can cheal twice.<br />
<br />
So who are the mystics?<br />
<br />
I think this spot is growing on me a little, I have turned in 25 teeth and I'm now threatening to the animals, kindly to the merchants, and if I get to dubious to the animals, I can wander around and explore without fear... that's nice, because most people can't.<br />
<br />
It is starting to get heavily camped.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to cancel Maliase? I get that stuck on me and it lasts what seems like forever, because it makes me vulnerable to any other casters I pull.<br />
<br />
I never get any armour, just gems, rings, poorly balanced weapon, bear fanged glove, long fanged glaive, pine spear, sacks of rock, gnoll teeth, research components including essence of rathe and scent of marr, gnoll forged axe(nodrop, no idea what it is used for, lousy stats), and occasionally a gnollish ring of sorcery.<br />
<br />
Only the last is worth anything at the Bazaar.<br />
<br />
But it's the xp I am after, 23 more blues to go to 58 and that UBER charisma buff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Well, I camped here all weekend and dinged 58. Yay.<br />
<br />
And I learned a few new things about this area.<br />
<br />
I did finally, get 3 pieces of sabertooth forged armour, and they all sold for &gt;70 plat a piece. Ok stats, but I could forge better, this stuff is really vendor fodder.<br />
<br />
I turned in 100 teeth. I am now ally (but not max) with the residents of Jaggedpine, kindly with the druids, and who knows what with the guards of Queynos. I am still threatening to the animals. No fair! I don't think there's any way to raise that faction at all.<br />
<br />
Twice, someone killed Duckpaw, the head gnoll. This doesn't affect fighting in the caves, but it takes 2 hours for the merchants (and more importantly, the bank) to respawn, so it can be a real pain. I like to turn in my gnoll teeth after I grind, to get rid of them from my inventory (hey, it's free faction), and it can be a pain when the guy isn't up.<br />
<br />
After grinding about 9 hours, I made about 2k in loot. Not bad, did better in HHK, but I think this is better than the mindless grind of HHK, and probably about the same blues per hour rate. I was getting a blue every 40 mins, or 1.5 blues per hour, same as the guy who was doing 58 here. So if I continue to get 1.5 blues per hour here at 58 (I left shortly after dinging 58), then there is no change in the output...<br />
<br />
I was actually wiping out almost all the mobs up to the right hand turn in the tunnel, before they would respawn. This is without epic, without kei. So I don't think it's possible to increase the rate here beyond 1.5 blues per hour, which isn't bad at this level, especially since this level has now been made longer due to the hell level restructuring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Tried the drop-off yesterday for a while.  With my equipment and no outside buff I could kill the first 4, maybe 5 spawns (depending on how the fight went) before the first one would respawn.  Didn't track time to get a blue but I got a blue and a half, then a ranger friend joined me and we got another blue.  Good idea about BoN / Epic and letting the casters lose agro from pathing, I'll have to try that.  At least the casters have significantly fewer HPs than the warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Largus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Harvyst- you can check what is on your pet by hitting /pet report health. It will tell you the HPs, buffs, debuffs/dots that are on the pet. <br />
<br />
To add, I think I like hunting outside the cave better. There is a spot on the ridge that was great for me the other night. If you leave the cave and follow the wall to the right, you will come to a boulder that is against the wall. Stop here and summon pet. There will be a gnoll right in front of you but at lvl 57, he did not agro on me or my pet. Buff up and slow him. let him run to you and dog will start chewing. You have to root him when low but I think this inconvenience is worth it. After he is dead, there are about 4-5 others you can pull without moving. Just target them and cast turgur. In the cave, I get tired of trying to coax the dumb gnolls into the cave. It usualla takes me 3-4 tries to get him to come in all the way. I think in the time I save from not having to do that, I can kill one gnoll and well on my way to killing another. In the cave with non-stop pulls I would get about 5 percent of the exp I need to level in an hour, the other night I got 5 percent in 40 minutes. I do have a JBB and a horse but no epic. Give it a try, yes the rooting is annoying but I think it is better then getting the dumb gnolls into the cave.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I have been doing the drop-off in the gnoll cave for a while now, here my observations:<br />
During one spawn cycle I usually do 6 gnolls, there is one in the tunnel, one at the tunnel entrance and then I work the slope.  Your learn quickly which mobs have pathing problems and which do not, the 2nd dog on the right wall is notorious for warping back, so I try to pull from the left side.<br />
Thurgurs for pull, and then just staight jbb while the dog chews. With horse and regrowth on I never run lower then 60 mana and health.  Experience at 57 is above a blue an hour, with no risk.  Loot is decent, just make sure you have space for all the weapons, they sell for 5 pp on average, and unlike FS even the dagger is worth keeping. Just toss the bags of rocks, they bring 5 cp.  It is also nice to bring a mortar and pestle and a stack of celestial solvent for all the components for celestial essence that drop (no fail combine, and you quickly fill your bags with words etc otherwise).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Seconds</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Yeah I just started doing the gnolls after the drop off at 51.  The exp was good, although at 51 without regrowth, I killed about 4 per cycle.  No epic, Jbb tho.  At 52 I go through them better and pending on if I debuff or DoT I can do 5 keeping my hp/mana around at 80/40.  Good exp, and you get the peace and quiet where most other spots lack.<br />
