<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Good Friend of mine won one of these the other night.  Here are the stats:<br />
Di'zok Oracle Shillelagh <br />
LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM  <br />
Damage: 16<br />
Delay: 30 <br />
Ratio: 1.875 Amazing <br />
Wis: +5 Mana: +20  <br />
Weight: 3.0 <br />
Weapon Skill: One Hand Blunt <br />
Classes: Shaman  <br />

<br />
Now...the problem:  I'm currently using a Centi Warhammer for my 1hb (15/32 +5 Str, +5 Sta, +2Wis) and thought this would be a nice upgrade.  However, the level to equip is lvl 51, I am currently 46.<br />
<br />
So...should I go ahead and buy this thing (at a great price) and throw it in the bank, or are there better weapons out there for a lvl 51 Shaman?  On first look, the proc would be awesome, but after a bit of reflection I don't know if it's so useful...I wouldn't want to wait on a slow to proc unless I was soloing light blues or a weak blue mob. <br />
<br />
Any comments?  Is this a great weapon, a piece of junk, etc??<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
PS - please don't recommend that I buy the thing and then turn around and sell it :)  That's tacky.:p</div></div><hr />

<br />
When your 51 you will have a better slow anyways...<br />
<br />
i know this slow is mana free, but its also a proc.  i personally always pull w/ slow, as it helps to get to camp and be able to stick a dot or two through w/ ease.<br />
<br />
you could always pull w/ a disease dot and wait for a proc, but its easier to jus pull w/ slow i think =-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's a fun weapon with a quite astonishing ratio, if you enjoy meleeing then grab it, I pull mine out to melee with now and again and end up giggling. The proc is incidental.<br />
<br />
If I was looking for a pre epic weapon for the stats I'd go for something with some HP and mana on it. Dark embers are highly underrated :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The proc on this is pretty useless from what I have seen, unless you are goofing around or killing shrooms in FG.  There are much better options out there and the Centi is not too bad a choice.</div></div><hr />
