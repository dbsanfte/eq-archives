<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Lets see, 16 straight hours camping the skelly guy alone in karnor. Months of actual learning and tracking and hunting and camping key parts. Only to see everyone on my server in a semi strong guild, farm up the parts in one night and finish the night off with a dragon raid that only 48 people can be keyed in.<br />
<br />
I know its just bitching, but i cant help but feel gipped. I think for all the hard work i should either be allowed in VP to being with or atleast get something for my hard work in return. Atleast in PoP you get AA for your progression, all i get is a burning sensation as i camp in SF for the 3rd day in a row and watch the raids blow past me with no room.<br />
<br />
I hate to bitch about it, cause i want everyone enjoying themselves, but i cant help feel just a lil screwed by this. I cant believe they added a raid to the key kinda shows you the direction of EQ eh? 100% group adn raid oreintated. God forbid someone that cant muster 50  people to raid a nasty lil bugger, could join in the fun ... for once...<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok, whine off, i needed to get it off my chest is all :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>BurgBrell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It takes a raid to really do anything in VP anyway, I don't see a problem with making the last step a raid drop. When the original key was in, Trakanon was still required to finish it, and wasnt quite the pushover he is today.  I think it makes perfect sense to end the new key in the same fashion, a preparation for things to come.  Sorry that doesnt fit into your plans of aquiring the key again though, hopefully you can get it finished up soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">How could they farm the parts in one night?  The echo's only drop one part at a time?  Do they respawn really fast or something?<br />
<br />
<br />
Trak was up last night, so a few of us killed him.  Now that I have a tooth, I've been debating just doing it the old way:)  Got a couple pieces last night (FV and Swamp)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Lit: original VP in its day was a top end only zone. There were a number of additional restriction for those who could get in (non-gating zone, if I recall correctly.)<br />
<br />
The effort to get to the new and improved VP is far easier in comparison.<br />
<br />
For my whine on the new VP,itI does freaking stink that folks keyed to VP pre-patch now have to take additional steps to access a zone they had access to. Add that there are a number of them that don't have the resources available (read: guild of capable level) to take the new steps required and the net effect is to shut them out of the zone.<br />
<br />
That sucks - and maybe that is what you are saying. I read it as complaining about the keying process which simply a mild hurdle for guilds working on access there.</div></div><hr />

Thats exactly what im saying. To a player like me, that BTW used to run open raids in VP pre-patch, im now shut out of one of the few zones that actualy excite me to go in. Im not complaining about the keying process, im frustrated that after all my work to get into this zone, im now shut out by the raid put infront of me. <br />
<br />
Im not upset at all that guilds can get in there pretty quick, its as you said, i cant understand why they would put a raid infront of my keying now. Not a lot of people had the old key to begin with, what would it hurt to just reward me for my hard work by letting me use the key :p<br />
<br />
<br />
More so its just venting at losing a fun zone to play in i guess :(</div></div><hr />

Really, I know that some of you took a really long time to get their pieces for the old vp key, but personally I spent prob a total of under 3 hours on it.  I had the tooth in the bank while we were messing around one day near trak.  I got the PS up in 1 hour and the dude in KC on the first spawn (guildee had spent 5 hours there and had to camp when I took his place).  So, I really didn't get to see much of the ass-pain that was this quest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mmm hmm.  Did you count the time it took to do Trak whenever you did get the tooth?  What about the travel time to all the turnin mobs?  What about all the random mobs in all the far off (at the time) kunark zones?  The staff from chardok, did that take you 10 mins to get?  At the time, were there actually people who knew what the heck the staff was for and did you have to roll for it?<br />
<br />
The pieces for your key to seb, did you just loot them from some random xp group in traks teeth shouting to the zone or did you spend several hours, like many did?<br />
<br />
Did you have a chardok ally mage coth you down into chardok to speak with Niblek?  Did you fight there?  Did it take 15 minutes?<br />
<br />
Seems like it probably took a whole lot longer than three hours for your key.<br />
<br />
granted its not an easy target. !<br />
<br />
For those that spent hours and hours getting their original VP keys during *KUNARK*, it wasn't easy either.  Relatively, the raid targets for such quests are probably much easier nowadays.<br />
<br />
The last re-vamp of VP didn't require any new key.  Maybe instead of crappy attempts at reviving old zones (and screwing veteran players) they might put that time into making new zones?</div></div><hr />

Its not the point of waiting, i can wait a long time, as my camping of the VP key shows, but it just seems unfair afer all that work and the VP key was hard when i did it, that im kicked out of the zone.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ill get in, ill just have to do the raid myself i guess.<br />

See ending on a positive note. Thank you for listening and helping me see im bitching a lil too much, though not completly unjustified :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">That is kewl that those of us who put in the effort a long ass time ago to get VP keyed now get a 30 aug for our troubles, and of course easy access to a muchly improved zone.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I agree with Landragoran, it's a good update, but I also agree with Litgruv that people with preexisting VP keys should have been able to get into the zone.  Maybe require the extra raid to get the 30/30/30 augment, sure.<br />
<br />
My wife and I started this quest ages and ages ago but put it on hold to get the VT key stuff instead, and somehow never got back around to it.  We are finishing it up now just for the extras on the augment.  Fun times going back to various spots in Kunark.  We are down to the Kaesora piece, the Chardok piece, the Warslik's piece, and Trak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Walknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I never did my VP key but an considering doing the old key first just to get the 30/30/30 aug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">i know alot of people that never did the original vp key and are doing it now simply to get the better augment. <br />
<br />
Oh, and in response to you Jaidan.  I said that I spent a total of about 3 hours working on the key.  That means that from the point when I started to actually work on it, it took me about that much time.  I already had a bunch of the things done from my various adventures around norrath prior to physically working on it.  Meaning.. I had the tooth from one time when I was helping someone farm the crown in sebilis and Trak popped on us.  I had the stave from a guildee who looted a bunch of them and handed them out.  I had the trak stuff from way back when I first made my sebilis key.  I also killed killed Niblik along time ago while exping in chardok.<br />
<br />
So.. yeah, in actuality it prob took me more than three hours counting how much time I spent doing the various things that got me the pieces that I had in the bank for so long, but physically attempting to work on it in one day that's all it took :)<br />
<br />
I'm just kinda sad right now cause I do not have my new VP key because of the timer on the corpse.  I zoned into the zone with about a minute left (was late to the raid).  I summoned steed then invised.. then had to stop after about 10 steps to reinvis myself (great 2 sec invis there) got agroed by a mob.. said screw it and took off running.  Tried to loot the book when I got there but it told me I couldn't cause my presence was felt in the zone.  I quickly camped out and back in and the book was gone :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">So to sum up.<br />
<br />
People in guild and able to gather forces for the dragon think its great.<br />
<br />
People that are more on the easy going and soloing side hate it.<br />

So whats new right ?<br />

BTW, good point land on the aug, but still, its kinda weak reward IMHO, but its better then nothing and i didnt even think of it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Nothing, this whole post was about putting a dragon raid infront of access to a zone people already had access too. That VP key quest was a tough quest back in the day and still is a long and time consuming one, so i dont think its much to wish that i would be allowed in the zone i was already allowed in before the upgrade.<br />
<br />
But like i said, im over it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Rtugok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Wait til they make VT key a 4 drop camp ;p.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Kriyn Nutzforcatnip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Yes it does stink for the people who had origanal key, but that zone wasn't made for solo'ing in the first place.  You can get better gear from doing advens than you could when going to old VP.  Reason why they put a raid mob for getting piece for new VP key is because the loot and mobs have been re-vamped by a long shot.  The gear that is quested from there is on par or better than a lot of the elemental gear.  You can still single grp the entrance mobs and up to some named ones.  I'm currently raising faction with CoV and RoS so that I can quest for a lot of gear before killing them for it.  I'm sure you'll find a raid to join to get the key eventually, but if you can't even raid/group against the mobs in there now there really isn't a point in going for it.</div></div><hr />

Wow.  Even then, I bet that was pretty lucky on the mob spawns.  <br />
<br />
However, thats impossible now, as I found out. The goblin marauder for instance, who spawns every 8 hours in front of Veksar, is NEVER up anymore since they opened Veksar.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Where is this coming from?  Everuqest has been 100% group oriented for the last 5 years.  The raid focus isn't so old, but its hardly a new focus either.<br />
<br />
You complain that you went through a long and difficult key quest, however you didn't even start your shaman until Luclin was out.  Trakanon used to be the most wanted mob in all of EQ, he was on a 7 day spawn timer (non randomized) and he didn't always drop 4 teeth.  Then if you did manage to get a shot and kill him, it wasn't uncommon for your entire raid to die to his dot, before you could get controll of things.  If you didn't have an epic cleric online, you didn't have much chance of looting before the corpse rotted.  On top of all that, the difficult medallions were much harder to get than they are today, simply because some of the camps couldn't be soloed.<br />
<br />
VP was never intended to be easy to access.  Many people (including yourself) got the key with a walk in the park.  If they are going to revamp the rewards of the zone, they should revamp the way to get access.<br />
<br />
Finally, when it comes down to it, its not exactly a moumental task to kill the new dragon.  If you really did lead pickup raids in the pre patched vp, then you should have no problems leading one for the dragon.<br />
<br />
Don't get depressed that you lost access, instead be happy that all you have to do is kill one easy and quickly respawning mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I am kinda curious though, what would have happened if you camped out in VP the night before the patch?</div></div><hr />

Like most of the game, the harder the problem the bigger the rewards; and some of the quests inside are very nice!<br />
<br />
eg  Assist Nexona quest<br />
<br />
<br />
Shield of Dark Hues <br />
LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM NO DROP  <br />
Weight: 3.0 Size: LARGE <br />
Slot: SECONDARY  <br />
AC: +50 Dex: +10 Sta: +20 Wis: +20 Int: +20 Agi: +15 Fire Resist: +10 Cold Resist: +20 Magic Resist: +8 Poison Resist: +7 HP: +125 Mana: +145  <br />
Classes: Cleric Druid Shaman Wizard Magician Enchanter Necromancer  <br />
Races: All Races <br />
Slot 1: Type 7 <br />
  <br />
 Focus Effect: Druzzil's Distance<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Additional Modifiers:<br />
Mana Regeneration: +3 <br />
<br />
 <br />
Probably an upgrade for most casters, and quest is not horrendously tough, time consuming maybe!<br />
<br />
guilds will simply have to cooperate for a change!!  good way to get to know more players; thers already regular open raids for pop content; not much of a step to push this further........picked up 2 flags this week from such raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I'm actually going to agree with Litgruv on this one =P<br />
<br />
VP ended up being a nice small raid zone and although the mountain of weapons had aged badly for the most part, it still had plenty of nice gear for the more casual raider.<br />
<br />
Making the new key dropper an 8 group event is just comical imho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Trak used to take a good raid force to take out - and quite some time just to fight down to him too. Sure, now he's gimp and people could solo VP, but that's not what the zone was designed for.<br />
<br />
IMO its nice they've brought the zone up to date, back to its intended level, and provided a new raid target.<br />
<br />
The issue of having some more zones suitable for the solo player to challenge themselves is a problem though - perhaps the new instanced, soloable adventures they talk of will provide a solution, who knows? I love LDoN and GoD trials for single-group content but there's not been much new for the solo person (besides Riwwi) for a long time.<br />
<br />
PS Didn't realise Scarab was so well known :) We're still growing strong btw Val - XTC &amp; Cursed down last weekend :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Beyond a couple of very early zergs, Trak was never really an 8 group ordeal, the norm was more around 4 to 6 groups during the kunark era no?<br />
<br />
I don't really care much for soloing anymore and I can think of plenty of places to have fun solo besides VP, I just want something fun to do with between 5 and 12 friends.  Ldon doesnt really fall into the fun department and stuff like Sol ro mini's and midrange SoLuclin stuff only goes so far.  Imho small raid content needs more attention than even solo stuff.</div></div><hr />

Has the shaman specific VP weapon actually been found yet?  I certainly can't see anything on magelo/lucy yet, I wouldn't be at all suprised if it had a completely different effect on it.  Considering the underwhelming dru/clr weapon effects, a Turgurs click with mod rod style recast delay would be my guess.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First time in my life, teir 3+ zone, I was able to fully funtion as the main healer. I finally felt useful again.  3 hours of grinding not one death, no virt/pot9 on melee's.. Just shaman haste and focus and I had the ability to out heal the damage of 3 mobs at once. I need to give those warriors credit they were well geared. <br />
<br />
Mobs hit in the 600 range (double attack) all partically slowable. Some did quad (not many). And get this the mini-named were mostly slowable (Dropped old vp loot) and much easy then the normal mobs.  <br />
<br />
This zone brought back the fun.. I felt like I was in kunark again.. Hmmm.. Come to think of it I was.</div></div><hr />

I just started the old VP quest when I finally landed a Trak's tooth (a spare) helping some friends get theirs recently (we had a group and a half &amp; it was overkill).  I'd always passed on the teeth before (after enduring some agony years ago camping the ancient jarsath I gave up), but decided to finally loot one this time around (our second Trak kill of the week).<br />

It only took me 2 days of serious camping to get everything (aside from the tooth) for the old key, though I did have my spouse helping a bit while I was at work.  Soon after I got my final old key 'camp' piece (the pained soul after 4-5 hours of killing PH's to get him), a pickup Suled'Dar raid happened &amp; I got my blood.  Then I just had to run around to put the medallions together. :D <br />
<br />
SoNH ground spawn was simple.  So was the Kaesora ground spawn. :) <br />
<br />
Ancient Jarsath took awhile, but I had a cleric parked down there that I checked regularly, and I asked guild clerics who weren't busy to pop into FV to cast Sense Dead right at the PoK book in FV which helped a great deal &amp; saved me wasting alot of my time.<br />
<br />
Bloodgill Marauder I waited on for a few hours, and then gave up actively camping him.  An early morning check before work on the second day had him swimming at spawn point waiting for me. :) <br />
<br />
Niblek - Had a non-KoS magician friend CoTH me to him in Chardok. I VP'd the one mob that aggroed and did my turn-in &amp; gated.<br />
<br />
Verik Kylox - A 4 to 5 hour long simple camp for me.  Wasn't too bad, 25 minute spawns meant I could get alot done around the house while afk.  I spent the first hour or so slaughtering everything in the basement just for fun.  Surprisingly some of the mobs were light blue and a few were even dark blue.<br />
<br />
My spouse is an enchanter, so getting Slixin charmed for the stave turn-in was a breeze in Warslik's Woods.  Another player in a guild I was friendly with gave me a spare stave for free a day after I gave her friend the Verix camp when I finished with it. :D <br />
<br />
Rotting Skeleton I was very lucky on and only had to camp for 2-3 hours.<br />
<br />
I started the old key quest AFTER the new Cipher of Veeshan was put into game.  I used Verdandi's guide to the VP key quest from here extensively.  My spouse (who didn't go on the Trak raids, lol) started a day or two before me and is now only missing the tooth to finish both the old/new quest (we both got the brood dragon blood at the same time) for a VP key.<br />
<br />
If the echo mobs are more than you handle on your own, I recommend trying the old keyquest.  My server has been killing Suled'Dar almost daily (several pickup raid kills as well) since the new key came into being.  I'd say within a week or two the books will be rotting &amp; be available for looting ffa if the kill-rate stays the same.  My guild only has 42 members, and if there is a blue moon out we'll have a dozen of them online at once - usually no more than a single group online at any time, but we were able to make rapid progress on this key and availed ourselves of pickup raid opportunities when they came up (It was my 4th try at Suled'Dar I think before we won).<br />
<br />
Oh, and the Cipher of Veeshan gives my Tipt bracer a nice boost as well. :cool: <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />
