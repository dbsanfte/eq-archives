<br />
dunno if that was ever asked or not, didnt found the answer im looking for.<br />
<br />
Does it matter how often dual wield get off/checked if im wielding:<br />
<br />
first hand :dam 10 dly 10 <br />
second hand: dam 40 dly 40<br />
<br />
or <br />
<br />
first hand :dam 10 dly 10 <br />
second hand: dam  20 dly 20<br />
<br />
just for secondary damage issues, first example would be great if dual wield would check if the 2nd weapon is rdy or not, but i guess it isnt like that.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Celt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">When you dual wield the game takes a few things into consideration.<br />
<br />
The primary hand always swings once guaranteed, on it's own delay.  Then the game makes a check on your double attack skill, and if it succeeds, you swing again instantly (no delay).  <br />
<br />
The offhand will make a check on your dual wield skill based on it's own delay.  If it succeeds you swing once with it, and the game checks your double attack skill again.  If it succeeds you will swing again instantly(no delay).<br />
<br />
I think there is some sort of penalty to the rolls in your offhand, because as I remember quad attacks were impossible until a certain level of dual wield and double attack was attained, it's been so long.  I'm sure one of the old farts around here like myself can remember what the integer was to reach quad attack potential, my swiss cheese memory keeps putting a 100 in my head for both dual wield and double attack before you can quad...but don't take that as gospel because I'm not sure anymore hehe.<br />
<br />
I am sure, however, that without a doubt, your offhand will trigger independently of your primary hand delay.  For weapons choices historically we choose fast decent ratio weapons for our primary hand to take advantage of the damage bonus (guaranteed lowest hit is 14 at 65 for instance as long as you score a successful hit, even if you could find a 1 damage weapon).  The offhand should have the best ratio (damage/delay) weapon you can find, regardless of delay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Your weapons swing independantly of each other.<br />
<br />
Your main hand always swings once; when it swings the game makes a double attack skill check (assuming that the character has the skill) and if it succeeds the main hand swings a second time.  Also, at the moment of the first swing, the game starts counting down the delay to the next main hand swing.<br />
<br />
The off hand does not always swing.  Instead, it makes a Dual Wield skill check.  If it passes, then the same thing that happens when the main hand swings happens; the second hand attacks, makes the Double Attack check, swinging a second time on a success, and also starting the countdown to the next second hand dual wield skill check.<br />
<br />
The differences are simple.  Instead of automatically swinging, the second hand automatically makes a skill check to determine if it does swing.  Also, the second hand does not make a double attack skill check (and thus no double attack) until the double attack skill is at 150.  This will happen at level 29 at the earliest.</div></div><hr />
