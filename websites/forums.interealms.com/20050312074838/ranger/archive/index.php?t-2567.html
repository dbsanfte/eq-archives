For some godforsaken reason Verant decide that 8:30pm Australian time is a great dandy time to do a patch, every bloody time. Why cant they vary it a little? or better yet, why cant they do what DAOC does and leave a couple of servers up and patch them later?<br />
Im sure you will all agree (especially you Aussies) that we would all rather play on the Test server for a night than sit here reading e-mails.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fredescu</div><div class="date">05-08-2002, 08:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the reason they don't leave a couple of servers up during patching is so those servers aren't disrupted too much by the excess players that would flock to those servers looking for something to do. <br />
<br />
I remember a couple of times they left the test server up during patching. Gfay had easily over 100 people in it. I shudder to think what field of bone would have been like.<br />
<br />
The other option is to leave half the servers up, so the burden is spread a little. The only problem I can see with that is if a tradeable item or a drop from a common mob is nerfed. People on the yet unpatched servers would get wind of this and try to sell their item quickly. Someone not in the know would spot a bargain, buy it, and be very pissed off the next day. If it was a drop off a mob that was nerfed, can you imagine the camp disputes? It would be a CS nightmare.<br />
<br />
A solution to that would be to publish the Patch Message *ahead of time*, and to do away with stealth nerfs.<br />

They choose the same specific times due to the fact that these hours are the lowest in activity on the servers. Since most of thier customer base is North America, you will see this at the same time, everytime. I would hope that VI would have enough sense to patch the Euro server at the appropriate time, which would differ from the time that they patch the other servers. I haven't finished my first cup of coffee yet this morning, so I hope this doesn't come off as incoherent ramblings.</div></div><hr />

Well I just came back to Aus from 12 months in the UK and I have to say that I didnt really have a problem on patch days. Generally by the time I was ready to login (about 8:30pm) the patches were finished. there was the odd occaison but not often.<br />
<br />
As for all of these reasons for them patching at certain times for certain reasons and doing it a certain way every time... all I can say is &quot;why doesnt every other MMPORG do it?&quot; I know UO doesnt as I used to play UO. I know DAOC doesnt as Ive just been chatting to a mate that plays DAOC. I know AC doesnt as the same mate plays AC.<br />
So why does Verant find it necessary when no others do?<br />
<br />
Most of these games have some way to play, even if its only a temporary solution, but they have some way to get your fix.<br />
I think its just another case of &quot;we're right jack....&quot;</div></div><hr />

And now we Aussies get screwed over TWO NIGHTS IN A ROW.  Repatch tonight.  Just like I said they would, they waited 24 hours to repatch.  They patch, you Americans play with it all evening, I get home from work ready to play and they patch again.  I am so sick of getting screwed out of my play time, over and over again.  I pay the same subscription fees that you do (in fact, some might argue that because of our appalling exchange rate, I pay more but that's not the issue here).  I would love to have the same right to play when I want like you do.  You pay, I pay.  You play, I don't, because every time they want to patch they abuse the very same players.  We're not many, but why screw us *every time*?<br />
<br />
I realise it's because we're a minority but please don't tell me we shouldn't complain (I know no-one has said it yet but I'm concerned that someone might).  Else you should be telling every other minority group in the world that they shouldn't complain about being treated badly either.

By the time I get off work, get home and login - everything worth fighting has already been killed. There were many times where I would have loved to see a patch keep the servers down until late in the evening my time just to give me the chance of seeing it after I login.<br />
<br />
<br />
It wasn't until they started varying mob spawn time so that everything didn't show up at server up that I actually started to see the big mobs that I always heard about.<br />
<br />
<br />
Taking the day off from work every patch day just isn't an option.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I work nights, so I was blessed with them for a long long long time. <br />
<br />
Originally, my days off were Wednesday and Thursday. Patches ended up on Thursday nights quite often. <br />
I got kinda fed up with this since it was during my weekend every single time. I went ahead and changed my days off to Sunday and Monday. Yeah, that's about when they moved the patches to Tuesday morning at 4am my time. Sure enough, in the middle of my weekend again. <br />
Finally, I ended up moving my days off again to match up with my friends (and since there was finally an opening for that time at work and I had the seniority) on Friday/Saturday nights. <br />
<br />
Haven't had much in the way of patch issues since then.<br />
<br />
All I have to say is, be glad it's not in the middle of your playtime on your weekend.</div></div><hr />

Hey man, they're not just screwing you with this.  Even though I'm an American, I don't start playing every night until around 2 or 3am my time-- which leaves me with about an hour or two before the damned patch shuts it all down.  You're right, they're not very considerate-- I guess it all depends on the &quot;peak hours&quot;-- I guarantee you they'll never decide to shut servers down right before those peak hours go into effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kishin</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 08:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">they simply try to patch when the fewest number of people would be playing... it's not &quot;fair&quot;, but it's not personal guys..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Braslo</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 11:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It really sucks that so many people are interupted by the patche schedules, and especially that it's the same people over and over and over again, but you need to keep some things in mind...<br />
<br />
First, the SCHEDULED patches are at those times for a reason, that is when the servers usually have the lowest number of players logged in.  The option is to block 10k people or to block 200k people, the obvious choice is the 10k group.  It sucks that it's usually the same people over and over again, but that's the way it is unless you can get everyone else to start playing during that time.<br />
<br />
Second is the issue about them having to bring the servers down at all, when other games don't.  Well think about this, EQ has been out for 3 years now, and was in developement for a couple of years before that.  At the time the game was developed, this is how server updates were done.  The whole system was designed the way the technology at the time allowed it to be done.  All of these NEW games that everyone compares it to are NEW, they use NEW technology, new technology that lets them update servers without bringing them down.  I bet that SWG is using this new techology that keeps the servers up most of the time.  And I'm sure that EQ2 will have that same always-online ability, but the current EQ is simply not designed to handle that.<br />
<br />
And just for FYI, almost all of the patches for the last 3 or 4 months have been on wednesdays.  That just seems to be the day they use now.  Originally, when the game first came out, it was usually on tuesdays.  Then for a while it was usually on wednesdays, then on thursdays.  Now it's back to wednesdays.  In actuality, wednesdays make a lot of sense, they get 2 days to prepare, and then after the patch they have a couple of days fix unexpected major issues before half the country shuts down for the weekend and pounds their servers into oblivion with increased activity.</div></div><hr />
