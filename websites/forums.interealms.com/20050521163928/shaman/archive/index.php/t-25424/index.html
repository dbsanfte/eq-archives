Hope I made that link properly ... what do you guys think about this ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hmm sounds good........but<br />
<br />
1st EQ was getting very bad press so in comes the &quot;guild summit&quot; once bad press blows over SoE go back to virtually ignoring the players.<br />
2nd EQ losing players because of WoW etc so now comes &quot;class roles discussion&quot;,sorry I just cant personally believe SoE will take this anywhere.<br />
<br />
&quot;Baffle them with bull****&quot; as my boss used to say.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It will be interesting to see what, if anything comes of this. Having an actual vision for what the different classes are supposed to be and enforcing it would be a good thing. However with all the class baggage accumulated in the past 5 years It seems to me they still have their hands tied when it comes to making any significant changes. <br />
<br />
After having combed every computer related store in the area and finding shelves full of eq2 and Wow sold out everywhere (can't find a copy to save my life). I get the impression that they've realised that eq 2 isn't attracting as many of the players leaving eq 1 as they initially hoped and have decided to try and fix eq 1 to hold on to the playerbase they already have, which would probably be their best chance to consolidate what's essentially a captive market due to the time invested to level characters. <br />
<br />
The core problem remains the same however. After 5 years, redefining class roles even slightly.... Someone will threaten sepukku no matter what you decide to do. Damned if you do, damned if you don't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The curiosity is definitely piqued. It'd be interesting to get in on that chat and see what's to be done.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Im watching this situation as closely as i can . I will post any details I can about the chat as fast as is possible for me to do so .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bigsnack For'Mobs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Live chat is fine for PR purposes but is not good for either giving or receiving information.  I would suggest a locked and severely edited thread that is just a list of ideas that have some basis that can be submitted by individuals from each class.  Let the discussions of those ideas go on in other threads.<br />
<br />
I'm curious what tests they are doing on the live servers.  Are they looking at what we are actually doing or are they using their own toons to try to play the class?  Are they looking at a single mob kill or what happens over a 3 hour camp?  Are they looking at all levels of equipment for the class or just certain levels?  The level of gear of other group members also makes a huge difference as well as what the group make-up is (warrior MT vs pally/SK is a huge difference for shaman).  Are they looking at bots or Shaman mains?<br />
<br />
What information they are gathering and how makes a difference in the validity of their conclusions.  I think it would be extremely difficult to get the information.  My hat's off to them for trying.  I hope they are open to getting feedback to help analyze data to reflect actual practice rather than just theory.  Class balance to me is when a group can replace a member with my class and maintain the same level of killing over a 3 hour camp.  That's hard to quantify from raw data.<br />
<br />
When do they expect to be done with their tests?  Giving us a target date would be nice.  I'd rather they set a later date than expected than an early date that will be missed.<br />
<br />
Will we get any feedback from the tests?  The statement seems to say they will provide some feedback and a request for discussion.<br />
<br />
I hope they are serious about wanting to fix the problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Razzaziah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The fact there is no way we can convince someone to buy EQ1 start at level 1 and go to level 70 when WoW/EQ2 do a decidedly better job of it causes a huge problem.<br />
<br />
This isn't a gloom and doom reply, but the developers have to do SOMETHING other then post on the message board &quot;we are reevaluating group and raiding roles of classes.&quot;<br />
<br />
LDON is empty!  I haven't even done one in a year, but visiting the zones is a graveyard.  And those were the easiest places to meet new people (if you didnt have a guild).<br />
<br />
If a level 10 can't fight something and try to earn something useful (i.e. someone says go to bazaar and buy X its better then what you can earn) the game has lost a major reason of why most people played.<br />
<br />
The developers need to decide:<br />
a. EQ lives on and rekindle the &quot;earning&quot; of low level crap to bring back newbies or<br />
b. Cashcow.  Please the remaining masses for as long as possible.<br />
<br />
And for now, it defintely looks like b.<br />
<br />
If you take what players learned post luclin about stats and how combat worked.  You need to rethink your itemization of the game.  You can remove the bazaar and people still know that a +1ac item with 2 sta doesnt matter.  EQ2/WOW do a good job of spreading equipment/quests across the level of play they are needed.  And the real test will be if EQ2/WOW 'adds' content, such that the next time a player goes through the game has it changed.<br />
<br />
So bite the hook of developer mockery or not.  But look at the last few patches for examples.  How much really changes?  How much is fixes to an expansion we already paid for vs new content?<br />
<br />
I love my shaman but a few more spells wont change the fact that the game is virtually empty in all things which made eq great in the past.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">we may find it necessary to make fundamental changes to the game<br />
<br />
One change that I've always wanted to see, is a complete eradication of any debuffs that lower mob dps.  In return, debuffing classes (slow, cripple, etc..) would need new, creative contributions to group and raid play.  <br />
<br />
For instance, if the entire game weren't entirely based around pure dps...(by that, I mean, any encounter seems to revolve around a mob doing X dps, and healers needing to heal for X-Y, where Y is the amount debuffed)<br />
<br />
What if a zone were filled with 1/3 mobs that blind, 1/3 mobs that mez, and 1/3 mobs that suffocate you?  Current debuffing classes would then have cure blindness, cure mez, and enduring breath that would be hightly coveted in groups.  <br />
<br />
Not the most perfect example, but you get my drift.  <br />
<br />
The issue with slow and any debuff that reduces mob dps, is that it is just too hard to tune once the numbers get too high.  The higher the dps, the greater the chance the unslowed dps will kill a tank outright, whereas the slowed dps is trivial.  <br />
<br />
We know SOE made the majority of all mobs mitigate, and ZERO was given back to the slowing classes.<br />
<br />
The only fundemental gameplay change that would really matter in the long run, would be a complete redesign of EQ content, to not entirely focus on dps/healing, and instead mix in new factors to battle, and give the &quot;cures&quot; or &quot;solutions&quot; to those new factors to the classes affected by SOE&quot;s continual nerfs of class defining abilities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Redesigning game mechanics would be great, but I don't see them do that at this point. The resources this would take up are better spent in making new content, in their eyes.<br />
<br />
In my perfect EQ world maxed channeling would allow casters to cast on the fly as if they were bards. The damage a single mob can dish out would be lower, but in exchange you'd have to fight several mobs at once. Alternatively a single mob would just hit everyone on its hate list. <br />
<br />
Tanks would get abilities to slightly reduce the damage other group members would take, but the whole group would still require heals.<br />
<br />
The 3 priests would have the same type of heals, with just the Cleric having direct group heals. One of the heal lines all priests would share would be ultra fast low healing spells, both for emergency and to allow Druid and Shaman to heal their group with those at the cost of being very inefficient.<br />
Recast delay of 2.25 seconds would goooooo. That was the most idiotic thing to implement ever.<br />
The only thing to interrupt a caster would be stuns and duck or movement if the character lacks channeling AAs/or max Channeling.<br />
<br />
Endurance Pool would work like mana. Once a melee ran out of endurance, they'd stop attacking.<br />
<br />
Sorry, just brainstorming and posting a few things I have always wanted to see changed. There are a lot more, I am probably not thinking of at the moment.<br />
<br />
Not like any of these things will ever happen in EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The &quot;new content&quot; what they make is exactly what has annoyed me mostly lately. Bugged stuff, unbalanced and what not else. Not to mention the annoyance of levelling again and so on. I don't know also what they will find in their &quot;class balancing&quot; checks and such, hopefully they'll actually listen to the many reports being said to them and sent and so on. If not, then they'll just lose another batch of players once WoW is out in Europe, which is coming soon, after a month or maybe tad more. To the &quot;die hard&quot; EQ fans here, no, this is not a threat, this is just an obvious observation that there will be more people leaving the game once WoW is out in Europe as well. No new corny expansion will help here, actual work on existing issues might.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>scarnage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">really a very funny AND interesting thread to me.  First, I really don't think class balance is an issue.  If you KNOW how to play your class, then there is definitely a role for you in ANY group, even if it's fill-in-the-gaps.  In MY very humble and honest opinion, the problem is simply that the game has become Everlewt and is no longer Everquest.  Secondly, for the regions where EQ2/WoW have already been released, the players that are still playing are mainly doing so because a) they enjoy the company of the people with whom they play or b) have simply invested too much time or money into the game to quit.  Please SOE, just fix the mechanical problems you always seem to create...  it's too late to fix the rest<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: oh yeah, and as far as class roles, isn't this about 5 or 6 years too late?  &lt;mental note to devs:  big picture first /bonk&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>bumluc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It's a crock.  They have MORE than enough input from the community through the various websites, their own site, etc.  This is more &quot;oooh we're going to make everyone happy!!!&quot; (hide in corner and see how much longer people continue to pay.<br />
<br />
They know what is wrong, they can no longer fix it, imo.  They have let things scale out of control by only balancing content for a limited number of classes all the way up.<br />
<br />
p.s.  this isn't a 'come to WoW' post, I've been fed up with this crap from SoE for a long time and when I see them doing it again, I hope other people see it for the smoke and mirrors it is.  you like the game?  stick with it.  for me, there were fun moments, but I was sick thinking back on the days of kunark and what shaman had been reduced to.  they can't give shaman that feeling back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Total crap, pardon my french.  I've never been thrilled with EQ customer service (which they might know by now! ;) ) but this latest ploy is total crap.<br />
<br />
Bumluc is right.  Good lord, they have REAMS of information related to class balancing.  Classes aren't balanced.  Classes haven't been balanced for years.  <br />
<br />
However, Rytan aside, SoE isn't stupid.  They collect statistics on everything.  I will lay odds on the fact that the only reason there is movement now, is because they're getting alarmed at some of their results.  They've dragged their feet and done no work for so long, that it's biting them in the ass now.  Heck, go look at the shaman forums on the EQ board.  Traffic there has dropped to a tiny trickle.  No one posts there any more, because SoE hasn't done a thing with it.  Heck, I've had some posts up there that ought to have been edited by the mods, and I bet they haven't even read half of them.<br />
<br />
This fiasco is just another in a long line of placebos by SoE.  Business as usual: &quot;Feed the customer a line, and do nothing until they notice.  Then feed the customer another line.&quot;  SoE CS couldn't have a worse mentality unless they adopt a policy to reply to any communications with incoherent cursing.<br />
<br />
Come to think of it, that might be an improvement.  At least it's a response!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I have to agree with Chutoi and Bum - I have no intention in participating in another farce from SoE.<br />
<br />
The last one regarding the 10 suggestions ended up being a complete joke with practically zero response on the shaman &quot;Top 10 Issues&quot;.<br />
<br />
Why should I bother wasting my time contributing to a discussion or suggestion on the topic of shamans when SoE have proved time and time again that they have absolutely no interest in paying any attention whatsoever to what the customers propose.<br />
<br />
Not even to the extent of giving us any reasonably well thought out reasons why they are not going to implement things.<br />
<br />

Hmmm....<br />
Perhaps some people dont just want to &quot;fill-in-the-gaps&quot;.<br />
Perhaps some people actually want to take an active role in the group.<br />
Im not aiming this at the Shaman class btw as we lately (post GoD) seem to play an active role.<br />
On that note my &quot;fill-in-the-gaps&quot; role in GoD trials was to heal the charmed pet between fights.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Ivloney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">What would ‘class rebalancing’ do for anyone’s character that can’t even get into a group because there is such a low population on most servers anyhow? Why don't SOE just make it possible for any class to solo to 70 in a short period of time so there is a chance for that class to get a group? Then worry about balancing group play styles. But even then at 70 there is still a challenge to get into groups. So why not just make a cheat for ‘GOD MODE!!!’ for those who want to see the end content of EQ. Further more let’s just end all our accounts because the way things are going EQ will have lost most of its luster and challenge to even play the game any more due to all the catering that is being done to keep little if any interest of the game alive. There is no saving this game after all the neglect SOE has demonstrated over the past three years. Call a dead horse a dead horse please and move on to new entertainment. Or just plug in and keep playing EQ like the good sheep SOE thinks we are....baaahhh!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Insert [random SOE bashing] here  :( .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Wodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Most of the class balance material they have had is from before OoW. Although some of it can be put down to sheer despair, things must have got better, lately there are far fewer complaints.<br />
<br />
Disgusted as I am with the cheap &amp; nasty way they have done things, I think they have learned their lesson to some extent, &amp; I'll be taking part in any discussions they care to start. Live chat does seem pretty pointless though.<br />
<br />
Glori's posts on the guild summit are worth going back and reading if you haven't - the designers &amp; developers do care really deeply about the game.<br />
<br />
Sometimes they over react though - monk nerf, mage nerf, bard nerf. Thousands of dissapoited customers, &amp; hardly any of the playerbase cared about the advantages those classes got (If warriors had the aggro lock that Sony have had to give them anyway, they wouldn't have cared how well the monks mitigated)...<br />
<br />
We have a chance at the moment to try &amp; avoid something like those nerfs happening - on present form if they do break something it isn't going to be fixed quickly.<br />
<br />
It's obvious that I'm more optimistic than most of the people that have posted, but for me this is pretty much the last chance they get. I have some in game goals that I'm shooting for, but when the're done, unless the game is looking like fun again I'm going to WoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Specter Aldonova</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Only 3 things I would want to see at this point really.<br />
<br />
1)  Reduce aggro of and lower the cast time on dots.<br />
As has been stated in the past, we get CREAMED if we dot something up.  And we HAVE to dot something to a fair-thee-well in order to do any kind of decent dps.<br />
<br />
<br />
2)  Increase the dps we can do.<br />
I'd like ONE good fast casting nuke.  Just ONE.  And if we are going to be mainly dependant on dots as dps, maybe up the dmg per tick a bit.  Wizard in my guild was celebrating a new high crit last night.  10,216 pts of dmg in one blast.  Even if we stacked every single dot in our line-up on a mob, we can't do that much dmg.  Nevermind in one blast.  Oh, and he survived it.  Not something I could say for us.  Not to mention how long it would take to cast all of our spells.  And all the spells we'd have to demem.  And discounting that the mob would be dead, or have made us resemble something along the lines of spaghetti, long before we finished.<br />
<br />
<br />
3)  Lower the cast times of the Mal* line.<br />
Seriously.  Why does this spell have such a long cast/recast time?  Enchanters get Tash.  Bards just sing HoS.  And we get Mal*.  Which takes have the lifetime of yer toon to cast.  On raids in Anguish, if I have to Mal* something first, the mob is already at 80% health by the time it lands.  And if you are an unfortunate enough Shaman to not have Balance, like myself, despite hours and hours of trying, like myself, then you are stuck with Mal* on mobs like the ones in Anguish.  And heaven help you if multiple pulls come in.  Read that as always, because it's just way to slow doing singles.<br />
<br />
However, those 3 things don't really address &quot;balance&quot; per se.  I'm not sure the game CAN be balanced anymore.  And, really balance isn't the issue of the day.  The real issue is logging in and seeing only 5 of yer own guild online on a non raid day.  And seeing only 15 players in MPG.  And only 20 in WoS.  The real issue is that people have left and they are not coming back.  Sure, we all fussed when zones were overcrowded.  But, there were alternate zones to go to, even if you didn't get the loot or exp.  And even that is non-existant now, with the MPG trials that have really nice stuff and all the spots in OoW.<br />
<br />
They need to figure out some way to either get new blood or bring back some of the old.  The best long term option would be new blood.  There are plenty of things for guilds to do at the top still, especially now that a lot of the end game people have hung it up in frustration.  But there is practically nothing for the new player.  Like someone else mentioned, why should a toon play for an item or complete a quest for something that just plain sucks?  Especially when they can just go to Bazaar and buy something better.<br />
<br />
/shrug.  That's all I can personally attest to.  Sure, the Monks need help.  And so do the SKs.  But almost every class says they need something.  You should hear some of the Beastlords talk about how they got the raw end of the stick in OoW.  Personally, I have no pity for them, but then again I'm not an end game Beastlord.  So how would I know?  Basically it works down to what SoE is or is not gonna do to us this time.  If they really do go in and change the fundamental way the game works, then all 3 of my points listed above may no longer apply.  And, maybe it'll turn out that Monks become the strongest class.  Or the SKs.  Until they figure out what they are gonna inflict on us this time (notice that I am also in the &quot;Can SoE do ANYTHING right?&quot; camp) we won't know just what we are looking at as far as class balance is concerned.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I'd have to agree that it's the &quot;too little too late&quot; issue, combined with the &quot;fool me once&quot; issue.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think that SoE has finally woken up to the FACT that EQ is starting to fade.  They have left it took broken for too long, and they have given those of us loyal to our favorite game so many lines and run-around that they have burned their bridge with us concerning trust.<br />
<br />
I went on vacation over Christmas, then when I returned I told my guild I was taking a hiatus to complete my book (I'm a writer), because I've been falling behind my schedule.  It's been a couple of weeks now, and I find that I don't miss EQ much at all.  Oh, I miss my friends, I miss raiding, but outside of that...nada.<br />
<br />
At the current rate, I may be retiring from EQ and cancelling my account by March.  Because for me, EQ has violated the most sacred equation of all:<br />
<br />
FUN = enjoyment - aggravation.<br />
<br />
The aggravation level exceeds the enjoyment level, turning EQ into WORK instead of FUN.<br />
<br />
This, more than anything else, is what SoE has to address.<br />
<br />
If they want to bring people back to EQ, they only have to do one thing.<br />
<br />
Make it FUN again.<br />
<br />
How they do that is entirely up to them.<br />
<br />
But I'd love to see them do it.  I want to look forward to logging on once again for something other than a raid, the way it used to be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyone want to guess how likely it is that we'll see 'class balancing' when they have to debug a new expansion in a month?<br />
<br />
Suspicious timing?  Nah, not at all!<br />
<br />
Farking hyopcrites.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Solemneyes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I would find it a little easier to believe if...<br />
<br />
... if the top ten had not been ignored.<br />
... if the previous class rep had not been ignored to the point he stepped down<br />
... if they had ever come to the 'next monday' when they were going to respond to the six month old 10 questions post.<br />
... if they actually fulfilled their promises on things they even agree are messed up (pets hps etc anybody?)<br />
... if they didn;t make this huge announcement about reevaluating classes a couple days before announcing a new expansion which will undoubtedly tie up immense resources. <br />
<br />
if this or thats are the reason that IF i trust them I am clearly being a gullible fool. For now, I remain pessimistic and skeptical - I will believe it WHEN I see it in game and working. Until then, its like whispering in a heavy blizzard - I can't hear you and will believe it when i see it as the previous snow jobs are just way to loud and blinding.</div></div><hr />

<br />
OOW:<br />
New disciplines, AA's, items, spells, quests and tradeskills continue to make EverQuest the most-compelling and persistent online world ever created. <br />
<br />
GoD:<br />
100 new Alternate Advancement abilities offer more options for character progression with new and unique skills to master.<br />
<br />
DON:<br />
New spells and Tradeskill Recipes<br />
<br />
So either they 'forgot' to add new skills/abilities into their PR website or they simply do not exist.  It is still surprising to me that the best thing they can come up with is the Bandolier.  I mean great now TA and your epic can be swapped! woot!  But is it worth 29.95?<br />
<br />
Hehe, I'm still pissed off OOW didn't come with a manual.  ARG!</div></div><hr />

Just wanted to drop you all a quick note and assure you that the announcement of the new expansion does not change our time table for the class re-envisionment project.  We are still diligently gathering and analyzing data and hope to share some of our initial findings with you later this week or early next week.<br />
 <br />
Thanks.<br />

I hope they do something to keep their players, I know my old family guild is going to LOVE the new guild hall. And be real community is why 90% of the ppl play, not that the game it self is fun, just the ppl you play with are fun.<br />
<br />
I really would love to see slow go away. And changed to a -damange per hit.  You could have more of them, for more varity.  Like -50 damage to a min of 10.. so casting that on an orc pawn would have no effect.. something like that. But I don't see how they can do that without trivializing to much content, all though if you consider old content trival anyway I guess its not relivant.<br />
