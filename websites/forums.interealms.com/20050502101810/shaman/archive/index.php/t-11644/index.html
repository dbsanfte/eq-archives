Nahhh removing totaly worthless spells(name of petition : remove str and dex spell) and giving us totaly worthless spells like STR+DEX spell ,is not a good point ,it's a joke</div></div><hr />

Crappy str/dex if it stacks with fos:  Mediocre<br />
Crappy str/dex if it doesn't stack with fos:  GARBAGE<br />
Group 50% haste that isn't 60% SLTW:  GARBAGE</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kintai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">a) with planar power, etc AA abilities to get your stat caps to 305, some don't max with just focus .. so this helps.  maxing str has more of an effect on ATK than on DMG .. allowing you to hit more often, and sometimes for more, less &quot;resisted&quot; dmg<br />
<br />
b) donlo's dementia is an effect on an item, vice a spell at this time, so tiny terror is our donlo's<br />
<br />
c) group speed.. hell yes... lots of times i'm the only healer / slower / haster in groups, and with 4-5 melee to keep happy, i'm more than glad to downgrade their haste for a group one that finally lasts an appreciable amount of time<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">how can you guys not be happy with a 50% group haste that lasts 30 min ? Sure 60% would be nice, but garbage ?? I fully have to disagree there. The only time a shaman is the haster at the level this spell is available is in a XP group , anything bigger a enchanter is going to be hasting with a better spell then we even have in our spell book. I can personaly only be happy with it 10% isnt going to make or break your XP group , its not going to get you a extra AA a hour or anything of any huge importance.<br />
<br />
Im just happy we got a gorup haste , didnt think that was going to happen even</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Xanivus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Donlo's Dimentia is an EFFECT on an item that comes out of VT. It's not a scribable spell.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I love the group haste, 36 min according to lucy, with shawl that should work out to one cast every 45 min or so.  And it's group, so you see it blinking on yourself before the whining starts.<br />
One question, does anyone know if the new tiny terror will get a buff icon? Otherwise I can hear the chanters cry worse then the clerics on focus about being shrunk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Demisius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Donlo's Dimentia is an EFFECT on an item that comes out of VT. It's not a scribable spell.<br />
<br />
Sort of like PE was out of VP? =)<br />
<br />
I think they made it a new spell because they wanted to modify our existing garbage spells.<br />
<br />
IE:<br />
Donlo's Dementia spell num 4564<br />
Group Agi spell num 65456<br />
<br />
If they were to give us Donlo's Dementia, we'd have a new spell, but still have a garbage Group Agi.  By making a new group shrink, they're able to convert all existing copies of Group Agi to Group Shrink.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Fozy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Donlo's Dimentia is an EFFECT on an item that comes out of VT. It's not a scribable spell.<br />
<br />
The effect is also on the group shrink potion that we are currently able to make. <br />
I am pretty excited about the spells and happy to finally see a group haste.  I don't care if its 10 percent less, its 1/4 the pain in the arse if you have quite a few melee in the group.  Atleast they are doing something.</div></div><hr />

Hmm..worked fine for me yesterday.  Hope they didnt actually break it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Islowem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I think some of you whine just to hear yourself , or it's become such a habit for you (/shivers), that you do it without thinking.<br />
<br />
HUGE thread on remove/ change str/dex spells.  Another huge thread (or many smaller ones) screaming for either longer laster haste, or a group version.  Many posts about where is group shrink (IE:  Donlo's Dementia).  Soooo, this patch, all those issues are addressed, and instead of being happy/ relieved/ excited that we actually got some changes we asked for, some of you act like my 5 year old boy when I bought him a Hot Wheels Dragster car, and he wanted the Hot Wheels Nascar.  I think you just whine/ moan/ complain, cause its a habit now.<br />
<br />
These changes are good.  No, they arent the best of the best of the best, and everything you wanted in life to make you happy for the rest of your days.  But before this patch, did we even have an option of group shrink/ group haste, or stackable str/dex buffs with FoS/7 ??  No.<br />
<br />
Yes, we can single target SLTW for more haste, then the group version, but the group version lasts longer.  It's no different then at 62 deciding to single target everyone with FoSoul, or group buff with Khura's.  Or at 61 whether to single target Replinishment, or group buff Regrowth of Dar, etc etc... come on people, these changes are good.  It addressed numerous complaints about those worthless spellls, and gave us more options and other spells we have been requesting.<br />
<br />
Sigh..<br />
<br />
Slow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I would have been happier with an upgrade to PE, but a stacking str/dex buff is a marginal improvement for buffing melee who are short on stats.<br />
<br />
SOE is still treating our spell lines in a half-assed, non-creative manner.  They could have just as easily added a consent message to shrink because you KNOW it is not going to be /tgb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Blackdust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">SOE is still treating our spell lines in a half-assed, non-creative manner. They could have just as easily added a consent message to shrink because you KNOW it is not going to be /tgb. <br />
<br />
Okay, dunno why everyone keeps bitchin. Shamans kick MAJOR ass, we don't need another spell at all. Soloing giants in PoS, guardian wurms or just about anything else, you name it and shamans rule. We are almost vital to any PoP xp group or raid. Shaman's are by far the most versatile class in the game. We don't need these spells but they are very cool.<br />
<br />
Group haste = awesome. I've wanted this spell for so long. I really hoped it would go in with PoP but it didnt. Then I thought maybe it would go in with LoY. So seeing it added now is a huge suprise and I couldn't be more happy about it. This spell is going to make xping so much less frustrating. I hated having to swap haste in and out and trying to remember which melees were hit with it at what times. So much less hassle with this I am happy as can be.<br />
<br />
The other spells are just nice. We don't need them or anything but they will come in handy. I say don't bitch when this is a totally unexpected ninja upgrade for us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Soon as I log on I will see if I am happy. If all the new spells work like they seem like thre will work then I will be very happy with them. I might be slightly disapointed if group shrink uses a buff icon. But just slightly. As long as i can use /targetgroupbuff to shrink other groups that is a big help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Did some testing. Can not MGB or /tgb the new group shrink. Does not use buff icon. <br />

The new str/dex does stack with focus, primal essence and voice of the beserker.</div></div><hr />

At the moment its a 750 mana spell that is self only.  It does not hit anyone else in my group.  But I'm still happy it'll get fixxed and be useful at some point in time. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Regardless of the value of the new spells ... at least we can do the Spec turns in in good faith rather than worrying that there was a good chance that the return spell was a total waste.    <br />
<br />
Last few days these spells had disappeared out of the Bazaar ... expect that they will be back with a vengance today asking top prices.   And expect to start seeing some old world spells turning up with much better price tags.   INT research skill folks will test the market on all spells including Shaman's for value ... it's just free market seeking it's own level.    The next week or so things will be in a state of flux ... but in time things should settle down.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Yay they take away a useless group dex spell and replace it with a useless group shrink spell.<br />
Here I was all excited about not having to group hop around to shrink.<br />
edit: why not just give it an icon then shove it in the bard box.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">These spells are garbage.  Shrink is so annoying to cast because I need to hop from group to group ~ thanks for answering my prayers on that.  Yay!  VI CARES!  Where do I line up to lick Absor's shoes?!?!  OMG someone tell me please! Oh, wait, still gotta group hop.  Well, um...THIS PATCH IS THE RULESEST BECAUSE IT SAYS 'shaman&quot; A WHOLE LOTTA TIMES I LUB YOU VERANT!<br />
<br />
STR/DEX worthless.  First off, 35 STR and DEX do two things, and the first one is jack.  STR has NO EFFECT on hit rate, fyi.  The displayed ATK number is a composite figure.  STR affects max, but not modal damage, and is pretty much worthless for that reason.  Thirty-five DEX points will have no measureable effect on proc rates.  Worthless.  Nonetheless, everyone on your raid who has 304 str will scream OMG I NEED DAIKU I DON'T CARE WHAT PARSING SAYS OMG I KNOW 1 POINT OF STR WILL INCREASE MY DAMAGE 75% AND MAKE MY SoW FASTER!!!!  OMG WHERE'S MY DAIKU I CANNOT MASTURBATE TO MY INVENTORY SCREEN UNLESS ALL THE NUMBERS ARE MAXXXXXXXED! <br />
<br />
Group haste could be nice if you are slacking and don't ming gimping your group a bit to save a few button pushes.  But the fact that anybody at the Crucible would think that 35 STR/DEX is worth casting while 10% haste isn't needs to be taken back to Castersrealm and left there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Hannduvdeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I figured group shrink wouldn't be targettable because it doesn't have an buff icon, like Radiant Cure.  I'm still happy about it because it will still cut down the time on raid prep'ing a little. (Enchanters who don't want to be shrunk can pop on an illusion before the shrink then click off the illusion to be full sized again, or just be out of range of it)  Of course I wish it was targettable/MGB, but I'd rather it not be to avoid a mandatory buff icon solution.<br />
<br />
My problem with group haste is I actually use my puppy alot, and can't cast this on him.  Since I'll have to load SLTW regardless for him, I may as well keep everybody with the best haste.  With QB2, a Haste of Mith item, and SCRM, I don't mind keeping 24 min duration, 4 sec cast time haste up as much anymore.  (group haste will be nice for powerleveling though)<br />
<br />
I got nothin but love for the group pr/dr cure.  Well deserved for shaman in my opinion.<br />
<br />
It's a bone thrown in the right direction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">i am more than fine with giving up 10% haste in an XP group, and i think my melees would be alright with it.  Group haste is very cool sounding to me.<br />
<br />
I was hoping group shrink would be TGBable but its not, not that i am surprised, for the same reason normal shrink is group only.  it could be used to harass people.<br />
<br />
as for the new diaku spell, pretty stupid /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Did anyone ask themselves why we get grouphaste and statbuffs out of all the suggestions that have been made on this board or /feedback in game yet?<br />

<br />
            Ok capito now or it's still to complicated ?<br />
Also you should understand that group version of a spell are ALWAYS egal or superior of the single version.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Single target buffs are for chumps, and so is single target haste =p<br />
<br />
Yay for group haste. Im sorry but SLTW is a GIANT PAIN THE FN ASS! I LOATHE this spell more then anything in my spellbook.<br />
<br />
Considering 3 out of 4 of the melees I group with have 41% haste items, switching to group haste is a tiny tiny dropoff and well worth not having to A)haste tanks every fn  3 minutes(it seems like) b)keep haste constantly memorized<br />
<br />
Sometimes I think you folks whine just to whine. Just thinking about group haste gives me wood heh. Have wanted it since I first cast quickness on a tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">These spells are nice ... and yes they are just a bone.  They have basically no effect on us what so ever except saving us a little time.  But it is a step in the right direction.  <br />
<br />
It would be nice to increase the effectivness of shaman both in dps tuned for pop mobs (fights that last &lt; 1 min) and our ability to decrease the amount of damage that mobs do.  Suggestion would be to make disease slows unmitigatble.   40% slow is not that overpowering.  There also needs to be some way to change the dps of caster mobs.  A slow and cripple line that effects them would work like the enhancement effects with negative values.  <br />
<br />
Thank you sony for taking a step in the right direction.  Please dont stop there.</div></div><hr />

And what about Disinfecting Aura.... is it back to the way it was curing both disease and poison?  Or does it still only remove disease?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">you can't please everyone all the time, and i don't care if its not EXACTLY what we wanted, the &quot;new&quot; guys over at SOE have really been listening. i am so impressed this went live. the dex/str seplls ARE useful for people who don't want focus, i know BLs and clerics always complain that they want buffs just not focus. yay for shamans we got a few really cool new spells. if you're not happy, oh well! let the rest of us enjoy it please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Jamorea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">I'm totally happy with group haste.  If the losing that 10 percent haste bothers you, cast the 63 ST haste.  I know I'm going to use group haste pretty much exclusively though.  Casting haste was my least favorite job in groups or the occasional raid I was on without an Enchanter.<br />
<br />
I hope I don't need to join the other groups to use group shrink.  I'll have to try it.</div></div><hr />

These may not have been my very first choices for the replacements for the STR/DEX spectrals.  However, the fact that they are being replaced and are being replaced with buffs that I find to be at least marginally, if not vastly, more useful than the previous ones is a step in the right direction.<br />
<br />
Group haste is a godsend for me.  When was the last time you had to do haste on an entire raid as a shaman?  At 250 mana a pop and a 15min duration its pretty damn hard for me to keep haste up on a raid of 24ish.  I find myself doing it FAR more often than I want to because our enchanter has had to switch to working graveyard for a while.  Keeping up with ~4500 mana every 15 mins for haste sucks.  By the time I get everyone hasted and get back to full mana the duration of SLTW is close half over already!<br />
<br />
The fact remains that a change was made and it is a change for the better.  These spell ideas were suggested in the spells thread.  If you have better ideas in the future I would hope to see them posted and /feedbacked.  Overall I am very pleased to see this and the changes to Disinfecting Aura, including the addition of the new LOY group cure quest spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Group Shrink:<br />
Need the whole raid shrunk?  Ok, gimme 2 shaman and it'll be done in 2 minutes.  One shaman sends tells to group leaders and gets an invite for group shrink, the other shaman invites whoever drops from said group and does single shrink...  Whole raid shrunk in 1-2 minutes reducing 6 casts per group to 2.  Would be nice if it was MGB enabled somehow, but as is it still makes life a little easier.<br />
<br />
Group Haste: <br />
Let's assume your melee put out 50 DPS unhasted and have 25% item haste, you then cast SLTW to put them up to 85% total haste and increase they're DPS to 92.5.<br />
<br />
Now compare to 25% item and 50% spell for a total of 75%... 87.5 DPS so you lost 5 DPS or 5.4%...  <br />
<br />
Increase that item haste to 41% on higher end melees and you lose just under 5% so let's just leave it at 5% for simplicity.<br />
<br />
So, 5% longer... let's say you're in a fast xp group doing 1aa/hr, what's 5% mean?  3 minutes.<br />
<br />
Yeah, I'll take the 3 extra minutes in worst case conditions.  Realistically, if I'm in a group with 4 melee and sole haster/slower/buffer... I'm busy as hell and the melee usually are as well, so it's not that rare that one of them forgets to tell me haste faded for a few seconds or minutes even.  It's not that uncommon that when the buff starts fading and they do tell me, that I'm busy doing something else and they have to wait a few seconds or minutes till I get a chance to cast it and/or swap it back in.<br />
<br />
Group haste is a LOT less hassle and well worth 5% DPS IMO. ;)<br />
<br />
STR/DEX:<br />
Ok, these are still pretty craptastic.  /shrug :p</div></div><hr />

(Well it WILL be good when they patch the AE range from 0).<br />
<br />
Group shrink will make shrinking a raid a lot easier EVEN if you do have to get an invite (briefly) into each group.<br />

FFS some of our complaints were heard and have been addressed.<br />

Go play the game and stop whining.<br />
Or better yet, dig out those monk mains you all scrapped to make shaman twinks and go cry about how badly you were nerfed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">hehe Henny, I learned from the best.  I should reprint some of the things you have told me here someday  =)  Yes, I suppose that the group haste is nice if there are no shamans or other enchanters at your raid.  That doesn't come up for most of us that often, though I know it does for you.  Still, you have to admit that it is a pretty limited market.  And, as I said, the group haste is nice if you are feeling lazy.  I don't see any reason they could not have gone with group SLTW.  10% haste (9% if your melee have 41% items) isn't everything, but it is pretty significant. <br />
<br />
Way more significant than 35 STR/DEX, which is beyond garbage.  Frankly, this single target versions were probably better (since so many castersrealmsers seem to think OMG CLERIC DEX IS BETTAR THAN AVATAR DOOD FINDING A WAY TO GIVE CLERICS MORE DEX IS WAY MORE IMPORTANT THAN FIXING MITIGATION) though it is hard to compare two numbers so close to zero.  The fact that so many people here seem to think that 35 STR/DEX is more useful than 10% haste just speaks to the decline in quality of the posters here over the past year, but that is an issue you and I have discussed to death and back.<br />
<br />
The shrink is the worst of all.  This is something that we have been CONSTANTLY harping on for over two years now.  Shrink is absurdly inconvenient because of the group restriction.  We've made TONS of worthwhile suggestions: confirm box, raid only, cheap infinite use craft items, giving the spell to every damn caster class.  ANY of these would have been a godsend in terms of convenience.  Have you ever had to shrink 70 people and keep them shrunk.  It blows.  Instead we get another shrink with the same group restriction and OMG PRAISE THE LORD VERANT LISTENS TO OUR CONCERNS!<br />
<br />
Anyway, they took out 4 worthless spells and gave us 3 worthless spells and an ok, maybe I'll use it when I am lazy spell.  The Second Coming this ain't.  Overall, we would be vastly better off if they replaced those spells with ~nothing~, and therefore gave us a better shot at actually useful spells.  As far as DA, they never should have nerfed it in the first place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Group 50% celerity is crap.  How many of you remember casting single target stamina buffs on everyone because the group stamina buffs weren't as good as single target ones.  Same goes for str.  Same goes for agl.  Same goes for dex.  Single target superior buffs will always be used over inferior group versions.  It's been proven in the past.  I won't ever be memming this spell.  It's garbage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dunno man, In my guild groups and raids people get the best *group* buff available and then we proceed with the killing. Only in the most dire cases do people get single target buffs for special circumstances(granted its rendered mostly moot now that almost all the clerics have hand of virtue and a shaman has fo7). Frankly, SLTW SUCKS. Its a mana hog(not so much an issue) its a pain in the ass with its flash in the pan duration(big big honking issue). Sorry but group haste that lasts twice as long that loses ~5 dps per melee is a beautiful wonderful amazing and beautiful thing.<br />
<br />
Mostly, people who insist on single target buffs that are marginally(thats what sltw is over group alac.. marginally better and only in its haste % not in any other way) better then the group versions getting passed around the group or MGB'd need to just get a TL out and never come back imo =p</div></div><hr />

Reading your posts is great. You should take your pills every day to get rid of one of your personalities though. I can almost tell when you have and when you haven't taken them in the morning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">Group shrink will save me like a second or two at the most in its present form.  The regular spell eats next to no mana and has a fast recast, so a group version of the same spell really is not needed.  What IS needed is a very quick way to shrink 50-60 people without the hassle of getting 10 different people to add you to a group.  When people die in a large raid it would really be nice to be able to just re-shrink them without again going through the group hopping hassle.  Oh, sure it was their fault and all for dying, but cmon'. :p<br />
<br />
The Shrink line needs a consent box is all and it is such a painfully simple solution.</div></div><hr />

<br />
nothing like a personal attack to fill in for for the inability to rebutle a opinion eh ?<br />
<br />
Changing your view on something does not require a personality defect , it requires a open mind and the ability to comprehend whats going on and to be willing to change to the correct view point for the moment.<br />
<br />
Ive stood here and shouted from the mountain tops and stomped my feet in anger as i think 75% or more of the people here a few months ago have. <br />
<br />
Im over it.<br />
<br />
Fact is I can sit here and look at my guild and know that a str/dex buff is going to help , marginaly yes , but no more of a slim difference then 10% haste in a XP group haste is going to make. Groups haste even at 50% is a freaking god send , this is something i been needing for so long. Its a good chunk of mana , but with 4 melee in a group it certainly will save me time and energy. Plus lets look at it from this angle. The time im buffing these melee with haste every 14 min i could have been DoTing or nuking. That would easily bring the DPS of the group back up and i would be doing it with my offensive spells which is alot more fun then keeping a 14 min buff on a group dont you think ? So the reality of it is there is no DPS lost if your doing your job right and you cant say we cant land DoTs or nukes. If you cant land a DoT , odds are you can land a nuke. Hell even putting pox on a mob is going to make up for that DPS loss from the 10% im willing to bet. Who cares if the full duration isnt being run, you still getting ticks of damage that is increasing the DPS of the group as each tick goes by.<br />
<br />
SoE is giving us some attention. I view it as a positive thing. I Certainly have no desire to remain a pissed off unhappy shaman for the remainder of my EQ days. There is a point where you have to stop and get off the train. This is simply my stop .....<br />
<br />

<br />
Actualy i disagree , once they see that lil buff icon , they wont care. Unless you make a hotkey thats like &quot; Groups hasting 50 % , which is not as good as my single target 60% buff&quot;  Then i dont think you will see anyone caring one way or another. I can tell you this much , anyone who asks me for a single 60% in a XP group isnt getting it. I will explain that the very small and unnoticable DPS you lose with a  50% haste will be made up cause ill be able to nuke/DoT more now because of its duration. so i dont see a real problem here.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">People forget that if mobs die faster then clerics have to heal less and wizards nuke less. Thus a batter haste indirectly affects their use of mana also. Instead of throwing 3 heals a fight on tank, cleric throws 8 heals in 3 fights. Has more mana, with the extra mana is an extra nuke and so on. Same applies to wizards. Less nukes a fight = more efficient use of mana.<br />
<br />
I found this funny though  cause ill be able to nuke/DoT more now because of its duration<br />
- Yeah, resist rate on SLTW is too high. And it aggroes a lot too. Grats! You save a little bit over 800 mana for a period of 16 minutes. You won Everquest. Oh and ... why is mana so important for shamans?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">Seriously, in 65 my exp groups rarely consist of 3+ melees. If i choose to get some great exp(in 65, not sebilis or something, k ?), i rarely lack an enchanter(because they just bring more to the table than any other class for exp sessions) and if you have an enchanter, you aren't hasting anyways.<br />
So how often do you people have 3+ melees, who don't have 50+ self haste, in your exp groups in 65 ? <br />
<br />
In PoP if you get a full group and you want to make &quot;ok&quot; exp, you probably bring a cleric because you have to pull a lot of mobs to make grouping worthwhile and can't be main healer. So that leaves 4 spots. <br />
Do you have any casters in your every day PoP exp group ? Of course, you do. <br />
So now you have 3 spots left. Do all 3 melees you usually invite need a 50% haste ? I'd be surprised if it was so.<br />
So are you casting your grouphaste for 1 or 2 melees at best, when it's worse than your best single haste ?<br />
<br />
But hey, it owns. And Sony listened to our petitions. I have a bridge to sell...anyone interested ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Group Shrink: Great for dungeon and raid content. Saves alot of button mashing.<br />
<br />
Group Haste: Awesome when mana is tight or I'm lazy.<br />
<br />
Group STR/DEX: I really like this spell. It adds that extra little bit of efficiency for tanks. Small effect maybe, but MGB it on a raid and I bet the cummulative effect would be quite a bit more than many of you think.<br />

Well, I do agree with you to an extent.  I am very pleased with the spell changes, though I am disappointed I cannot shrink other groups.  However, as far as what we can solo... man, other people must be WAY better soloers than I am, because I just cannot solo the way some shamans seem to!
