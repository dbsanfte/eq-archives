<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mysticbash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am curious. There are 3 aa's in which the text is vague enough and I wish to know more about their exact effects if possible<br />
<br />
1. Call of the ancients (how much healing?)<br />
2. Radient cure (how is it differant from blood of nadox?)<br />
3. Virluent paralasis (how successful and how long lasting is the root?)<br />
<br />
Thanks, Mysticbash</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Galiden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Radiant cure is different because it works on curses, and can be trained to work on higher counters than nadox.</div></div><hr />

2. Radiant cure is different because it also can remove a set number of detrimental effects.  The higher level RC, the higher % chance it will remove an effect and also the more effects it can possibly remove.  This is why it can remove effects such as Malo which is neither poison, disease, or curse.<br />
<br />
3. VP is extremely successful, so much so that if you use it with Malicious Decay it will last it's full duration 99% of the time.  VP1 the root lasts about 1.6 minutes, VP2 1.8 minutes, and VP3 is 2.1ish minutes.  At VP3, it will actually last longer than the recast time which is 2 minutes so you can keep a mob perma-rooted.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">CotA is useless,  the big advantage of RC is it doesn't take a spell slot and doesn't use the recast delay.  Same for VP, VP3 lasts 2 min with a 2 min recast, great for add parking</div></div><hr />
