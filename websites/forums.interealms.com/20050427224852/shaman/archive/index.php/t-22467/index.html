<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>doitup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does anyone ever go to the tower anymore? I was wondering if anyone had an idea on how xp is there?<br />
<br />
I figured if I'm playing an alt i want to enjoy the experience, and I havent been there in such a long to other than to goof around and get all the keys just to have :). <br />
<br />
Was also wondering what is a good lvl to head there since i dont remember what lvl the 1st and 2nd floors mobs are?<br />
<br />
Also will be partner with a Shadowknight around the same level as myself when we go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kellenial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">To duo TOFS, it can get rather hairy. At level 30, a beastlord and cleric did okay, but slow on level 1. More DPS was needed, and a little better CC. I'm guessing low-mid 30s will do well on level 2, with using level 1 solely to get the key. Level 2 has casters, which can pose their own problems, but to me they seemed easier to single pull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Durdend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Did ToFS from lvl29-ish until lvl34 with a Paladin part who was about a level or two lower then me the entire time.<br />
<br />
We did fine on level one, as most mobs were straight melee (and back then we could get a KEI).  The second leve was a little harder, as many of the ghost in the library were a caster of some sort.<br />
<br />
We tried level three once or twice, but left for SolA to try that out for awhile.  We were on the third level for about 20 hours total and never even saw the fouth level key dropper, so we got a bit discouraged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>PanzerCat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If your going higher then the third level your gonna want to be higher then lvl 40+.  When you get to the Tzarina she is gonna mez you and have you beat the crap out of your buddies which wont be too fun.  Plus, if you get turned around in there its game over, pack up your bags and go home.. I love the tower for its feel, and general layout.. Its a blast with a full decent group of 40's..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I &lt;3 ToFS<br />
<br />
It's tough, think of it like Guk used to be.  You always needed to be a few levels higher than what you would normally have to be to take out mobs of that level due to agro/adds.<br />
<br />
If I remember right you could do there in the 20's moving up to 4th and 5th floors in the 30's/early 40's.  I still have the wedding rings around my bank some where.<br />
<br />
2nd floor key requires patience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have fond fond memories of logging onto my monk from time to time, camped out on the 3rd floor.  There's a safe room in the first skelly hallway, and those skellies are mad mad crazy exp for a little solo monk.  It was a lot of fun the first time round, too, with my shaman and my man's warrior.  I want to say 30 or 35 is a good time to start on 3rd floor, which was the best spot, IMO.  Still cracks me up that the 3rd floor key is so easy to get, compared to the 2nd.<br />
<br />
Getting chased out into the dervishes in iceclad was the first time the sow booties saved my life, too.  *grin*<br />
<br />
The gaters on the 2nd floor makes it a real pain if you don't have anyone to stun, or if you aren't high enough level to NOT have half the floor come back to you with the gater.  Cancel magic on those DS's...  SK will be really handy on 3rd, since I only had root for runners, which caused some pain with the armors.<br />
<br />
ToFS is the kind of thing they should be looking at when designing new content as something that was done RIGHT.  Well, mostly.  The later floors got a little iffy in terms of risk vs. reward.  But it's still got great mood.   It took literally a minute for us to zone in there on dialup back when velious was shiny, and we still did it.  Such a great place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>TainwulfSilverwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">/agree<br />
<br />
Velious and Kunark were such a blast when they were shiny and new.  Now it just seems like a copy paste job with different skinned mobs and slightly different rewards.<br />
<br />
I had a blast in ToFS back in my 30's, and in Velious in general.  I'd suggest giving this a shot.</div></div><hr />
