<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Something that was a good battle at level 50 that alot of people couldn't do was the Allizsaur in OOT. He's a nice big lizard that looks intimidating. Long ways in the middle of no-where though so be careful.<br />
<br />
Try the unkempt druids in Rather Mnts. They spawn on top of bear hill near the inn, they are level 50's also.<br />
<br />
One of my most memerable fights at level 50 pre kunark was the named shark in Kedge Keep. Lots of fun things in there to solo, but rareish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>bakkal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">At 55 I've had some battles with the named Revenants in SD.  Run them around the whole plateau hoping for a break.  They aren't HARD, they were just some really fun solo battles.  I used to have fun with Taskmaster in Echo caverns as well.  At 51 i think I was doing exp there. That can be a  challenging spot (undead room)<br />
<br />
Yvolcarn (sp) in CS was a good battle. Had someone tell me at 53/54 he wasn't soloable and to leave him alone so I had to prove them wrong. that was a BATTLE. Running around with the dog on his butt and praying for no death.<br />
<br />
Bakkal</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I remember the dino being a pain in the mid 50s because our spear dot has such a short range that you need to stand in melee range to cast it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gooch Gooch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Two of my toughest solos were allizewsaur in OOT... damn that took a long time.  I also soloed the great saphrodyte in echo.  He summons and has a 145 point AE that lands EVERY time (for me at least).  Not the highest amount of hp but he deals the damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>DarkPhase</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Here is what I consider my thoughest fights, with Andad Filla being the thoughest.<br />
<br />
Froglok King in Lower Guk at level 55.<br />
- level 50 pally. About 8khp plus heals and LoH. Hits double for 140. Weak mr.<br />
<br />
Elder Wyvern in Skyfire at level 55.<br />
- level 48 - 50. About 15khp. Hits double for 160. Weak mr.<br />
<br />
Andad Filla in South Ro at level 56.<br />
- level 51. Summons. 32khp. Hits double for 147. Weak mr.<br />
<br />
I got Fungi and JBB, but no epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">At level 50, I know of 2 difficult yet bragworthy encounters.<br />
1.  Break the Frenzy camp in Lower Guk solo, and then hold the camp, with killing the Cavalier (is that the named mob nearby?) spawn as well.  It's hectic, but doable with current gear.  I don't think it was doable pre-kunark though.<br />
2.  Kill the Froglok King.  Ulver told me that he used to kill him pre-kunark.  Bind behind the throne.  Pull him out towards the zone.  Root him in place to break the spawn, then zone out.  Gate back, and figure out how to kill a 10k hp paladin NPC that hits for 130s+.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>DarkPhase</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Soloing Froglok King pre kunark sounds impossible. You would have to do it without JBB, pet, Fungi, Epic, Turgurs. Can't even root rot at that tight space. If someone has done it I would really like to know how. Only way I can think of is by using some potions and/or buffs from other classes or some kind of exploit.<br />
<br />
Or maybe Froggy King has been upgraded after kunark.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Wow- best I've done at 50 was a Mountain Giant Patriarch (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=4229) in DL (level 47, around 9000 hp, hit hard but was rooted most of the time... hehe... still took a LONG time.)<br />
