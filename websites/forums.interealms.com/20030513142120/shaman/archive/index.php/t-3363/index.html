<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cerberis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">On FV the Trivial Loot Code forces us to start long quests early or &quot;buy&quot; the time of younger lvl folks to help with the quests. Some of the early kills and item collections I have done like killing the 2 folks in RM and collecting all the notes in CoM. I want to start the path but am only lvl 40. Will the NPCs talk with me or do I have to wait til 50+? Any help is appreciated, thanks in advance!!!<br />
