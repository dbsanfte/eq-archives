<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have read here that you can't single pull them until 60.  My question is, when you end up with multiples (you are under 60), how many will you get?<br />
<br />
I am trying to figure out when I can move there for a little variety.  I 2 box with my druid.  They are in Katta now doing Nathyn's guards.  I often get 3 or 4 on a pull from inside.  I can handle 3 no problem, but sometimes on 4 I lose my pup and need to bail out.<br />
<br />
I figure that I could probably handle 2 shrooms, but I don't know.  I haven't fought them yet.  I will probably go give it a try as soon as I get 56, for Bane.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any info you can give<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Heigelyac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I tried shrooms at 57.  Got owned raather quickly.  Had 5 on me, I was able to run about 30 feet before death.  If you know a cleric will be available to help you out when you get owned, give it a try, but expect to die.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dunwut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I tried it at 56(jbb, kei, no epic). I never got less than 4 and it's just not worth it to split em up. If one gets a stun on you on the pull you will die. The few times I was successful I was OOM, dogdog was dead and I was close to it. With a solid tank and a cleric/druid you could do it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bubub the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">shrooms suck, we had 56 cleric, 54war, a 43 drood, and 52 beast...only the shaman ,made it ou alive :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>AJ0302</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">what do you guys think about duoing with a 60 pal or warrior here?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Any 60 can single pull there.  Why he would do so when he can get much better experience in POP, I dunno.  Shrooms give only about 1/5 of a bubble per kill at 60.<br />
<br />
Be aware that you should really get your disease resists up.  They cast lots of disease-based spells, including DD's for 200.  Being under 60, you will be especially vulnerable and need resists even more. <br />
<br />
If you don't have a mushroom veil or a bronze statute of bathezid, you might want to think about getting them -- or whatever gets your DR high.  You'll find that what level of disease resist you have makes more difference than anything else here; try to get over 130 at the very minimum, or your kill rate will go way down due to using up so much mana healing.  For someone under 60, the sky's the limit on getting enough DR.<br />
<br />
Realize that you cannot SOW in here(though the zoneline is only about 10-15 seconds away, if you fight in the back), and since the mushrooms can root you and stun you, escape can be rough if you get in trouble.</div></div><hr />
