<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hagle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi, My name is Hagle and I'm an EQaholic. Here's my story. I'm about to get my 4 month chip thingermajigger for not playing! I really like to play EQ and it has been hard to stop because of the temptation to jump on my computer and get some awesome equipment for my shaman and some new aa abilities. All of my family and friends have been calling me a looser since I started playing and It was hard to accept. Finally I realized that I'm a looser so I began the long process of quitting. Sometimes the withdrawls are very rough but I think I can do it!<br />
If anyone else would like to share their story of addiction go ahead. That's what EQaholics is for. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Taabya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, personally if my family and friends started calling me a loser I'd get new friends and possibly a new family too:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Quitter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You will never manage to quit if you continue to browse EQ message boards (trust me).  One more thing, it's loser not looser.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Some people may not want to admit to it;  EQ does have a detrimental effect on everyones life.<br />
<br />
It's when you realize this and walk away, that you become free once again :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Anyone that calls you a loser for playing a game is most likely a loser themselves, otherwise they wouldnt need to degrade you for enjoying what you want. Its your life and F them if they cant handle what you like. Everyone has their own set patterns in life and we all have things we do alot of. Some people watch TV alot, other people read alot, some people EQ alot.<br />
<br />
In the same respect though, one must realize that too much of anything is generaly a bad thing. Too much sex lowers your chi too much. Too much TV makes you lazy and stupid. To much EQ will make you miss out on real life fun and also make you lazy and stupid.<br />
<br />
So its not that your a loser for doing pretty much anything lin life, including EQ, you just need to find balance. Dont play EQ every night, make it a point to place life in front of EQ. Distance yourself so your in the mindset that you would rahter go out and do something or really rather do anything else but EQ, but since your bored and have nothign else to do, might as well play EQ. Something like that helps keep a balance with EQ. I recommend not joining a guild and if you do only join a very small one that doesnt not require huge raid times or that doesnt raid every single night. Its when you join a big guild that raids every night like 4-6 hours and that wants you with them, that you will begin to slip the wrong direction.<br />
<br />
<br />
So like i said, just maintain balance and you are fine. It mihgt take a lil time of coming back and quiting for a month, then coming back and quiting and such, but eventualy you will find your balance and all is well.<br />
<br />
Good luck and have fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I personally have found my balance.  I play... quite a lot, really... but when I start to feel upset, or angry, I log.  And I do have a life!  And that's without counting co-workers as friends.<br />
<br />
However, I swear to GoD (Heh heh...EQ pun... okay, the balance is shakey) that this story is true.  At one point, when I was getting a bit tired of playing, my brother asked if we wanted to go into town to rent a movie.  (We're in our mid-20s, but neither of us have a good enough job to get our own apartment, hehe.  We're not losers, we're cheep!)<br />
<br />
We drive into the parking lot, which is nearly full, and my brother says - i quote exactly:<br />
<br />
Him:  &quot;**** this place is camped!&quot;<br />
Me:  &quot;Yeah, it's pretty packed...&quot;<br />
Me:  &quot;... wait a minute! Did you just say this place was camped?!&quot;<br />
Him: &quot;Oh god... I'm going to have to quit EQ now.  That's just not right.&quot;<br />
<br />
He never even realized it...<br />
<br />
I still taunt him about it - and no, he never quit, either.<br />

Just look at the new spell and AA &quot;upgrades&quot; for GoD and it should be a lot easier for you.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Piwacket</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hello :)<br />
I am an EQaholic and I LOVE IT !!<br />
I am disabled and have no friends in my town ( they got smart and moved away) and I love EQ. I have made more friends here than I ever did at school or work. <br />
I don't get around so well now ( the after effects of using a 1965 Pontiac for a blanket 20 some years ago) and on EQ I can have a life and friends and be myself.  :rolleyes: <br />
I was shy and withdrawn as a kid , so I did not make friends easily and as an adult, I made friends, but as I said, they moved to different towns and we finally lost track of each other.  :( <br />
3 years ago , I was depressed and thoughts of self termination crept into my thoughts DAILY. Now..I can't wait to get up each day and face the world of Norrath :)<br />
I have 2 grown sons ( the youngest is 25 and got me started on EQ) who support my game habit and cater to me (lol love that too hehe).<br />
Youngest bought me my own computer cause I had to share his ( he's a guide on one server ) and so, I did not get a lot of game time.  :D <br />
I still clean my house and fix the meals and go to the store ( with my eldest son's help) and do the everyday things that support life. But I can honestly say that EQ has given me something to do and people to talk to and communicate with every day :)<br />
'nuff said hehe<br />

Excellent but special reaon.  And don't u miss the more immersive aspects that get swallowed up by the arcade game its become?<br />
<br />
But what's your advice for healthy men and women who are glued to this game?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zamnon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I started playing EQ when kunark came out, and I was hooked, instantly.  I had always liked D&amp;D as a kid and EQ was like D&amp;D x10.  I played almost everyday and 12+hours on the weekends, it was quite an experience.  I did this for a year and a half, working full time mind you.  I think back on all that damn time I wasted and don't regret any of it, man I had fun.  Then the game became waaayyyy too friggin complicated for me, as we've all seen, that broke me of my &quot;habit&quot;.  The new high level game holds no fascination for me.  The game now is so easy, I miss the strife, the old 45 minute runs from halas to oasis, scared to death running through zones you had no clue about, then dying and having to make the run all over again.  Having to take an hour boat ride to get to another continent, depending like mad on other players for ports and buffs/companionship and safety.   As much as those days sucked, Damn! I miss those days.  I had the ****tiest equipment, the crappiest luck, the best adventures, and loved the game for it.   Maybe it's just nostalgia talking, oh well, that's my story.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Nah, we are losers for playing this game all the time instead of enjoying life.  Then again, lots of people are losers at real life anyway, so might as well play EQ.  Or, you could say that you save money by being an EQ addict rather than an alcoholic *unless yer both like me haha* or a drug addict or going out on dates all the time and having to pay for movies and dinner for some bitch who is gonna sap you for money until you break up with her and then pretend she never met you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Vladigar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The same people that tell me I waste my life by playing a game are the same people that sit in front of a television for hours every night. Get a life? You first.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">If you can't balance RL and EQ, you shouldn't play.  If you want to be Uber (end game), you may have to sacrafice some RL to obtain this goal.  However, you don't have to be end game to enjoy EQ.<br />
<br />
It's all relative.  Should you lock yourself up for days playing it?  No.<br />
<br />
Is it better than going out to a club spending $100 on drinks trying to get laid, but probably not being successful?  Could be...<br />
<br />
Is is worth losing your job or family over?  No.<br />
<br />
Can you still have a career/family and play EQ?  Yes.<br />
<br />
Balance.  Moderation.  Play to have fun.  EQ is no different than any other &quot;addiction.&quot;  There's nothing inherently &quot;addictive&quot; to the game...there's a bug/fault in the person playing it.</div></div><hr />
