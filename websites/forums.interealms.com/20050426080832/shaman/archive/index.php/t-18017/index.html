<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nokkn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay just like to say, how come no one mentions highkeep nobles/bards, if you dont mind the faction hits, u can easily make around 1.5-2.5% exp a kill and with little down time if u have stoicism and canni dance if u dont have kei, with kei well no down time at all. Its quite easy to get to the noble/bard camp (if its not camped already) since most people camp the guards for cash. just thought id get some highkeep mentioned :) . Nobles hit quite hard (100's) and backstab if ur not paying attention, root one noble to pull since u get 2 but well u can figure out the rest *wink* not a hard camp, gets kinda boring but if u play late at night u can kill nobles and farm guards at the same time, and if your a good aligned race and dont mind faction hits i suggest you try there for your levels (btw im only lvl 41, but i decided to group with my lvl 48 shammy buddy on bard for free exp and he was tearing the shizzy apart) hope this helps, o yea he also said he was getting 2% a kill, and spawn time on the nobles are 5 min, bards around 15, so once again easy camp</div></div><hr />
