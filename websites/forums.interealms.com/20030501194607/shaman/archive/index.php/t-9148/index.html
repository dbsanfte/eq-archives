<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Wow, that is absolute genious!!!! Kudos to that guy.<br />
<br />
who is that guy anyway?  I take it hes some young punk, and no body likes him, but what exactly did he do?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Scurvey Pestilential</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Read some more of the thread, you'll soon see the universal contempt this guy seems to have attracted on his server.  He actually makes a reply on page 7 I think it is, I haven't read past there to see where it goes though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Why put n***** in the title, spoils a brilliant thing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Wow - that is one hell of a lot of effort - very funny tho</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">How exactly do u move somebody who has lev and they afk i don't understand<br />
<br />
<br />
Soulstorm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">bump them... like a bulldozer or somethign.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I was a little surprised by three things here.  First:  the lev had to be done by a dr00d with MGB, since you can't lev anyone else in the bazaar anymore by regular means (and I don't know a lot of dr00ds with MGB).  Second, this guy is UNIVERSALLY hated on his server for cold calling on items and being generally annoying.  Why not sacrifice one out of 30 slots for an /ignore on him?  And if people hate him THAT MUCH, why do people still buy from him</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">There are people who don't know what a pile of crap he is. I was hoping that the bazaar would curtail him, but apparently not.<br />
<br />
As mentioned in the thread, I've had him on ignore for the better part of a year now. He's a moron of the first order whose only joy in life is ripping people off. It's pathetic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Eahlfereth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">This is a guy who sends people random tells &quot;hey you wanna sell for Lodi shield for 5k?&quot;<br />
<br />
Yes, That is an actual tell, from back when Lodi Shields were 20k.<br />
<br />
I bet if he ever got his hands on Torpor he'd be sellin it for at least 200kpp.<br />
<br />
He's a dick. He deserved this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jagara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">classic.  reminds me not to park my trader anywhere near the arena lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">funny</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">rofl funny ****</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>gnarishal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Appears they were using Spirit of Eagle, which works some places where lev does not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>MacBane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">/em stands up</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>DarkSidhe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Flight of eagles, Gnarishal...group SoE (lv 62 druid) + MGB = everyone within about 4 aisles was floating.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Meschit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">This guy must be a telemarketer in RL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Karnn Sathir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">As far as I understand, the idea is: you lev someone, when he's up in the air a Troll or Ogre moves under and a bit behind him, when he comes down he bumps forward a bit due to the box of the Troll/Ogre.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Hargin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I reckon that is why I've come back from /trader mode and noticed Spirit of Eagle on me a few times.  Would a barb in Big Bear form also be able to bump them?<br />
<br />
I wanna kill those traitor shammies selling SOW potions for 74 PP....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Serj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">A Barbarian in regular form can move people too.  I've moved somebody, but this never crossed my mind.  This guy is on hell of a genious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I thought they fixed this exploit?<br />
<br />
You were able to lev someone push him to arena, kill him and loot his trader stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">They fixed direct lev casts, but not MGB SOE/FOE casts.  And if you can push with barb form you can push with your Iceberg sized bearform (must be the specially grown form).</div></div><hr />
