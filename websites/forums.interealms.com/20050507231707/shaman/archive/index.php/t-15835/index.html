<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kaalisti_Painstorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I ran a search on AAXP and couldn't find a list...<br />
<br />
So a 65 shaman has Canni5 and MGB... What's next on the list?<br />
<br />
I suppose it might be determined by how the shaman is played? I buff alot, am usually the only slower, and I am often the only healer, if that helps. I normally don't melee, as my hubby and constant companion is a warrior. I do use alpha pet.<br />
<br />
Suggestions please?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">SCM - appears to be a flat 10% mana savings and stacks with mana preservation focus items.<br />
<br />
SCR/SCRM - one of my favorite AAs, extra ticks to torpor/Q as well as longer lasting buffs make this a good one<br />
<br />
ND - need a few more hitpoints to can 5 comfortably?<br />
<br />
HG/HA - maxxing out these AAs (especially in addition to an IH item) makes us better healers then I ever thought we could be.  Healing crits are just plain fun.<br />
<br />
Virulent Paraylsis - disease based root and knockback, up again in 2 minutes.  I've found it very useful to de-wall mobs and quickly get mobs off casters (useless in places where mobs have a high DR, like CoD)<br />
<br />
RC - get the first level as soon as you can.  At two points, it's a cheap buy to quickly cure your entire group of poisons, disease, curses and magical effects<br />
<br />
Spirit call - helpful with controlling an add or adding a little extra damage.  High fun factor.<br />
<br />
MGB - incredibly helpful for a raid shaman.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">At least QB1 (2 if you don't have at least a beneficial haste item), SCRM can't be beat.  Aside from those, extra hp and tanking abilities from nd3/ca/cs3 were my choices, but SCM is also good for mana savings, and if you heal a lot, the healing adept / healing gift may come in handy.  Pretty much all the archetype abilities are good, though reinforcement tops those IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Can we please have this or some sort of shaman AA path stickyed?It would Really help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Get RC1.<br />
<br />
Then get either SCM or ND.  Hell, get them at the same time.<br />
<br />
After you finish those, you'll probably have a good idea of where to go next.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Its a lot of AA's but I went SCR and SCRM next (after cannV and MGB), nothing like extending buffs (so you have to do it less often) and extending Torpor/Q.  I threw a RC1 in there somewhere too.  QB1 is nice and will finish your title at that point if you are interested in it.  After those, I went SCM3 then ND3, which is where I currently am, still deciding on what I want next.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">after canni V and MGB i went for spirit call (for fun) then i did SCR3, SCRM and SCM3 in that order. Then i picked up QB2, RC1 and VP, SCF1 (for fun) and ND1, Just finished Healing Gift 3 and i'm working on Advanced Healing Gift now. <br />
<br />
Once i'm done with those, i'll probably max out ND, then go on to healing adept and advanced healing adept, then on to the defensive aa's. *pant pant*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My path:<br />
<br />
RC1 (SO glad I got this, at 2 points, this could be the best bang-for-the-buck AA there is).<br />
SCR3/M (Big investment, but very very useful for big Q, plus having the long buffs is so nice)<br />
MGB (I raid a lot)<br />
QB1 (basically just for the class title, but it's kind of handy trying to sneak Q in)<br />
CA3<br />
LR5<br />
ND3 -- better defense at this point<br />
SCM3<br />
Then I'll look at some fun stuff like SC and VP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>bakkal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I sure don't use VP for fun. I think it was fun once seeing a mob fly back a few feet. Mob positioning/etc in clearings on raids and on some bosses, works great.  Also makes Fire solo'ing a complete joke with pretty much no chance of a broken root *shrug*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If you don't have spirit call that is a really nice one...but get whatever you want. There is no right way to spend aa's. <br />
<br />
Spend them how you want to spend them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I agree with bakkal: VP is very useful, moreso than SC. I wish I'd gotten it earlier, but I thought it was just a disease-based root and didn't realize how extreme the knockback is. I wouldn't get it before SCRM, RC1, ND3 and possibly some others, but don't stick VP too far down on your list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Sticky Me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Secs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">VP is a very underrated shaman aa, really needs to more attention brought to it.<br />
<br />
I like heal crits/healing adept personally, make us more useful spot healing on raids.<br />
<br />
AA's to stay away from:<br />
<br />
SC = waste of 4aa+<br />
rabid bear/hastened rabitiy!  just sad</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I have to vouch for the SCRM route also. It's a tough one but I just got SCR3 last night and I'm in heaven. With SCR3 you get a guaranteed 1500pt Torpor/Q with a remote chance of a 1800pter. SLTW lasts a tad over 20 minutes, BoR lasts 26 minutes.. gotta love it.<br />
<br />
Only 8 more AAs for SCRM now... ah dreaming of 1800pt minimum Torpor..<br />
<br />
My route so far: Run3-&gt;Regen3-&gt;MC3-&gt;Canni5-&gt;VP1-&gt;SCR1-&gt;RC1-&gt;SCR2-&gt;SCR3<br />
<br />
Wish I had got RC1 a lot sooner, it's the best 2pts of AA I've spent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">this is the path i took...some of them i would say should be done in that order like to get to canni V but the rest is really based on play style...some AAs are way more usefull than others...i would say SC, VP and RC are great...i would get lvl 1 of each of those next if i were you. anyway, here is my path...<br />
<br />
Run 3<br />
regen 3<br />
mental clarity 3<br />
canni v<br />
spirit calling1<br />
Virulent P.1<br />
radiant cure1<br />
mass group buff<br />
spell casting mastery3<br />
N. durabitly 3<br />
quick buff 3<br />
spell casting reinforcment3<br />
spell casting reinforcment mastery<br />
Combat agility 2<br />
<br />
i am working on CA 3 atm, from there i am doing..<br />
<br />
CS 3<br />
Lightning R. max<br />
innate deffence max<br />
VP 2 and 3<br />
RC 2 and 3<br />
SC 2 and 3<br />
channeling focus 3<br />
<br />
then depending on my stat/gear at this time i will do planer power and innate inlightenment first, or go straight for healing AAs first...<br />
<br />
healling A. 3<br />
healing G. 3<br />
A. healing A. 3<br />
A healing g. 3<br />
<br />
after the healing AAs i had planed to do spell casting fury and fury of magic, followed by the pet AAs.  after this it will really depend on what my gear looks like (what stats i want to AA first...).<br />
<br />
i should note that i will prolly get tired of following this template i have layed out for myself and at some point AA rabid bear and H. rabiditity 3.  also possably the worthless alchemy 3 (since i did take the time to max alchemy and make a trade skill bag.)  i find these AAs would be fun and not much more for me.  I also plan on stick innate metebolism in there somewhere (i always seem to be out of food/water and the damn stat stuff is costly to purchase.)  Aside from this the only other thing to note on my intended path is that the only trade skill i have maxed is alchemy so new tan. mastery is worthless for me atm.<br />
<br />

i hope this helps you guys a little.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Swiftfisted</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I am in about the same position as the original poster.  What does everyone think of the Healing AA's (gift/adept).   I noticed alot of people really didn't go for them right off the bat.<br />
<br />
I've already got Canni V, 1 aa from MGB, have RC1....thinking of where to go after.  I really like crits so ill probably put one point into healing crits then who knows from there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The healing AA's are okay. The problem is that they're based on percentages, or doubling in the case of crits, and our heals start out being so weak that you're spending the same points as a cleric or druid for much less in return. Tnarg's Mending does crit fairly often with Advanced Gift, which can help some with spot healing. I wouldn't say these two skills have made much of a difference in my (in)ability to heal. Kragg's Mending still takes a million years to cast and ends up only healing for 2300+. Maybe if Kragg's could crit these skills would be a little more worthwhile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I went for can5 then MGB. After that, it's just personal preference. I<br />
decided to go for some quick useful or fun ones. Radient Cure is very<br />
useful, and good &quot;bang for the buck&quot;. Spirit Call is both fun and useful,<br />
as is Virulent Paralysis. Working on Lightning Reflexes now. <br />
<br />
Healing is the last thing I'll go for, 'cause we just suck at healing<br />
anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I almost never raid anymore.  I stick to my regular group and based my AAs around my role with them.<br />
<br />
Run3 was a clear first choice, anything else at the general level really makes no difference.<br />
<br />
At the archetypes I went MC3 (had to for cann5), SCR3, HG2 (will be 3 when I get to 65), ND3 (I find the extra HP usefull, although not critical), CA1 (stopped this when I decided to get levels, will resume the CA3-LR5 path after 64).<br />
<br />
Class: Cann5, SCRM (a truly awesome AA especially with torpor, I'm frequently the only haste caster in the party), my next class AA will be quick buff, but that will wait till 65.  I find the class AAs mostly lame (outside of cann5).<br />
<br />
PoP (lumping both to one): Spirit call1.  I will get RC1 and VP1 sometime during lvl 63, so pretty much next (right after CA3).  Advanced healing adept 3 and LR5 are on the long term list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The healing AAs are nice, especially for Shamans as they need the most help with direct healing. However being as that is not my primary role, I maxed them late in my AAs as they were others I liked more - for instance beefing for Torpor/Q with SCRM, shawl, QB3 is awesome. But with a healing 4 item like chain sleeves and maxed crits and maxed adept, I crit for 3300 a lot. It's nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">After canni5 / MGB I found SCR3 / SCRM very usefull. With SCRM I get more HPs back the I lost from canni5 (with BoR up). Without SCR at all I was always 1 bubble health to short.<br />
<br />
When my old guild was in NToV I found that RC1-3 came in handy to cure the damn slows / dots.<br />
<br />
Now I wanted our last title and I got QB1-2. In the meantime SCM3 was a requirement for the guild so I got it. The next steps were ND3, SCF1 and HG1 (just to see a critt every blue moon ;)). After going splat way to often on raids I decided it's time to work on the defensive skills: CA3 -&gt; LR5 -&gt; CS3 -&gt; ID5. If I had to do my AA again I would get LR5 a little bit earlier. Primary for XP groups and solo time I worked on SC1-3 and VP1. Both skills are more for the fun. My guild is now in the EPs and after slow / debuff I tended to heal rampage / AE damage. This was crying out for the healing AAs. I got HG3 / AHG3 / HA3. I stoped here to work on the healing skills to finish up archtype skills: SCF2-3 and channeling focus1-2. Now I need 4AA to finish CF3. When CF3 is done AHA3 is the next goal. After that... I think I will go for /pet hold, suspended minion2, innate metabolism3, VP2-3, FOM2, PP5. This should take some time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">My own route, some of which was done at 61/62, where I stopped to get Canni V, the rest at 65.<br />
<br />
Run 1/2/3<br />
Regen 1/2/3<br />
Mental Clarity 1/2/3<br />
Cannibalization<br />
Radiant Cure 1<br />
Mass Group Buff<br />
Natural Durability 1/2/3<br />
Spell Casting Reinforcement 1/2/3<br />
<br />
I'm now working on SCRM, then will probably do VP1, RC2, QB2, and think some more about whether to go CA3, LR5 or do SCM first. That choice will probably depend on how often LR5 will have saved me if I had it. Mana isn't a problem, but I'd like to die less. :)<br />
<br />
I went MGB early because I was joining a raiding guild. It's definitely worth it if you're raiding a lot and don't have many shamans.<br />
<br />
RC1 is definitely a good way to spend 2 points.<br />
<br />
I did ND3 earlier than most people, because my gear is low standard for the guild I was joining, so I figured I needed the extra HP.<br />
<br />
I'm not considering the healing AA yet, but one of the motivations behind going SCR3/M is the extended duration on Torpor/Quiescence, and similarly QB to cast it quicker. Quiescence is our best heal, and Healing AAs don't work on it. Of course, SCRM will be very useful in its own right to make buffs last longer.<br />
<br />
All this will probably take a long time though, one thing with a raiding guild, my exp rate has slowed right down. I really don't know how people manage to have 400+ AAs and raid every day! :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nod, isn't easy to get XP if you are in a hardcore raiding guild and still have some RL left.</div></div><hr />
