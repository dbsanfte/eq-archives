<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just got Yoppa's Rain of Poison last night, didn't get a chance to use it before I logged.  I did a search, there doesn't seem to be much info on this spell other than what it does.<br />
<br />
How is the resist rate?  I was told a few weeks ago that the resist rate on it was better than previous rains.  Is this true?  I don't see a resist modifier on Lucy for it.<br />
<br />
892 X 3 is pretty damn nice.  If it lands.  That's 2676 damage if all 3 waves land.  Together with Tears of Saryrn, that could produce some respectable DPS.<br />
<br />
Been trying to find a way to add decent, easy DPS along with my support abilities without blowing too much mana.  Level 67 dogdog parsed at about 45 DPs with pet gear and buffs (anyone else confirm this?).<br />
<br />
I can keep two poison DoTs on mob without sinking too low on mana and they expire so I can top 100 DPS pretty easy on each fight, but I get occasional agro...  wondering if I can do better with poison rains.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jeones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Resist rates seem the same as past rain spells but I seem to crit with it often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I recomend dropping poison dots in battles and just use this rain spell. I'm always using it.<br />
<br />
Honestly, resist rates aren't too bad. All 3 waves hit more often than not. Usually when I get a resist it's usually only one out of three. Two waves hitting for full is still better than any nuke we get. (and sadly one wave is almost as good as our DD's)<br />
<br />
Unless I'm in a high DPS group I usually cast bane first then follow up with this rain. In high DPS groups I drop Bane and just use this spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I really love it. With the dps the mobs put out we usually try for singles even with a chanter so mez'd stuff isn't as much of an issue as it was before. The dps is just great if it doesn't resist all to hell. I'd only sparesely used rains before, but I've been using this one a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">People Always complain about hitting mezzed mobs with it. But the radius is pretty tight. I target meele all the time and cast it on them to hedge my bets Vrs proximity on mezzed mobs. <br />
<br />
Or if solo, Position mutt to the rear And cast on mutt to hit the mob and not me while I still meele. (well back when I could do it in teh face!)<br />
<br />
I am seeing alot more 3 wave hits. But not as many seqenced crits. <br />
<br />
Ahh well. It does seem to be useful. Drop this then a bane then this again and I do decent damage in low DPS groups. In High DPS groups I am too busy pulling normally and only drop a quick bane and off I go again. (especially after breaking rooms.)<br />

Unless I am mistaken it greys out Tears of saryrn when you use it so you cannot chain cast the two of them.... which is of course completely lame.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hmm, maybe I'll have to give this spell another chance.  Was playing around in a DS expedition I got with my 55 rogue, so most everything was light blue, and I tried the rain twice...  One resist x3, and one resist x2. Promptly unmemmed it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I thought they were supposed to be tied together as well, but I've cast them back to back numerous times since I got Yoppa's, works just fine and certainly some eye candy when I got (3) 1786 crits and (2) 1300 crits.  :D  Group members were like &quot;hey, whoa!&quot; as was I.  If only it happended more often.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hmm I guess once again my bad luck kicks in. I think out of the total times I have used this I could probably count on one hand the times all 3 waves hit, even after malos. It does seem odd because I do feel it crits more also, but the resists are still there :(. Its funny because the new poison nuke seems to NEVER crit for me. I have most all the aas, and I counted I think 26 casts in a row yesterday before I got a crit. I guess the RNG hates me!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The resist rate seems the same as previous rains to me. I'm up to Fury of Magic Mastery 1, so I crit fairly often. However, when I do crit one wave of this, I can almost always count on another wave being completely resisted. In the end, I just about have to have one of three waves crit just to get full damage out of the spell. Rarely does it do over full damage with crits. I hadn't noticed any problems with chain casting this with Tears of Saryrn, don't think it greys that one out when you cast Yoppa's, and don't see why it would. Previous rains didn't grey each other out when cast either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">&quot;Unless I am mistaken it greys out Tears of saryrn when you use it so you cannot chain cast the two of them.... which is of course completely lame.&quot;<br />
<br />
You can chain them np.  <br />
<br />
Resist rate feels the same to me.  Crit rate might be slightly higher though.<br />
<br />
I can't keep my mana high enough to use both rains in groups once per mob however.  If I malos, slow, rain, rain, and the puller is chain pulling, I run out fairly fast, because I have maybe 1-2 chances to cast canni before the next mob is inc.  I just got the new canni, so that might help, and I don't have mana pres. yet for rains.<br />
<br />
You know though, druids regularily nuke for 3k+ in groups, and they can cast 1-2 plus an attack debuff without problem.  I recently got a 70 druid with alteration/evocation specializations, and fairly decent time gear (friend taking time off).  I usually bring him along to attack debuff and nuke.<br />
<br />
The druid can do far more dmg than I can per mob, and sustain that easily.  While our new rain is more dmg, don't fool yourselves into thinking its actually caught us up with other classes:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I find that Malos, TA-slow, rain, rain, new-canni works well for me.</div></div><hr />

0-11 on TA now :(   Doing Time tonight or tomorrow again. Hopefully it drops hehe.  <br />
<br />
Good to know the new canni helps.  I'll have to try rain+rain again now that I got it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>robxiii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Crits hit for over 2k once you get all 3 levels of the OOW crit enhancing AA.  Its quite nice :P</div></div><hr />
