Mark of Karn got nerfed as it benefitted DW more than 2handing, so something needs to fix 2handing benefitting more on innate DS.<br />
<br />
/snicker.. I knew that nerf would come back to bite somebody else in the ass someday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Xzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yea, so far I've only seen it in Plane of Torment.</div></div><hr />

good that we have to - heaven forbid - not approach every encounter the same way.  and even if you dont have a good 2h (i have NO 2h weapon, and swiftwind haste), i think you may have another way to do non-spell damage if you think about it long enough :p</div></div><hr />

the same would hold true with mark of karn then yet that was nerfed because dual weild/faster weapons were better in that case. dual weild has taken way to many hits to it's usefullness lately and they really need to look at it and fix it.<br />
<br />
dual weild takes a bigger hit from DS, more hits per sec equals more damage to you from DS.<br />
<br />
dual weild takes a bigger from high ac mobs due to the lack of damage bonus in the off hand.<br />
<br />
dual weild does not get triple attack 2hs does.<br />
<br />
dual weild itemization sucks were as 2hs weapons drop like candy.<br />
<br />
dual weild recived no upgrade when 2hs was upgraded losing it's inate advantage it should have over 2hs.<br />
<br />
dual weild causes more argo than 2hs.<br />
<br />
<br />
currently the only advantage dual weild has is you can get higher stats from 2 weapons than you can from one 2hs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jezekiell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I strongly disagree on this one....<br />
<br />
&quot;dual weild causes more argo than 2hs.&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm pretty confident I arggo alot more with my 2hs then i do when I duel wield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Telon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Picked this up last night cause no one else wanted it in guild.  Will have to parse it out sometime, see how it stands up compared to dual wield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sharidann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">and dual wield also means more chances for the mob to riposte so extra damage thrown on you...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Eoghan Blaidd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Funny, when I use my bow the damage shield doesnt mean squat :)</div></div><hr />

and dual wield also means more chances for the mob to riposte so extra damage thrown on you... <br />
<br />
In PoP you arent soloing at all, thoes mobs just hits for to much. And if you get ripostes while the tank has arggo from mob, it's your own fault for not attacking from the back. And that goes for both DW and 2h.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Sharidann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">err Jezekiell, I usually AM the tank, thank you. :)<br />
<br />
When I aint tanking, aye Im behind the mob, unless it needs pushing. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>luterin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">We had one rot yesterday since no one wanted to spend points on a 2hd, had me thinking some on how this sword would actually compare in dps compared to AHB/Claw or whatever combo.<br />
<br />
Personally I use archery 95%+ of the time, so I more or less just use my melee slots for stats/effects.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Shar Nightwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">These have dropped around me before and I have passed on them always.  I have no interest in a 2h weapon.<br />
<br />
The number of times I have to give up Archery completely in a situation and pull my swords out of their scabbards has become so infrequent, that I can't see myself ever wielding a 2h weapon.<br />
<br />
Besides, I don't have a haste item that isn't a 1h sword.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Arondar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Yakie and Kuin it will be a cold day in hell before you see this sword unless in the hands of your opponent :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Ashbys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I guess I am missing something here.<br />
Is this considering not having the epics? I assume it is because why would you want to give up the stats and the proc of the epic swords to fight with a 2hd sword. I assume it would also have to be based upon the group you were with and your 2hd skill. But in my experence I do get more argo from using a 2hd than using 1 hd slash. not because of speed but because of the amount of Dmg i do with the 2hd. Often double 300 and sometime triple 300 hp. Most warriors i group with hate it because when you add the speed it can often out damage them and no jolt that is resisted 40 percent of the time will pull that mob off me. I do have a good 2hd and I use it when I know my epics are not going to be effective. And I will not have the advantage of getting distance on the mob for archery, But if I have distance , the 2hd will not be in my hand.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Toshiden Satori</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Whether you are creating more aggro via a single 2h weapon or dual wielding 1h weapons is going to simply be based on which setup is doing the most potential damage from my understanding of how damage aggro works. And if you are 60+ and don't have all of your weapon skills at least 200+ you are slackin ;)<br />
<br />
I think it's nice that there are some 2h varieties out there for folks to choose from.  I'm not a big fan at all of the folks that stick to that one holy magelo setup (although it's VI's fault for not giving us more options sometimes) and when people have creative gear/weapon setups I like to think it offers more variety to the game, which imo is a good thing.</div></div><hr />
