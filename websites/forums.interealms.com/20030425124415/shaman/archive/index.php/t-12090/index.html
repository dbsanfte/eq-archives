<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>celebel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">can one of you tell me what is best to have:<br />
<br />
<br />
-girdle of mithaniel:<br />

Girdle of Mithaniel   <br />
MAGIC ITEM  <br />
AC: +8 Str: +12 Sta: +10 Wis: +10 Int: +10 HP: +55 Mana: +45  <br />
Weight: 3.0 <br />
Classes: Cleric Druid Shaman Wizard Magician Enchanter Necromancer  <br />
Races: All Races  <br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
-girdle of magnificence (from Lcea)<br />
LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM NO DROP  <br />
AC: +25 Str: +15 Wis: +15 Int: +15 Magic Resist: +7 Fire Resist: +7 Cold Resist: +7 Poison Resist: +7 Disease Resist: +7 HP: +50 Mana: +25  <br />
Weight: 3.0 <br />
Classes: All Classes  <br />
Races: All Races  <br />
Inventory Slot: Waist<br />
 <br />
<br />
don't take the focus effect on the girdle of magnificence, because I have it already on the circlet of falinkan.<br />
<br />
<br />
is there in your opinion a better belt that is at the same level of difficulty?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, here you have a question of what is more important for your character.  If you are a HP freak (like some), then the Girdle of Mithaniel is the better choice.<br />
<br />
But, in my opinion, the Girdle of Magnificence is a better balance.  High AC, high wisdom, and solid resists.  The only area where it is inferior is hit points, and even that isn't a huge difference.<br />
<br />
If your guild kills Dain or has any intentions on killing him, you'd probably find his belt to be of interest.<br />
<br />
Other than that, I'm not really sure what else would be an option.  The belt I use is from Lendi the Keeper in WToV.  Check my magelo link if you want to see the stats but it's not as good as the Magnificence.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>celebel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">thx for your input.<br />
<br />
here is my magelo (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=276389) !<br />
<br />
I currently have big problems upgrading.<br />
<br />
-going to switch shield of bane warding for tae ew shield<br />
-going to find hurricane chain sleeves (I have the blood and bricks, I still need the components for the temper)<br />
-going to replace gloves with hurricane gloves<br />
-replace lodizal with hiero for more HP/mana<br />
-replace the focus bracer with a bracer of fortitude.<br />
<br />
<br />
then my guild should do Lcea again soon and I have good chances to win the belt, since most chanters and shaman in my guild has it already.<br />
<br />
<br />
Then I don't know what I could upgrade...not many choices except from big raids...<br />
<br />
I have problem raising my mana pool. After all those changes I will &quot;only&quot; have 3643 (without the belt from LCea)...not that much to my taste.<br />
<br />
I don't find quests or mobs I could solo/duo to upgrade my stuff...a pity that the high end gear is for high end guilds only.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you make the upgrades that you say you are hoping to make, then I don't see what else you could do.  Looks fine to me, and with those upgrades, I'm sure you'll see a difference, especially with your hitpoints.</div></div><hr />
