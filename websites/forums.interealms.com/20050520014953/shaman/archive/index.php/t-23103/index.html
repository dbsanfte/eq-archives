<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>vincenzovs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hail Heyokahs!<br />
<br />
I have been reading these forums for some time now, and although I agree to an extent with a lot of the gripes I hear, I wanted to make a (mainly) positive positive thought about what it means to be a shaman for me, and why I enjoy playing it.<br />
<br />
Here goes:<br />
<br />
I started my shaman a couple of years ago from lvl 1. I had just moved server and due to some issues with no character transfer from SZ I had to start from scratch.<br />
<br />
Even at lvl 1 I was talking about forming a raiding guild with my friends (who movelogged with me) and so time came to pick classes. Knowing that slows and buffs from a shaman were important I decided to choose a Vah Shir Shaman called Vincenzo.<br />
<br />
AT first things were great....then came the mobs that mitigated slow, and suddenly i noticed my beastlord friend (with plenty of AAs in the right places) could slow faster, with faster recast time and less mana than me. (less mana on the basic spell. with spec adjustments that statement may not be true).<br />
<br />
I started to ask why would Sony do such a thing. The only answer I came up with was that the PoP developers were new to EQ at the time and things hadn't bene thought through properly.<br />
<br />
I then entered what I call the &quot;dark age&quot; of being a shaman. (This was around &quot;Baron&quot; level). Like many posters on this forum, I noticed that I excelled at nothing and couldn't find groups so easily, while the Beastlords and Enchanters were having a whale of a time.<br />
<br />
However in last 160 AA's and lots of gear ups since then things have changed a lot.<br />
<br />
The fact that I am an all-rounder (in some ways like the bard) starts to be my greatest strength. <br />
<br />
Firstly I can heal. I heal pretty well with Tnargs (especially when the Healing Adept crits kick in) and often save asses that way. Quiescence and Replenishment (thank you Sony for the tweak. I FEEL the difference) are my answer to the Bard's healing songs. They don't heal fast but over time it all adds up. I have even healed  a hard ldon named mob when the cleric went LD on pull on a not so great tank....I am no cleric but yes i can heal. (please note you must buy Healing Adept AAs)<br />
<br />
Secondly. The buffs. I am still the buffer with the biggest set of all-round buffs. This isn't such a big bonus though in this day and age of multiboxing and &quot;shaman in yer pocket&quot; players...but nevertheless, Focus of the 7th with a 70% buff extension is a very nice buff, along with Group Primal Essence from my Cudgel from Acrylia. Shame that they made this lovely spell almost impossible to get through research.<br />
<br />
Thirdly. Crowd control &amp; protection. VP3 + Petrifying Earth +6k HP/1.2k AC (buffed) + ND3/CA3/CS3/LR3 means not only can i root mobs, I can peel them away from casters using high agro spells like Turgurs, or just knock them back with VP3. It's not quite the Paladin offtank/stun machine, but it's not terrible. With AAs and gear shamans can even be tough. We can take a pounding. A very useful trait to have. On raids I often think of myself as a bodyguard to the silkwearers.<br />
<br />
Fourth. The pet(s) Dogdog is there to protect. He does some dps, but his main job is to get in the way. I throw 5 dogdogs at a mob (Spirit Call 3) and they really get tied up. Root the mob and you dont even get summoned. Again this is crowd control, but with a DPS element.<br />
<br />
Fifth. DPS. This is perhaps where the shaman feels weakest in this time of Charmed enchanter pets hitting mobs dead in under 5 seconds. However, with a nice fast dot like bane you can add some real damage (2.4k approx) in just 30 seconds. With the Bracer of Exploration and some AAs in Critical Fury, Velium Strike is (finally) starting to be useful. The epic dot is a freebie and is always there to stick on rooted mobs waiting for the group tank.<br />
<br />
Sixth. Debuffs. Mages do have Mala but since the wonderful Beastlords invaded Norrath I don't see too many Arch Magi studying any more. The reality is if you want to MR debuff a mob Malos is a very useful addition to the arsenal, along with Tash and Harmony of Sound.<br />
<br />
Seventh. Canni. The very high mana regen rate that our canni line affords us means we are rarely without mana, and can often squeeze a little more out in tight moments. And with so many options on what to spend the mana on that is very useful.<br />
<br />
So there are my 7 circles of Shamanism. Yes, years ago it was perhaps 10 or 11 circles (think back to when SoW was a BIG advantage) and each circle was perhaps stronger, but even in today's EQ we bring a lot to the table in one class. The caveat emptor of course is you must know how to play your class well. Since we are not a &quot;strong&quot; class it takes a while ( it did for me) to learn how to get the most out of Shamanism. but when you do and other players realise it you become a powerful force in the game.<br />
<br />
My main gripes about the class?<br />
<br />
1. Spells cast too slow. I have managed to get around this with focus effects from items as well as Quick Buff, but compared to my last class (Cleric) a lot of  our spells seem far too slow.<br />
<br />
2. If a mob dies slowly and is slowable I can slow then dot. If a mob dies too fast for slow or dot to be efficient( I am thinking here of lvl 65 ldons in normal risk mode ) and the mob is usually dead before even my first nuke lands...what is my value in the group? It seems absolutely none to me. This is my biggest gripe and as a result i hardly ever do normal ldons, even way back when I was still struggling to do hgh risks....I have this same feeling on &quot;high dps fast killfest&quot; scenarios like the GoD stone of entry trial or the PoJ trials. I seem to be in the group just for the ride....I don't like this at all.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, I used to worry that we were no longer loved as we lost our dominance on the &quot;slowing&quot; world, and as we saw other classes actually doing that job just as well. But now I see our strength lies  in our versatility, almost like the bard. A useless class in the hands of a newbie, but a veteran can shape  some real power out of the mysticism.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well I agree pretty much with this post, our power curve certainly goes up with better equipment and lots of aa's. The level 62 a few days ago who was moaning and griping about not being able to solo a blue guard has no clue about what will happen when he gets 65 with all spells, good equipment, all focus items and a few hundred aa's.  It gets a tremendous amount better - although you might not know it from many posts on this board.<br />
<br />
But anyway, our top 10 list items are pretty much all needed in my humble opinion (except for alchamy and mgb shrink) to get the balance we need to compete for higher content groups.  We know that, lets just hope Sony has a clue and puts in as much time for true class balancing as they do to the nice little goodies they have added in the past year - improved interface, more pok stones, pet zoning, etc.<br />

PS: Shaman don't suck, we just need some tuning.</div></div><hr />
