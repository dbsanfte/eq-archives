<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Meiamour</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know from the patches that bards were the first to go to Luclin sooo my question is.....If you are KoS to bards (looks at Windigo) is it still ok for you to go there and walk around in the city? <br />
<br />
Didn't know if the city is run by bards or not and Kirena wouldn't want her husband walking into a death trap there. Does anyone know?<br />
<br />
I got my expansion today so hopefully I will be able to see what everyone will look like since people are talking about it. I am just keeping my fingers crossed that I have no problems once I install it.<br />
<br />
Anyways...if anyone can please answer my questions it would be most appreciated.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Knarlz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think at the starting city everyone is non KoS to begin with.<br />
<br />
There is a whole new faction set for the moon. <br />
<br />
Some vendors may not like you enough to sell but I don't think anyone is outright KoS</div></div><hr />
