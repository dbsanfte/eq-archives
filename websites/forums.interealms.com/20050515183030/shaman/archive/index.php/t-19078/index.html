<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I want to first congratulate all the intelligent shaman who are doing an amazing job consolidating a front against the steady decline in power of the shaman class. <br />
<br />
I did notice that the vast majority of concerns were in relation to the level 60+ crowd. Though I do believe this is where shamans become most out of balance, SOE will undoubtedly be releasing spells across a variety of levels. As such, I thought it might be a good idea to list some of the concerns that pre lvl 60 shamans are experiencing with their class, in an effort to give the devs some hint of what lower level spells would actually be appreciated, should they be released.<br />
<br />
Please, if you are below level 60 (or remember problems that you faced below level 60) post what upgrades you thing the younger shaman could really use.<br />
<br />
CAVEAT: I do not think this information should necessarily be placed in the e-mail to the developers on what NEEDS fixing with the shaman class. If, however, there appears to be a common weakness/concern with the lower level shaman, then this will be the place to find it, and decide if it's important enough to go (for review anyway =P) on the general list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jahvah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">At level 45 the only thing I'd ask for a is a faster slow for LDoN type dungeons. Something on the order of 40%.  That way the mob won't be down to 20% health by the time I finish casting Togors.  <br />
<br />
Oh and cut down the re-use timer on Spirit of the Cheetah. That's just annoying.<br />
<br />
Group haste would be nice too...but that's just dreamin'</div></div><hr />

<br />
I thought life was good when I was leveling up, one of the issues I had they addressed with the 44 LoY spell (I woulda killed for that back then), but if I had any suggestions looking at the lower level spell line ups:<br />
<br />
A early malo spell, maybe -15 resist around 44-49.<br />
<br />
A direct healing upgrade at 44. <br />
<br />
Pets starting at level 4.<br />
<br />
Group HoS 51-53 someplace. <br />
<br />
I'm a bit far removed from newbiedom, but just looking at spell lineups those are issues I see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">apart from some spells slightly quicker, there isnt much wrong with a shaman pre 60 as i can remember i love my shaman up to 60, and i like it to 65. just higher planes and hard ldon are getting almost too hard for level 65 shaman wih lots aa and it shouldnt.<br />
<br />
only other thing i can think of was an improved sow.</div></div><hr />

somewhere 49-55ish.  it is sad that you go from Billy as an atk buff to full scale avatar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I can say that a quick heal would do WONDERS for us at lower levels (40-54?)<br />
I know it's kinda silly responding to myself, but I just wanted the intro to be...  well, and intro...  Then have the responses follow.<br />
<br />
I am a level 52 shaman.  One of the major problems I find I have is with healing.  I LDoN almost exclusively, and find myself frequently playing the main healer.  The problem is (and this is actually with both shaman and druids) I have no form of group heal, or quick heal.  This means if two targets are dropping fast, most likely one is dying.  It takes me 3 seconds to get off superior healing, and then a few more to wait on the recast timer.  With the low HPs of younger characters (drastically lower with casters, as most don't even look at HP gear till later on) 5 seconds can be longer than the time it takes to go from full health to loading (particularly with enchanters).  <br />
<br />
Moreover, just keeping a caster up when they have agro is sometimes impossible even with chain-healing.  Stoicism helps, but if an add suddenly drops on the enchanter, I can't use stoicism.  The cast time, plus the additional 6 seconds (waiting for the tick) is enough to have most enchanters dead before the first 180hps comes in.  Not to mention that this is an unslowed mob, so 180/tick probably isn't enough to keep the chanter up while you wait for Superior healing to land.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I don't even bother healing the enchanters any more.  I just slow the mob and chain sit (hitting the sit every time I pop up), and hope to god I keep agro till the MT pulls it.  This still doesn't always work, and is a terrible option to be at the top of the list of a Main Healer, when your chanters life is on the line (especially since without a cleric, you most likely don't have decent rezzes) but without a faster heal, i really have no other choice.  This (IMO) is a major cause of the epidemic of Chanters not grouping unless a Cleric is present.<br />
<br />
A lower level faster heal, and possibly a lower level group heal, would do wonders to help here</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">a lower level group heal <br />
<br />
Shamans don't get a group heal at any level currently.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Quote: Shamans don't get a group heal at any level currently. <br />
<br />
Word...<br />
<br />
My phrasing was keeping in the spirit of proposing changes.  I was thinking &quot;If I were sending a list to sony, and then got to the lower level spells...&quot; so obviously, you know where I stand on the higher level group heals too =).<br />
<br />
But yea, give us a lower and a higher level group heal.  Make it a line that slowly scales up, so when SOE inevitably gives us a cruddy verion of our final one, they can slap a few upgrade on it with each expansion, as they are so fond of doing =P.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">No, during the lower levels shamans are pretty much fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">At 65 I don't invis up to run across zones anymore, but in my 40s an Improved Invisibility (longer duration) would have been nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Scarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I agree with Wulf.  In my experience pre-60 shaman are a good balance of early weakness progressing into a real strength around level 39 or 44.  I can't remember any glaring problems or weaknesses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">At 65 I don't invis up to run across zones anymore, but in my 40s an Improved Invisibility (longer duration) would have been nice.<br />
<br />
Do you just train everywhere you go then?<br />
<br />
I still invis myself in many travel zones if as a common curteousy if nothing else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Honestly, I don't think shamans are fine at the lower level.  I think most people believe we are, so we still get groups easily, but if I were a melee, I would be looking for an enchanter over a shaman in my group hands down.<br />
<br />
Shaman buffs are great at lower levels where everyone's stats aren't maxed, but they are starting to become very available in PoK (especially on Tribunal.  I swear there is a MGB focus every 6 seconds, followed by &quot;MGB HOS for the poor Lowbies&quot; every 10 seconds).<br />
<br />
Beyond that, the tiny difference in slows isn't at all noticeable at the lower levels (certainly not to the healer), but the difference in haste is.  Add to that the ever increasing need for CC (which I wholly believe a shaman can run well.  But it takes a rather good shaman to run effective CC, and only a mediocre chanter) especially in LDoN, and you have Chanters comming out on top in almost all situations.  The only plus the lower level shaman has is heals, but those are VERY pitiful until superior healing (52ish?) and even then are still pretty low.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I love my shaman, but if a chanter is already in a group, I feel like I'm only adding a little bit to the group (back up for those &quot;oh ****&quot; moments) and taking away a solid dps slot.<br />
<br />
Oh, and for LDoN, chanters get Pacify which, with LDON, is a HUGE boon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">imho, LDoN changed the pre 65 shaman also.  <br />
<br />
and with the number of bot'ed accounts and 2+ boxing, they just log on the higher lvl shaman, buff up with him and use the enchanter for CC + haste and don't drag our lower lvl butts along.<br />
<br />
a short duration ATK buff gets lower lvl shaman invited to LDoN.  so would some better melee skills 50-65 too; but i can't have it all.<br />
<br />
besides, Carnage is in the game, shaman only, and attainable according to Allakhazam's at lvl 50.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Do you just train everywhere you go then?<br />
<br />
Nope. Only on three runs:<br />
<br />
to Griegs End - and I haven't seen anyone camping that zoneline when I've done it;<br />
in Siren's Grotto on the way to ToV - but nobody camps that zoneline, either, so no worries;<br />
and on the way to Ssra, but those zonelines are never camped (outbound run) either.<br />
<br />
And I gate or use my spiritstone to get back.<br />
<br />
Okay, I admit it, I do invis up to get to SMid in BoT, but other than that, I run where I want to, visible, like a 65 Shaman should. At least, in the zones I cross now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gnofr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Of all the improvements I'd like to see in the pre-65 Shaman, my short list includes:<br />
<br />
Make the class-specific Alchemy worth doing.<br />
Simply decreasing the cost of ingredients would go along way.  Why should potions that trivial over 200 (a skill reachable only by a level 63 Shaman) and only decrease mana consumption by 5% cost 127p per dose to make?  I pay 50p every three-four hours to an Enchanter who would have to be mathematically challenged to turn around and buy most any potion I could offer.  I especially want affordable potions that don't duplicate our primary buff lines.  Shaman provided affordable mana preservation would be my favorite.<br />
<br />
Faster mana regeneration or decreased mana usage.<br />
Whether with Canni 2 and Stoicism or Canni 4 and Torpor it's hard to hold a conversation as a Shaman.  Canni dancing constantly until you can afford a drogmar beats the heck out of not having mana.  But in a game that's fundamentally social, making the choice between talking and being ready for the next fight is awkward at best.  Anything that speeds regeneration or decreases mana cost is welcome.  Even being able to afford to use our own potions would help, but it's not like we'd have the buff slots for them anyway.<br />
<br />
The ability to ever become reliably invisible.<br />
Wasting an hour on a completely un-necessary rez, cussing SOE the whole time, has never been my kind of entertainment.  For those with foraging friends who can stomach LDoN, at least the new potion's available.  Otherwise, getting the swamp vine component in the Bazaar makes each dose cost 100-150p.  That's more than the rez.  So much for mystical Shaman alchemists supplying Norrath with a fixed duration invisibility potion folks might actually want.  An AA that removed the randomness of spells like invisibility or a new spell somewhere in the 50s would be welcome.<br />
<br />
One soft DoT or a Root that works.<br />
We suffer through not ever getting any form of snare (unless we can use the Iksar clicky, if I'm not mistaken), so is it too much to ask for a root that works?  If I'd wanted to kite I would have played a Necro, Druid or Bard.  Once I can finally afford my Scaled Avatar's Leggings and can at least get the spell gem back it won't matter.  Until then one of eight slots is wasted to the emergency-only &quot;root so I can gate&quot; spell.  OK, so that's a slight exaggeration.  I'd be overjoyed with an AA that removed the DD component of my DoTs, or better yet replaced it with even a short duration snare.<br />
<br />
Not having to look forward to worthlessness.<br />
Having (euphemistically) &quot;donated&quot; for my share of Temperance, KEI, Blessing of the Nine and Virtue, I've always resented Focus of the Seventh, let alone all its baby predecessors.  For being a class renowned in the early game for great buffs, it sure feels funny that none of them will ever be worth paying for.  I'll get my MGB AA, but it would sure be nice for Fo7 to last long enough so that I could MGB a group version of Ferine Avatar or a group heal in between.<br />
<br />
There are certainly other class-specific things I've wished for getting to my current level 60, but those might have been unbalancing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kanati</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">When I was leveling up my major complaint was in regard to healing. I thought not getting Superior Healing until 51 (when its almost antiquated...) was not entirely satisfactory. Clerics, by 39, are already regularly employing Complete Heal. It seems that giving druids and shaman Superior a few levels earlier (perhaps around 39 or 44), would be very helpful. Still, I'm sure Stoicism has been somewhat helpful in regard to this complaint. <br />
<br />
And, yes, the Cann II quest is a bit difficult for its level. It's doable, but takes a great deal of work and help to have it in a timely fashion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Here we go...take a deep breath.<br />
<br />
Speed up the cast time on Tagars and Torgors.  Most people don't have spell haste at these levels and mobs are close to being dead by the time it lands.  This makes our slow completely useless, and we become glorified nukers or healers because our dots are too slow at this level also.<br />
<br />
A 450 heal between Greater and Superior.  If we can't be slowers at these levels, give us something to work with other than Stoicism...although Stoi is a great spell, my eternal thanks for that :D<br />
<br />
More than a group STR before fifty something.  If we are going to be bullied into grouping, don't make me have 30 casts just so we can get a group rolling.  <br />
<br />
I would love to see a Mini Malo.  Nothing uber, just throw us a bone like 15-20 :D<br />
<br />
Thats about all.  I would like to see a bunch of other stuff, but these are viable issues...the rest is just dreaming :D<br />

Bear form sucks--  not even worth using<br />
melee sucks-- if i cant out hit my dog, that is sad<br />
heals suck--  i will not accept job as main healer without a really good tank witn many dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Kirisula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I'm 55 myself. While I agree things are mostly pretty good for the shaman pre-60 (thank you Stoicism!) there are few things I'd like to see for the Shaman pre-60:<br />
<br />
1. Melee improvements to keep us in line with Clerics<br />
2. More group buff versions of our buffs. Right now, I would REALLY love group HoS or Haste.<br />
3. Make Can II easier to get.<br />
4. A Heal to bridge the gap between level 51 and (eek!) level 29. Remember trying to heal a bunch of level 50s with Greater Heal? Ouch. Better gear and buffs have made this even tougher.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Vazzkorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Hmm,<br />
<br />
Mostly no...maybe some tweaks between 61 and 65...but not much else.<br />
<br />
Pre 60, the shaman is pretty balanced, maybe has a few weak points, but all in all is pretty versatile and fun to play...and if working in areas he was designed for (not PoP), is fine.  Even PoP is doable though.<br />
<br />
At 60, shaman are great...and even better at 61 with new pet.  Really Tier 1 content and much of the Tier 2 does not present all that much trouble, old world and expansion content is fairly doable/easy, except for the resists you tend to get on much of the higher level/boss mobs which make us pretty useless.  Kunark dragons have always been a good example of that...can't slow em (mostly)....can't seem to get the Dot's to stick and nukes are usually resisted a lot even after malo.<br />
<br />
However, after that, the power growth for shaman is pretty minimal. Quick DPS doesnt scale up at all really, only changes are a few buffs...which are basically meaningless to well equipped/AA'd players.  Slow mitigation removes much of the justification for a Shaman and the mobs are so resistant to poison, disease and even cold in some cases that our ability to contribute is reduced chiefly to  a mitigated slow, a few buffs and heals.<br />
<br />
Effective feel is a fairly decent reduction in power and ability to contribute as a shaman levels from 61 to 65.<br />
<br />
The reason for this, is chiefly the way SoE scaled up resists on mob's in PoP and some other areas.  Since shaman spells have no resist adjusts, we really start to hurt later on with the ability to land spells.  Sure we can Malos...but on a high resist mob, it doesnt lower resists enough for our un-adjusted spells to land.  All we have done is make it easier for the other classes to land spells that have resist adjusts on their spells.  Looks great for them, but doesnt do much for a  shaman's self-esteem.<br />
<br />
Combine that with the short duration of most combats (by design) and the long cast time on our spells and...well you get the idea<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Fix Spirit of Cheetah. <br />
This is an OLD spell. Now since horses and Bard Speed in a buff slot should not be an issue. Let us mem it and cast it. We SHOULD have a faster then SoW travel spell.<br />
<br />
Not to step on the younger shaman toes, but don't you think the Group buffs are something to look forward too? Personally I like the goals that getting &quot;group castable upgrades&quot; to spells represents. It's pretty much that way across the board for most casters. It's how they pawn that same old spell off as something new and improved.</div></div><hr />

I would agree except for the fact we already get group strength spells at level 9 and another at like 29 iirc.  I just want the rest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Beafly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I'm currently level 57 and only started my shaman about 6 months ago so i've just recently experienced most of this.<br />
<br />
Slow before level 52 is near worthless in an LDoN mission. I found that if I casted on incomming my slows would hit with mobs between %30 and %50 health. My biggest nuke at the time would knock off a full %20 more of the mobs health. Net result, I should be casting a nuke on incmoming and not my slow. Something is broke there.<br />
<br />
Canni II is just plain a pain in the butt. By the time you're sufficient level to complete the quest you're only a level or two away from Canni III. Show me a level 39 shaman that can get a greyish bone chip. Heck, show me a balanced group of level 39s that can get a greyish bone chip. Yea, I got my Canni II spell at level 47 or so, but I had a couple of +60 buddies helping me. Shouldn't be that way.<br />
<br />
Also, maybe a look could be taken at our ability to heal from levels 51 to 58. Note that at these levels quite a few of us are grouping in Tier 1 and Tier 2 PoP where mobs dish out fantastic amounts of damage. I've included Stoicism here, because it is the only heal over time available to us from level 44 all the way to 60, and it is the most manna efficent heal we have all the way to level 58. (Numbers at the Bottom)<br />
<br />
From Level 51 - 54 we have two heals available in the event that our cleric goes down. Superior Healing and Stoicism. Used together with good timing we can put down about 650pts of healing power per tick for a limited period of time. (Consider this number in the context of Tier 1 PoP mob dps)<br />
<br />
From Level 55 - 57 we get the addition of Chloroblast. While this spell allows us to patch heal more quickly it is only slightly (and I'd say not significantly) more manna efficient than Superior Healing. The use of Chloroblast vs. Superior Healing does not yield an increase in healing power per tick (actually is a small % decrease). (Consider this number in the context of Tier 2 PoP mob dps)<br />
<br />
From Level 58-59 we add in Kragg's Mending and wham we've doubled our manna efficency and total hp healed per tick. Also note the only heal over time we have available is still Stoicism which is now less manna efficent than our big heal. (consider we're fighting the same mobs we were fighting at level 57)<br />
<br />
I don't pretend to know how to fix this or exactly how it compares to Cleric and Druid Heals of similar levels, but it just appears broke to me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Aikoiko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Hrmm... well I see most of the suggestions here are regarding pre-60 spells.  <br />
<br />
My suggestion...  Make them more obtainable.  I'm tired of constantly being gouged for mediocre spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Spirit of Cheetah was supposed to be an escape spell, like Divine Aura, Harmshield or Feign Death, not a travel spell. Of course, it never worked. 10 minutes recast time, overwrite SOW, short duration, interruptible... whoever try to use it as an escape spell has to sacrifice a spell slot for a spell that, if they can cast it, will leave them crawling in short order. So nobody ever did once they fixed the bug that made spells auto-refresh on zoning.<br />
<br />
You want to fix cheetah? Make it insta-cast (so not interruptible), give it a normal recast and make it so it doesn't overwrite SOW. With that, you can even *shorten* the duration and it will still be a useful spell that shaman can use to 'sprint' away at the cost of draining their mana.<br />
<br />
Another thing that's pre-60, annoying and should be fix? Our self-buffs. The problem? They didn't start as self-buff but as another attempt at providing a 'safety net' spell for the shamans. the original spells of the 'Rage' line use to drain your mana while enormously boosting your HP regen, some stats and AC. But when they introduced the paladin's line of mana-for-hp spell (with Velious?) they screwed up ours to uselessness (the spell would stop when we ran out of mana, which didn't make it very useful as a last ditch kinda thing). So they removed the mana-for-hp component, added some stats and proudly announced that shamans now had a line of uber stats self-buffs...<br />
<br />
Except those cretins, in their typical slap-dash approach, forgot to remove one little side effect: casting those spells also blanks out your spell gems for 30 seconds. In the original line, it was so you could just cast the spell, then use up the remaining of the mana before the spell drained it up, effectively sacrificing your spellcasting abilities for better melees. As a self-buffs, it's just freaking irritating, especially since they kept the ridiculously short duration of the spell untouched (compare the 20 minutes duration of the level 58 VoB to the *2:24 HOURS* of the clerics' BAotR, by example). So another fix begging to happen would be to remove the spell gem blank out effect and raise the duration to something decent... considering how useless the stats are anyway, it's at best a glorified self-AC spell so it's not like it's going to be a immense powerboost.<br />
<br />
On the subject of mind boggling annoyance built into our spell... why the hell do our AC spell have that annoying 12 seconds recast? Is there somehow a balance issue with shaman chain-casting mediocre AC spells on people? You would think those spells had a CH component to them or something.</div></div><hr />

Invis isn't that bad if you work your divination up.<br />
<br />
<br />
i need to work on my negative feedback, this is a great place to start.<br />
<br />
anyone not 65 before LDoN, and 126 AA's now; would realize he was talking about the the fact that shaman invis does not last for a predetermined amount of time.  and the lower lvl shaman gets Hosed when it goes off in short order.<br />
<br />
No, during the lower levels shamans are pretty much fine.<br />
magelo says you are 65 and 299aa.  how many LDoN did you do at 60?  Anathema did not fix shaman in LDoN at 54.  chances are you never bought that low lvl 54 spell, so realize you are unqualifed to speak about it.<br />
<br />
I agree with Wulf.  In my experience pre-60 shaman are a good balance of early weakness progressing into a real strength around level 39 or 44.  I can't remember any glaring problems or weaknesses.<br />
and your experience with this would be what expansion exactly?  when was the last time you were under lvl 60?<br />
<br />
i am seriously concerned that Bot'ed shaman are going to kill us.  after 46, just log on the Bot'ed shaman and buff the LDoN group.  regular groups, log on a Bot'ed shaman for the endurance Warder and have him sit down.<br />
<br />
44 to 54 sucks. after the solo nerf, it sucks more.  without something for LDoN (aside from the curse line) it sucks even harder.<br />
<br />
shaman that lvl are not behind in gear, go to bazaar and get gear for coppers i thought i would never see on my first shaman.<br />
<br />
but they are behind in LDoN, for the same reasons 65Time shaman are falling behind.  no burst damage, spell casting time and poor heals compared to other classes.<br />
<br />
and i am sorry to all the Iksar shaman with the Crudgel, but throw your younger brothers a bone and let them have Carnage.  (YES, i would love to see Sony implement a similar quest for each race with the same outcome) but if you think that is gonna happen,  please let me sell you some swamp land.</div></div><hr />

<br />
By your first sentence you try to make it sound like I believe that invis is a set duration.  Just because I'm 65 doesn't magically mean I forgot how my spells work.  I do, which is why I said work on your freaking divination skill.  That's the key to longer durations.  When you aren't working with a 50 div skill invis tends to have a decent duration.  I know, I use the spell.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anathema did not fix shaman in LDoN at 54.  chances are you never bought that low lvl 54 spell, so realize you are unqualifed to speak about it.<br />
<br />
Fixes for shaman aren't LDoN specific.  Try grouping with people either right around your level or a bit below.  If you group with people on the higher end of range you can LDoN with you get a higher avg level.<br />
<br />
<br />
and your experience with this would be what expansion exactly?  when was the last time you were under lvl 60?<br />
<br />
Not directed at me, but I was under 60 when pop came out, so I know what it is to go from the usual mid 50 xp camp to PoP.<br />
<br />
i am seriously concerned that Bot'ed shaman are going to kill us.  after 46, just log on the Bot'ed shaman and buff the LDoN group.  regular groups, log on a Bot'ed shaman for the endurance Warder and have him sit down.<br />
<br />
If you seriously have this problem, you should look at they way you are playing.  The anti-higher level attitude you have shown me and a couple others makes me wonder how you work in groups.<br />
<br />
44 to 54 sucks. after the solo nerf, it sucks more.  without something for LDoN (aside from the curse line) it sucks even harder.<br />
<br />
I loved 44 to 54(back when 51 was hard), try grouping.  I also did 45 back when we had those hell levels too.<br />
<br />
and i am sorry to all the Iksar shaman with the Crudgel, but throw your younger brothers a bone and let them have Carnage.  (YES, i would love to see Sony implement a similar quest for each race with the same outcome) but if you think that is gonna happen,  please let me sell you some swamp land.<br />
<br />
Try Primal Essence, it's the precursor to Avatar.  If you want the spell on the cudgel, go earn the cudgel.  The reason you get Bih'Li for attack buff is to give people a reason to use that over druid group SoW's that also matched our melee buff method.<br />
<br />
Instead of trying to insinuate that anyone that isn't your level doesn't know their class, try thinking of fixes for problems...like standardizing buff lines so we have scaling buffs for everything we have(like adding atk buffs).</div></div><hr />

SWEET!  does that mean you are qualified to speak on it? or not?<br />
<br />
while i do not say anything because i realize they are largely correct, i get a bit tired of hearing Timed Elemental shaman telling people to **** if they do not know the end game.  If you do not know the middle game does the same not apply?</div></div><hr />

GREAT.  if you read above i am lvl 62 and asking for a buff for shaman lower than i am<br />
<br />
<br />
edit, forget my attitude.  i am not trying to get in your guild.  i see no reason to suck your, just look at facts please.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ok, i get a bit lost on all the expansions, all the abilities.  but wasn't everyone under 60 when pop came out?  wasn't pop the expansion that went to 65?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">No, some people were 60 ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">No, some people were 60 ;)<br />
you're caught, and you know what i was saying.<br />
<br />
people that have been 65 with XXaa's for so long they cannot remember what expansion came out when they were lvl 60, should take a grain of salt when the lvl 60 balancing discussion comes up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">SWEET!  does that mean you are qualified to speak on it? or not?<br />
<br />
Yes.  I've been through it, logged my time.  Unlike most others I had stoicism until a couple months ago when I bought Q(I was 65 for awhile before that).<br />
<br />
while i do not say anything because i realize they are largely correct, i get a bit tired of hearing Timed Elemental shaman telling people to **** if they do not know the end game.  If you do not know the middle game does the same not apply?<br />
<br />
The difference is that if you aren't in the end game, you haven't experienced what they are talking about, but they HAVE experienced the mid 50's albeit their prospective may be jaded and those lower levels made easier.<br />
<br />
My guild and I are not end game, we are just in the tier one of PoP and trying to move up in Ssra while still having a number of players mid 50's.  What this means is I deal with those levels, a couple of which have been shaman.<br />
<br />
GREAT. if you read above i am lvl 62 and asking for a buff for shaman lower than i am.<br />
<br />
More Bih'Li would be great :)<br />
<br />
you're caught, and you know what i was saying.<br />
<br />
No, but I know exactly what *I* was saying, and that was I wasn't one of those that was already 60 with torpor/malo/avatar.<br />
<br />
edit, forget my attitude. i am not trying to get in your guild. i see no reason to suck your, just look at facts please.<br />
<br />
I am, work on your divination skill.  I wouldn't mind having imp invis, but considering how long invis tends to last for me, I don't think it's needed as bad as standardization and scaling of our buffs.<br />
<br />
PS. I love getting feedback via reputation, but add more than bone to it.  Give a reason.  I have been now that I see you can see the message.</div></div><hr />
