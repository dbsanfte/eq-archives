<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aspenarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Over this past weekend, I had a couple clerics tell me that Divine Barrier would not land if they were buffed with Strength of Tunare.<br />
<br />
Has anyone else had this problem? SHOULD this be a problem? To my knowledge, there's no aspect of DB that should prevent it from stacking with SoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There is already a couple of threads about this issue. And yes it's true.<br />
According to Lucy there are no stacking issues, so I guess it's a bug.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sharidann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">well since I saw it happen, I ALWAYS ask the cleric in the group I buff to declick it right away. Sure loses 125 hp but in some areas, DB is really really needed at some point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Daesun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've had clerics in my guild confirm that it is a problem.  Luckily they usually click SoT off immediately so they can still Yaulp, so I don't think I've killed too many people with it yet.. :)<br />

/bug it, /feedback it, complain until they fix it!</div></div><hr />
