<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This board has gotten SO pathetic that I am just gonna stay away for a week. Once the new version of the Panther line goes live, I will come back and see what the reaction is. In the meantime, remember Shamans arent the only class in the game, remember that before DoN we were a damn respectable class (and this nerf doesnt make us WORSE than that, does it?) and remember that in the REAL world, you usually can get more with a kind word and a calm demeanor than by acting like a ranting, spoiled brat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1.  With SOE, you don't get more with kindness.  You either get nothing, or get crap taken away.<br />
<br />
2.  When others you are competing with for groups get markedly better, and you get worse or even stay the same...yes, you did indeed get worse when it comes to getting groups.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">This is kind of funny. Me, since I'm already numb to all of this argumentation (didn't want to risk turning argue into a noun with all the speeling natsi's), I'm keeping out of it for a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shamylamy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm still fighting off addictive urges to play EQ, haven't played for like a week or two, and hearing this stuff helps. It's just too funny what sony does to &quot;balance&quot; the game. I don't want to be &quot;balanced&quot;. I don't want to be anything like a freaking beastlord, cleric, druid, warrior. I want my own thing. I want a situation where people cannot live without me. A group where people say &quot;we don't just need slow to win this, we need some crazy buffage from a shaman&quot;. I liked when beastlords seemed more like monks. Honestly I don't think they have a place in the game. They are mages that can slow and heal. Sure they can't nuke, but mage nukes suck anyway. Same reason that berserkers don't really have a place. They are basically rogues that use 2h weapons instead. If they had some crazy special powers (besides snare/stun which hasn't been that great when I played my zerker), they would be better.<br />
<br />
I'm getting off topic /sigh, maybe cause I'm bored and this is more fun than playing solitaire. Panther didn't seem too overpowered, since I rarely put it on more than 1 or 2 people. Usually it was only on my pet or on the tank. I've put it on several people at a time a couple times, but it's too annoying to keep up and my 7k mana pool can't keep up with it while spam healing or random other things. Blah blah blah.<br />
<br />
Blazz seems to pick apart what people say a little too much. If he is going to state his opinion on something, he should just state it and leave it at that. Most people should probably do that. Just edit your original post to convey info you may have missed previously. It gets tiring reading through 200 posts of people going back and forth over the same thing and picking apart sections of posts, quoting and quoting and quoting, and not really getting anywhere. But I guess since it ups post count it's better to not edit.</div></div><hr />

they will not take stuff away if you are nice and may think about listening maybe not but will atleast not take stuff away<br />
<br />

better to leave than to argue is it not,  it is more mature to just leave than it is to start yelling and fighting isnt it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I daresay there are only so many times a man can be blamed for singlehandedly causing the nerf of a class he loves and has staunchly supported over the years. Can't say as though I blame him for walking away, though I don't exactly agree with the method.<br />
<br />
Enjoy the week off Blazz. Cooler heads will prevail.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Been off EQ now a couple of weeks.<br />
Been reading The Grey but not here since then.<br />
<br />
Thought id have a quick look just to see what was going on.<br />
<br />
Boy this is the liveliest ive seen the board for a long time.<br />
<br />
Im so damn glad real life got in the way of EQ for me now :).<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Blazz.<br />
<br />
His posts pre nerf werent fanboy posts .<br />
But i honestly dont think anyone should have publically stated that Panther was overpowered,you were just asking to be butt****ed by SoE.<br />
<br />
If something is overpowering you do not bring it to the attention of SoE you let the ranters of other classes do that.<br />
<br />
Yes from what ive read the spell was overpowering on pets but hey *** thats Sonys problem to sort out not the Shaman communitys.<br />
<br />
Blazz you keep saying Shaman got rewarded in OoW.<br />
Personally i think that is bollocks.<br />
The content made Shaman good again but i in no way believe that the content was put in for the benefit of Shaman.<br />
Shaman as a class got no more than any other class out of OoW.<br />
<br />
What you actually hoped to accomplish by posting this &quot;leaving for a week&quot; thread i honestly do not know.<br />
If you were hoping to garner support for yourself i fear you made a drastic error as all you now look like is the kid who cant have it his own way so takes all his toys home.<br />

------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Crystal ball conspiracy theory time.<br />
<br />
I would not be at all suprised if Panther goes on live with say a 15 sec recast time.<br />
SoE will now see how outraged the Shaman community is with the 30 sec recast time but will on no way actually give you what you want.(well ill be buggered if they do anyway).<br />
<br />
People will still be outraged at the 15 sec recast time but then you'll get people posting facts and figures on here showing how it can still be used etc etc and in the end the Shaman community (ie The Crucible) will eventually give in and say &quot;well we can live with that&quot; just like it always does.<br />
<br />
See this thread for the sort of thing i mean.<br />

So Sony will still have butt****ed you but you will have lubed yourself up for them 1st.<br />

You know what doesnt suprise me.<br />

they announce this super nerf and let us howl about it for a few days, then announce that they are only going to do the one part of the nerf that they had originally told us about and we all start kissing their feet in gratitude that we took a size 6 up the ass instead of a size 12.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Alphar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The only problem I ever saw with Blazz and his posts, other than disagreeing with them, is anyone not agreeing with his point of view is labeled as &quot;an idiot&quot; in his eyes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Love how everyone suddenly has an opinion when a back is turned and from a nice safe distance. Blazz has a view point that sometimes I agree'd with, and sometimes I don't. I will however give him far more credit than people who will rather than discuss the facts and back them up, turn around and label him a fanboi, because of it. More often than not, that's when Blazz's label of &quot;idiot&quot; came out, and most often justly deserved.<br />
<br />
Wastrel da Leezurd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Heh, he had a great post on the EQ live forums :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">It was an ok post, except he still states that a recast time being added to panther is acceptable, despite a poll here that has results to the contrary.... but hey, who cares about putting a consolidated viewpoint across when you can just post on behalf of all shaman.<br />
<br />
I've got nothing against Blazz, and it's natural for people with opposing opinions to clash now and then.... but when faced with a large amount of dissenting opinion it might be a good idea to take a step back and think about why it's happening, and why it might be a good idea to tone it down.... rather than throwing all ones toys from the pram.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Me ?.<br />
<br />
Certainly not lording it.<br />
<br />
If it wasnt for real life id still be playing.<br />
<br />
Id be posting ranting and raving about the nerf.<br />
<br />
Sadly even after the nerf id still be playing a Shaman.<br />
<br />
5-6 years i played a Shaman its quite hard to get it out your system.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">My apologies Wulfbane, I misunderstood your reasons for leaving EQ.... far too many bitter ex-players around, I wrongly put you in that bucket.. :)</div></div><hr />
