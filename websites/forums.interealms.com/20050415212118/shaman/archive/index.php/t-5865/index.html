<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Armak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After todays patch I cant play, I log on and everything is fine (only tried the Bazaar, so far) after a few min the comp locks up.<br />
<br />
Seems that after todays patch my computers uses up all availble power. <br />
comp 1<br />
OS: Win ME<br />
Intel 3 1,6mhz<br />
256 mg RAM<br />
GeForce 2 MX 64mg<br />
<br />
Comp 2<br />
OS: Win XP Pro<br />
AMD Thunderbird 1,4mhz - 256mhz bus<br />
512 mg RAM<br />
GeForce 4 Ti 4200 128mg - Denator latest WHQL driver<br />
<br />
Got T1 connection<br />
<br />
Now they been working fine before the patch. Can it have something to do with the new spell effects? Anyone else having the same problem?<br />
<br />
Seems strange that both of the comps would behave the same way when they got very different configuration in HW<br />
<br />
Hmm I upgraded both my OS today, the normal way, get a anounsment that upgrade exists and installs it. Never been a problem before.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Regards<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Reeannon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There are major problems arising from this patch.  Namely, lock ups and 1018 active char bugs.<br />
<br />
The lock ups seem to be directly related to links from anyplace<br />
/auction, /gu, /tell, /ooc, etc.<br />
<br />
I went to SONY tech help and they are aware of the lock ups and activie char bugs and are working on fixing the problems.<br />
<br />
In EQ general chat a guide stated that there will be an emergency patch either tonight or earlier tomorrow.</div></div><hr />
