<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kEMAN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I would like to get my shman the Kylong Darkmail waist and gloves from Veksar since the pair would run me about 50K in bazaar.  I have a good map of how to get to the chef camp and the highborns are right in the same area.  My 3 man group will be 65 mage, 57 shaman and 55 cleric, do you guys think that is enough to get to the camp and handle it.  My plan is to get my mage some IVU potions, run him to an safe area around that area and CoTh them down to him.  Has anyone don ethis camp before: how hard is it and how rare is that Waist item?  Next highborns , from what i have read all highborns have a chance of dropping the gauntlets.  They do not look to hard for this group but if one of the named highborns spawn at level 63 might be a problem.  So pretty much i'm looking for any info/hel;p/tips for these 2 camps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Spite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">With invis, ivu and lull, you can get pretty much anywhere, and single pull anything.  It may take a bit of experimentation and experience to know how individual mobs behave.<br />
<br />
Some mobs like to fear, so be sure to keep your MR high.  <br />
<br />
Chef isn't a bad area to hunt.  Depending upon how fast you clear things, there are a number of named spots you can also clear nearby.<br />
<br />
I don't know how well a 65 mage pet would be able to get and keep aggro, but it should be able to manage the chef area fine.  Some of the highborns are higher level, 62-ish, and are quite smacky.  <br />
<br />
I know some necros can solo almost anything in the zone (other than the triggered dragon), so a group of three should be able to handle chef and highborns too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>umpaa_the_prophet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This is my main farming spot so I'll give you some info. I dou it with a 65 shaman and 58 wiz. I could solo this spot but I do have Q and bane. Anyway, the whole camp is single pullable at 65 so the pulls shouldn't be an issue. There are two types of mobs at the chef camp. Revenants which are warrior mobs and cooks which are SK's. If you are outside the camp in the hall with the chef on your left, then behind you is a wall. The chef is in the room on the left up the stair on the right. His placeholder is a revenant.The wall behind you is a safe camp to pull to. On your right there is another room that has two mobs in it which are  hand mobs or wraiths which are also warrior type mobs. In the room on the right, there is a hall on the back wall left side. Up this hallway and to the left is another room with another mob that is the placeholder for the undead slavemaster. The placeholder is a revenant.<br />
<br />
So here's what I do:<br />
1) Look into the chef's room and see what mobs are there. If any of them are cooks then you need to be wary since they will fear you and this sticks to my 65 shaman with 125 MR about once in three.<br />
2) Pull the revants out of the camp one by one. I use my pet to tank this camp so a mage pet should hold agro fine.<br />
3) When you get a cook, now you'll need to clear the left hand mob in the right room and slavemaster PH. When you pull the cook he will HT for about 950 so get your buffs on. Once the pet has agro or if you see the cook casting fear, get your butt up against the wall on the side near the chef room. Standing here your path will take you up toward the slave master camp. Since you cleared it, when fear wears off you can just walk back to the camp. The cook will fear the 1st PC on it's agro list and will not fear the pet. You should make sure that your mage is 2nd on the agro list under your pet as the highest level toon is most likely to resist fear. If you are not in the corner when feared you may path striaght out instead of to the right. There are two wanderers straight ahead. A couple of things to remember: 1)remove sow at the camp (running around feared with sow = bad times) and 2)you will not aggro mobs while feared only when it wears off. So if you get feared and then it wears off, as long as you are out of agro range you can invis/ivu and run back to camp.<br />
4) The chef spot is hard to pull since you can't cast on him (no line of sight). The only way I've been able to agro him is proximity which means you're gonna get hit. The chef is just another warrior mob but is level 60 I believe (yellow to 58).<br />
<br />
There are 3 mobs plus the chef/PH in the chef's room. One at the door and two at the back right and left. You do not have to pull the mob on the left as it will not agro while you pull to the chef. The waist is the rare drop and I've gotten 2 (one last night woot!) for about 7 of the knifes (which are might nice rogue pokers btw). The hands in the room on the right rarely drop the band of twilight (AE 3). <br />
<br />
I have never fought the highborns but the are supposed to be like the cooks except harder from what I've heard. Try your luck with the cooks first and see how you do. It seems like you should be able to pull high borns to the chef camp by going past the chef room and down the hallway to the left. It might be kind of a long pull but experimenting with fear pathing is not my favorite past time. There is a roaming hand in that hallway.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps and good hunting!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Korman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've done this solo as a 61 shaman.  By judicious use of Invis and IVU potions you can get to the highborn area by the fountain without aggro.  I only stopped there becasue I wanted to summon a pet.  I could have gotten all the way to the camp room itself if I had wanted to.<br />
<br />
I summoned my pet at the highborns; buffed him as best I could, gave him mage summoned pet-gear.  The highborns have such a small aggro radius, you can walk across the steps and take a left towards to chef camp without aggroing anything.<br />
<br />
Once you take a left, there is a roamer that paths up and down that street/path.  It is usually a Cursed Hand, but occasionally pops as something else.  I kill it right there in the street.  With an alpha'd pet (with mage gear no less), epic dot, and torpor, it was never a problem.<br />
<br />
Take the next right into a short alley with entrances on both sides.  To the right is where you want to go.  The first mob is a Cook.  Like was said earlier, he's an SK, so buff up your MR for his fear!  Luckily, everytime he's feared me, I've had Torpor on me!   :cool: <br />
<br />
I always fought him right at his spawn spot, being very careful to keep him close there.  Pushing him into the corner worked well for me.  I tanked him every time (5 so far), and pretty much kept Torpor active the whole fight.<br />
<br />
After he's dead, you can slide by the revenant closest to the stairs without aggro.  I have done it 3 times so far.  Once I was on the stairs, I just rushed the room at the top and ran straight to a corner to help channel slow as the PH revenant attacked me.<br />
<br />
I'm sure you already know this, but don't bother with Poison or disease spells when fighting undead in Veksar.  Poison/Disease work well on goblins, golems and hands.<br />
<br />
I camped that little room where the undead chef spawns through a total of 23 spawns.  I got the Undead chef once.  He dropped Gomdurig (nice dagger with +5% backstab mod), but no darkmail for me!<br />
<br />
Spawn time is 17 min 30 sec.  Loot sucks except for the special drops, only 3-6 plat otherwise).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>kEMAN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Damn one out of 23 spawned a named.  That is 6.5 hours of play time, i could probably farm enough acrylia from AC to buy the damn things =).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">completely off-tpoic but i bet your annoyed that when you made your account and had caps lock while typing your user name :p.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">completely off-tpoic but i bet your annoyed that when you made your account and had caps lock while typing your user name :p.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Blaorfi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just a quick question.<br />
<br />
Do you root dot these.  As I tried to just c what the mobs are like and I had to nuke them as they seemed to resist all my dots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Completely off-topic but i bet you're annoyed that when you posted that comment you did it twice :p<br />
<br />
Root dot works fine there if you prefer but, as has been said already, bag the poison and disease dots. You're looking at Bane and Ana if you want to go that route.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>VXThis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I farm the chef quite a bit solo (trying to sell 2 gomdurigs at the moment) at 62.  Having a partner or more makes it quite a bit easier.<br />
<br />
The only problem I run into is when slow bounces, which it sometimes does after Malo... Usually, if I remember, I begin the fight with torpor on me and pet to add a bit more survivability.<br />
<br />
Once slowed, he's easy with Torpor.  I don't have the LDoN dots yet, but between epic clicky and ice nukes I can kill him fairly easily.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Namurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yeah always malo/s the chef first.  I've died due to thinking &quot;ah hell, 3-4 tries and one slow is bound to land&quot; - he's quite resistant.  Gomdurig is the common drop, might be better off buying the belt in the bazaar if you're here just for that, especially if you're solo, especially if you don't have LDoN or have it but don't have Bane/Anathema yet.</div></div><hr />
