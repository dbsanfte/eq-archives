<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I've been hanging out in Hollowshade quite a bit lately (can't you tell from my profile? :) ) and am just wondering about this war that keeps going on. <br />
<br />
How do you start it?<br />
<br />
Once it's started, how do help a side win the war?<br />
<br />
Once the war is over - how long does the winning race control the zone?<br />
<br />
Would really appreciate any information anyone might have!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I was looking into this to try to flummox the Grimlings into giving land over to wolves, so I can harvest more substances.  <br />
<br />
I believe it's started whenever one of the chiefs (or possibly a PH for them) is killed.   It may be random, though.  People are sharply divided on this.<br />
<br />
One of the other 2 camps will send some invaders, and some &quot;defenders&quot; will spawn.  Defenders seem permarooted, and are summoning beasties.  Defenders will win unless players take them down.  To help the invaders win, kill the Defenders.<br />
<br />
Eventually, one camp will win all 3 locations (owlbear caves, sonic wolf caves, grimling camp).  This will despawn the Vah Shir near Shar Vahl and respawn a named leader of the apprpriate type near the city.  Killing him resets the zone.  The leader has decent loot, but his corpse will despawn in about 20 seconds (supposedly to get a rez) so there's no time to look and discuss.  Much of it is nodrop.<br />
<br />
This zone is frequently bugged, most notably when the Grimlings own all 3 camps.   GMs are as consistant as always when asked to help.  Some will, some wont, and some will be arses about even asking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Cool thanks for the reply.<br />
<br />
Hmm, I have killed the Grimling chieftan multiple, multiple times and the war did not start so maybe there is something else you need to do.<br />
<br />
Oh and here is handy little bit of info (I don't know why I'm going to post this but wth) - when the grimlings win the war or take over the owlbear caves, some of thier spawns are insta re-pop.  Last week the war was bugged and grimlings owned the zone, so I went into the owlbear cave and farmed acrylia ore like there was no tomorrow.  Very very easy to get ore when the zone is bugged like this - I must have made over 5k in just a few days =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>jurassic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not sure what starts it if it isn't started - maybe if you kill all the named up in each camp?<br />
<br />
And yes there is an issue with looting the body - I /buged that and got into a fight with a GM over it.  Killing the prince causes the zone to reset in about 30 secs - this causes the body to poof even though the con on the body is 7 mins. <br />
<br />
It seems to me that killing the named starts the next phase of the war.  And that killing defenders is the way to make your invading team win.<br />
<br />
Good luck on it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Coralis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hi All,<br />
<br />
I don't post very much here, but here goes..<br />
<br />
As far as I understand it, the war is triggered by someone completing the Sonic Wolfbane spear quest.  This quest requires foraged and dropped items to be combined by each of the 5 Vah Shir classes.  Each class completes their part and then has to trade with the other classes for the other relevent items.  All the items can then be combined into the spear.<br />
<br />
After this, there is an NPC in the caves in HS near the Grimling Forest zone.  You can talk to him, and AFAIK, this begins the war.<br />
<br />
Other than that, I think what goes on is as Shandy put it.  You have to help one side to win the war, and this then spawns a named mob in the Vah Shir outpost.  You have to kill him, and then the war should reset.  It can be very buggy if things aren't done properly, leading to one side controlling the entire zone and none of the other sides spawning until a server reset.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps!<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>jraven1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I can *guarantee* you that the Sonic wolfbane quest has no effect on the war. I've spent many, many hours in the zone, and there is no way that monster of a quest was completed as often as the war happened. <br />
<br />
2 or 3 times an hour, either the East, West or South camp of monsters will send out an invading party towards on of their enemies camps. This is plainly indicated in a zone-wide emote. It'll say something like &quot;The grimlings in the south gnash their teeth in preparation for war. The Owlbears in the West stare silently south&quot; or something like that. That tells you that the Grimlings are marching on the Owlbear caves, and if you want the grimlings to take over the zone, you need to help them take out the Owlbear defenders (or do it yourself). Once a single faction controls all 3 spots, the Vah Shir fort is taken over by that faction until someone kills the boss in the fort.<br />
<br />
I've gone for an hour killing turtles on my BL being the only one in the zone and seen several invasions start. I'm almost positive that there is NO trigger and that it is just a random event.</div></div><hr />
