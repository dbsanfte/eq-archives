<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sumadra Jacke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So we have to go from 29 to 51 without a new heal?  Isnt there any other heal I can use to 51?  Clicky....ANYTHING?  Oh this is gonna suck....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">the funny thing is at 51 when you get superior heal, it heals 583 hitpoints. You might not know that but that's jack crap especially when compared to PoP mobs. Chloroblast occasionally can keep a tank alive if the Cleric times his/her CH wrong, but basically the shaman's healing ability is worth absolutely nothing after 29 until Kraggs mending at 58.<br />
<br />
But my point is that basically after the early levels anyone, including yourself, who thinks you will make a good backup healer is making a fatal mistake (literally). Your job after the 30's is solely to slow the mobs and make the job easier for the cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sumadra Jacke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well...my concern is this.  I have started duoing with a mage and we both hit 30 tonight.  What is the strategy after say 40ish when the mobs will really start to chew at the mages pet?  Slow/debuff AND heal?  Thats gonna tap my mana pool big time then.  Guess thats where my ikky bp and cannidancing along with KEI comes into play....<br />
<br />
Thanks for the post...does any of the JB stuff give us any mana free heals like the Donal's does?  Or any item you can suggest to help me out with the duo scenario...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yep, until Kragg's Mending, healing only gets harder and harder. I was 58+ when PoP came out, so I never tried to get by healing there with Sup Heal/chloroblast. I often played healer in the old world zones and could get by, even though it was taxing (slowing/maloXing if needed/buffing AND healing). If you're going to be duoing with a mage, you may be okay for now, depending on where you're fighting, but healing will only get harder. Remember, the mage will also have some &quot;pet healing&quot; spell. It's not as powerful as your heals, but every little bit helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ok, not having decent heal spells for MANY levels does bite, but you can still heal in some situations.<br />
<br />
I OFTEN play the group healer in guild exp. groups.  The key is to know your limitations--many places require a cleric as main healer.  In my 50's I've been main healer in Burining Woods, Chardok, OS, Tene. Mtns (hunting named vamps) and many more reg. exp. group situations.<br />
<br />
Long as you are not chain pulling (I mean literally NO breaks), you not fighting red mobs, and not fighting +50 summoning mobs with 30K or more hitpoints who rampage, etc..., you can often (with care) be group healer.  Not in the PoP zones though......<br />
