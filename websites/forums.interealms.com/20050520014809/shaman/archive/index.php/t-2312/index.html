<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Epyx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone know if affliction works on the Necro Splurt spell?<br />
<br />
If so that should turn it into a 2k dot for them.<br />
<br />
Also do focus effects work on items like Spear of Fate?<br />
<br />
Would be nice for Curse of Spirits to do 2k as well ;)</div></div><hr />

It adds pulses to the dot at the START of the dot... pulses that HEAL.<br />

I'm sorry but I can't help laughing at this. It's just too perfect of a screw up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">As far as I know no focus items work on item clicks.<br />
<br />
I have an Afflicition spell haste item and it does not affect the casting time of the epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Graal the Dorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I was playing my wife's shaman last night. She has a shadel bandit ring which has the buff duration focus effect.<br />
<br />
Her sow boots were affected by the focus effect, but no other items.<br />
<br />
I have a shadel ring on my paladin too. When using my deepwater boots to cast endure magic, the focus effect kicked in. It did nothing for 8th dain ring, or right click aura of battle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Duffe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">shadel ring works on ultravision effect from wolfcallers bracer, but not for bramblecoat from jbbp, go figure. also sow boots were effected by the ring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">cool.<br />
<br />
Shadel Bandit Ring effect has been changed to summoning spell haste 2 now, I read, but last night it did not work on my RH from Wolfcaller BP.  Interesting to note that it did in fact work for some items though.  Thanks for the info guys.<br />
<br />
Epic wasn't affected by the Affliction spell haste last night, I can check it again today.</div></div><hr />

That reminds me when they screwed up the shaman epic.  Bobo the VI programming monkey is hard at work again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Duffe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">shadel ring was changed to a crappy summoning effect? boo. gotta sell it now.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>smashie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">anybody know if the extended enhancement III items are working with group spells? didn't seem to kick in for me while casting group buffs before the bandit ring was changed to the crappy summoning focus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ciele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Extended Enhancement III wasn't working for any group spells for me either.   I'll check again when I get home tonight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It would seem unplausible to have focus items affect item effects.  How can you even determine the level of the spell being cast on the item? Is it the level of the user?  The level of the real spell? If so what about effects that dont exist as regular spells?</div></div><hr />
