<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>lightus_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok we were doing sarynn the other day and another shaman casted crippled, but it didnt take hold not resisted , i was just thinking what the hell, since when did another class get a better debuff then us ?<br />
Im not sure what class cast the debuff, i was just wondering if you have tried that before also ?<br />
<br />
btw very nice board</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">if he was lower level than the one who casted it first, then yes it didn t take hold, like slow works</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>lightus_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">cant really be that since all the shamans in the guild are about<br />
65 and 150AA+</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>FVDladian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Were all buff slots on the mob full?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have seen the same effect on some mobs in SolB when I PLed a friend a bit. Tryed to cripple them but got the message that it wouldn't hold. Looks like a low level buff is blocking cripple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Believe it or not, I actually got the same thing happen to me with turgur's the other day. Immediately after that, I landed a dot on him, so no, his buff slots were not full. Note: I am 65</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The 30 buff slots are full.<br />
What kind of effects can you see up there?<br />
Malos<br />
Tash<br />
Cripple<br />
Slow<br />
SK resist debuff<br />
HOS<br />
Mark of Karn type spell<br />
Mark of whatever that other one is<br />
Druid Eci debuff<br />
Druid Ro debuff<br />
Snare<br />
<br />
Plus every dot that someone casts takes up an icon slot.<br />
The necros in my guild can each sustain about 3-4 dots on a boss mob.<br />
Shaman can stick Bane and Blood without aggro for the most part.<br />
If your guild is flagged for PoFire, then most likely all your knights and some warriors will have a weapon that procs boil blood.<br />
Druids have various dots to cast too.<br />
<br />
It's not hard to fill up the 30 buff list.<br />
With all the dots up there, it's quite possible something just wore off.<br />
Bards songs are also wearing off quick enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well due to that and mez factors, no one is allowed DOT weapons on raids in my guild. It's quite easy to fill up the debuff slots on a raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Believe it or not, I actually got the same thing happen to me with turgur's the other day. Immediately after that, I landed a dot on him, so no, his buff slots were not full.<br />
<br />
Possible a dot wore off the mob just before your dot landed?  Or was this a 1-group situation?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thorman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Someone mentioned a solB mob,while PL'ing someone else.I doubt 30 buffs were filled while doing that.<br />
<br />
/shrug it never happened to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>archi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It's more than likely Extended buff Issue.<br />
<br />
That's why sometimes if you have a buff on you, and someone casts the same buff have on, the buff won't hold.  Due to extended buff issue.<br />
<br />
That's why Enchanters always asks party or raid members to remove previous Clarity buffs.  If the Clarity was buff by other than current one that is casting, there are chances that the buff will not hold.<br />
<br />
I am not sure if that's the case on the debuff or not but...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>bakkal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">There is a rogue poison that decreases dex on a mob and wears off frequently. I've had this issue with rogues when attempting to slow or use cripple as I believe it has both a dex decrease and a &quot;slow proc&quot;  The thoughts above are possible, but I'd check with your rogues and what poisons they are using.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The dex debuff proc'd by melee under the influence of the bard song Katta's Song of Sword Dancing might have a stacking issue with Cripple.  Both effects have a dex debuff in slot 1, and the proc effect doesn't occupy the song box, so it could conflict.  I'm not sure if the amount of the dex debuff is affected by the bard's percussion modifier, but if it is, it could equal or exceed Cripple's dex debuff if the bard is using Puretone or has a decent drum equipped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Had the same problem on Tmax last night, cripple was not taking hold for any of us and the fight hadn't been going on long enough for his debuff slots to be full. <br />
<br />
I think something is blocking cripple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Had the same problem on Dain last night.  It was intermittent though.  Sometimes cripple would land.  Sometimes I would get the &quot;did not take hold&quot; type message.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Saarlyndara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Was there a druid around?  <br />
<br />
I had this same problem, and started buggin' people about who was castin' whot.  Not because it really mattered, I was lookin' ta use cripple to take agro over mezzin' chanters.  But our MA was doin' fine gettin' agro afore breakin' mez.  Just got me curious.<br />
<br />
Turns out a druid was usin' one of the Ro spells that was blockin' cripple.  She said it was primarily a fire save debuff, but Lucy shows it has an AC component also.  Also shows that none of the AC debuffs are more than whot our Cripple should be doin'.  <br />
<br />
But fact is when she casts that spell Cripple doesn't take hold.  When it really does matter I'll ask our druids not to Ro.  This would also explain why some shaman have intermittent results with cripple, it don't work if a druid cast thier thing, it does work when they don't.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Our druids have always used their debuffs on raids, but before I took a few weeks off I never had a problem with cripple bouncing when I cast it (which honestly wasn't too often since our chanters usually do this). <br />
<br />
This a new issue then with the Ro line?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>archi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Spells not holding on the mob was an issue way back from Velious far as I could remember.<br />
<br />
While playing with same classes or other classes that shares same spells.<br />
Like Cripple or Turgur's or Malosini.<br />
There was always a chance of your spell being rejected or not holding when someone else beat you to it on the mob.<br />
<br />
Can't exactly remember how one spell will override the other one or rejected due the spell was already present on the mob.<br />
<br />
Like I said this was always been like this from Velious days as far as I can remember or could be further back.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Reysa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I have seen this happen with cacti in PoStorms. I'll cast cripple and it will not take hold.<br />
<br />
I duo with a magician and we are frequently the only people in the zone. She pulls with malosinia then I cast slow and cripple. Her pet usually has summoned weapons (which have a DD proc) and it is smacking the cactus before my slow lands. She always uses the 61 air pet for those fights.<br />
<br />
It doesn't happen every time. I don't understand why it happens at all. Very odd. Lately, I don't bother with cripple, and just cast the rain for damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>lightus_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Thanks all for the reply ill try to do some testing with otgher debuff classes, if i find anything ill report back.<br />
But anyways its good to know im not the only one having this problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">crippling claudation and cessation of cor (2 necro spells) also block cripple</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>starkje</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I've had cripple no-holds on frogs in sebilis, back in the days... dunno if that still is the case, but could be. I think it was shaman frogs that gave the msg. Must be a buff that blocks it.<br />
<br />
Could also be what others have posted here, the maximum debuff slots on NPCs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Believe it or not, I actually got the same thing happen to me with turgur's the other day. Immediately after that, I landed a dot on him, so no, his buff slots were not full. Note: I am 65<br />
<br />
Actualy, that mihgt mean someones DoT or debuff wore off. Odds are that his debuff/DoTs count were filled up is all, happens all the time in VT when mobs take forever to kill and everyone has a chance to land something.<br />
<br />
<br />
Remember, DoTs and Debuffs are all counted together.</div></div><hr />
