&lt;B&gt;A tremor in the underpants. The last time I felt this was in the presence of my old master. <br />
<br />
You are unwise to lower your underpants. <br />
<br />
We've got to be able to get some reading on those underpants, up or down. <br />
<br />
She must have hidden the plans in her underpants. Send a detachment down to retrieve them. See to it personally Commander. <br />
<br />
These underpants may not look like much, kid, but they've got it where it counts. <br />
<br />
I find your lack of underpants disturbing. <br />
<br />
These underpants contain the ultimate power in the universe. I suggest we use it. <br />
<br />
Han will have those underpants down. We've got to give him more time! <br />
<br />
General Veers, prepare your underpants for a surface assault. <br />
<br />
I used to bulls-eye womp-rats in my underpants back home. <br />
<br />
TK-421. . . Why aren't you in your underpants? <br />
<br />
Lock the door. And hope they don't have underpants. <br />
<br />
Governor Tarkin. I should've recognised your foul underpants when I was brought on board. <br />
<br />
You look strong enough to pull the underpants off of a Gundark. <br />
<br />
Luke*Help me take*these underpants off. <br />
<br />
Great, Chewie, great. Always thinking with your underpants. <br />
<br />
That blast came from those underpants. That thing's operational! <br />
<br />
Don't worry. Chewie and I have gotten into a lot of underpants more heavily guarded than this. <br />
<br />
Maybe you'd like it back in your underpants, your highness. <br />
<br />
Your underpants betray you. Yours feelings for them are strong. Especially one. Your sister! <br />
<br />
Jabba doesn't have time for smugglers who drop their underpants at the first sign of an Imperial Cruiser. <br />
<br />
Yeah, well short underpants is better than no underpants at all, Chewie. <br />
<br />
Attention. This is Lando Calrissean. The Empire has taken control of my underpants, I advise everyone to leave before more troops arrive. <br />
<br />
I cannot teach him. The boy has no underpants. <br />
<br />
You came in those underpants? You're braver than I thought. <br />
