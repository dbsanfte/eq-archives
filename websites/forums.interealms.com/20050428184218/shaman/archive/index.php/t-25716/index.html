<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ashes is moving from a US server to a European server and as such we have (limited) room for new members. <br />
<br />
Our core has been together since our days in Everquest and us such we value personality just as much as playing skills. We will be playing on an English PvE server (the name of the server will be announced as soon as we know a name list)<br />
<br />
For more information please visit our board (our website is currently down to convert it from a horde design to an alliance design) at:<br />
http://www.ashesguild.org/forums/index.php?showtopic=368<br />
<br />
For a small introduction feel free to download our video from: http://www.overdark.com/vid/ashes1.zip<br />
(this is a video from our horde days so dont be suprised to see orcs and taurens running over your screen)<br />
<br />
If you are interested leave your application at our board or you can come and visit me as Stygiana on En final beta 18 (alliance)<br />

PS if this is the wrong forum I am sorry and feel free to move this topic to the correct one</div></div><hr />
