<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Upcoming for August 26th, 2003<br />
<br />
Plane of Mischief changes going to the Legends.  The Plane of Mischief, home of the trickster Bristlebane, has undergone an extensive revamp.  As one of the most unusual places to visit in EverQuest, this zone will be a very interesting challenge, if you have a sturdy funny bone.<br />
<br />
Partial Zone Revamps coming to all servers.  These changes are not as dramatic as those made to the Plane of Mischief, but they are great improvements to these zones that needed only a little modification to make them much better.  The zones we'll be updating this week are: The Deep, Charasis (Howling Stones), Dragon Necropolis, Siren's Grotto, The Hole, The City of Mist, The Accursed Temple of Cazic-Thule and Velketor's Labyrinth.  Gameplay in these zones has been improved, based on feedback from players and careful review of the content.<br />
<br />
New filters and chat message options will be added.  We will be separating pet melee messages into their own category.  You will be able to send them to whichever chat window you want, or filter them out completely in the Options window.  We have also added the ability to send /random messages to any chat window you'd like.  There is no option to filter these messages, however, to prevent any loss of the information in cases where it is needed.<br />
<br />
Memorizing spell sets.  We will be adding /memspellset # to make memorizing spells a bit less bothersome.  Using this command will memorize one of your saved spell sets.  # is the number or name (or shortened name) of the spell set you wish to memorize.  Note that if you use a shortened version of the spell set name, it will match the first spell set that has those characters, so /memspellset Dots will find your &quot;Dots and Charms&quot;, or &quot;Dots&quot;, or &quot;Dotsandstuff&quot; - whichever shows up first on your list.<br />
<br />
Shared Bank gains a Plat slot.  We will be adding a Platinum slot to the shared bank to make transactions between characters on the same account more convenient.<br />
<br />
Rain Spells can be deadly.  Rain Spells have been resisted 100% of the time when an NPC was above level 20 and had less than 10% of its hit points left.  We will be removing this restriction.<br />
<br />
Also, as a heads up to players that have created their own user interfaces for EverQuest, these are the interface files that we expect to change next week.<br />

======================================================<br />
<br />
About time they finally do something about rain spells, that'll provide a real nice boost.  In fast killing groups, sometimes it's nice to toss one, but you can be often assured of the 3rd wave not landing.<br />
<br />
Also a little worried about the changes to those zones.  CT was a great zone pre-PoP, it really needs a ZEM or mob level boost.  That and remove those damn AE'ing rain/slow mobs.  I always liked HS too, if it's a viable 60+ spot I'll be pretty impressed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Callir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Looking forward to the rain changes, as well. I really hope they don't screw up any of those zones as I really enjoy all of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">woot.. love the rain changes.  Just kinda annoying to have to mem another spell when the mob gets that low just cause you can't hit him with it under 10%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sounds good. HS should get some sort of graveyard with no or very little exp loss and a PoK stone. Just make it real long duration before corpse pops there.</div></div><hr />

How bout the book in OT? Only like 30 seconds away. Now a book for DN would be nice.</div></div><hr />

Finally!<br />
I like the look of these changes, the changes that have been recently done have made the game much more fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">im a lil worried about the CoM revamp, that zone was about perfect. A shaman spends most of his epic hunt there and before he could do it solo around 46ish. Though i cant deny as a 65 that i want to be able to go back there and quietly hunt as i did many moons ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bamce ConstaCani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">another nice patch, little worried about the ct revamp again, was a nice zone from what i remember, nice little farm spot.  i really love the finally added the pet spam.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Changes to PoM going to legends and from what I've read on test the zone might actually be worth visiting when they go live. I spent some time there in the current zone and didn't like it at all even though I know some are just fanatical about it. <br />
<br />
The rain changes are perfect, only reason I don't use them very much finally getting fixed.<br />
<br />
Would be fun if CoM becomes huntable at 65. I really love that zone, spent a good part of my lower 50's there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Merwenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I thought CoM was/is pretty boring, and am glad they are doing something to change it (besides killing about 15 reavers in a row). Maybe I'll actually finish my epic while visiting it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">HS should get ... a PoK stone.<br />
<br />
this is THE single laziest comment i've ever read...<br />
<br />
and exp loss is tied to level and such and isnt less in some zones than others...<br />
<br />
Although the graveyard wouldnt be too bad an idea, but that can be said of any dungeon.  Of course they could just make everyone spawn at bind with gear intact (beyond newbie levels) and leave the corpse for rezzing purposes, but i dont see either of these happening.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">PoM still going to require a death run through NToV to get to it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Okotona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Better not GODDAMMITALLTOHELL!!!<br />
<br />
Err... Ahem...<br />
<br />
'Scuse me...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Someone posted on the cleric board that the entrance to PoM on test is currently located in GD. Whether this is just for testing or is a permanent change we'll see when it goes to legends I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">That'll be nice, I bound in PoM for a long, long time but just never got enough interest to hunt there in groups or time to do it myself, so I rebound a while ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>FloppyDisks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I hope they keep the level range of CoM the same and just up the spawn rate and maybe add some loot with focus items for the appropriate level range.<br />
<br />
Something I really want them to do for it though is FIX Neh Ashiir's key so it is not no rent and it actually works to open the doors.<br />
<br />
I can't tell you the number of times that we had to sit around forever waiting on a rogue to show up so we could continue on our way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">PoM is a pretty small zone.  I dont see how it will handle the amount of peolpe headed there, especially with a entrance in GD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">good changes for the shaman class .. rains are big .. that whole permaresist thing was getting old ... shared PP is good too... a billion edits to UI files isn't so good .. :( .. but i'll hack away at it :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Zarlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Cant go wrong with new content, just hope they dont mess with the npc's needed for the 7th and 8th cudgels in HS, just got my potion of swirling liquid done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">The beauty of PoM is that it is completely different from any other zone.  It is almost completely nonagro, so you can explore freely with just a little care to avoid a couple places.  There are absolutely no trains.  Getting anything worthwhile requires completing *gasp* quests.  It is equally fun for a group or for soloers.  And because it's so hard to reach, it's very rarely crowded.  People there are super friendly and helpful, because the isolation makes you a little more dependant.  I've had people come out to see if my camp was open, and when they found me they buffed me and went off to find something else.  No ksing and no whining.  No waiting lists for camps.  No other zone has its own message boards and serverwide chat channel.  PoM inspires community like nowhere else.  <br />
<br />
If it goes Live the same as it is on Test, it'll just be another zone that will get pharmed for phat l3wtz and then abandoned.  <br />
<br />
I just wish I'd gotten there sooner to enjoy it more. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Dissonant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Yeah I'm not a huge fan of the PoM changes.  I wouldn't mind them so much if they hadn't moved the zone-in.  The ToV death run pretty much ensured that you wouldn't be getting random retards into the zone.<br />
<br />
I was bound up there for almost an entire year, so it holds a sentimental place in my heart... /sniff...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I don't think they'd move the whole zone to GD, but who knows.  Test has a pretty low population, so it'd be a lot harder to get people to test it if they had to follow someone though NToV to do so.  Putting it there makes it available for testing so it can get some use.<br />
<br />
It does need moved out of the back of ToV though, if they ever want it to get some actual use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Something I really want them to do for it though is FIX Neh Ashiir's key so it is not no rent and it actually works to open the doors.<br />
<br />
Neh Ashir's key has always worked - it's not a key for the front door, but for the elevator.<br />
<br />
I agree that it being norent is a bit odd though.</div></div><hr />
