<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>rooknight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've finally finished all my combines for this one hell of a long quest.  Looks like the final battle requires about 3 groups with an enc and FD'r recommended.  below i've posted info from eqtraders but would appreciate any information from those that have done this battle before.  The time for this is approximate and will need to work around spawn time and guild activities.  Hope to see ya'll there and thank you.<br />
<br />
General Bragmur: You will find him to start the action bit at -3400, 9000 in Iceclad. His respawn is about 4 hours in case you happen to catch him shortly after someone else has killed him or completed the quest. (He is not triggered by your conversation with the Dain.) Your mission is to travel across Iceclad with him, fighting off special wolves and giants that will ambush you along the way. There are numerous bugs in his travel that you might encounter and for which you'll want to be prepared. First, he tends to vanish and then reappear a short way back or ahead on the path, sometimes even returning to his spawn point, so you might find a tracker reassuring in case you can't see where the little guy went. Second, you will definitely and absolutely want a feigner who swims well and has enduring breath. The General knows that his orders are to travel a certain path with you but he sometimes likes to interpret those orders creatively. When crossing from one island to the next he may try to go under the ice. If that happens you should have someone agro him and pull him up above ground to where he should be walking. He should then resume his trek appropriately. He does not hit especially hard but with it being underwater you'll want your feigner to be sufficiently sturdy. Your third essential type of crew member is someone who can Memory Blur in case someone accidentally agros him during a fight. You are supposed to be protecting the General, not fighting him. It is possible to bring kos people along but it will cause additional hassles. You need to be sure they understand that they need to stay away from the General as much as possible, and that your chanters keep a close eye for the need to mem blur. <br />
<br />
There is one other issue to watch for as well. When the various wolves and giants spawn, they might be placed such that they all agro on party members and none on the General. If this happens, the General will continue along on his merry way, oblivious to the sudden bloodshed. You must be prepared for this by making sure that at least someone in your party is watching the General and can keep him close until the fight is over. Your feigner and/or Memory Blur person might be good choices here. The General will keep walking as soon as the fight ends so feel free to delay him until your party has a chance to recover. He cannot be charmed in order to buff him. You also cannot agro him and run him to the end of the path without having the fights. He must walk on his own and trigger each attack in order for the Avatar of Brell to appear at the end to grant you your new shawl. <br />
<br />
As you travel, you will encounter five waves of attack from the giants and their wolves, some harder than others. Three coordinated groups of 55+ are required at the very barest minimum. Remember that you will also be agroed by all the green wolves and giants and obnoxious dervishes that you encounter along the way. It might be smart to have a few folks as the designated greenie brigade to help keep them out of everyone else's hair while fighting the real attacks. Please give those nasty dervishes a whack for me while you're at it. You may also wish to walk the path ahead of time through all of the locs indicated below, so that you know where the General should be going and are prepared for each fight. <br />
<br />
First Wave: (-3550, 7550) 4 Kromriff Tracking Wolves spawn and attack. These cannot be charmed, snared or rooted. Stuns should be possible. Some reports say they're mezzable, some say they're immune. They're not terribly difficult. <br />
Second Wave: (-2200, 7250) 4 Frost Giant Skirmishers spawn and attack. They cannot be mezzed. They hit for 178 max I believe and were again easily dispatched. <br />
Third Wave: (-1100, 5950) Commander Kvarid and 3 Frost Giant Skirmishers spawn and attack. (They spawn on the General.) They cannot be stunned, mezzed, rooted or snared. The Frost Giant Skirmishers are 55ish, and Commander Kvarid is 57. <br />
Fourth Wave: (1500, 2250) 5 Kromriff Tracking Wolves spawn and attack. Same rules apply as on the wolves in the first wave. <br />
Fifth Wave: (3700, 2650) Commander Vjorik and 5 Frost Giant Skirmishers spawn and attack. Same rules apply as on the giants in the third wave. <br />
