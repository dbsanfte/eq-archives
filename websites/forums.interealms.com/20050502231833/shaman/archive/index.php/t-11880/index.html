<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Psycotika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ever since the board got changed I can't access it from home. This is really starting to bug me! I can only check at off times at school and I'm missing my fix everyday... At home Im on Win xp behind a linksys router. Both PCs cant get to it for some reason, I just get a 404 error and thats it. If anyone can think of something that may fix this problem that would kick booty  :p Going to go home now and reset my router and see if that works.<br />
<br />
Thanks Guys<br />
