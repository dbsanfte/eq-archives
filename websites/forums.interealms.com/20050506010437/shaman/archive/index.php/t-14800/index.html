<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sharkus Greenfang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">You level through the first 40 levels or so pretty fast and 50-60 is quicker now thanks to PoP so I wonder how alot of people view the pre-AA farming/heavy raiding cycle at the endgame.  When I first started EQ(been here since the start) it was all about grouping and leveling.  Now it seems like it's a rush to get to raiding level.  <br />
<br />
Like this thread at the Graffe board:http://www.graffe.com/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=12<br />
<br />
Does it really matter if things are a bit out of whack pre-60+ or is it really important to keep all the classes reasonably balanced before they reach raid level?  On one hand most of the people I group with are obviously looking ahead to the raiding game and want to get there as soon as possible.  On the other I see some true newbs(they stick out like a sore thumb these days) who are struggling to adapt and keep up with everybody else.  <br />
<br />
I'm hoping LoDN will revive some interest in things other than organizing 30 or more people for raids.  I'd like to be able to login a character at any level and get into the fight of my life without having to farm AA's ad infinitum and wait for 30 people to figure out how to run from CS to WW.  If such a thing is possible I would personally like to see a little more attention paid to keeping every class in line with what they're supposed to do rather than just feeling like the first 50 or so levels are slapped on as a timesink.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The problem with EQ lately is that it's gone more and more to number of characters vs. skill of characters.<br />
<br />
With PoP you can see a lot of unskilled players just showing up on zergfest raids and getting through them and into Tier3 and Tier4 planes with little effort at all.<br />
<br />
Experience now has become meaningless both in character experience/AAs and also 'skill' experience of the person.  All a person has to do now is level to 65 and listen to instructions to be a good zergling and grind AAs so much more easily than pre PoP during non raiding hours.<br />
<br />
Sony added far too much content for the large formations of Zergatrons in PoP than they did for highly skill small groups of people.<br />
<br />
Personally I cannot wait for Lost Dungeons of Norrath.  I really hope they give well deserved rewards for super challenging 1 group encounters.  My friends and I excel at these and I really would like to see us rewarded for that skill.<br />
<br />
As it is right now you get to see people who made their characters a couple months ago join a zergfest and enter Tier 4 zones gaining all kinds of uber loots without really working for it or truly knowing their class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">With PoP you can see a lot of unskilled players just showing up on zergfest raids and getting through them and into Tier3 and Tier4 planes with little effort at all.<br />
Oh ya.  Unskilled people can quite easily zerg their way through Mith Marr, Rydda, Bertox, TZ, RZ, and Sol Ro.  *nod*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Nah, Juujuu. <br />
These encounters have only been beaten by the most skilled guilds in EQ and the fact that you have an average of 4 elemental guilds per server is an excellent proof.<br />
<br />
The only encounters(outside of time) that required some sort of skill were the RZ script and Sigismond. Both weren't *zergproof* either though. <br />
The funny thing is that zerging is actually encouraged and rewarded in the elemental planes. Having a big roster puts you into a position of being able to farm the mini's for incredible upgrades, before others, possibly more skilled guilds, can get the numbers for them.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think the problem with lower levels is the trivialization of most sub-60 content by today's equipment.  Put a newbie shaman in a full set of JB gear or a fungi and nothing till level 30 will touch him.  There are no &quot;fights of a life&quot; anymore if you stay in the level appropriate zones.<br />
On the other hand, the usefullness of a lower level, especially shaman, to a raiding guild is also greatly diminished.  Lets face it, a sub 63 shaman (when he or she can cast wrulans) is useless to a raid force that has a 65.  From that point its good that leveling is so much easier now, you need the level in a game where half the players are 65.<br />
Regarding the need for zerg forces, its a two-sided affair.  We all remember when charm classes could solo BoT tower bosses for VT equivalent loot.  You allow top stuff to drop from one group encounters, and you create the equivalent of the AC all over again.  Deadly boring camps, monopolized by a few.  If you want to keep your players engaged you need to create content that require a lot of players, and since you have a limited number of encounters, you need to get a lot of players into these encounters. Or you need to up spawn rates, something SOE has been reluctant to do for years. The new expansion might change that by creating challenging one group encounters again.  But my guess will be that unless the &quot;adjusted to group strength&quot; AI is very good and uses equipment levels it will be &quot;the trails&quot; all over again, cakewalk for the few on the top with 7000 HP, a struggle for most non-elemental equipped and a &quot;screw this&quot; for those that can't make 5k HP (or 7 k for warriors etc).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree that competent zergers are all that's needed to advance in PoP these days, as long as the guild leadership is good.  The better the players, the fewer the wipes, the faster and less painful the kills.  But everyone ends up in the same place, kiting bajillions of adds around the pit while people kill RZ.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is always one guy in every group that can't live without an agi buff. So I found it easier to just cast it on the raid then fullfilling individual &quot;requests&quot; (aka whines).  And since we usually have 2 mgb shaman, we can do that an be fm before the clerics are ready.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wargbearjumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">There are no Agility buffs in EQ, None... ever, you hear me?<br />

Warg<br />
<br />
I can see why that would be an annoyance.  Far better to have that DI fail, and to do prop heals on the new MT, then rebuff the first MT after he's ressed.  After all, that cha buff does take a lot of mana...<br />
<br />
/boggle<br />
<br />
On top-end encounters (Aten Ha Ra, Zeks, etc) our MT and secondary MT are both DI'd and charisma'd as a matter of course.  And most of the time both spells are just a waste of mana.  But that one raid where DI saves the raid makes it all worth while.  IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I guess it kinda depends on your definition of zerging. There are a fair number of events that if you just threw people at no matter how many you are going to fail every time. Once you have some basic strategies for most events the more dps you have the easier they are. If that dps comes from more people, better equiped people or higher percent of dps classes doesn't matter too much. So yes once you have the basic strats down move dps from more people is handy. If you want to try the classic of just throw as many people at the mob as you can and then res as fast as you can that really isn't gonna work in pop.<br />
<br />
As far as when a shaman becomes useful it's when they get group sta since I don't even know where group agility is in my book at this point you can see how often I cast it. Malo can work for malos too if nessicary and anyone can try to slow but as an officer in my guild I made it a point to strongely encourage all the shaman to get to 65 quickly.<br />
<br />
As far as Sharkus originial post I don't think it really matters because the game is already so far messed up at the lower level. Equipement is so far beyond what any encounter was designed for in it's time that it trivializes any appropriate encounter. The &quot;end game&quot; is where everyone wants to be and it's where the devs spend most of thier effort. Why go out and do something as an epic battle when you can come back next week with a couple levels and its more managable or a joke.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Chernobul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">About six months ago I quit EverQuest, for what I thought was gonna be for good. About two weeks ago I went to the local gaming store that rents out their computers to play some StarCraft(an oldie but still a classic) it was there that I met two kids who couldn't have been older than 13 (I'm 16 atm) talking about EQ. What with all the reading about EQ I was doing, I was quasi-considering coming back to EQ, but it was listening to these guys actually have fun with EQ that made me come back.<br />
<br />
So instead of playing on the Tribunal where I was pretty well known on my paladin, I decided to start up on the Bristlebane server. I decided to play an Ogre Shaman (that's why I'm here hehe) along with my best friend who is playing a Troll Shadowknight. Over the week that we've played we have gotten to lvl 13. If you call the first 40 levels easy I would ask you to start a new character and do it again, without being powerlevelled.<br />
<br />
Unless you played about 14 hours a day (which some people would just to spite me) you would change your opinion.<br />

Noobs are mean.</div></div><hr />

I always find it puzzling when shamen get all whiny about buffs.  It's kind of one of the reasons I made a shaman... most of the ones I've known have been flakes and whined about giving buffs (even when asked nicely and during buff periods).</div></div><hr />

Dang you mean we are not supposed to buff.  Dude I've been playing this class all wrong then.  I thought once the mob was slowed I was supposed to be refreshing buffs.  /em hits palm against for head. Doh!!<br />

One thing that I'm confused about I guess though..I never have a warrior usually asking me for charisma (well...maybe once in a while) but the clerics ask me for it and says that it helps their DI (DA...ummm..can't remember exactly now).</div></div><hr />

I don't like comments where someone is mad and just types out of randomness.. just look at the vox raids how many are successfull? 1 out of 10 maybe and damn 40 level 52s is not needed for that encounter!!<br />
<br />
MB is not zergable right? I mean no cc and won't everyone die?<br />
Carpin ring is not zergable, when you fight those guys that pop 4 mobs when 1 guy in zerb_raid01 dies, it gets ugly and FAST!<br />
RZtW is definetly not zergable so I don't see how people are zerging into elementals...<br />
<br />
On our server the guild that made it into time did most of it with 50 people or so, and the basic tactic from my understanding was get soooo decked out in gear that 50 people could handle it, depending on what you mean by zerg, they zerged their way! getting 40 people Zek bane weapons so that can do the damage that 60 people can do is the same as having 60 ppl w/o bane..</div></div><hr />

KEI has had a huge impact, as has virtue, but I saw that as improving the game as a whole, particularly KEI, 10 to 20 minute med times just were not fun (I'm not talking about shammies here).<br />
<br />
I left for 7 months, came back, and everyone and their aunt was 63-65, I was pretty amazed, 60 was a real goal for people pre-PoP at least , now it's 65 and 50+ aa or whatever.<br />
<br />
PoP xp does seem a bit silly, when I went to PoS I made 2 yellows into 58 in about 3 hours, or less, if I'd stayed I'd have pretty much missed the entire level in a blur. I try to enjoy each level as it comes, enjoy the new spells, get some loot, go further into places if at all possible, then march on to the next, but I'm old school now, it probably sounds silly to people with PoP  xp available any time I want it. *shrug*, just me.<br />
<br />
I feel it's trivialised 55-65 especially, though 51-55 seems pretty easy I guess, so personally I'll just carry on as I was, level slowly, do some raids/epics, get 60/61 and hang the old boots up.<br />
<br />
I'm 59 now (haven't updated sig), could probably get 60 by Friday/Sat in tier 2, with friends, but I don't see the point, there are other routes if you can avoid that Tier 2 temptation recently opened up to the unflagged peeps, and those are the ones I'll take most likely.<br />
<br />
Anyway, enough ramble, the game does seem geared to get people to 65 asap now, yet oddly they've made the game slower to get to 45, I think it's a case of making your own mind up what you like about the game and do that, if it's high end you can get there in a few weeks, if not, you can still ramble on, there's so many expansions I can find a solo spot almost any time I like =)</div></div><hr />

until a few patches ago you could throw as many people you wanted at RZtW.  I've got a friend in a guild that had 110ish people at their first RZtW kill, something like 14 clerics and 7 enchanters, and then the other 90 people just beating poor rallos silly.  Until they cut the limit to 72 he was most definately zergable.<br />

Guess that would make me one of the ones that stick out like a sore thumb lol<br />
<br />
But seriously, I did find levelin' to be way fast. . to fast. . to the point i sacrificed myself down to actually  live those levels. . get the experience under my belt. . keep my spells and gear up with my levels. . . and enjoy as much of non-pop zones as i could get my grubby lil' paws on before it turned into almost allways Pop zones. So I agree in a large part with Dimdim.<br />

I also avoid kei and virtue buffs unless i'm going to be in an insanly intense group somewhere, as it makes you learn and remember how to manage yourself. . . but thats just me . . and i know i'm a bit of a minority eheheh. .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Nowadays when people talk about *zerging* in EQ, it usually does NOT mean that they keep dieing and rezzing dead people in till they win, instead, the term is used to point out, that while a 100 people raid has double the healing/dps/CC power and whatnot of a 50 man raid, these encounters were never designed for that many people(zergs). <br />
Having higher numbers simply never has any drawbacks, making the encounter a lot easier.<br />
<br />
My definition of an expansion that encourages *zerging* is this: <br />
<br />
If adding a twink(usually equipped with droppable gear or with gear of 2+ expansions ago) to your raid yields a higher benefit than uber equipping a regular guildmember, then the balance is screwed(ergo encourages zerging) and instead of wasting so much time of a whole guild on equipping their members with high quality gear, they can just bring along their alts/box and save themselves the hassle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Qatrixaro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">My theory on why 1-60 is easy nowadays.<br />
<br />
Majority of people joining EQ in the past year is someone's friend.  The faster the veteran players can get their newbie friends up into their level the better. It is more likely that they will all stay and play for a very long time.<br />
<br />
That is why Sony spread out the hell levels and made leveling easier 1 - 50.  They introduced PoP to make the 50 - 65 game fly by.  Then added the grouping bonus to encourage people to buy 2 or more accounts.<br />
<br />
I have experienced this personally and I am actually having alot of fun raiding with friends now that I have caught up with them.  They don't really care about my skills when I first joined them.  Now I play just as good as the best.  Anyone smart enough can be taught to play a level 65 character as long as your friends are willing to put up with it.  It is those that do not have friends that eventually die out from the game in the end.</div></div><hr />

I'd hardly say that is true. Outside of the obvious coordination issues with more people and lag with more people. There's also the issue that in most encounters of this level 1 person can screw up the entire raid. The more people you have around the more chances there are of this happening.<br />

In some ways different solutions to the same problem. You need more damage you can work to improve the damage of the current people you have by getting better weapons, more attack gear, better hase, more aa's, etc for melees or more ft, better focuses, more aa's, etc for casters. You can also add more people to the mix. Each has it's own advantages and disadvantages. Fewer people usually means it's to coordinate and you have less lag issues to deal with. It's also easier to gear people up to higher level with less people. It does of corse require a higher level of commitment from the people involved to be successful. With more people you have more to coordinate and possibly lag depending on the numbers. It's also harder to get people well geared with more people to equipe.</div></div><hr />

You need more damage you can work to improve the damage of the current people you have by getting better weapons, more attack gear, better hase, more aa's, etc for melees or more ft, better focuses, more aa's, etc for casters. You can also add more people to the mix. Each has it's own advantages and disadvantages. Fewer people usually means it's to coordinate and you have less lag issues to deal with. It's also easier to gear people up to higher level with less people. It does of corse require a higher level of commitment from the people involved to be successful. With more people you have more to coordinate and possibly lag depending on the numbers. It's also harder to get people well geared with more people to equipe.<br />
<br />
Obviously you don't see the problem. <br />
Adding people should NEVER grant the same benefits as equipping your current members. Never. <br />
Having more people(doesn't matter if it's boxed characters or real people) gives you an edge, when it comes to racing rival guilds for contested spawns, as the *zerg* guild can assemble more people earlier and secure the spawn. <br />
This offsets the argument of being at a disadvantage when it comes to equipping more people, as you effectively can kill more spawns.</div></div><hr />

To say something never has any drawbacks is a pretty strong statement and in my experience wrong. It is quite simple for one person to mess up an entire raid. Doesn't have to be intentional even not paying attention at the wrong time can do it on alot of raids. The more people you have the greater the chance of this happening. There's no dening that. The more people you have the more people who have to do everything right for you to succede.<br />

My definition of an expansion that encourages *zerging* is this: <br />
<br />
If adding a twink(usually equipped with droppable gear or with gear of 2+ expansions ago) to your raid yields a higher benefit than uber equipping a regular guildmember, then the balance is screwed(ergo encourages zerging) and instead of wasting so much time of a whole guild on equipping their members with high quality gear, they can just bring along their alts/box and save themselves the hassle.<br />

By your definition any individial player should be able to solo any mob in the game if well enough equiped. Obviously this is rediculous and isn't the case. Question then becomes who gets to draw the magical line in the sand. When is a guild the proper size and when does it cross that magical line and become zerg. All to often i've found the definition to be, &quot;anyone who uses more people to kill mob xyz than I do.&quot;<br />
<br />
One could easily make the arguement that anything up to 72 people is appropriate. After all verant made raids that big. Just because you can do it with less doesn't mean that is what they intended. Outside of encounter with obvious hard limits like the trials or the hedge maze we have no indication on what verant designed the encounter for.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong gear can and does make a difference especially in the right places. More hps and ac on your mt. Better aggro weapons for the mt. Better weapons on your dmg dealers. More ft, Focus for your clerics etc. We rescently went back and are doing some reflagging for some new recruits. It's amazing how easy some of these mobs are now that we've upgraded gear and are used to working in the elemental planes.<br />
<br />
Just because someone has greater numbers than you and uses that to be the mobs easier than you doesn't mean they are any less skilled. It also isn't a given that just having more people will allow them to beat you to something. It really sounds to me like your opinion is collored by the situation on your server.</div></div><hr />

Everquest's implementation of a level based game has been their biggest challenge.  All too often friends were made enemies by the divisive nature of leveling at different paces.  Now it's easier for people to keep up with each other, and PLing is not required to gain 5 levels in a week (in the 30s and 40s).<br />
<br />
Are 1 - 60 worthless--yes and no.  They've always been worthless, as is 60 - 65 IMHO.  Level based games are not realistic and only cause divisions among friends.  Skill based games have always been superior to level based games.<br />
<br />
Look at it from a D&amp;D vs reality standpoint.  25 peasants with pitchforks in D&amp;D would get slaughtered by a lvl 20 knight in plate mail.  Historically, 25 peasants with pitchforks would rip the knight off his horse, rip off his helmet, and brutally murder that lvl 20 knight.<br />
<br />
Secondly, hit dice focused games, like everquest, imply that your body becomes expenentially tougher as you increase in levels, while in reality, no ones body can become 650% tougher without turning into pure titanium.<br />
<br />
My point?  That this is just one more bandaid to a gaming system that is fundamentally flawed.  If they had chosen a less D&amp;D style model to create their gaming system, EQ would have had far less problems than it currently has.<br />
<br />
Dont' even argue fantasy vs reality--you won't convince me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Sharkus Greenfang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Since all people do not raid (I hate raiding), I would say it is important to keep the non-raiding parts of the game balanced. <br />
<br />
That's how I feel too.  If LDoN works out it may finally give alot of players something entertaining to do rather than feel like they're totally missing out on the point of the game if they can't or don't raid.<br />
<br />
BTW just in case anybody got the wrong impression, I don't think 1-60 is meaningless at all, in fact I think it means alot to the majority of EQ players.  It just seems like most people, especially on the message boards, act like pre-60 leveling is just something you quickly do to get to 60-65 and start raiding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Demisius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">It's not zerg tactics, It's Hydralysk-Deficient tactics, OK? :P<br />
<br />
So you can take the stance of zerging to mean tons of people or making up for lack of equipment with more people.   The first one is zerg imo, second one is H-D :P<br />
<br />
In regards to RZtW being zergable, numbers can help make up for gear deficiencies (IE: 10 ft15 clr vs 15 regular clr), and gives you a buffer (lost clr early on, lost tanks due to CH problem)  but it can't make up for tactics.  You need decent tactics for RZtW, and many of the tier 3/4 fights, if you don't have the right tactics, many encounters will chew threw any number of ppl no problem.</div></div><hr />

Of course, the main problem with these types of games, is when people try to insert REALITY into a GAME, and a FANTASY game at that.<br />
<br />
As to the 1-60 debate, I think it depends on the person, but if you want to enjoy 1-60, do it.  Don't let people deter you.  I played an enchanter until shortly after Kunark's release.  While my friends were out raiding Gorenaire, Venril Sathir, and the like, I was starting over because I realized I didn't like playing an enchanter.  I leveled a wizard to 60 (65 after PoP), and realized that I missed a lot of fun from 1-60, doing the power grind.  So I am now taking it easy with my shaman (a great class at all levels), doing some lengthy quests (cudgels, shawls, epic, faction work, etc.) and not sweating the levels at all.  Do what is fun for you, and yield not to peer pressure  :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Foramorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">They have fixed this so that on 24 people can engage a spawn in PoTime.  That way the &quot;zerg&quot; guilds won't have a chance, but the few guilds with 40 or so devoted, skilled, well equipped players can handle these encounters.  <br />
<br />
This brings up another content.  Now only 24 people can experience the new content of PoTime.  <br />
<br />
What happens to the other 20 people that can't go?  Do they just go home?  While it somewhat fixes the zerging issue, it brings up other problems.<br />
<br />
It seems that there is no quick fix, and people need to stop complaining and enjoy the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Mercuratrayin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">The problem  have seen is that POP has the gear people want.<br />
I see people making an alt, buying for $250 real world money 100K platinum, buying all the high end gear that they can get, twink themselves out, power level themselves to the point the gear they are wearing is finally able to be replaced by drops. Which, is POP. I mean im seeing people turn their nose up at gear people used to swear that if they had one of those they would retire. Epics are a dime a dozen and in some cases inferior to easilly dropped weapons.<br />
<br />
(Shaman epic vrs say Soulsipper with rage and self haste I can do more damage with melee than I can with casting the free slow casting dot, slow acting dot. DPS any more is so high the mob dies before the effect reaches its 170+ effect unless im soloing)<br />
<br />
The bazaar was a god send for tradeskills, but flooded the market with gear that should not have been there.<br />
<br />
Underused zones? Why? Because nothing drops on mobs people want.<br />
Veeshan Peak? Howling Stones? Dragon Necropolis?<br />
<br />
Quest gear should have been alot better as well. I still get questions asking about my cudgel.. What mob drops that. I want one. <br />
<br />
Gah spoiled people. If you got to 65 in under a year your spoiled rotten or cheated. Multiboxing is another great sin. One which I will save my rants for later... but I see this as simple greed. not wanting to share loot or exp, but rather wanting to play by yourself and screw the rest of the server.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Well wit the introduction of Nurga and Droga  and HoB i find myself only going to BoT to raid the twoers with my guild. I havent set foot in a exp &quot;grind&quot; group in almost a month it seems. The result has been the most fun i have had in EQ since i joined any guild. Last night i sent time crawling in HoB making nice cash from loot and nice fun in a challanging enviroment with friends, It wasnt about checking the AA exp bar and going , Ok 1 more AA and ill go do something fun, it was more like &quot;Wow this is a blast&quot; then going , WOW i just dinged!. Im finding things in EQ that havent been there for a while and ill be sad when HoB is gone, its a nice lil zone. But it does make me wonder about LDoN and how good it will be. Im defienlty finding the reasons i got in EQ lately and likeing it and LDoN seems to be directed right at that enviroment.<br />
<br />
So if you think about it, EQ got a lil messed up, it went to hardcore raiding and yes, 1-60 was pointless for a while, but it seems to me the game is expanding itself again and getting back to its roots, so that no, you no longer have to level in PoP to ding 65, you no long even need a guild to decently equip yourself due to revamps of zones and more revamps coming, the game is leveling off and FINALY not requiring you to live the raiding lifestyle and to ease off and play for PURE fun and adventure. It still has a way to go but thats the general direction i see, getting back to its roots. Who know, we might even get enough people back into the roleplaying scene to see weddings again. Granted weddings are kinda lame imho, but it was a mark of how deep the roleplay enviroment was in EQ and roleplaying is something that on my server atleast is none exsistant and i miss that.</div></div><hr />

--No paitience to deal with other people. Precisley my point. Your too good to interact with others. Cant play the game right, dont play.<br />

-- I've got a job too. I'm sorry if that makes you think your &quot;entitled&quot; to have everythign handed right over to you personally. And in an hour or two a day I can make fine progress without having to be my own guild. Multiboxing is just an excuse to never have to interact with people.<br />
<br />

Oh right, you have a job and are entitled to it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>dikkakor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">I see there are two kinds of multiboxing..<br />
<br />
First kind that 95% of people don't like. The kind that people will not group with other people and just use their 2, 4 or 6 toons.<br />
<br />
Then there are 2 boxers like me..<br />
<br />
I 2 box because I find there can be way too much downtime running only one toon. I have raided in ToV at the same time I was grouping with my necro. Did anyone die because of my 2 boxing? nope. I feel I can handle it. If Im in an extreme situation and i need all my focus on one toon - i gracefully exit the group im in and then log that character. Many times I have been lucky enough to get both toons in the same group. more often than not people are shocked to hear that I am running both since it almost seems like 2 people ( allbeit one is very quiet :) )<br />

not all people in game are evil :)</div></div><hr />
