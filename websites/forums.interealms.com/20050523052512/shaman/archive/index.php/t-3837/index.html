<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>DSX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi,<br />
I am having trouble deciding what I should go with. Either 1 handed bash with a SBS or 2HB. Is there a real nice 1 hander out there. right now i am using Smoldering Iron and Centi Warhammer. Do you guys have any advice for this confused Shaman. <br />
<br />
Thank You<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Our melee skills suck either way,  but it is really situational.<br />
<br />
If you are rading or in a group AC is the most important.  So you would want a 1hb and a SBS.<br />
<br />
If you are soloing and need melee output 2nb is the way to go.<br />
<br />
I usually use 1hp and a shield in all situations but my gear is pretty crappy and I'm broke :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Setantha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I use both Piercing and 2hb. Max one skill out..then the other. Generally I stick to Piercers after both are maxxed.</div></div><hr />

I recently got this one in Akheva on a quick raid we were doing one night.  My best hit was 143 at a 155 1hb skill.  I use it to solo a lot and I use it on some raids.  Most of the time though I bag it for the epic.  The details should be posted on Allah's.  Now I'm trying to hunt down a reasonable haste item so i can equip this bad boy, celerity, and see if I can out do my JBB.  Man, now I'm getting motivated to get to 60 and AAXP for rabid bear ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
What dropped it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jormal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The Va'Dyn drops it. Slowable rock golem type mob with lots of hp. Easy enough kill with a small raid. Usually killed by lower tier guilds on Bristlebane.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Larloch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">A Much easier alternative than that weapon is available <br />
:) ......Tae ew hammer of aggression 17/20 2hb 10wis and some other stats, only priest classes can equip, so they run pretty cheap(3k was the highest i've seen yet).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dredak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Would that be better than a Tae Ew War Maul?  33/36 and some nice stats.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">ACC is awesome, best one hander!  just wish i had one yet lol<br />
<br />
Righteousness 20 22   i wonderful  but requires a pretty tuff guild to get.<br />
<br />
i used to swear by club of the iceocean  `cos of the 150dd proc, but after the HOS nerf i cant get my ogres dex past 200  with out compromising on ac on somesuch stats.<br />
<br />
Actually i dont like melee weapons with a delay of more than 25, cos more hits per min means more chances of hitting, and cos of our skill cap of 200 WE do miss alot (<br />
<br />
This is why i find the epic  bit naff to melle with.<br />
<br />
For melee a REIF is way better, esp with a haste item on, suks the sta tho lol!!  <br />
<br />
i saw a spear in the bazaar for 5k on thur  was 15 22 !!  i had only 1k on me tho /cry    Spear of the despoiler from CT<br />
Someone things it dont dro anymore for some reason ??<br />
<br />
<br />
i am sure that POP will bring some  nice toy   a ihb of 14 21  ratio  would be great weapon to have *muhahaha*<br />
<br />
Actually ther are some bane weapons with comparable stats vs say vampires!!!  good to know for exp at 45+ in tmtns  :)<br />
<br />
phosphorous torch...ill dig out the stats...</div></div><hr />
