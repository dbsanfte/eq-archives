<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I soloed Akheva.  FG would be possible but IMO you'd really need to know the camp first; it would be much easier with a partner, especially one that can snare.  Deep is probably soloable these days since you can invis most/all of the way across the bridge, or just kill the ones on this side of the bridge, but again it wouldn't be easy.  Akheva... Never been in the inner sanctum solo, but it didn't look like an easy solo to me when I was there in a group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've soloed the fungus grove one. it was fairly easy at 65. all i basically did was the 3 warriors (i think) that were on the sides of the royals. you can single pull them fairly easily, and with slow and torpor/q tanking it's not hard. took 3-4 mins each, basically the same way you'd solo anything hard. they knock back fairly steadily so i basically just wedged myself into the corner of a cavern. not that bad. good luck with it, i hear it's a bitch but my shard dropped on the 3rd mob. hehe<br />
<br />
edit: also, keep the mob rooted in the end. vp is bad here cuz you can either fling them into agro range of other mobs, or 2 far into the walls to loot them after. finding the camp is also fairly difficult if you haven't done it before. that was the only part i found hard haha. just takes patience when you start soloing. dying isn't really a normal thing with that kind of solo</div></div><hr />

I did the following zones either solo or duo:  Here's what I remember:<br />
<br />
The Deep - Duo, I did it before you could invis in there.  Used my pet cleric to run with DA on, then jump off the cliff.  My shaman ran like hell, jumped, then /q out more than half way down, lived...  The mobs are easy to single pull once over the bridge.  Be careful of the enchanter type mobs, they charm.<br />
<br />
Acrylilia Caverns - Solo,  when you zone into AC from grimling, there will be a mob standing right there,  kill him.  He drops the shard alot.  Just keep him down and you'll get it.  I tried going deeper in, killing around the gate, none of that worked.  This is the easiest way solo to get it.<br />
<br />
Akheva - solo - invis and run to the big room where they suppossedly spawn.  Go into either the left or right corner.  Sort of easy to get singles, but you can get over run.  Don't try a ruble rouser, tons of hp's.  Just kill the mobs close to the corner, you'll eventually get it.<br />
<br />
Fungus grove - solo - Got lucky here, was killing everything in the area with a group of people for nights on end.  One day logged in and was going to gate out, but decided to kill one mob, got the shard.  Lots of hit points, long fights, don't let them run, root, root, root.  Kill the priest first, then the other big bugs.<br />
<br />
If you need more specific info, let me know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Quiggle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">8 out of 10 shards are soloable to a 65 shaman with all or most of his spells. The adds really stack up in Ssra and Akheva and I don't recommend trying to solo those. <br />
<br />
The Deep-- Invis and follow along the right wall and you'll see an area with several &quot;a thought leech _____&quot;s. You don't have to cross the invisible bridge to get to this camp and nothing should see invis on the way. Invis past the leechs and set up on the ramp on the other side of them. Then just kick back and kill until you get a shard. For all of the shards, you should use bane and blood of saryn if you have them, they'll go down pretty quickly. There are about 10 leechs here and you should be able to clear them all before repops. Anything can drop a shard except young thought leechs. <br />
<br />
Acryilia Caverns-- I don't really know how to describe how to get to the camp, but it's right after you click over to inner Acryilia. The mobs are dark blue to 65 and are pretty easy to kill, you should never get more than 1 or 2 adds. <br />
<br />
Fungus Grove-- Probably the most annoying solo camp once you're KoS. Assuming you know how to get to the room with the royals/warriors, invis there and set up camp right next to the cave entrance. Here you can cast a pet and get set up to pull. All pulls can be singled. Just root/rot and send your pet in if you feel like healing him evey once in a while, otherwise don't bother. Each kill takes about 5 minutes, so use BoU as well as the other ones. Remember to keep them rooted because they run when the get below 10% and the adds will stack up fast. <br />
<br />
Get a group for Ssra, a few enchanters/wizards and you can AE 20 at a time. For Akheva, grab a group or 1-2 people and pull from right outside the Va'Dyn's cave.<br />

  Btw, they changed the shard droppers in this camp, shards don't drop near the gate anymore. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I soloed 7 out of 10 so far.  Akheva was fairly easy, but watch out for the Rubble Rousers and The Va'Dyn.  Just invis, run  straight down the hall on the left side, go through the first room and into the left corner of the next room.  1 static spawn here.  Easy at 64.<br />
<br />
FG was quite interesting.  The first time I came here I was at the wrong camp.  Was dicey at 62.  Then went back and started looking inside the Shiknak cave and found the royals and named.  At 64 this was a blast!  Got lucky and got it on the first cycle of killing.  Think the named had it.<br />
<br />
Acrylia.... I did not solo this one, but got lucky when a friend said one was rotting.  Duoed to the 2nd floor to get it.<br />
<br />
The Deep was simple.  Invis to the fake bridge.  Picked a good set up spot near the cliff, summoned pet, buffed, alpha.... got it within an hour.<br />
<br />
Only Ssra and Sanctus Seru left.  Sanctus Seru is driving me nuts.  I can't quite solo this one yet, and spent hours here with a friend with no shards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Solo'd all but SSRA.  Too many adds down in the mines.  However, shard was easily obtained when AE group was getting ore.  Re the zones you asked about..<br />
<br />
FG - Not a problem, 65 sham can likely hold down 3 spawns - Royal Guards x2 and a warrior, or the 3 warriors, etc.  I camped in the hall where the Soldier spawns and roams, but just kept him on a timer.<br />
<br />
Deep.  Kind of got lucky on this one.  First horror I killed after invis bridge on the way back that area near THO dropped it.<br />
<br />
Akheva. Left camp at end of hall.  Like the posters said above, be careful what you pull and keep an eye on  your surroundings.<br />
<br />
SSRA - Difficult to solo.  If you can, more power to you.  I didn't have the patience to do this one solo.   Lots of adds, heavy mana usage here.<br />
<br />
AC - There is a guide to hunting in IC (iirc) in the hunting section that may provide some insight for you there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The Deep - soloed.  Very easy actually.  Just have the LDON map so you don't get lost and you can get across the bridge easily.<br />
<br />
SSRA - trio'ed.  This, I believe, is the toughest shard to get - way too many adds.  Luckily, the drop rate isn't too bad.  Not sure if it's really a good spot to try to solo.<br />
<br />
Acryilia Caverns - Easy solo.  Bring an IVU potion with you.<br />
<br />
Akheva - Hardest solo (not including Ssra because I think Ssra would be nearly impossible to do with any reasonable safety).  My recommendation is to sit at the Va'dyn pull spot and pick off rocks as they walk to the end of the hall.  Kill the rocks and shades that pop from traps - they drop the shard too.  Avoid killing the aliens... they don't drop - and zone if you pop the mind worms.  Being patient and careful is the key here.<br />
<br />
Fungus Grove - Liberal use of root here is all you need.  Most can be single pulled - or parked long enough to finish the one you're on.  Once at the royals, kill that f'ing priest first...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Slavage909</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I did FG at 63.  It was so easy it wasn't even funny. I did the two warrior camp. I cleared most of the bugs below them then cast slow on one and got him single...droped him...jumped on the other.  Had both killed before the bugs below started to respawn.  The warriors have a 25 min respawn time.  After you have the warriors killed you don't have to worry about the ones below.  Just make sure to keep the warriors rooted else you will have a little problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I noticed that a lot of people mentioned crossing the invis bridge to get the shard in The Deep.  I got mine from the mobs at the fake bridge, and did not have to cross over the chasm.<br />
<br />
Anyone solo Sanctus Seru, and when did you do it?  If you did it before 65, please tell me how.  I can do ok solo here if I get 1, maybe 2.  But I always get 2 or 3 adds through the fight.  And then I'm in trouble.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Icklymuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Akheva - Rubble rousers while they do have a ton of hps, do drop the shard alot. I don't recommend doing this with less than 4 people though, simply due to the amount of HPs. My Last trip there netted 2 for 3 pulls, which is all we needed so we gated... your milage may vary...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The trick to Seru is sitting in one of the corners.  Many of the wanderers seem to turn around before they get to the corner - leaving you fewer adds.  You should be able to kill them before too many stack up on you.  Once you've cleared the area of all of the potential adds, you can meander down to a 'nook' and take out a stationary... although, if you have done your work to clear the way, you should already have a shard.  :)  Easy camp, really.<br />
<br />
Akevan RRs are a nightmare... extraordinary number of HPs and I have had ZERO shards drop from them.  I've stopped pulling them all together when I go to help friends get keyed.... not worth the effort IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sanctifier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I have soloed 9 of 10 parts of the VT key, barring the deep because I went to assist others in getting it and to my spot I use to get shards to drop, can be soloed.  You can get all 10 shards as a 65 shm easily soloing.  <br />
<br />
It takes time, patience and getting that lucky ME shard to drop is the hard one, do that first, and you got your VT key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Probably gonna jynx myself, but so far I've had extraordinary luck with my shard drops.  Except Sanctus Seru.  I'll try a corner this time and see if that works.  Thanks for the advice.  Already been there for many, many hours with a 65 BST and seen none drop.  :(  Just gotta keep trying.<br />
<br />
Course, I still need to get my Emp key.. ugh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Nanuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I hunted the FG part solo some but the bugs never gave it up to me when I was soloing them.  I ended up getting that shard, while in a group, after like 35902 hours total accrued time, well it seemed like that (talk about crap luck), trying for it.  Not a breeze but able to be done.  Slow going and tricky till you get split.  Very helpful if not a full spawn up when ya start up. =D As someone said earlier, priest first if up!<br />
<br />
I haven't been to the deep since changes were made in there so I can't really say now how it is.  I just remember the pack of shrooms where a pain so I didn't really try it.  I just ended up going with a group of friends to farm them for us all.<br />
edit2--<br />
as for spots it was found often for my friends and I.  Zone in, take a left, to end of hall take a right, keep right past the deadend passage to left, then you'll come up to a bend in main passage to left and it goes uphill to area where invis bridge is.  We hunted from this bend in the passage on up and got pretty good results.  The other frequent drop spot is across bridge furthest passage on route to the THO.<br />
<br />
Srra shard.  I just have to say no on that one solo.  Maybe I guess if someone had some large huevos and luck. :)  Not saying it can't be done, but, in my opinion find some AE group friends and take a easier road for this shard, unless your really bored.  It will definately be a very challenging camp, and thus rewarding success if done.<br />
<br />
I've solo'd down at the AC shard camp.  It is possible.  Correct on the IVU potions.  Back when I got the shard I used for my key, the shard camp was at the gate.  That unslowable was a pain in the butt.  The new shard spot, in my opinion in much easier, just be wary of the adds and know the lower ac zone out.  It's a spiked stool in some room.  I think they stole it from the Addams family.<br />
<br />
For the akeva ruins, it can be solo'd as well.  Just be wary of the traps that are around.  I'd get near the vadynn room like someone mentioned and pick off the rockdudes.  Challenging shard camp as well solo due to roamers that could add.  Patience is a must on this one for proper picking off.<br />
<br />
edit--<br />
for the santus seru, the spot that I went, and you can solo here, is inside the main city are and click on the portal things that take you to a LONG hall that goes around the city.  Its a level above ground that has window areas you can look down at the city at every alcove.  One guy in each alcove and roamers pacing the halls.  Easier than zone in, imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Chifari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Seru is one of the easiest.  Walk straight from DS zonein till it opens up, turn left, and click on the thingie to go up to the ramparts.  Just walk around and kill.  You'll have one mob most of the time (sometimes two) and the drop rate is high up there.  I've done tons of shards up there for different people... one usually drops every 10 mobs or so.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Cabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Just trying to confirm:<br />
<br />
In the deep, the ones before the bridge can drop it also? Or do you HAVE to go across toward THO?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I was doing inner acrylia nameds the other day and noticed that the mobs in and around the warlord room dropped shards fairly often.  There was an entire group camping shards downstairs somewhere and me and my ranger friend got two shards for them in the same amount of time it took their entire group to get one downstairs.  I'd be very surprised if a 65 shaman had any difficulty soloing in acrylia.  I always brought a ranger with me, but it seemed super easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Nanuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">In the old deep, they could.  In my post above I edited it for where I looted my shard from.<br />
<br />
As for after the changes to the deep.  I can not say for certain yet, but I am pretty positive they still drop where I mentioned as a real life friend of mine JUST got his like 4 days ago and I am pretty positive he used my directions on where to go and get his as I know he HATES that bridge, though he FINALLY has it mapped out now. :D<br />
<br />
I'll ask and update this thread tonight, unless someone confirms before then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">In the Deep, the Thought Horrors on the near side of the bridge are reportedly dropping the shard as well.  This has been cited on so many threads and forums that I have to believe it to be true, despite never seeing it myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Morizard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">So the shard can drop at the zone in in AC from grimling???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Juff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I can confirm shards drop before the invis bridge in the Deep post-revamp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Moregar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">The shards I have seen drop in AC were around the sage/arcanist camp...basically you turn right when you zone in, take your second left, hug the left wall until you see some skeletons (you can invis to here).  You can either use IVU potions, or just kill the few skeletons here.  Turn left where the skeletons where, and then go through the door on the right side of the next big room with about a dozen grimlings.<br />
The click down to IA is a statue that looks like a dragon head to me.  After you click down, there will be see invis mobs...go straight, hugging the right wall, and you will come to a room with a pot in the middle...that is the arcanist camp.  In this room and the room before it I see about 1 shard an hour drop when I am camping it.<br />
<br />
Never seen it at zone in, and the mob that was on the zone line is no longer there.</div></div><hr />
