Sooo....what is your point exactly? Here's the Defiler description...<br />
<br />
Defilers enslave the spirits of their ancestors, harvesting and corrupting their power, to use against enemies. This stolen energy can also be used to heal and boost the capabilities of the defiler's allies.<br />
<br />
Still sounds like a healer to me...it kind of helps if you read the descriptions. ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Eisgeist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Defiler ... w-t-f ?<br />
 Exactly what I thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>DemonMage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Also, as they've said many times before. Don't go into EQ2 looking at the classes and thinking they are like EQ1 =-p Even if they have the same name, don't expect them to be doing quite the same thing.<br />
<br />
From a roleplaying aspect, the description for it seems to fit quite nicely on the dark path a shaman can take. Shaman are not immune to corruption =-p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Defiler is pretty much a necro.  It makes sense if you think about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Defiler is pretty much a necro.  It makes sense if you think about it.<br />
Necromancers deal with Undead and manipulation of lifeforce. We speak to spirits of animals and ancestors and call upon them to aid us in battle (Mystic), or force them to (Defiler) depending on your race background / preference.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It fits in pretty much exactly with the conversations you have with the spirits during the Spear of Fate quest.

Notice, yes. Care, no. Don't plan on touching EQ2 with an 11 ft. pole.</div></div><hr />

&quot;I wouldn't touch you with a 39 and a half foot pooooooooole!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mystic sounds more shamanistic.<br />
<br />
Guess totems would be too complex...</div></div><hr />

Hehe, you haven't done your epic as an evil race I take it. As an Iksar, the True Spirits talk to you about how they know you are trying to enslave them to serve your evil purposes. They say they understand you are trying to use the powers of fear (ala god of fear worshipping shaman) to enslave the spirits to do your will, but they are ok with helping you if you help them by doing the epic quest. So the spirits themselves agree to serve these evil shaman because of the balance they see that needs to be in the world, which includes evil shamans. They know that as you progress in your quest, you will come to form a symbiotic relationship with the True Spirits and that they maybe able to influence you even though you are still evil.<br />
<br />
I think its one of the coolest things in the game that the text of your epic quest is different depending on what god and race you serve. Very cool.<br />
<br />
So bottom line is that a Defiler type shaman is perfect imo. It fits the game as it is, but some of the lighter skinned barbarian type shamans may not have seen that side before because for them being a shaman was about being a wise healer rather than an evil manipulator of spirits.</div></div><hr />

Okay, I'm just going to assume you're completely uneducated about what you're referring to. No point in assuming I misread, since, well, you came out and said it. <br />
<br />
First off, &quot;voodoo&quot; doesn't exist, except in mostly-fabricated accounts by white protestant slaveholders trying to explain the beleifs of their three-dollar savages. The correct term is &quot;vodoun&quot;, and isn't a &quot;healing&quot; religion - It's a supplication religion, where you give of yourself to higher powers - in this case, God. The spirits that practitioners pray to (not worship) are the Ioa, the messengers of god. NONE of them are evil, though some can have negative connotations, such as trickery, battle, that sort of thing. Santeria is a &quot;sect&quot; of vodoun developed to hide the religion under the noses of slaveholders. Instead of calling the Ioa by the names of Legba, Ogun, Shango, or Eshu, they used the names of Christian saints, and quite a bit of Catholic ceremony.<br />
<br />
If you were wondering, animals are rarely sacrificed as such - Usually it's more common stuff like yams, cabbage, rum, or whatever. It's not a &quot;blood sacrifice&quot; thing, it's a &quot;feed the spirits that carry our prayer to God&quot; thing. Don't even get me started on that &quot;zombie&quot; crap.<br />
<br />
Ahem. Sorry folks, I got some relatives, see...<br />
<br />
As for &quot;evil&quot; shaman... Read up on the mythology of Shamanistic culture. Hell, for something closer to home, read news stories of modern religious figures who use their positions for personal gain or social detriment. Mix in fantasy details like evil races and gods and monsters galore, and you have yourself the &quot;defiler&quot; type of Shaman. Instead of helping his people, he blackmails them... Rather than supplicating the spirits, he abuses and enslaves them. Instead of healing the bodies and souls of those wounded and tainted, he CAUSES the hurt and taint. The defiler is essentially the anti-shaman, and in my eyes, has the potential to be the most thematicly frightening class in EQ.<br />
<br />
Of course in game terms it means that they'll have the DoTs and the Mystics will have the heals...  :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Jindaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">You have to remember - EQII will be a struggle between good and evil.  Freeport being the &quot;evil&quot; starting city, Qeynos the good - your guild will be aligned with a city and as such I'd imagine your title has more to do with this alignment rather than your starting race.<br />
<br />
If I recall correctly, all races can either be good or evil in EQII.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Somehow, I have more trouble imagining an evil high elf battling a goodly troll than I did imagining an ogre and halfling warrior both hitting for the same way back when I started.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I don't find it so difficult to believe.<br />
<br />
Let's examine old world Innothule as a microcosm.<br />
<br />
The dominant local inhabitants are Trolls.  There are only a handful of Trolls roaming around causing mischief in Norrath, a clear minority compared to the various gnomes, halflings, humans, ogres, etc.<br />
<br />
So the trolls pretty much stuck to the swamp.<br />
<br />
As a newbie Troll while running around killing frogloks and gators, I was frequently attacked (from behind I might add) by a high elf paladin, who was clearly the aggressor.  So in those circumstances, I would say Good Troll and Evil Elf.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Sarania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">&quot;If I recall correctly, all races can either be good or evil in EQII.&quot;<br />
<br />
That is not correct. The only races that get a choice are neutral races such as, Vah Shir..opps I mean Kerran, humans, gnomes, erudites,  <br />
<br />
This is an except from the Moorguard Chronicles on EQ2 Vault:<br />
<br />

EQii.com<br />
<br />
Some races are good. Some races are evil. Some can be either. Still others are neutral.<br />
Gnomes and humans are examples of races that can be either. Iksar and trolls are evil. High elves and wood elves are good. Barbarians are neutral.<br />
These are traditions carried over from EQ, so I'm not spilling anything new or revolutionary here.<br />
Good people go to Qeynos, the evil go to Freeport.<br />
<br />
BTW Monks can no longer FD</div></div><hr />
