<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Darwood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I made a big mistake grouping from 16 to 23 in palaudal. Now my defense is in the pits. After hours and hours of buffing up with every buff I have (except char and including frenzy) and getting the living daylights beat out of me I have managed to get to 25 and raise my defense to 100/dodge to 75. The thing that gets me is that my buffed agi/dex is at 131/117 while my bard/necro/enchanters, who are lucky to break 100 in either stat, fly through defensive skill ups. I gained around 60 dodge in one level with my bard. The only thing I can guess is that once your defense falls too far below your level it becomes even harder to raise. Is this soe's way of punishing me for grouping?<br />
<br />
I made this char to group with so I don't think I'm willing to spend the next 3 weeks finally getting my defense in line so I can have the priveledge of grouping every once in a while again. So, as I see it my options are to say screw defense and just group or delevel myself back to where my defense is in line with my level and hope it starts to raise normally again.<br />
<br />
The reason I am concerned with defense in the first place is that I gather that my job is to be able to take some aggro for a bit without the cleric having to take their attention off the mt. So, if I go ahead with grouping will defense eventually take care of itself or should I delevel to 21/22 to get my defense back in line?<br />
<br />
Any pointers would be appreciated but anything that involves money is useless. I am completely broke and will be lucky to afford my level 29 spells when I get there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just keep at it. 25 is still pretty low, you can keep tanking mobs until your early 50's, at which time your defense should be maxed.<br />
<br />
Our dodge caps at 75, though, so don't expect that to go up any further. ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Search for other posts on good places to get defense up. Vaguely I recall needlites (sp?) in Echo are a good place because they hit fast but for little damage giving more chances for defense checks to be made.<br />
<br />
If you can handle one easily pull 2 and the defense skill ups should fly by.<br />
<br />
As Toktuk said, you are still pretty low at 25 and maxxing skills just take time and effort to max out.</div></div><hr />

With my first Shaman I was a grouping Shaman and never tanked. When I hit 50 with her my defense was in the 170's so it does take care of itself somewhat. However, the free AC I lacked was noticeable and I ended up tanking seafury cyclops for days...boring :(<br />

Mine was ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Darwood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hello, and thank you for the quick replies and the suggestions.<br />
<br />
I understand that 25 is &quot;Still pretty low&quot;. This isn't my first char, just my first time playing a shamman. The reason I was thinking of deleveling is that I know I can gain back 4 levels in one night faily easily assuming my defensive skills begin to raise like every other char I've played. Which brings me to the question I was intending to ask...Is it just my imagination or does defense, in fact, raise more slowly once it falls behind?<br />
<br />
Regarding Echo caverns, I did try that for a little over an hour and didn't see one defense increase. I didn't even slow the little bastards. Which brings me to my next question...Has it been proven that defensive skill ups arn't just checked each tick? Do faster hitting mobs really give you faster defense?<br />
<br />
I've taken several chars through echo for several levels a peice, and every time I expect to see my defense raise really fast. And every time it seems to raise like any where else. I have, however, noticed a very noticable increase defense skill ups when multiple mobs beat on you. And a single needlight probably hits at least double the times per tick as most other mobs.<br />
<br />
Anyway, thanks again for the suggestions. Perhaps I will try the needlights again if I can ever find them open (Im on stromm) and see if another 10 hours of so of fighting them will get me a few more defensive points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Defense is like everything else, at the mercy of the RNG. While leveling my current Shaman there would be times I would ding and 10% of the level later defense was maxed while others I'd be looking at a nearly full XP bar and no skill ups yet only to get them all one right after another. <br />
<br />
It's tedious getting defense up once it falls behind, particularly if you wait. I don't think de-leveling is the answer, just persistence. Unfortunately persistence usually isn't the most entertaining thing in the world :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Darwood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">&quot;If they aren't available, old world mobs are your friends...talk about wussies &quot;<br />
<br />
Thanks, good idea...I will take a trip to south karana and see how that pans out. Its been so long since Ive been there I forgot all about it :)<br />
<br />
Also, in hopes of keeping things on topic. I am not asking for advice on how to level solo (e.g) root, slow dot etc. There are plenty of great guides here and elsewhere on exactly how to do that. I am only concerned with getting my defense up now so I dont find myself soloing cyclops at 50 as the other poster mentioned.</div></div><hr />

<br />
there is this Mechanic in Akkanon (gnome town) that stands with a merchant. he drops FS and some good gems (Black Pearl being the best, sells for 9pp i think to the merchant). He hits very low (because he is an old world mob) and is a 6 min spawn. No guards wander there. The only thing that paths through that camp is a clockwork rat (whatever they are called). You can single pull, the merchant will never follow. My DE mage maxed out her defense there when i was playin around on the Stormm server. Very boring but good plat for the young folk.<br />
<br />
One word of warning though, the Mechanic will run when low on health. you definalely do not want him to get away so have root ready.<br />
Hope that helps,<br />

<br />
Mistmoore, pull a few dblue melee mobs at once and let them hit you.  They hit like wimps, just mind the casters.  I find I tend to get more defensive skillups when more than one mob is hitting me (no, I have no parses, but a few log samples from my paladin twink /shrug).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Feradach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Wait...you're level 25.  You said your defense is at 100, and dodge is at 75.  You can stand there and get the bejeezus beat out of you all you want, but you still won't get any skillups.  Our max defense is lvl*4.  You won't see any movement until you level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">defense and offense for shaman is level*5<br />

<br />
So you are only 25defense behind where you should be (dodge cap is 75 for shaman).  If it makes you feel better, my beastlord that i recently made has been tanking mobs from 38-44 and he just got one defense skillup in that time (to 194 now).  Defense is just one of those skills that refuses to raise for long stretches of time, and one day decides it will max for you--same was true of my shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Just stick with the groups until 34, then do the jaggedpine basilisk caves.

After getting my A$$ handed to me a few times I talked to a shaman guild mate and he about fell out of his chair when I told him my Defense was only 122.  He took me to the arena in the Bazaar, cast his 61 mutt, hasted it and it was on.  I dueled that stupid dog for about 2 hours.  My friend, just set pet to guard and went shopping.  I would walk out of the arena if I got low on heath, heal up and go back at it.  I went from 122 to 184 in that time.  Gonna finish it off tonight if he is willing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Darwood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Ok, cooled off a bit, maybe the deleveling idea was rash. I think I'll take a day or two and try out some of these suggestions. If that doesn't pan out, Ill stick with grouping for a while (which is what I mostly want to do with this char) and see if tanking improves a little later on.<br />
<br />
Again, thanks for all the helpful advice. I'll post back here in a while and let ya'll know how things turned out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Onte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I seriously do not think my Defense maxxed until I was level 56.  I shed a tear, it took THAT long to get it up there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I grouped in HHK until 34, so defense was pretty low. After that I basically soloed to 57. My defense caught up finally about level 47 or so. Of course, the last 20 were torturously long because even though I was tanking the mobs I was slowing them, so they were swinging much less often. Also remember to keep whatever spell in the rage line you can on yourself. It will also add to your agility, which will help out on defensive raises.<br />
<br />
<br />
You're at 100 out of a possible 125 at your level. You're not light-years behind by any stretch. Sometimes the RNG isn't your friend, but you'll be fine over the long haul<br />

Just partner with an int caster (mage, wiz, nec or ench) and be the tank.  You would still want to be partnered to decrease the strain on keeping your mana up and plus, mages and wizards would be happy to find someone who would want them at that level.  Keep the mob slowed, keep all of your buffs up and you should be ok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Well as the one person said if one you all out there fine your defense pretty low for your level our pets make Ideal defense skill increasers.  Just max the persons Dex and Agi and sick what ever pet is blue to him.  Haste and duel welde are good as well to increase the number of possible skill ups.  Just remember to get any type of desent skill up rate on meele skills you need to be fighting some type of mob that cons Dark Blue to you.  Yellow and Red Mobs will as well but they will be hitting you for FAR more.  Light blue mobs will but they seem to give far less if any over set point of time.  Green mobs will never give you any at all that I have ever seen.  Pets also work as well as they are NPC's as well.  You can do the skilling up in an arena or even better find a out of the way place and duel the person you have helping you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">One nice place to get Defense up for mid 20s - low 30s characters is Maru Seru at the Seru zone. Start with Rockhoppers, which should be blue to you, and work your way up through Stonegrabbers and Beetles, which max out around 28. They are social, but easy to single pull and you never run out of mobs. The loot is not that great, but Iron Oxide, a rare drop of Stonegrabbers, still sells for 40ish pp on E'ci and Rockhopper hides, which you will get plenty of, sell well to budding tailors.<br />
<br />
The only critters that will agro are Lightcrawlers, who run at fast SOW speed, and Zelniaks, who have a HUGE agro range. If you are a good race, you should be able to zone into Seru. Otherwise stay away from them or Root/Flash of Light and either DD/DOT them to death or run to Netherbian Lair.<br />
<br />
Raising Defense to 180 shouldn't be too hard. After that it slows down and 190+ is a pain. But at that point you will have a decent slow + an AGI buff and will be able to stand toe to toe with many dark blues.<br />
<br />
Crystal Caverns are very good for raising Defense in the 30s since the mobs are weak by Velios standards and are VERY good XP and loot. You WILL need a group, though, unless you know exactly what you are doing, which takes a long time in CC given its tortuos design. And not many groups will let you tank for them :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Darwood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Scalia, right on about crystal caverns. I love that place, I had a chanter that lived there in the dwarven city for more then a couple levels. I am looking forward to seeing how my shamman can fare there. I soloed a bit with the chanter but group xp was always better because of all the roaming orcs or just the huge number of social spiders and neither me nor my pet had the defense to go toe to toe with the geodes without an obnoxious amount of downtime. <br />
<br />
By the way, did you solo there? And if so, what part?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh and Klemydia, I have heard that too about greens. Very rarely they will skill defense. I have never seen it but I did gain a point in dodge off of one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I gotta say that Defense is probably the skill that I worked on/worried about the least as I leveled, but thank god that my play style was in line with how typical shamans play, so it leveled nicely on its own, and it maxed at around level 44 give or take a level (been so long I cant even remember exactly now), but I can say that it is of the utmost importance to get it up there as high as possible, as soon as possible.<br />
My semi-mentor as I leveled was a fellow barb shaman that was 10-15 levels higher than I was and never soloed. At level 58 his defense was a whopping 57 and he was a big Druman and he got his ass handed to him a lot.....this was in the days that people had just found the velious tailoring for Artic Wyvern and he was wearing a full set LMAO.<br />
This was while I was wearing an Iksar regen bp and ac/hit point rings heheh.<br />
I also have to second the idea that Crystal Caverns is a good idea to level and get phat loots (for the level that is). Only trouble is that its a bring your own group type place or a solo place......but somewhere you can solo at level 30ish and get 2-3 plat per kill, velium weapons (sell to vendors or sell in bazaar for 7-8 plat to people like me that use them for DPS boosts when mage pet toys arent available), velium (anywhere from 30-55 plat per block, depending on the server) and odd drops that may or may not be useful...Herbalists Pack, Crystaline Belts, etc, etc. And thats just from the orcs. I have leveled tons of toons in CC, soloed/duoed there on this toon, PLd my peeps, etc......its really a great place. Only negative is that you cant bind in the zone, but its semi safe to bind outside the zone in at the orb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Koraden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">One thing that i have found to raise defense is too lower your AC. I don't know if it really works, but it always seems to me that the lower your ac, the higher the chance of a defense skill up. This is probably a wives tale though, but you only have experience to lose by trying it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Defense is flat out not worth stressing over so much, especially at 25. as a shaman just slow stuff early and you will get skill ups grouped or not, god knows my chanter has never had to worry about defense just from tash/mez agro.</div></div><hr />

That's why it is best to try and keep it maxed early. The free AC you're missing out on is noticeable - if you ever level another Shaman and have it maxed by that level you'll see what I mean.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">From level 15 to level 54 all I did was solo, my offensive, defensive, piercing, and 1h blunt were always maxed and I leveled quickly. I had a cleric friend who always complained that his offense/defense was too low. This was because clerics are much more group oriented. Once you get into your 50's it becomes harder to raise those skills so it is good to keep it up as you level. You say you like to group and thats great, but soloing always seemed the best answer to me. Not only do your combat skills go up, but you learn valuable lessons on how to handle yourself in different situations. If you overpull, no one is going to bail you out. Basicaly I stopped soloing when I was 54 because thats when LDoN came out. I had read a lot about how people who solo were anti-social and not good at working in groups, man was that wrong. All the lessons I learned while soloing applied in group situations also. Slowing multiple mobs, healing, doing CC, all came naturally to me as I'd been doing it for myself all along. Plus the knowledge that my skills were taken care of all along the way, made for a very enjoyable time.<br />
Anyway, it doesn't sound like your doing that bad, don't stress it too much. Your still very low level. Just give a thought to soloing at least now and then and your skills will take care of themselves.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Although I agree that soloing teaches you a lot of skills that will come in handy when grouping, there are things that you won't internalize unless you group. Things like how fast INT casters can go from 100% HP to dead, buff stackabing, how many mobs a chanter can keep mezzed versus Necro mez, which classes can off-tank well, etc.</div></div><hr />

It was slow exp and all, but I gained alot of defensive skill ups that I needed at that time.  <br />
<br />
One thing that I laughed about the other day, was that I maxed my defense as soon as I was able to, but my old roommate, who plays a rogue just maxed his a few weeks ago.  This came about 8 months after he reached 65 and about 150 AAs later.  He just didn't get hit alot and whenever he ran into what might have been trouble he just escaped out of combat</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wrong. A swing doesn't have to miss to give you a skillup in defense. <br />
<br />
Each attack has a slight chance of giving a skillup in defense. The higher level the mob you are tanking, the higher the chance of a skillup. The higher your AGI, the better the chance of a skillup. <br />
<br />
You want your AGI as high as possible, the mob you are tanking to be as high level as you can comfortably tank, and preferably lower the mobs atk by as much as possible.</div></div><hr />

Barbians are to shaman what halflings are to druids.<br />
Hmm I dunno about that; halfling druids, at least from old timers points of view (like me), were usually l33t d00dz that were min/maxing the exp tables (halflings get a considerable bonus to those that are not aware of this); Barbarians are by far the most common choice for shaman true that, but for me at least, it was solely based on faction choices and where I could hunt with my friends and not spend half a day getting back and forth to bank/buy food when my friends werent on line. I am old school, no PoK or Luclin when I started, it took a long time for travel then; Everfrost to Butcher where my friends were (all dwarf paladins/clerics and wood elf druids/ranger) was a real chore and a good bit of travel, even with TPs.<br />
If I was going to do it over again, I would be an ogre all the way. I FREAKING HATE GETTING STUNNED.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Wrong. A swing doesn't have to miss to give you a skillup in defense.<br />
<br />
Interesting. My parsing only shows Defense skillups when the mob misses you. Do you happen to have a log with a successful hit resulting in a Defense skillup, perchance?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Helfdane - Barbs are also the only shaman race that didn't get a considerable exp penalty... so same theory applies (attracts the min/maxing l33t doodz).<br />
<br />
Back OT - as most posters have said, don't sweat it.  if you were 60+ with a 100 def, then yeah you're gonna pay...but no biggie at lvl 25.</div></div><hr />

Heh, probably right on that, but when I started people had very few clues about such things; in fact I had no idea when I started this toon, just made Helf, a Troll and an Iksar shaman and wanderd around; couldnt find my way out of the troll city; got attacked by froglock slaves in Cabilis and got killed, so here I stand a barb today :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">And another troll is snuffed out in its youth due to the ****tiness of Neriak.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Yep, we weed out the weak ones pretty quickly. You should have stuck with troll though, I mean getting your ass kicked by froglocks is almost mandatory for playing one.</div></div><hr />

Took one of the toons on a dungeon run last night and, purely by chance, remembered getting just that:<br />
<br />
<br />
[Tue Dec 30 21:22:12 2003] a Bloodguard aspirant was hit by non-melee for 20 points of damage.<br />
[Tue Dec 30 21:22:12 2003] A Bloodguard aspirant pierces YOU for 164 points of damage.<br />
[Tue Dec 30 21:22:12 2003] You have become better at Defense! (233)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Innatook</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Also let the mobs hit you in the back, defense seemed to go up faster if I had 1 on my back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Bedin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Best suggestion I can make is do what I did. Group a lvl and solo a lvl. Keeps you from getting to board and keeps your defense maxed as much as possible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Although arcane skill increase messages appear AFTER you cast the spell, melee skill increase messages apparently appear BEFORE the action that gave you the increase.<br />
<br />
For example, here is my level 36 Cleric figthing in CC the other night:<br />
<br />
[Thu Jan 01 00:54:00 2004] You try to crush a hollow crystal, but miss!<br />
[Thu Jan 01 00:54:02 2004] You have become better at 1H Blunt! (141)<br />
[Thu Jan 01 00:54:02 2004] You crush a hollow crystal for 7 points of damage.<br />
<br />
Notice the time stamps?<br />
<br />
Here is another one, this time for Bash:<br />
<br />
[Thu Jan 01 00:58:36 2004] Auto attack is on.<br />
[Thu Jan 01 00:58:37 2004] You crush a stalag terror for 1 point of damage.<br />
[Thu Jan 01 00:58:37 2004] You have become better at Bash! (56)<br />
[Thu Jan 01 00:58:37 2004] You bash a stalag terror for 1 point of damage.<br />
<br />
Similarly, Defense messages appear before the line that shows the action that gave you the increase:<br />
<br />
[Thu Dec 25 18:23:00 2003] A crystal crawler bites YOU for 32 points of damage.<br />
[Thu Dec 25 18:23:02 2003] You crush a crystal crawler for 8 points of damage.<br />
[Thu Dec 25 18:23:04 2003] You try to crush a crystal crawler, but miss!<br />
[Thu Dec 25 18:23:04 2003] You have become better at Defense! (171)<br />
[Thu Dec 25 18:23:04 2003] A crystal crawler tries to bite YOU, but misses!<br />
<br />
So my guess is that the very next line in your log file reads:<br />
<br />
[Tue Dec 30 21:22:12 2003] A Bloodguard aspirant tries to pierce YOU, but misses!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">Bang on Scalia, well spotted. Next line was indeed a miss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">i soloed a ton a mammoths for the tusks back in the day. In fact, I soloed almost 90% of the time in my youger days. Never even thought about defense, as it went just fine own its own. Maxxed out at 200 by 45 at the latest. Once you hit 34 and get pet, you're soloability improves a lot, but you can still solo before that, that will get your defense up just fine.</div></div><hr />
