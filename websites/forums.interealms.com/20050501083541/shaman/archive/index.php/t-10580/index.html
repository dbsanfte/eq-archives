<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does anybody know where a good web-based AA guide for shaman is?  I can't find the information I need anywhere.  All the normal websites seem to just echo the SOE-provided text describing the ability.<br />
<br />
I would need<br />
<br />
   *) Number of skill levels, and effect of each level<br />
   *) Point cost per skill level<br />
   *) PREREQUISITES<br />
   *) Updated info that includes the new AA's opened up for shaman recently (natural durability, any others?)<br />
   *) POP AA's<br />
<br />
I know it's got to be out there, I just can't find it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">DOH right after posting, I found EQ caster's realm has a pretty current listing with prereqs.  The descriptions are just the canned stuff from SOE but at least the rest is there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Stubble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I found casters realm to be wrong on some of their values (big surprise I know). Be wary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Umm, just make a lvl 1 shaman and bring up the AA menu</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Caster's realm sucks on thier info.  The best that can be said is that they list all spells and the level corectly.  <br />
<br />
They are missing aa for most classes and dont explain the costs clearly.  The best one i found is in game the descriptions are very clear.<br />
<br />
I would like to get another source of info about them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can't do it at work.  Can't print it out to use as a reference.  Can't easily do it on the second computer while I'm EQing (would rather use that EQ session for something else).</div></div><hr />
