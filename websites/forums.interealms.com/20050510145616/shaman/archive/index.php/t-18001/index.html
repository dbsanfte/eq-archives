<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ggrowler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just got a Drog mount, and got a couple of questions:<br />
<br />
1.  Used to be that &quot;duck&quot; was the best way to stop casting a spell.  When on a mount, you cannot duck, is there a good way to stop casting a spell, other than moving forward hoping that interrupts casting?<br />
<br />
2.  Seems like you can forget about 'cani dancing&quot; when on a mount;  that is, you can chain cast cani III and hopefully get full KEI medding each tick.  Is that correct?  Will you get full KEI mana regen while chain casting cani?  It seems like the mana bar should be jumping up more when canniing AND KEI is up.<br />
<br />
I sure hope my cani dancing days are over.  I really HATED having to watch the mana bar to time the whole canni deal.<br />
<br />
Thanks...</div></div><hr />

1)  There is no other good way.  I strafe the sides because it isn't as clusmy as trying to move forward, but it is still pretty bad.<br />
<br />
2)  Being on a horse and stationary gives you the same mana regen as if you were sitting and medding.  Thus, if you just sit on your horse and chain cast cannibalize, its the same effect as doing a perfect cannidance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  A) Clicking off mount<br />
  B) Ducking<br />
  C) Recasting mount<br />
<br />
Only takes 3 seconds to recast.<br />
<br />
I have gotten to where I only use the mount during downtime, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">2.  Better than a perfect Canni Dance.  You get sitting mana regen while casting the spell as well.  Or so I hear.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Though I haven&#8217;t tested it, the general consensus I&#8217;ve read on numerous boards is that you do not get sitting health regen on a mount.  It makes sense to me that we would if we get sitting manna regen, but whoever said Sony was perfect?<br />
<br />
And unfortunately, Ggrowler, your canni dancing days are not over unless you only hunt in outdoor zones.  Once you are in an indoor zone, such as ALL the LDoN adventures, you won&#8217;t be able to summon your mount.  So you&#8217;ll be back to dancing for your manna.  <br />
<br />
However, there&#8217;s good news on the horizon.  Once you get Canni 5 and Torpor you&#8217;ll never have to canni dance again.  You still can if you like, but you won&#8217;t really need to.  I&#8217;ve been going on LDoN adventures for over 100 adventures now and I&#8217;ve not danced in any of them.  Manna has not been a problem.  I always get KEI to make life easier, but Canni 4, 5 and Torpor are what really make it possible.  I still need manna between clicks of the magic Canni 5 button, but I&#8217;ve found that simply chain casting Canni 4 and using Torpor are more than enough to keep up with a fast paced adventure.  <br />
<br />
Because of the lack of a sit graphic, I never used to use Form of the Great Bear.  But now I can happily take bear form since I never have to worry about whether or not I&#8217;m sitting.  And fizzling on casting Canni 4 is no longer such a pain since I&#8217;m not stuck in my Canni macro and I can simply cast the spell again.  When I&#8217;m outside I always summon Pokey, my little green lizard, but since gaining Canni 5 and Torpor adventuring indoors is no longer the annoying ordeal it used to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Actually doing cannidance didn't bother me much after I got the horse, having the break in all the outdoor zones was enough.  Besides, I haven't done the REAL cannidance since getting Canni IV - I just cann'd and sat, cann'd and sat, knowing that I'd be getting SOME of the ticks of regen, but not squinting at the health bar to make sure.<br />
<br />
Now with Canni V I usually don't even do that, I just stand and canni.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I stopped dancing when I got Canni4. Just chain canni4 and torpor back up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I stopped dancing regularly when I got Stoicism - I chain canni and heal up with stoic except during down time.  Seems to work for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">To interrupt casting on a horse quickly type /dis  and then duck. (/dis = /dismount).<br />
<br />
2. Yes no more canni-dancing</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have tested it and that is corect. When on a mount you only regen at standing rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ggrowler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Thanks all for the replies.... seems like most of them depend on Topor.  On E'ci, thats a rare spell that lists for 25kpp up at the bazaar, when one is being offered at all.  Will be hard to snag that spell for me I think.<br />
<br />
Great to know that cani days are over (except for indoors, until i get Can4 prolly).... LOL<br />
<br />
Thanks again all ))<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The point of the cannidance is to be sitting on the tick, because you only get mana back on ticks.  Whether you are sitting or standing in between ticks is irrelevant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">To interrupt casting on a horse quickly type /dis  and then duck. (/dis = /dismount).<br />
<br />
<br />
Attually if not mistaken /dis = Displine (meele Ability) you need to go one more letter to make it do the dismount to /DISM.  For me I made a hot key in the Actions Menu (Socials Tab) and click that button when I need to dismount fast.  All buttons there can be activated in the middle of a macro or while casting if you click them....  Though now that I think of it is there any way to duck with a /command.  Would be nice to just add that into the hot key instead of having to remember to do that as well.</div></div><hr />

Aye same price on prexus mostly.  I just found it yesterday for 20k (or 2,000 prismatic dyes) and snapped it up.  Tested it last night - well worth the expense.  :D But I am SO sick of making dye!  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>LorriLou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I haven't Canni-danced since I got Canni IV, and I don't use stoicism or torpor regularly.  I'm lazy I know.  But ask anyone who groups with me they'll tell you I'm good at what I do, and I have good mana regen.  In fact I can't think of a time I've sat for ages...except on my horse.  With KEI or better, canni 4 is fine for what I'm doing.</div></div><hr />
