<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>lanthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is there one? if so what is it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eepjr24</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think it is:<br />
<br />
serverwide.crucible:crucible<br />
<br />
It was at one point, anyway. I tried it, but it was a pretty bad signal to noise ratio. Hope it has changed, have to try it again one of these days soon.<br />

Much like the forums have been of late.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>SurfinShammy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I personally won't touch that channel again<br />
<br />
I saw nothing but crap and smack talk yesterday<br />
<br />
questions were ignored or laughed at and few would actually help  I saw more than a few frogs shunned in the channel <br />
<br />
they pay their 12.95 too  <br />
<br />
all this from shamans... :mad:   just plain steams my clams to see this from those that used to be so much better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hey surfin.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why don't you go join it, and go answer everyones questions?<br />
<br />
<br />
That would work wouldn't it?. Its not like the other people in the channel join it to 100% help people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Denero Creed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Why would you join just to insult people???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">duno, <br />
<br />
<br />
but you can just type /ignore stormhammer.lenine and you wont hear me anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>SurfinShammy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I don't expect every question I have to be answered. You have to go out and research. I just came back to my shaman after a break and I was mortified. When I left the channel was very helpful and fun. Now it's insulting and making fun of others. How noob they are and how stupid they are. <br />
<br />
I guess from responses to my post here that the board is going that way also. <br />
<br />
So instead of wanting to help to fix it you all want to tell me to buzz off and just ignore you. Ok. Gotcha. I am just so stunned that shamans act this way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Torelorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I join it in the off chance that there is something usefull happening.<br />
<br />
No luck so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yah the general attitude of &quot;uber&quot; EQ players has seeped into the shaman channel.  The attitude is &quot;omg you have a question?  nubi, i can't be bothered.  Or if I can be bothered, it is to make fun of u.&quot;<br />
<br />
That needs to change.  This crucible board has long been considered by members of EVERY class to be one of the best class messageboards out there.  This is for one simple reason, we are helpful and we don't act &quot;uber.&quot;<br />
<br />
Those of you who wanna act uber and be all stupid and say things like asshat and stupid comments, plz just don't post.  <br />
<br />
I can think of quite a few names of people on this board that decrease the signal/noise ratio severely.  But for now I'm not gonna name names.  You know who you are and consider yourselves warned.  This is MY f***ing message board.  If you don't have anything helpful to say, shut the f*** up!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Hadd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">i always loved the serverwide shaman channel , and i think it rarelly is that * uber* ; more of a helpfull chat , with valuable advices and co . <br />
as of late i have been in the necro serverwide channel ... i wanted to puke and tell them how much their channel  sucked at 3 different times .<br />
go check other class specific channels for one day before you say shaman one sucks . because i think we definatelly have a nice example of responsability and knowledge in our ranks , with people  more mature than other classes for sure . <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Redspeed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">just because we're not asking &quot;what should i upgrade&quot; every 10 minutes doesnt mean its a worthless chat, it just means we're actually *chatting*.... i mean hell, if you want a channel that consists of 500 lines of worthless diatribe about how to slow a damn mob go to serverwide.arrianaknowseverything or some crap.   i mean seriously, would you go to a channel that consists entirely of &quot;how much did you pay for your jbb&quot;? no, it'd be boring as hell.  in conclusion, you should be paying me for entertaining you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Redspeed is my hero.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kome_battle_shm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The attitude is &quot;omg you have a question? nubi<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Hargin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I found the channel very dEwDish...<br />
<br />
If ya mention camping Ice Giants at level 50, rest assured there will be someone responding that they camped them at level 10...<br />
<br />
Always a one-upmanship contest on there, but I found it to be helpful once in a rare while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jonat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">shaman channel used to be great. now its just a waste of time. i personally use the shadow knight channel it is somewhat like what we used to have.</div></div><hr />
