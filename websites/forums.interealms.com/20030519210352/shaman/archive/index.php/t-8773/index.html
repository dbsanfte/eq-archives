<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>hotelseven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can someone please set me straight?  Someone told me that Shamans can only wear up to banded armour.  Yet I have read that they can wear 2 kinds of Plate (Iksars being the exception).  Can someone please tell me what kind of armour Ogre Shamans are able to wear?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Shamans wear chain armor. Jaundiced bone looks like plate but isn't. Banded armor is a type of chain armor, so yes, shamans can wear it, but there are many varieties of chain armor for shamans to wear. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Shamans can wear up to chain-class armor.  Banded is chain class.  However some technical plate armors are chain-class, for example the Hate stuff and Jaundiced Bone.  Those are ones Iksars can't use.<br />
<br />
This was the original reason Iksars couldn't use Golden Efreeti Boots -- they were plate, but cloth-class.  I hear that's been changed, though.</div></div><hr />
