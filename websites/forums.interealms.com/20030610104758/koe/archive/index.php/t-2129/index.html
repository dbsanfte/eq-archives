<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lianna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello everyone,<br />
<br />
I'm sure everyone knows by now that I've decided to leave the Keepers of the Elements.  I want you all to know that it was not an easy decision -- one that took many weeks to make.  While I won't get into specifics, there are a few things that have happened/are happening/will most likely continue to happen, that I simply don't agree with, and these are the basis of my unhappiness, which in turn is the basis of my decision to leave.  I tried to stick it out and see if anything might change, but nothing changed.  I tried taking time off and coming back (hence you didn't see Lia around for a month or so), but still very little has changed.  I'm not sure what else I could or should have done to try to convince myself to stay.   Please know that nearly all of you are and will continue to be terrific friends to me, and I in no way mean to sour relationships with any of you.  <br />
<br />
If anyone wishes to discuss (discuss, not argue) this or anything else, or just want to say hi, feel free to send tells, private message, email (liannahihi@hotmail.com), or whatever else, please don't hesitate.  Tactful confrontation on this board would even be fine, should you feel the need to make any disagreement public, but please be discreet with it.<br />
<br />
Your friend,<br />
Lianna</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, I am very sorry you have decided to leave.. you probably don't realize it, but you were the first Keeper I ever met when we were in our 30's and doing FM. We have played off and on together over the levels and I always enjoyed the hunts; be it in FM, Guk, or where ever our paths crossed. <br />
<br />
If you don't mind, please write up an e-mail for me with your feelings on why you left (issues you felt compelled to leave over) and send it to klydon1@hotmail.com  <br />
<br />
Goodluck and see you around Norrath :)</div></div><hr />
