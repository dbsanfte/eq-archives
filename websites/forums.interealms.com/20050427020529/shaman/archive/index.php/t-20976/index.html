<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Konarg_Shaminator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I finally scored Q and malos so have been working on one of my own.  Don't laugh too hard but I started easy.  Any suggestions on what to add to the progression of fun solo fights?<br />
<br />
So far for me mobs of any note;<br />
<br />
Yeldema- yea I know, wish I had done him sooner.  he was a disappointment.<br />
Haecheva<br />
Vraptin<br />

Lodizail- This one was very fun.<br />
<br />
As you can see I'm just getting my handle on big mob soloing.  Any suggestions for what to try next would be great for when I just don't want another Ldon. /cheers<br />

<br />
I've been meaning to get out and try a few of the same things.  I'm curious to see what I can handle these days.<br />
<br />
I recently tank-soloed a Protector in Sol Ro..that was fun, and easier than I had expected. :cool:<br />
<br />
Usable loot isn't expected off of this sort of venture for me, but would always be nice.  Just bumping for more suggestions. :)<br />

Be Well,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Foramorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">How hard are Cliff Golems.  What is their HP, max hit, resists, etc?<br />
<br />
Looking foward to trying one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Mingh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Cliff golems have around 18k hit points, they are a bugger to slow, and hit for around 160 - 180? Once slowed they are cake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The two mini UP named, Tawro and Radir are a decent challenge</div></div><hr />

Cliff Golems are highly resistant.  Pull only at night or you will get guards as well.  Park our pet over on the shoreline.  Pull the golem with Malo; kite him till Malosinia sticks; kite him till turgurs sticks; run him to pet; torpor/quiesence yourself; summon mount; epic....<br />
<br />
Re-epic as needed and don't forget to reslow.  Will probably take 2 or 3 re-casts of turgrus to finish him off.  Overall, they are pushovers once you get the process down.  <br />
<br />
Personally, I am 10-1 against them.  For a while, I'd kill the fist golem befroe logging for the night.  The one loss was my first attempt and I didn't keep a timer for turgurs.  It wore off and I had to gate.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hail,<br />
<br />
Pull Cliff Golem with Malos from max range.  Sic armed/buffed pet.  Slow attempt on inc.  Run &amp; recast until it lands.  Once slow lands, /mount up &amp; then chain cast Velium Strike, tossing on a Q when you need too.  You can add epic dot if you want.  Trivial encounter once you have them singled and slowed.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Foramorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Nice, got it at 64 =)  First try!  Thanks for the info, it was quite fun.<br />
<br />
Things like this make EQ fun for me.<br />
<br />
Any other challenging solo encounters?  Loot is always a plus :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Beliael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Guardian wurms were a challenge for awhile but are too easy now. Always have wanted to play with a kunark dragon but rarely up. I'd kinda like to play with Doze in Halls of Testing. No idea really if its doable as its been years since I played with him.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Drylar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">hehe, cliff golem was fun, i solo'd it at 59, with just stoic ;) i did'nt have my epic, but i do have a jbb.<br />
<br />
barducks darkpaw at 59... went 0/4 at 58 though. root rot i could have one, but i went for self buffed only tank in teh face. <br />
<br />
the captain... for the 7th coldain ring... last time kited him for 2.5 hours, and won. every time i thought i was dead for sure, my black fur boots barely saved me. still want a rematch<br />
<br />
various others =)<br />
<br />
lodi was cake, though i hit him at 65. friend of mine took him down with onlt turgurs and q memm'd =)</div></div><hr />
