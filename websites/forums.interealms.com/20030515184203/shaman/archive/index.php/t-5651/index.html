<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gomerr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">using the information from:<br />
<br />
http://www.easttown.co.uk/Epics/epic.php?Class=13<br />
<br />
step 25 says turn in the tear....well....i am having the tear MQed by a good friend of mine who is a 60 shaman with epic...<br />
<br />
will that affect the turn in status? i am wanting to just skip everything and max faction and do ashiir asap. <br />
<br />
since my friend is a 60 shaman with epic will that affect the fact he has turn in issues IE being kos, him returning the scale? etc.<br />
<br />
and will it even work? am i allowed to skip everything and just go to neh ashiir with ally or can't get any higher faction and make it work? or will it just fizzle out and i will be SOL?<br />
<br />
any information would own...since eqshaman is a bit cooky on it when i talked to a few people who got the information from that site.<br />
<br />
i mean, i can do the entire quest the &quot;proper eq player who doesn't like to save his guild time&quot;, but i mean comon, i was in friggen CoM 14 hours straight at the stables for the students log to drop, and it never did. ticked me off....<br />
<br />
so if anyone has any information, would really help...going to faction all this weekend unless i am told it will fuxxor it up *please be truthful :)*<br />
<br />
o well, please respond if you know anything, got a friend who might know a cousin that works in ak'anon that was a gardener in firona vie that might know something..<br />
<br />
thanks in advance<br />
;) :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm not sure what youre asking, getting someone else to MQ a tear will deprive you of the faction hit at that point, The epic shaman will have sufficient faction to trigger the aggro version of Rak. The question then is have you enough faction to complete.<br />
<br />
The only way to be 100% sure you have the right faction is to complete each step of the quest yourself (barring bugs, which have been known to happen), if you want to skip bits then you have to accept the risk that it may fail.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Iynna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Having Epic does not guarrantee correct faction to aggro Rak on turn in.  This was the case for an MQ I had arranged.  Rak conned ally, but ate the tear.<br />
<br />
The epic shaman needs to be at &quot;can not get any better&quot; true spirit faction to be sure.  This can be checked by doing a Ghiosk book turn in or some other lower level faction turn in.  <br />
<br />
After you kill Rak and loot the scale, then you need to be at max ally to turn in the scale for your spear.  Again, it's not just getting the scale, you have to be at the proper faction for the turn in.  Conning at ally doesn't mean faction is high enough.  You have to be at max ally which can only be tested by doing some other turn in and getting the &quot;your true spirit faction can not get any better message&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gomerr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">if you kill rak without turning in the tear...he drop scale?<br />
<br />
or does he only drop it if tear is turned in?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If he dropped the scale without turning in the tear, every level 1 shaman that worked faction for a bit would have an epic. The tear must be turned in to him in order for the scale to drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gomerr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i read at eqshaman...if you are ally or higher in faction with true spirit, he aggros you immediatly?...this confirmable and or a drawback?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">as far as i know he is unkos until you hand in the tear.  Then he is aggro to all. Whoever hands in the tear usually gets hit first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gomerr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">k thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Lord Rak`Ashiir is on True Spirit faction, smiling gayly at everyone. He doesn't drop anything. Turning in the Child's Tear with appropriate faction -- he is replaced with Pissed Off Lord Rak`Ashiir, who is on I Hate You And Your Little Dog Too faction, and drops a nice iksar scale.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gallerus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I helped kill rak for a friend of mine - he had tear &amp; maxed truespirit faction &amp; got his epic, skipping the rest of the quest.  I thought it was cheesy + risky but whatever /shrug.<br />
<br />
I did my twink shamans epic, start to finish in under 4 hours - which is less time than he spent doing faction, so again /shrug :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gomerr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">*THIS IS TO CLARIFY A POSSIBLE VERNAT SCREW UP THAT I MIGHT UTALIZE, ALL WHO HATE THIS, CLICK X OR BACK NOW*<br />
<br />
<br />
so if i just work my faction from amiable atm...to can't possibly get any better...then have the 60shm friend turn in tear...i can loot the scale from neh ashiir  *recently nerfed to be alot meaner*, i can still get my epic?</div></div><hr />
