<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>andi23</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hiya :)<br />
<br />
Has anyone ever tried soloing &quot;A Rabid Chokidai&quot; in Chardok B?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yep.<br />
<br />
Not much to say on them really, its a straight up IN TEH FACE dot/doggy kill, or root rot if you prefer (might be better if you lack hp/defensive AAs). The main thing to note is that, just like all chokidai, they seem to have fairly high DR, and I think the rabid's might even mitigate slow a little.<br />
<br />
They're certainly a significant step up in difficulty from their placeholder brethren, but that's not saying much really :) If you can handle soloing in PoTactics you'll do fine here.<br />
<br />
Not been there for ages so my memory is a bit rusty on em, but for sure a 65 shaman can solo with reasonable ease.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>andi23</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thank you :)<br />
<br />
I like to have mage weapon equipped dogdog with me when soloing things... -&gt; Have to use the in da face method 8)<br />
<br />
I think I have quite nice gear but only very few AAs... Have to work on some defense AAs I think!<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not a gear thread, but I'd suggest replacing bracers (e.g. windriders trinket) and gloves (e.g. kylong) for some more hp. Haste isn't doing much for you at your level :)<br />
<br />
You should do fine though with what you have. If you've got GoD, I'd suggest spending tribute on BA 4 and spell haste. BA4 for saryrn and ultor, and spell haste so you can get that malos/slow combo in quick, and also faster heals if it goes a bit bad.<br />
<br />
Lastly, if you take some ivu potions and move very carefully, you can get to the courtyard area past the castle entrance. Mobs there are a bit tougher, and the rabids in that spot drop the rather tasty warbeads (FT 2, sell very nicely, bit short on hp for my liking though - but I do want some for my bard!). I did it once when I got bored fighting near the zi, haven't tried since so maybe it was a fluke but I didn't aggro anything (note that a few things DO see invis to undead though)<br />
<br />
Probably goes without saying, but if you're not friendly with chardok CRs here are really really nasty. Always carry some EEs and pearls in case someone else needs a hand, one day they may repay the favour.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">They are cake for the most part.  They do mitigate slow to mostly and summon.  Also, they are a bit resistant so malosini(a) before throwing dots and slow if you want to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>andi23</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks again :)<br />
<br />
Yes, I know I have to replace bracer and gloves but didn't find good items in the bazaar (Kael is a quite young server) and hadn't the mood to camp veksar.<br />
<br />
I have GoD and am using the tribute buffs FT5,IH4,AH4 and BA4 :cool: (about 100k tribute points from leveling 2 chars in nurga )<br />
<br />
I have no problem getting to Chardok B... I am amiable to DiZok! And I know a necro that is ally to DiZok so CRs shouldnt be that big of a problem.<br />
<br />
I think I'll try it this weekend, depending on which raids are going on.</div></div><hr />
