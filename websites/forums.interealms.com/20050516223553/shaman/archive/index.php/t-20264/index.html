<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Thats right. Being good in the long haul doesnt mean squat anymore. Get it through your heads. How many wanted warrior tanks on exp mobs before incite? They were more efficient tanks in the long run, but pallies were MUCH preferrable in the short game. Expining EQ is a series of 30 second short games. Our disease DoT's are worthless because of this. Who cares if you can cast em all day; mana regen for other classes has gotten tot he point where wizards can chain cast their nukes as well.  The ability to heal effeciently over time matters little to a dead group mate. The devs have phased out the long fight, where such an ability, and lasting power can come in handy. Its all about isntant. Breath of Trushar and Quiesence could be FREE to cast, and our problems wouldnt be reduced one bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">correct.<br />
<br />
give me the 1950 heal for the cast time of the 1300, and i don't care how much mana it costs.  i can work some mana management, i can get a bard to play nice music, teach the necro to spirit wrack me, make sure the chanter keeps more than VoQ on me, have the pally HoT me as i canni, go with Pot9 instead of virtue, whatever it takes.<br />
<br />
but then i might be able to keep the tank alive.<br />
<br />
because when you can't do that, you stop getting invited to groups as a priest class.  ask the druids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This is the kind of thing that I fear most other classes simply won't understand.<br />
<br />
Ever since Nixx soloed a dragon and posted pictures of it here, shamans in most people's minds have been basically god-like.  <br />
<br />
Too bad that was in Velious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm thinking that Shamans are going to be banished to solo hell and Druids will now be a groups best friend.  Maybe after a couple years, we will get a new toy that everyone wants and be asked to group again.  I hope GoD isn't an indication of SOE's insight into the future of EQ, otherwise...Im glad I 2-box a Cleric :P<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Daekar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Be nice to see SoE bring back longer more interesting fights.  Interesting in not just bigger harder hitting mobs but just tougher to take down in general regardless of overt dps they may put out or needed to take down.<br />
<br />
Unfortunatly I doubt thats even remotely possible anymore so just got to take the game how it is and try to keep afloat and enjoy what is to be currently enjoyed as stands lol.</div></div><hr />

They in fact, tried that, in Legacy of Yksha. These were the type of mobs we excell at.. long lasting, low damage out put. Unfortunately Hates Fury and Torigan Mines are underutilized primarily for the same reason we are good there. High HP mobs take more time to kill, yield less exp, yield less faction hits, yield less random loot, you kill less ph's per hour, seeing less named...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok! This necro will teach you to wrack something other than your spirit:P<br />
<br />
Its call Mindwrack.</div></div><hr />
