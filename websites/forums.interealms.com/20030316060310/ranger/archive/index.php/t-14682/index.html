<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grimmy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've heard many rangers mention the EW dorf camp as a good xp spot.  Could someone please answer these questions:<br />
<br />
1)  Where is the camp?<br />
2)  Do they hurt dorf faction?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Elwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's not as good as it used to be. Harmony no longer affects them all because the bodyguards are level 50. Harmony of Nature works, but it is kind of mana intensive and slows things down a lot compared to how it used to be. Also, the bodyguards seem to be linked.. after harmony wears off, expect adds.<br />
<br />
If you really want to go though...<br />
<br />
1) Where is the camp?<br />
Answer: Head straight out of the valley leading to GD until you hit the side of the giant fort, then make a left.. it's visible from the shore cliffs, it's kind of a diagonal left from the giant fort.<br />
<br />
2) Do they hurt dorf faction?<br />
<br />
Not the Bodyguards or the Captain, the others do though.<br />
<br />
Note: the far left Bodyguard hits hard. Stick to the other 3. Don't bother with the Captain, he is light blue at 60 and hits a little harder. All except the Captain have a lot of hp for their level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Someone had said somewhere areound 12khp for those three bodyguards.<br />
<br />
I'd taken two out at 54, before the Harmony nerf; wasn't worth my while in down time.  They didn't hit very hard, think mid 70's for max; but the huge HP pool allowed them to get a lot of swings on me; oddly enough though, swapping to Swarmcaller to slow made the fight harder than just using my LSoEE and Swiftwind.  If you've got both epics, then this could be a good spot.  Haven't tried them at 55, mainly because of the harmony nerf; I spent too much of my mana at 54 healing myself to want to cast HoN enough to get a single pull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jannelle Silverthorne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not overly efficient at 61 altho they're still blue, turn light blue at 62. Good spot if you have KEI left over from a raid so the mana drain from HoN isn't so bad.<br />
<br />
Note. I've never gotten an add after Harmony wears off. Only time I get adds is if I get off cycle and one spawns between my harmony and when I pull with snare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grimmy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the info guys.  I'm also hitting them with LSoEE and Swiftwind.  I'll be duoing with my RL wife (a 40 cleric) so healing downtime will be 0.  With PoP, it's so easy to zone to the nexus, pick up KEI, xp for 2.5 hours, and zone back the the nexus.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dranex Tical</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">With PoP out, Velks is better solo/duo xp IMO.<br />
<br />
Even with the above weapon combo, these things take forever and a day to take down for solo XP that isn't even close to the 3 spiders you could have taken down in the same time in Velks.<br />
<br />
If not 4 or 5 spiders....these things really do take a long time to kill. Not to mention the spiders don't hit much harder at all, and slowed they're trivial.<br />
<br />
Whatever floats yer boat, I'm just letting ya know that when I did it at 55, the time vs xp gained just simply wasn't worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">With LSoEE and Swiftwind, for both BG's I'd killed I'd had to reapply the short term DS (shield of whatevertheheckitisthats12pointsofDS).  IMO, one shield should last through the fight, at least, or you've not got the needed damage output.  So, I'd not recommend going to these guys without better weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Speaking of WW.  What is the best way to travel there from PoK?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>ToyzRusKid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The absolute best way is to get a friendly druid/wizard to teleport you to Cobalt Scar, then somehow sweet talk him/her into following you to Siren's Grotto and casting succor/evacuate to take you to the Western Wastes zone (not sure if 'Lessor Succor' and 'Succor' have the same port spot, I have heard only the level 57 version works). If a port is out of the question, you have a run ahead of you:<br />
<br />
Take the Great Divide portal from Plane of Knowledge. From there run to Eastern Wastes. Go south to Kael Drakkal. Run through that zone to Wakening Lands, then west to Skyshrine. In skyshrine is a portal Cobalt Scar. I won't get more complicated out of pure laziness :) but maps are available all over the net for these zones. <br />
<br />
What I normally do is get a port to Cobalt Scar, haul butt through Siren's Grotto, and hope I do not get killed by sea horses. To save myself the trouble of getting back, I bring a gate potion (from the Coldain shawl quest).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nulian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">To get through siren's is actually pretty trivial.<br />
<br />
Once you zone in, invis up and and cross the pool to the right-side ledge. From there, swim across to the left-side ledge.<br />
<br />
Put on sneak, and drop down directly above the two seahorses guarding the underwater tunnel. If you do it right, they won't agro you.<br />
<br />
Once you're a safe distance past them, get rid of sneak and swim past the seahorse in the middle of the tunnel - it's possible to sneak past him, but I generally don't bother. It tends to be hit or miss, anyway.<br />
<br />
From there, swim up the shaft and down the waterfall. Re-invis in the little alcove on the left and run to the WW zone.<br />
<br />
Getting back is even easier, just swim over the waterfall back to the CS zone.<br />
<br />
There was a post on how to do this some time ago, do a search and you might find it - had detailed screenshots of the route.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Nerple</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Nice, I actually came to this forum looking to find when they went to Light Blue.  Thanks Jannelle.   I first went to them after the release of PoP so I don't have a comparison with the two harmonies, but i can compare the difference between doing them pre-60 and at 60.  Pre-60, Harmony of nature and the buffs take up a lot of mana so expect some downtime, even with a cleric healing, the harmony alone will be enough to force downtime.  Invest in a KEI if you have a friend or have the cash to do so.<br />
<br />
Once hitting 60, it became a lot less mana intensive that when I log on i can usually graba  KEI from a friend and kill non-stop until KEI wears off.  the main reason is Warder's protection which is a great combination Buff that lasts a while.  Besides WP I usually only keep Sow, Force of nature and Chloroplast up. <br />
<br />
As for the comparison to Velks, I prefer the EW Dwarfs, main reason being on my server the dwarfs are always free while Velks is mainly still camped at all the normal spider spots.  However the Experience sin;t good enough to convince me to take down the LFG tag when killing them, so I am usually only there when I cant find a group or being anti-social.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Forgot to mention, I almost always use Earthcaller to slow them, but the other day I had forgotten to relace my Tox Axe with Earthcaller and while I noticed my Hp dropped a little more per dwarf it wasn;t too much to create concern, so while slowing is a help, its not a necessity.</div></div><hr />
