<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Taragan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all.<br />
<br />
After starting my shaman, I discovered that I know very little about casters in general, never having played one.  A higher level bestowed the following wisdom on me:  <br />
<br />
&quot;Use mana items in the beginning, and then switch to wisdom later on.&quot;<br />
<br />
So after thinking about this, I was wondering when is the time to worry about switching from one to the other?  <br />
<br />
And also, what would be some decent mana (or wisdom) items to get that would also have ac on them?<br />
<br />
BTW, playing a level 15 Iksar Shaman, so I don't think I have to worry about it for a while.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any and all information.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My advice is not to focus on just those two factors.<br />
<br />
The advice is basically good.  but if you will look around these forums, you will see anumber of equipment threads, and AC vs. WIS debates.  Check those out for the basic argument.<br />
<br />
As to just the WIS vs. Mana issue at your level .... the key is that WIS does not provide the same mana at all levels.  One point of Wis provides level/5 points of mana.  at level 15, a 7 WIS ring gives you (7*15/5)= 21 points of mana.  <br />
<br />
If you have a choice of an item with 3 WIS (lizardscale mantle) or one with 10 mana and some ac, the mana and ac is better - for a few levels.<br />
<br />
At 24 you will get Cannibalize and regen ... and you begin to learn that a shaman is about mana-regeneration through both regular mana regen AND hp regen converted to mana.  <br />
<br />
AC is very popular with many shaman because it saves your life when you get aggro, and because it conserves hp to use for converting to mana.<br />
<br />
WIS vs. mana?  situational - and changing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The ratio of WIS to mana changes as you level.  I believe it goes something like this:<br />
<br />
Wisdom per mana = Level / 5<br />
<br />
So...<br />
Level 60  --  1 WIS = 12 MANA<br />
Level 55  --  1 WIS = 11 MANA<br />
Level 50  --  1 WIS = 10 MANA<br />
Level 45  --  1 WIS = 9 MANA<br />
Level 40  --  1 WIS = 8 MANA<br />
Level 35  --  1 WIS = 7 MANA<br />
Level 30  --  1 WIS = 6 MANA<br />
Level 25  --  1 WIS = 5 MANA<br />
Level 20  --  1 WIS = 4 MANA<br />
Level 15  --  1 WIS = 3 MANA<br />
Level 10  --  1 WIS = 2 MANA<br />
<br />
This means that a +30 mana item is the same as a +10 wis item at level 15, but only a +3 wis item at level 50.</div></div><hr />
