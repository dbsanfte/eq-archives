I'm sure there are quite a few highly skilled players out there who can't really hit the &quot;End Game&quot; encounters on their servers, and would love a shot to test their skills with the ultra uber. Hell, how many people who read this board haven't, at one point or another, dreamed of being a part of arguably the greatest guild in EverQuest, killing mobs and completing quests months in advance of most other guilds?<br />
<br />
I also find it very interesting that Rangers are listed as a very desired class, and Paladins a desired class. I've just recently ascended to the rank of Oracle, and it has been a real eye opener as to what level 60 paladins and rangers can do - they are no longer the red-headed step child of Verant at level 60.</div></div><hr />

Don't be fooled, most independently wealthy are busier than the proverbial beaver. That's how they got that way and stay that way.<br />

In truth it's a sad addiction as destructive as any other for some, put it in a class with a gambling addiction. Instead of gambling away your paycheck you're gambling away your time and in a sense your life. In a way it's worse because you  have a chance to get your money back, time is lost forever. The enjoyment is fleeting and gives you an emptiness because you know you have better things to do but still persist in playing. Ask yourself this, &quot;20 years from now would I like to have those 1000 or more hours back and what would I do with them?&quot; I think we all know the answer to that.</div></div><hr />

They state flat out what they want, and to be honest, that's exactly what they need.  To maintain &quot;uber&quot; status you need to have no life, a great computer/ISP, and the willingness to devote countless hours to anything Furor can think of to do in EQ.  I applaud FoH for being up front and straight forward about that.  <br />
<br />
I also got a perverse pleasure out of the lines that they cuss a lot and make fun of people's sexual preferences and will promise to not tolerate sissy politically correct ideas.   <br />

Trust me, there is a huge difference between someone who is making a lot of money by working hard all their life and someone who knows how to work hard for a short period of years and never have to work again, yet still earning tons of money year after year, regardless if they work a day.  Unfortunately most people are never shown how to be the latter.</div></div><hr />

Hah, if they have that kind of money I'm SURE they're not playing EQ, who wants to play EQ with a bunch of geeks when you can be cruising the Carribean in your yacht with some hot cuties. I can think of an infinite number of things I'd rather do than play EQ IF I had that kind of money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well thats you.  I don't necessarily share your opinions on what to do with my life.  I've been to most the Carribean countries/islands a few times now as well as across most of the US.  Sure its fun to do some times but I'm just not into the travelling all the time. <br />
<br />
I do hope you get to live your dream though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ogrym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">heh, my &quot;independantly wealthy&quot; comment was a joke, a barb, a complete laugh.  No person with that kinda money is gonna sit around and play EQ 24/7, i don't care who you are.  If you got enough money to not work, you're gonna be doin 10 million other things. <br />
<br />
In other words what i meant was, only the unemployed or the unemployed can put that much time into EQ.  I can't imagine any person i've ever known with friends and a social life that is able to put that much time into a computer game, nor would they want to as they have healthy interpersonal relationships with real humans not some virtual avatar.<br />
<br />
Something a friend said comes to mind.  He said it to me the night he bought luclin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, i'm NEVER telling anyone i play EQ again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Why?  Of the people he saw in line that day at the store buying EQ, he was pretty sure he was one of the very few that showered and bathed regularly and wasn't either obese or just outright nasty.  In addition he was the ONLY one in line that was buying only ONE copy of luclin.<br />
<br />
Kinda sad when you think about it.  I mean really what kind of person with healthy real life relationships would spend this much time in a game?  None.  So honestly i think the &quot;uber&quot; players in EQ are made of up &quot;social rejects&quot;.  If i was still in college i'd love to do a research paper on the online phenomenon and how it relates to your real life.  I'd venture safely that anyone that devotes as much time as the above FOH folks is probably not a very emotionally happy person, whereas your casual gamer is likely more a normal well adjusted person.<br />
<br />
Anyhow something to think about i think.<br />
<br />
(next comes the part where one of the anonymous &quot;nerds&quot; says how he plays 40 hours a week yet has tons of friends.  EQ is sort of a sad addiction for the social reject to be powerful and popular.  Find the uberest person on your server and i bet in real life they are a freak)</div></div><hr />

Please lets not get into this again. This has only been posted about a million times on every existing EQ forum, and yet people still feel they need to post something like this in an effort to belittle someone's decision on how they spend their free-time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The difference between this and FoH is they demand you keep up with that active raiding schedule.  SR doesn't seem to hold that firmly.  Yes, you were raiding almost 7 nights a week (and you still do raid frequently with them), but you did it as prefferance and devotion to your guild.  From the friend's I have in SR, I think I can safely say not all of them raid 5 days a week.<br />
<br />
I think the difference between your example and FoH's policy, is that FoH is demanding it.  You did/do raid very often out of choice.  Although, you never log on anymore.  =/</div></div><hr />

 <br />
<br />
Amen.  My wife and I went to a neighbor's house for dinner once (just once) and the huge-screen TV was blaring blaring blaring the whole time.  We even asked if it could be turned off once, which lasted about 10 minutes.  Each of their kids has a TV in their room and can't go to sleep without it.  They have a TV in their room, too, of course.  Utterly amazing.<br />
<br />
We have one 23&quot; TV in the house, used mostly for videos for the kids, and EQ takes that place in our lives.  We play 2-4 hours at a stretch 3-4 nights a week, are in a great guild that is friendly to the casual player, and we have lives.  With small kids at home, there is a fair amount of &quot;I can't go out tonight, what am I gonna do&quot;, and although I could probably spend my time better writing programs or reading books, I could do worse, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Meschit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">When I went to Baltimore Con last year, I didn't meet many of what you would call social misfits. Maybe it's because they were at home playing EQ.<br />
<br />
The people who came to the con were about 75% normal, I'd say. There were about 20 of us from E'Ci there who got together and drank at the Sports Bar till the manager kicked us out. There were also of course the eccentrics, the geeks, and the Simpsons-Comic-Book-Guy-archetypes, but their numbers weren't so prevalent.<br />
<br />
I met a few people who could be considered fanatics, but not because they were freaks, but they're just really obsessive. One I met was in the army, and his duties required a lot of &quot;hurry up and wait&quot; situations, so to kill time he played EQ. He'd take a character up to 60 on one server, then move to another one.<br />
<br />
I stood in line with a guy who told me he had 4 accounts. He chose his server by doing ping tests, then set up his 4 comps and accounts to play. I asked him if he used hotkeys and macros to shortcut  and he said No, not really. He otherwise did work as a consultant. So he's at least savvy enough to convince clients he can do their work at home and get paid lottabucks for it. Then he devotes the rest of his waking moments to play EQ.<br />
<br />
So I guess I'm just saying that maybe not all typical FoH types are sociopathic losers. But then again, a convention can't really be considered a representative sampling because the sociopathic losers don't show up.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Cali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I dont think one has to be a &quot;social reject&quot; to play EQ.  Nor to even play EQ to extremes.   The problem with broad sweeping generalizations is just that you may brush the top of something but you rarely encompass it all.<br />
<br />
Some people play EQ due to factors outside their control, like they despise where they live but cant move.<br />
Some people play EQ to spend time with loved ones thousands of miles away.  (More entertaining then any old chat room, imho.)<br />
<br />
*IF* I was ever independantly wealthy, while I would spend time travelling and enjoying life, I dont think I would totaly give up all the things that I enjoy now.  Weather it be EQ or any other hobby.  But until then I will continue to plod along doing what I can to enjoy life as it is.  <br />

You all would be shocked at what a positive difference a game like EQ can make.<br />
<br />
Here is an off the wall real life example for you.<br />
<br />
My younger brother was having trouble reading.  It was mostly lack of interest since it is hard for a book to compete with a game console.  I bought him EverQuest and later DAoC, the difference in reading comprehension was apparent after about a month.<br />
<br />
Now granted, his spelling needed some work after that (just think, some of you probably helped destroy his spelling skills!).    Now his mother uses a pry bar to get him off of a computer game that involves heavy reading, and the game console gathers dust in the corner.<br />
<br />
EQ is a tool, just like a myriad of other things in life.  Find redeeming value and put it to work for you.<br />
<br />
On the topic: I found FoH's joining requirements honest and rather funny, especially that rather wry ending :)</div></div><hr />

Uhm wouldn't you make someone illiterate with EQ? Good grief, with the LEET SPEEK, acronyms and such.. you could walk away knowing less ;)<br />

That declaration of what FoH looks for in members.. that's exactly the reason they are the first to do things in EQ first, find certain lewt first, etc. They have people playing 24/7 and probably 99% of their guild is doing that.

<br />
Forget about EQ for the moment, anything done to excess can be harmful.<br />
<br />
As for chess, being a big chess fan I can tell you there is more than just mental training involved, you need to be physically fit to survive the rigors of even the lesser tournaments. Most of the great chess players of late have a physical regimen that they follow almost as religiously as their mental training. Kramnik and Kasparov both have physical programs that are more akin to a sports star than a chess player.</div></div><hr />

Try joining if you only raid once or twice a week ;)   Ain't gonna happen any time soon.   And yes, I raided daily because I loved the people in the guild.  Only reason I can't log in much lately is because RL &gt; EQ and right now I have things in RL to take care of first.  And I said other than the 5 day a week thing its nearly the same.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heh, I see what you meant, Jaradis.  I was just picking at it.  =P<br />
<br />
It's nice that you're keeping busy in RL, Jaradis.  Never the less, jope to see you a lil more often in game.  ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Numbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">I've nothing against FoH.  If they want to devote that much time to a video game, that's their life.  I already know what it's like to put in an average of 8+ hours a day to a video game for 2 straight years(and no, it wasn't EQ).  It's not worth it for me and I lament that lost period of time in my life.<br />
<br />
But I will say that FoH, above all others, are ones who I'd get a perverse grin over to see their faces if somehow, a computer glitch caused all of their characters to mysteriously and permanently be deleted.  I've always wondered how the average EQ fan would react to something like that.... but moreso the big super guilders.  :D<br />
<br />
It'll never happen (or will it?) but it's funny to think about.  ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Azmodai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Personally I liked the page.  Very straight forward, no crap.  I'd join them if I ever quit my current guild, which isn't likely to happen.  The only problem is I really can't play 5 nights a week anymore...damn real life...:P<br />
<br />
hehehe....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Cantiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Sure, Furor and crew are damn good and all but look at THESE requirements!! hehe<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Dragonsfyre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Having been on the fringes of a couple of raids with them, all I can say is that they should add something about being able to handle being in a constant state of chaos on raids.  None of this sit, get ready, go slow, etc.  They plow thru areas, pulling multiple nasties, like they were nothing, with little notice, and expect you to perform.  It's interesting to see actually.  I'm not sure I could take it for long periods of time though, night after night...heheh...but it's fun to witness from time to time.<br />
<br />
As for their requirements, I think Afterlife's are tougher, but it says something that FoH doesn't need to be as tough, in terms of requiring certain gear, etc, as they just get so much it is a minimal problem to gear up or get keys for a transferred char.<br />
<br />
Five days a week is a lot, but not too bad...most heavy raid guilds demand at least 4 nights, some 5.  For those of us who play 7 (i.e. have no life), it's not a big deal.  And there are plenty of those people out there to play a part in what FoH is doing I think.<br />
<br />
I'm certain I'll never end up in FoH or another uberguild, but it's interesting to see what they are looking for and then to read about their adventures afterwards...it's the next best thing to being there I guess.<br />
