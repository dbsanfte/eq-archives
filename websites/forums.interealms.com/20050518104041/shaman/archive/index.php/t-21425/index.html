<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just morbid curiousity, but after reading the patch message and seeing it go live (but not playing it because I retired), I was wondering how much of a change the patch made in shaman issues.  I'm hoping this thread ends up documenting the real changes and their effects on the shaman issues as oppossed to a discussion of shaman problems.<br />
<br />
So far, the only change I've heard of is that all classes can stand a little longer against GoD mobs and that Knights can actually tank most trash mobs (unsure of boss mobs).  This change alone should have had a positive impact on shaman healing and I'm eager to hear your experiences and read any data posted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jormal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Two changes that have affected shaman are in that I've seen.<br />
<br />
Pooka pets no longer workable so shaman are again the preferred slower in Vxed/Tipt. The boss at the end of Tipt now hits for 1650 max vs 2200+. A couple times yesterday knights from my guild tanked him with just a cleric healing and won (just barely).<br />
<br />
We tried to take out a mini-maned in KT with a knight tanking and wiped at 40% with the cleric and myslef chain blast healing. My observations so far.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Seems like a rework of the resist system for pvp went through. Spells should be easier to land. <br />
<br />
Cannot comment on how it works out as I cannot bring myself to spend 3 beers worth to reactivate. I'd rather drink the beer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Oukast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Think you are partly right Asta...<br />
<br />
Root seems to land pretty easy now, but snare and dots and nukes still are sucking major against people with high resists...<br />
<br />
Doesn't seem to be an all around change...maybe just for certain spells?</div></div><hr />
