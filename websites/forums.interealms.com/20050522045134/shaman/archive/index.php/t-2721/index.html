<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all, im new to the shaman class and was wondering about a few thing<br />
<br />
1)wheres the best place for a level 5 to get exp(barbarian)<br />
<br />
2)wots sum decent n00b armour and a few upgrades from that<br />
<br />
3) wot r top three stats apart from wis?<br />
<br />
3)KOS in anywhere apart from DE and Ikky cities?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The answers to the first two questions depend on whether you're twinked or not.  If you're truly untwinked (no plat, no gear) and starting from scratch, then Everfrost is the best place for you for awhile.  <br />
<br />
1.  You might want to check out this thread (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=2549).  Basically, save High Quality bear pelts, spider silks, and bone chips (to sell to players), sell everything else back to vendors.<br />
<br />
The moon also has some very nice hunting newbie hunting areas.<br />
<br />
2.  If you're truly untwinked, your progression will likely be Patchwork -&gt; Banded -&gt; assortment of pieces.  Banded will be your near-term goal- it provides nice AC and is cheap (generally 1 pp per AC or less.)<br />
<br />
3.  Depends on what you're doing.  STA is the easy choice (STA = HP, HP = good).  STR is pretty much worthless, same with INT, DEX helps weapons proc and offensive weapon skills go up faster, AGI gives a tiny bit of AC and helps defensive skills go up faster, CHA gives better prices at vendors.  If I were you, I'd concentrate on AC, HP, Mana, WIS, and STA (in that order) for awhile, at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm not sying there is *one* way, but as a lower level shaman, I favoured wisdom over AC.  I'd always get into groups, and very rarely did I use slow till around level 45, which didn't make me much of an aggro magnet.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, since I wasn't slowing in groups, I made sure to buff, heal, sometimes dot, dd, etc.  So that's why I preferred wisdom, and at that time, I wasn't getting hit much, so it was all good.<br />
<br />
However, once I really started slowing and mobs capped past the 100 damage mark (double), I realized the importance of AC.  Wisdom was still important, but I balanced the 2 so that I could get ac to around 850 and wisdom 160ish.  At this time I also noticed my defense finally going up pretty fast, so even more ac :)<br />
<br />
Anyways, it depends on the player really.  Some people like to be caster shamans, others battle shamans, don't matter as long as you get to the top.  SO to answer your questions:<br />
<br />
1) Stick around Everfrost and Blackburrow if ya want, although a lot of people (including myself) hated dungeons at that level.   If you don't like dungeons, I'd say maybe ec/wc/oasis until you reach your mid teens (have no idea low level luclin zones), then grab a boat to firiona vie from butcherblock and head towards loio for a good while (maybe up till high 20s). It would actually be safer to wait on boat than getting a port to Dreadlands even if you had the money.  <br />
<br />
BTW, anyone know what level Netherbian Lair is?<br />
<br />
2) Ok, for major slots, I'd go mostly ac like bp and legs.  Chain is the very basics.  Then maybe ringmail, then rygorr.  For minor slots, I'd concentrate more on wisdom like maybe bi medallion, chanter made wis gear/mana gear, charred guardian shield.  Oh, and instead of getting chanter made wis earrings, try to find those golden ivory imbued ones that can only be worn by tribunal worshippers, 1 more wis and 2 ac per earring, think some sv cold too.<br />
<br />
3) AC/Wis/mana/hp.  In the long run, AC is slightly more important for me, but at lower levels, I chose wisdom.  Then I'd say mana gear then hp.  I really dont go out of my way to look for mana/hp gear - normally, I look for wisdom gear nowadays on eqprices.com and search by order of AC.  If what I want has +hp and/or +mana, then it's a plus.<br />
<br />
Also, after 50, you'll have to start looking out for your resists if you wanna raid places like ToV.  Most dragons AE fire and cold, which generally is what you would expect from the common AE mob.  So like cold and fire are important.  I know I'm getting way ahead of yourself here, but hey, it might be useful some day :)  One of the best fr/cr resist pieces is froglok crown from lguk. <br />
<br />
Magic resistance is also important too for single target caster mobs like wizzies, shamans, clerics (god I hate it when Im soloing a level 58 mob and their dd's land for 600 :( ), etc.  <br />
<br />
4) You'd be kos in paineel, oggok, grobb, kael, and skyshrine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I was a non-twink starting in Halas.  I found Blackburrow to be a ton of fun at level 5.   I met some people that I still group with today, and learned that dungeons &gt; all.  I remember the basic rule of thumb was that if you can kill the two gnolls guarding the entrance, you're ready to enter train-central.  Was an epic battle, with my freshly tailored bearhead (which is still in my bag today) and my freshly looted Cracked Staff (!), but the gnolls fell to the overwhelming power of the The Tribunal.  I then proceeded to become hopelessly lost in the tunnel because I had no lightsource, but that's another story.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">thnx!</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are kidding right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Nope, always used to group outdoors with easy pulls.  We often used to fear kite the mobs or I'd just keep all melees buffed and hasted.</div></div><hr />
