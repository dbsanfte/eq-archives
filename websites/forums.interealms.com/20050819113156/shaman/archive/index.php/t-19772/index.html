<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ohaern Halveric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Evening shamama's and shapappa's , just wanted to see if anyone else had went for this AA skill besides myself, and if so what you think.<br />
<br />
     For  my  current playstyle  ( solo 98% duo'd or trio'd 2% ) and other invested AA's I chose to roll with PC3 and Hastened Curing 1. That took the bulk of the points I had saved for GoD. So far I have been pretty happy with the skill. <br />
<br />
    I have no parses / hard data - just &quot; feelings and  impressions &quot;. Taking on King Dronan in Droga before PC3 ( 16 Kings before skill went live) and between yesterday and today 5 more Kings , I can say this-It felt better- got my DoTs off while getting pounded, same with malos etc. True  I had done it before , but not  &quot; quite &quot; as smooth. So far I'm definitly enjoying this , invis poofed putzing around in Droga  ( imagine that  shammy invis poofing!) - got a small train , was able to lock it down and get some bonus xp without as much trouble as it had been in the previous weeks.<br />
<br />
   Have a pleasant evening gang- looking forward to seeing some others impressions.yay- finally remembered magelo info- but gates aa's arent on it yet.</div></div><hr />

Thks for the very informative post, just one more AA I have to get.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>matumboo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Channeling Focus is less important than CA / CS of course, but far better that most people think imo. That come from the fact people dont use walls / corner to avoid pushing wich interrupts you a lot. And no, you are not chain stunned all the time, if you stand still in against a solid object (if any around you of course...). Anyway that persistant casting will help a lot on this stun crap (or be an ogre).</div></div><hr />

LR5 is god....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">LR5 is god....<br />
<br />
No, GoD is kind of mediocre, while LR5 seems pretty decent.   :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Khethil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Matumboo nailed it. CS/LR are more important than Channeling. But channeling, for me, gave a *noticeable* improvement</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ohaern Halveric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Zigmund - all of the AA's you mentioned are great, LR5 is excellent. In my opinion there is no &quot;right&quot; AA path.  ( well not once ya have your can5) I bounced around from AA skill set to AA skill set dropping points on whatever seemed most important at the time. My AA's are chosen to compliment a soloist's lifestyle , your mileage may vary.<br />
<br />
Matumboo hit it right on the head in regards to channeling focus. Myself I am a barb so  to me it seemed mighty important to get this one maxxed. <br />
<br />
<br />
Using the defensive AA, Channeling Focus and the new Persistant Casting AA in concert makes a definite change in &quot;my&quot; world at least.<br />
<br />
Im interested in what my raiding shaman  sister's and brother's have to say about this skill, particularly Jinheim , Henora and Gloriana since I've always found their impressions and posts informative. <br />
<br />
and lastly, finally did it 300AA- and of course  magelo doesnt hvae the god skills yet ...can't update it ! DOH!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>blakhomer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">ID5 mitigates dmg that the mob will do as hes already connected with your skull.<br />
<br />
LR5 mitigates the amount of times a mob might crack your skull now that youve got his attention.<br />
<br />
SCS mitigates whether you will even get the mobs attention.<br />
<br />
Read em over and you tell me which scenario youd prefer to be in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I picked up PC1 as well. I'd give it thumbs up myself so far. As a barbarian; stuns sucked. They &quot;seem&quot; to have decreased; actually I haven't seen a stun since I picked it up but I have been raiding mostly and not tanking much since GoD release. (SCS also has helped a bunch there) <br />
<br />
I need to get back to pulling in some LDON for a complete frame of reference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">LR first then CS/ID, then cap out RC, then GoD aa's, channeling is not a great AA.<br />
<br />
CS/ID sucks big time, it's worthless even more than channeling IMO. I didn't get channeling AA but I have a 5%? mod for channeling and I noticed a big difference mostly now I have to sit to accurately &quot;duck&quot; out of a cast. (I tend to channel through duck). But LR5 is really king.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You know what the funny thing is, this skill doesn't reduce stuns, yet people notice less stuns.<br />
<br />
When this skill kicks in, you get the message that you are stunned, the spell isn't interrupted tho and you will get a channeling roll at the end. It honestly is way too weak. <br />
<br />
The number of times it has kicked in with Persistant Casting 3 I can count on 1 hand in the past two days. If I had to guess, I'd say you have a 15% chance to keep casting while stunned tops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Can't say I've noticed any difference with persistent castin3 since I bought it the first day, and I've done plenty of tanking/raiding.</div></div><hr />
