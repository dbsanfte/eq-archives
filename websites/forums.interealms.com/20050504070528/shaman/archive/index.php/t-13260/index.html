<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shammann65</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Info on EQ2:<br />
<br />
-	Setting is 500 Years after EQ1<br />
-	Character creation is more streamline than before. Taking a cue from “Asheron’s Call 2, you simply click on a statue representing the race you wish to be. Using a series of slider bars, you deform and tint the facial characteristics of your avatar.<br />
-	Can be young looking or super old<br />
-	Character stats are hidden, to avoid overwhelming new players. Experienced players can still open them up.<br />
-	Just like the new NPC journal in LoY, EQ2 has the same thing to help stay on top of Quests.<br />
-	There will be No “Sense Heading”. Have to use compass.<br />
-	Level 5 is when you first experience the new class system. That’s when you’ll finally select a profession from one of the Archetypes: Fighter, Rouge, Druid, Mage, Priest, or Tradesman.<br />
-	EQ2 dedicated tradesperson is a full-blown, experience-earning character.<br />
-	Tradesperson will get XP for successfully creating new Items, Items that will be among the very best in the game.<br />
-	“Trade Raids” will essentially be enormous civil engineering projects that require the efforts of several players in order to create large structures (such as Temples) that will then provide huge benefits to other players.<br />
-	Maintenance of these structures will be another crucial task for trade’s people.<br />
-	Since EQ2 will be awarding XP for making items, there is a crafting system that mimics Combat. Separate bars on the crafting interface track the item making progress and your Characters “Concentration”. As long as your concentration bar outlasts your item making progress bar you will be successful in making the item. But events will occur during crafting to complicate matters, and you will have to execute “maneuvers” (Which are Essentially trade-based spells) to deal with them. Maneuvers are chosen before crafting and are lined up on the left side of the interface so that when you see an “Alert” like: “Overheating Metal,” you can click on “Cool Metal to salvage the crafting process. Of course, maneuvers cost you concentration. Should your concentration run out… You Fail! But you only lose raw components and money you put into it. Happily, rare components aren’t lost.<br />
-	After picking an archetype at level 5, players will then choose a “Sub-class” at level 10. Then at level 30 they can choose a full “Class”. (So to become a paladin, the progression would be: Fighter at level 5, then Crusader at level 10, and finally Paladin at level 30. Also to be a Shadow Knight or something different you would choose: Fighter, then Brawler, and then Shadow Knight… Ect ect).<br />
-	Characters can be developed up to level 100.<br />
-	SoE has a game engine to allow players to reach level 200 (Expansions already in the works?).<br />
-	Mobs are Tougher and smarter than EQ1, they have a dramatically complex new pathing system that will prevent mobs from attacking through walls and stuff.<br />
-	Mobs can follow you anywhere within a zone. You can still Zone to lose a pursuer, but with EQ2 Vast zones, that’s going to be a much longer run than before.<br />
-	A direct answer to the grefing tactic of pulling large trains of Hostile Mobs into a cluster of underpowered players is that EQ2 mobs will stay focused on the player who pulled them. Once that player dies or Escapes, mobs that have moved out of there “Area of comfort” will ignore other potential targets and make a beeline for home, thus protecting innocent players. Of course, some Mobs at higher-level zones are going to feel at home (Area of Comfort) just about anywhere in that zone.<br />
-	Instead of taking away XP with death, the game will levy an “XP Debt”. Its like a credit card: a certain % of all XP you gain post-mortem will go toward paying off your dept, so death will only put a temporary drag on your advancement. Or you can just log off- XP dept will expire slowly over time on its own, so you should be good to go 24 hours later offline.<br />
-	EQ2 camping of Mobs should be limited due to the new “Pocket Zone”. This is similar to the “Anarchy Online” when you triggered a quest or met specific requirements, you are (and your group, if needed) taken to a zone that is essentially your own. Sony will be able to create as many pocket zones as necessary for any players at the same point at the same time- so no more waiting.<br />
-	Combat hasn’t changed a ton. But weapons have the potential to do different damage to different Mobs. Such as a Blunt weapon will have a higher damage effect on a skeleton due to the vulnerability to getting crushed vs. just cut… what’s a cut going to do to a skeleton, he has no blood to spill.<br />
-	The EQ magic system is largely unchanged except for the addition of “Concentration” as a new spell resource. While you’ll still need mana to fire off any spell, concentration represents your character’s ability to maintain spells and will be primarily used to maintain buffs. So a Shammann can cast a slew of protective spells on party members and never have them run out just as long as that shaman (other classes too) keeps the mental bandwidth to keep them running. Should you need to reclaim concentration to cast a different spell, you can “shut off” any currently maintained magic and immediately recoup the necessary brainpower. <br />
-	Sony is making plans to give some time of Bundle or group subscription rate for playing both EQ1 and EQ2. But still wont be able to import your EQ1 toon over to EQ2. Sony is working on an “Ancestral” plan, in which your new EQ2 character could be the descendent of one of your EQ1 characters. Your descendent will carry an “Heirloom” from your older character- maybe a piece of Jewelry or Armor.<br />
-	Player communication will be open and seamless across both games and all servers.<br />
-	Every player will have some sort of access to a secure player housing, either by renting a room in an Inn or pooling in resources to buy a guild Hall.<br />
-	Binding spots are scattered across the land.<br />
-	Players can own boats, and other modes of transport (but no horses- not yet… Maybe yet another expansion?)<br />
-	You can create macros of different Armor/Weapons/Spell set-ups, so you can easily toggle to whatever the situation demands without laboriously rearranging everything in your inventory.<br />
-	When you die you’ll face a Choice: Float around your corpse and wait for another player to Resurrect you, or sacrifice a randomly selected item (including things stored in player housing) in order to respawn at your last bind point. EQ2 will pick a level-appropriate item to sacrifice. It won’t delete prized, rare items.<br />
<br />
Hmmmm… Some interesting stuff, yes? So what do you all think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>greatmilenko_00</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">seems pretty interesting to me, but i seem to remember them mentioning armor/weapons need to be repaired, and the turns me off from the game before i even play it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sarania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Not bad where did you get all the info at?<br />

I've seen this work in Earth and Beyond, which I play when I feel like I am getting burned out on EQ or on patch days cause patches are always during prime time in europe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Graskulis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">- Every player will have some sort of access to a secure player housing, either by renting a room in an Inn or pooling in resources to buy a guild Hall.<br />
<br />
Remember when they said this would be in EQ1? Ya, so do I.<br />
<br />
Sorry feature lists, but I've learned from one series of listed fakeness from EQ that they aren't worth squat.<br />
<br />
I'll see it when it comes out, but I wouldn't expect all this to be around. Maybe after three or four expansions.<br />
<br />
(Note: I'm just bitter because my first character was a rogue, because the EQ FAQ said that only crafty rogues could sneak into towns that closed at night. Turned out they were the most broken class at release, since none of the promised features associated with them existed)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Combat for melee will be still limited to auto attack ,and for caster to one ,two or for very diversify class three spell.....disappointing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">- Mobs can follow you anywhere within a zone. You can still Zone to lose a pursuer, but with EQ2 Vast zones, that’s going to be a much longer run than before. <br />
<br />
Yah cause NO ONE camps zonelines.... :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hmm, don't care for the randomly deleting items when you die thing.<br />
<br />
Nowadays I often suck up an experience death because (1) I don't care and (2) I still have a buffer in 65.  I'm not sure what kind of stuff will really end up getting deleted, but it's a bit alarming.  <br />
<br />
I like the other ideas though, especially the trade implementation - even though I'm not a big crafter in EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">One could look forward to spending an evening or wekend as a merchant or skillsman, and spend hours repairing amrour, wepaons and inventory gear with monotonous and repetetive keystrokes!<br />
<br />
<br />
In other words, you can be a cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bailie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I would be curious to know the source of that information.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Very little new things as such. Most of things are copied from other games already on the market, old and newer ones (newer as released after EQ1). Of course, it's always easier to use the bicycle then to re-invent it.<br />
<br />
But these are all technical features, which are not such a concern for me. What is interesting, for me, is whether the EQ2 will put a plug on solo people just like EQ1 did, where only couple of classes can really &quot;solo&quot; and rest can't even blow a nose alone (i.e. warriors). Also, is EQ2 also geared towards so-called &quot;uberguilds&quot;, i.e. people who do not have many responsibilities in RL and can play like 8 hours per day, and 80% of the whole game community can only look and read about the cool items and zones on Allakhazam and some other sites. If yes - screw EQ2, WoW will be out probably somewhere at that time too.<br />
<br />
I don't mean here that a solo person or 1 group should be able to fight the top mobs in the game, no. But, if a group size is 8 to 10 people, then 3-4 groups should be able to handle anything, provided the levels and skills are also maxed, not that you need almost 100 people to do something. Granted, wouldn't be easy and would recquire concentration and skills, but still. And that there would be better access to ANY mob in the game, not that some mob spawns only after a certain time, and some organizations can basically &quot;camp and farm&quot; that mob. There should be probably also added some timers, which are used very well in few other games, i.e. after you do some quest or defeat some mob, you cannot repeat the process for some amount of time. This allows others to access the area/mob/loot too, and at the same time prevents farming. Some may think it sucks, but it doesn't, I've partaked in such events in other games and it was a very good balancing thing.<br />
<br />
And so on...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">(Expansions already in the works?)<br />
<br />
I'm sure they are. I know Kunark and Velious were at least in the concept stage during EQ1 beta.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yah cause NO ONE camps zonelines.... :rolleyes:<br />
 <br />
LOL, obviously they are making the zone sooooo big that the there wont be any worthwhile mobs anywhere near a zoneline. Those SoE guys sure know how to design fun games.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'm sure they are. I know Kunark and Velious were at least in the concept stage during EQ1 beta. <br />
<br />
Actually, Kunark and Velious were suppose to be in the original release of EQ but they cut them so they could release it earlier and put them out as expansions for more cash.  The original EQ box actually said 5 continents...not 3.</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately, I don't have it with me, but it was in some gaming magazine from April.</div></div><hr />
