<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>sorsisis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">No message of them fixing the 7th cudgel which wont proc, nor fixing the stacking issues with the 8th.... go verant! ~_~ i must have emailed them 2, 3 times a week... wonder how long we must wait until they realize they messed this quest up result-wise. sigh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Israi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">this item i spent weeks questing for still does not work?? why is this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>sorsisis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I wish i knew israi :( i wish i knew. They musta just rushed to get it out with the 8th, and with such, messed up the proc. in case you didnt know, the effect is supposed to proc in battle, but when it procs, nothing happens, and you get the message &quot;Item is out of charges.&quot; well, its not a charged item :/ good going verant. and not only that, but they made the 8th very unstackable. doesnt stack with Harness or Focus, or avatar.... i dont see the point to it. I can buff my tanks better with HoS, str, dex, agi, and sta, then with the 8th cudgel, which costs a damn emerald and only buffs 40 pts. verant pulled a screwjob once again :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Verant says &quot; Leezards??  We don't got no steenkin leezards&quot;.<br />
<br />
The programmer is prolly on vacation and I doubt that there are enough Iksar who have complained.  Just look at the massive petition on RoK 55+ drop spells and how it still took forever to get some changes there.  I feel fer you lizzies :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Is this what you were hoping they would fix?<br />

<br />
Sorry I don't know anything about these quests so I'm not sure if this is the cudgel in question.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Arsenak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What?<br />
<br />
I have the 8th cudgel and thought I would try the Carnage effect tonight.<br />
<br />
1.  It DOES stack with HoS.<br />
2.  It does NOT need an Emerald anymore!<br />
3.  It still does NOT stack with FoS<br />
4.  It still does NOT stack with STR and a few other class buffs. =(<br />
<br />
try it... click click click ... free buff... just still has stacking issues, but then, thats probably VI's &quot;intention&quot;<br />
<br />
its much better that it stacks with HoS and doesnt use a component though.   I'm happy with it sitting in the range slot.  Probably wont use the Carnage buff much though.<br />
<br />
I cant speak for the 7th effect though since i dont have that one anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>sorsisis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">oh great! it stacks with hos now and doesnt cost an emerald?! WOOT! OMG! thats great for us 50+ shamans who dont have focus yet, saves us  A BUNCH of mana, just Hos tanks and right click carnage instead of str, dex, agi, sta.... woot! thanks for the info!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Silsisa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">What does Carnage actually do? hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sthaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Carnage = +40 Str, Dex, Agi and Attk.  It will stack with HoS (tho HoS will overwrite, it can be recast).  It also stacks with any other Talisman line spell (Kragg at least, only one I tried).  It stacks with other Agi, Dex, and Stam buffs as well.  It will not stack with Str buffs or Rage (not sure on VoB) or Focus/Khura's.  I'm guessing it won't stack with Avatar either.  However, HoS + Carnage + Deliriously Nimble = (approx) 100 str, 90 dex, 90 Agi, 40 Attack, 250 HPs.  Not bad.<br />
<br />
It WILL save lots of mana for buffs, but it does NOT save much time at 15 seconds per cast and only lasting about 6 minutes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">So this is kinda like Iksar's JB buffs, right?<br />
<br />
(manaless melee right clicky stats buffs, stack with HoS but not focus)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>bakumba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Does it stack with avatar?<br />
<br />
-Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have group focus, not group HoS =/  Still worthless for any level 60 shaman with group buffs (which is a fair bit able to get the cudgel).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Arsenak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">/agree Cakaris<br />
<br />
Carnage is worthless indeed.<br />
<br />
Maybe the NEXT cudgel will have a good effect.  =P<br />
<br />
It makes for a nice range item with the stats though, thats about it.<br />
<br />
I group with a monk sometimes, and tried doing the HoS/Carnage buff... was nice for the first 30minutes... then i just said F%^K it, and threw on a FoS... just as good and not worth the stacking hassle.  If i wanted to max out his stats, i just put on HoS , then STR and DEX...blah blah blah... you know.<br />
<br />
Just dont get excited over this Carnage effect, its just a toy =)<br />
<br />
Thats my opinion. /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sthaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">At level 60, yes Carnage is useless until it will stack with Focus.  I'd take Khura's over this, just for the HP and the fact it's one cast.  It's also impractical for raids, with or without Focus.<br />
<br />
Before 60 tho, it is not useless at all.  Harness your melee, like you always do, toss on whatever stat buffs (group version or no), less strength, and proceed to Carnage.  Chances are, all stats will be at or near 255.  Yeah it's annoying to recast every 6 mins, which is why I think it's supposed to be a group buff as mentioned in another thread, but useless it is not, prior to lvl 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Arsenak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Good point Sthaz.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Durnitol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Is it even possible for a non-iksar to do this quest? I mean can Cabilis various factions be raised hgih enough? or MUSt we be iksar?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Azhdarkhos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Since they made the cudgels useable by all shaman races, you'd assume that the quest would be completeable by any race given enough faction work.  Unfortunately, this is Verant, so it's anyone's guess.<br />
<br />
I suspect that they didn't investigate the faction set-up sufficiently before making the change to the cudgels.  Odds are good that any shamans that do not follow Cazic Thule (and therefore start off with lower faction with the iksar) may not be able to get enough faction to start the quests.  There may be tricks that can be pulled with the help of enchanters that I am unaware of, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ghanimaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Considering how they f'd up with the quellious monks on the whistling fists quest, I'd say they probably have the faction thing figured out and it's doable by tribunal/inny/agnostic shamans. Of course I'm not planning on doing the faction work to find out.</div></div><hr />
