Seriously, though... she's such a gimp it makes me sad to think it took me 5 tries to kill her my first time (although I have more HP naked and buffed than I did back then WITH gear).<br />
<br />
I don't even have the new dots or quinn.  SCRM alone made it a gimp fight.  I don't think my health ever dropped below 90% except for when I used canni5.</div></div><hr />

I think that riding a giant lizard while holding a stick and not wearing any clothes should be considered naked.  The cops in my town agree (I would know).</div></div><hr />

whoops.<br />
<br />
The shoulder item is just a girdle of mithaniel.  I kept it on because I am blind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Some Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Looking at your screen shots i saw what appears to be a gauge for reading your DoTs durations, is that right?<br />

If it is what I think it is where did you get that and does it work with stacking? Can you see each DoT?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">As they've said, you're not naked - you have your epic, your drogmor and the Pus Covered Beetle Carapace.<br />
<br />
I imagine you could have done it almost as easily without the epic dot, Affliction Efficiency IV and the mana regen from the Drogmor, but they still make &quot;naked&quot; a false claim.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying it's not some sort of achievement, but being truly naked would have been more of one.</div></div><hr />

Looks like a modded Drakah UI,  he has 4 different ones on his site now you can check out here http://www.shakahr.com  in the downloads section.<br />

There's about 50 billion others at http://www.eqinterface.com in case you didn't know :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hey, even if this guy is LB, and even if you did have a few piece of stuff, who cares ?!? This game is about fun, isn't it ? It seems you did really enjoyed yourself doing it. This last point by itself deserves you my congratulations as it seems there are a lot of people who plays more as an habit than for fun.<br />
Go, go, go fun (ok, I'm biased as I'm on a RP server where fun is placed above all by almost all players :)).<br />
I, for myself, will try to go solo this guy at 51 once I'll get my epic (only got the turn in to do as I got every drop including Tear hehe). If it doesn't work, I'll bring my best friend with me (51 wizard) and we will kick his rear (the rear of the dragon, not the one of my friend...).<br />
Ok, you claimed making it naked and you weren't completely naked. Who cares. What would have change if you really have been ? No epic ? I don't think this would have make a lot of change for you when I see the dots we got past 60. Don't quote me on this last sentence though as I'm only a 50 shaman and, even if I've read a lot (and I mean a LOT) about high end, I'm not part of it so I don't have first hand clue.<br />
/bow to Jinheim to still enjoy himself with simple things :)<br />

Yeldema is a gimp.  Don't be fooled by the dragon model.<br />

IMO soloing lodi is a more impressive and appropriate shaman feat.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, but can he do it naked?<br />
<br />
Yeldema is a gimp.  No one should be bragging about soloing her.  This post isn't a brag, it was meant to be funny.  I, personally, thought it was hilarious, so I decided to share it.<br />
<br />
Tell your druid friend to solo Karkona (which I did at level 60 before pop came out) and then I will be impressed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I did this a few months ago fully naked, nothing on at all (was on my horse but even took it out of ranged during the fight).  Yeah though, it was just for fun, its not hard...yeld is so insanely weak its not even funny.  A friend of mine did her in only full Rubicite pre POP for kicks and pics (full rubi has no stats cept for like 3hp a tick regen and maybe 60 or 70 AC total).  Shes definately a gimp, and gratz, try an AE'er naked, now that would be tough...been thinking about trying that soon (2 fast sow boots + a fast cast buff thats low mana for clickies, maybe the fast cast buff being the resist needed for that one).</div></div><hr />
