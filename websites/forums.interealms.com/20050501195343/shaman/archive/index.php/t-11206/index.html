<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">some nerdy wizards on graffe's have been experimenting with their rain spells and from the data they've sampled have come up with the conclusion that rain spells have a fixed resist rate of 20-22% regardless of debuffs. I'll bet my bottom dollar that the same sort of hard-coded resist rate is in for shaman rains.<br />
<br />
you can check out the research here:<br />

<br />
Dumb, but interesting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If any rains were hitting when the mobs were under 10% health, the result is skewed since rains are automatically resisted by mobs, when they have less than 10% health. <br />
Unless 10% of their health is less than the damage of a single wave of the rain spell you are using. And afaik even the DC pet in Valor have more HPs than that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rafeeky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I thought they fixed that Giac</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If the last rain would do more damage than the mob has HP left, then it will be resisted.  I don't know where the 10% figure comes in, I've witnessed rains landing on mobs when they are below 10% but have more hp than the rain dmg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">No no, it's not fixed.<br />
<br />
I can't land rains on mobs in BOT when they are under ~15%.  I know they have more than 650 hp at 15%.  Lots more.  In fact, they have time for all 3 waves to be auto resisted, spell gems to refresh and me to get in another nuke with velium strike before the mob dies.<br />
<br />
I was using Tears of Saryrn on Vindi the other day too and same story.  He was about 15% when my spell finished casting, auto-resist all 3 waves.    <br />
<br />
<br />
:rolleyes: <br />
It's laaaame.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">As soon as a mob goes &quot;Enrage&quot; your waves will get automatically resisted. Enrage kicks in at 9% if i am not mistaken. So a mob with less than 10% health will resist EVERY wave of our rain spells.<br />
If a mob has low max HPs, so that 9% is less than the damage you would inflict with a single wave, you will be able to kill it. <br />
<br />
Test it yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">11% is where Enrage starts as far as I know.  I noticed that the rains were doing that resist thing too when it was low on health, I just chalked it off to some stupid bug.</div></div><hr />
