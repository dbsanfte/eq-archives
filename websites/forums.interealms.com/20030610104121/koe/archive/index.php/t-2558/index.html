<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Eliyra Darkangel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Back when Fawnea was a noob, she hunted in West Commons and Oasis quite a bit.   Giants were a terrifying thing back then...I remember panicking every time I saw a hill giant in WC, or a sand giant in Oasis.  Well, one night, I was driving home from somewhere.  I was really tired, and it was a really dark night.  (I'm trying to make excuses...addicts do that!  :) )  Well, up ahead on the side of the road, I saw this oddly shaped tree...but I didn't think it was a tree at the time.  *looks sheepish*  As I nearly drove off the road, all I could think was...<br />
<br />
/shout Giant!<br />
<br />
...and was trying to figure out the loc so I could let people know.  ;)   <br />
<br />
You also know you're an addict when you drive through a construction zone and see sand bags lying around....and you wonder if there is anything good in the loot bag<br />
<br />
And then when you hail someone and try to cover it up...<br />
<br />
Hail!....lo<br />
<br />
I have actually told my co-workers I was going afk when I stepped away from my desk...<br />
<br />
I could go on, but I don't think I need to embarass myself further!  My favorite thing I've heard said as an &quot;excuse&quot; for joining the real world for awhile is...<br />
<br />
&quot;I have to keep up my wife faction, otherwise I will never be able to get the bedroom camp&quot;</div></div><hr />

I told someone the other day the FAX was bugged.....<br />
<br />
They looked at me a little strange it took me a couple minutes to figure out way..<br />

Con's work in RL...<br />
While out with a fellow EQ'er this knockout woman walks into the bar, I look at my buddy and inform him she cons red... lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aseid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yep she did Redtree, but I couldn't get her to aggro on me no matter how hard I tried to pull her... hehe</div></div><hr />
