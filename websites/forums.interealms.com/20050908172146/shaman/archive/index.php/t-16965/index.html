<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bitey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So, I just got my first dogdog and I have a few questions.  First off, what buffs do you put up on dogdog?  Second off, what buffs should I put up on myself solo?  If I put up all 4 stat buffs, shifting shield, talisman, regen, sow, and quickness I end up medding forever (even canni-dancing).<br />
<br />
 My other question is, is there any way I can get my hp back from cannibalize faster? G. Heal, Inner Fire?<br />
<br />
The way I kill stuff is pull with slow, run back, sic pet, cast scourge and then tank it to death.  Are there any things that I could do....better to be more efficient?  I'm not twinked, first char on this server, first shaman I've played.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm soloing the basilisk caves in Jagged Pine right now.  When I log on this is typically how things go:<br />
<br />
Cast pet.<br />
Self buff. (Str, Dex, Sta, Agi, AC, Tnarg, SoW, Regen, Quickness, Fury)<br />
Buff Pet (Sow and quickness)<br />
Canni dance back to full (typically leaving me at 80% HP)<br />
Park pet in front of me.  Pull basilisk with slow.  Sic dogdog on it.  Disempower, scourge, envenomed breath (last dot usually gets me aggro, if it doesn't I just sit down which usually does the trick).  Tank it.  When mob starts to run, I sit down and start canni dancing while dogdog and dot kills it off. <br />
<br />
Rinse and repeat.  I hear things speed up a bit once we get Canni II and Chloroplast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chouzen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I just hit 35 and tryin to summon my pet is a @#$%* my conjation is so low for what lvl I am. I was woundering were is a good plce to solo at 35?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bitey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">spots to solo: http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=9932<br />
<br />
Wouldn't it be more efficient to just cast fury and sta buff instead of str, dex, agi, sta, and fury? 160 mana instead of ~360 mana.  When I do full buffs on self + SoW + Quick + Tali on dogdog, I end up low on mana.<br />
<br />
Hey Chouzin, I'm in the same position you are.  My conj and alt are pretty good, but abj, div, and evoke are soooo low.  Just mem a low level spell of that type and spam it for a couple hours (sucks, but you gotta raise em somehow).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Eh, I suppose I could go without the strength buff.  But... higher agility means defense will be trained faster, higher dex means weapon skills will go up faster and you will hit and proc more often.<br />
<br />
I generally don't cast Tnarg on dogdog as he doesn't do the tanking.  He's just there to take a few hits for me while I debuff and dot.  By the time I pull the next mob he's almost at full hp anyhow.</div></div><hr />
