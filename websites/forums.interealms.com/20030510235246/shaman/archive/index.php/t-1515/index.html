I petitioned to see if there was a problem with the quest, the reply i got was that i handed it to the wrong spirit.. after convincing the gm that i had giving them to the correct spirit he gave me another set of books to hand in. The same thing happened and was told it was due to my faction not being high enough.<br />
I have done all the parts fully up to this so i would assume that my faction would be ok. (was kindly to the spirit)<br />
Has anyone else come across this problem or is it down to my faction not being high enough... in which case is there anything out there that may reduce my faction without me realising</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I am just guessing here, but I think it's a possibility that they decided to ninja-nerf the exploitability of truespirit faction.  Lots of people posting stories about how they cheated on the epic, and lots of people bitching about it.  When they tried to fix it so that you couldn't use the faction exploit any more, they fookered up somewhere and now people's ghiosk books are getting eaten, and other parts might be broken and just be waiting to be discovered.<br />
<br />
I have my ghiosk books banked, all I need is my student's log before I can turn them in.  I got my tear last night, so I'm motivated to really work on this again.  I'll try and get the com reports done tomorrow night and see what happens with the ghiosk books.  If they get eaten and the GM won't fix it, then I will just do what I swore I wouldn't do and kill the two schmucks in RM over and over again until I can just go turn in my tear.<br />
<br />
edit: nevermind on the last part.  if they ninja-nerfed the quest so that people can't do exactly what I was planning to do, it wouldn't be a very good idea to do it, now, would it?  hehehe :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>midvinter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just looked at the new patch message for today, said that they have fixed a bug that was causing some quest to think they required higher faction than they actually did....<br />
Looks like got screwed over by a bug that they put in with the last patch, just hope that i may be able to get replacment books from a GM as i can't be bothered to get them again:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Oddloots</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I got my books from Ghiosk and turned them in the the spirit with no problem. That was last Saturday 5/4/02. I was level 50 at the time, and I am still level 50 now.  I have repeated some of the early steps of my epic a couple of times (turned in envy/woe/marr's promise twice, killed capt' surestout and did the talk with spirit a bunch of times while bored in OOT). I did Krin on Tuesday night, then we ran to CoM to see if we could complete the Epic that night. I got the books from Ghiosk again while moving into the temple. Lord Rak'Ashiir popped too after killing a reaver. I conned ALLY to him. <br />
<br />
At this point, it is late, I'm tired, the wife is yelling at me &quot;How much longer you gonna be??!?!&quot; and I'm not looking forward to moving through the rest of the temple to get to Neh'Ashiir, just for f00king faction. I told my group f#$% it! I had my tear and was going to hand it in to him (after all, I conned ally to him .. what better faction is ally?!?). <br />
<br />
If your guessing at what happened, you're probably right. That bastard ate my tear. We killed him anyways, and he didn't drop anything.  I realize that I skipped a step. It was not my intention to skip it ever, but that night was not a good night for me and I went against my better judgement and rushed through the steps. <br />
<br />
Now I have to go back to Fear and get the tear again. The Good thing is that I can turn inthe books from Ghiosk again, that certainly will help my faction by repeating that step. I play on returning to CoM and hunting down Neh'Ashiir. I'll finish all the steps. <br />
<br />
I just wanted to post that for me , turning in the Ghiosk books to the EJ spirit in the pond at level 50 worked, and turning in the tear to Nak at level 50 without killing Neh but connig ally to him does not work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I will post a more detailed thread about this after I get some sleep.  I have a transcript of my latest conversation with my Server GM (not some flunky Guide who is well-meaning but in the dark) over this.  <br />
<br />
THERE IS NOW A SPECIFIC FACTION RANGE you must have to turn in the Lord Ghiosk 3 books to the Spirit Sentinel at the pond in Emerald Jungle.<br />
<br />
1.  You can have faction be TOO low.  (Duh, nothing new there)<br />
<br />
2.  You can have faction be TOO high.  (Amazing, but true)<br />
<br />
How do I know?  #1 happened to me on 5/8 due to the faction bug.  I was kindly.  #2 happened tonight (5/9) turning in again with ALLY faction.<br />
<br />
That's 3 sets of the (3) Ghiosk books I've turned in over the last two days.  If you did it before the 5/8 patch, you should be fine.<br />
<br />
I have the exact words from the GM recorded, and I'll include the whole conversation (excerpting /gsay and /gu) after I get some rest.<br />
<br />
My personal recommendation for ALL shaman working their epics is NOT to deviate AT ALL.  Do not repeat steps.<br />

I'm back, after a few hours sleep.  Here's the conversation and activities I had with my server GM over this subject.  This is a follow-up to the previous day (5/8) when the Server GM replaced my Ghiosk books and watched them get eaten for my second time.<br />

GM - Hail GM XXXXXX here, Can I bug you for a moment?<br />
<br />
Me - Certainly friend.<br />
<br />
GM - Did you read the patch message?<br />
<br />
Me - Seems I wasn't mistaken last night.<br />
Me - Yes I did<br />
Me - Think I might have been the impetus for it<br />
Me - Sent Sony 2 feedbacks last night after I got off-line<br />
Me - and found I wasn't the only one having problems<br />
Me - :)<br />
<br />
GM - Yeah, I was thinking the same thing &amp; was wondering if you wanted to try it again?<br />
<br />
Me - Yes I would<br />
Me - That would be wonderful!<br />
<br />
GM - Ok, give me a few moments.<br />
<br />
Me - Gornit about to pop, so take your time :)<br />
<br />
GM - Ok, let me know when you want to head that way<br />
<br />
Me - About one minute and Gornit will be down<br />
Me - Ready for summoning whenever you are Sir. :)<br />
<br />
GM - OK, one moment I need to find your items again<br />
<br />
Me - heheh, ok, would names help?<br />

Spirit sentinel regards you as an ally - You could probably win this fight.<br />

<br />
Me - report sent to you /report XXXXXXXX<br />
(I used the GM's name for the report)<br />
<br />
GM - thanks<br />
GM - How did you get your faction up<br />
<br />
Me- I repeated the Shield of Falsehood once so far<br />
(I have also repeated the Tiny Gem to Bondl step a few times, but I didn't mention that as it was pre 5/8 patch.)<br />
<br />
Me - by killing Tabien the Goodly and Glaron the Wicked and turning in the Wandering spirit<br />
me - I have the tiny gem in inventory to turn that in again<br />
me - when I logged on I was already warmly<br />
me - which was one step up from last night<br />
me - doing nothing<br />
me - to Bondl<br />
me - I'm still waiting on the courier to do that step over<br />
me - I helped a friend turn in the Bondl gem today, though I didn't do it, was still in oot<br />
me - so i can verify today that the Greater Spirits in NFP work<br />
<br />
(I type rather fast, if some of this seems disjointed.  Imagine you are IG and it should be understandable)<br />
<br />
GM - Okay, want to hear the bad news<br />
<br />
me - and the wandering spirit in W. Karanas<br />
me - Uh ohh, yes I better<br />
<br />
GM - Seems for this part of the quest, your faction can be too high <br />
XXXXX comforts Frekkels<br />
XXXXX apologizes wholeheartedly to Frekkels<br />
<br />
me - so I can't do my epic because I did too much work?<br />
me - If I hadn't done the work today, it would have worked?<br />
<br />
GM- You can always kill one of the spirit sentinels<br />
(IS he serious?)<br />
me - Do you know how big a hit that is?<br />
me - and what their respawn is?<br />
me - I'll be happy to whack this one that keeps eating my books once :P<br />
me - If I know he'll take them the next time :)<br />
(revenge was sounding pretty good)<br />
<br />
GM - Okay, I take that back...However there must be a mob that lowers this faction<br />
<br />
me - I'm not aware of any<br />
(I didn't want to get a brush off, &quot;go lower your faction&quot;, and I really don't know if you can lower it from killing a non-quest mob)<br />
<br />
me - If I just skip this step, will ally be okay for turning in the icon to Kirn?<br />
me - or is that still too high?<br />
me - I can figure out why Sony did this<br />
me - To prevent ppl from getting out of going to the Hole<br />
me - as the 3 books are easy for most ppl to acquire with a little help<br />
me - but it hurts those who didn't want to cheat as well<br />
me - this is definitely a change from 05/07/02<br />
<br />
GM - yeah<br />
<br />
me - I just want my spear of fate :P<br />
me - Never thought doing more work would hurt that effort<br />
<br />
GM - You know I think if this is just a faction raising step then you should be fine.<br />
<br />
me - I'm hoping so<br />
me - You were here and saw I did the books<br />
me - Mind if I call on you when I go to do Kirn later?<br />
me - I'm not skipping anything<br />
<br />
GM- please do<br />
GM - Monday through Friday 3pm-11pm PST is when I work<br />
<br />
Me - ok, use a standard /petition, or a tell, or what?<br />
me- I have to get guild support for this<br />
<br />
GM - and give me a bit of lead time<br />
GM - /petition early and send me a tell as it gets close<br />
(How much more can you ask from a GM?  I want my (he's new btw) GM nominated for sainthood at this point)<br />
<br />
me - ok, we might be able to get a Hole raid setup for tonight, but usually we raid early<br />
me - in the am<br />
me - will do<br />
(I live EST, most of my guild is on PST, so what is late evening for them is VERY early AM for me.  Darn cross country move!)<br />
<br />
me - and thanks again for all your help and concern<br />
me - this is huge news for the shaman epic<br />
me - and I think this is a GOOD nerf<br />
me - to prevent ppl from skipping steps<br />
me - just that a small percentage of us at this step suffer because of it<br />
me - being caught unawares<br />
me - this is almost funny in an ironic way<br />
me - first I'm told the spirits do not hold me in high enough regard<br />
me - and a day later, I am too close a friend to be accepted by the same spirit<br />
(missing just a few lines here, but it was just chat about roleplaying, which I do)<br />
<br />
GM - None of us know the whims of the Gods :)<br />
<br />
me - very true<br />
<br />
GM- best of luck to you and let me know when you try the Hole...<br />
GM- Am I taking you back to OOT?<br />
(I gated to EFP already)<br />
me - nope<br />
me - I will let you know<br />
<br />
GM - okay, take care<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>dominan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">OMG. I just turned in the woe/envy/shield last night. and went back to rathe and got another set.<br />
I weren't able to turn it in since i couldn't find the spirit in WK. Thank god i read this.<br />
Anyone else able to confirm this &quot;too high faction&quot; thing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Ok, since I'm probably not going to be finishing my epic anytime soon, I'm just going to wait and hope that they fix this &quot;faction can't be too high&quot; thing. I never had any intention of skipping any parts of the quest, but I did the part up through the Shield of Falsehood twice, because (a) I thought it was actually kind of fun and (b) I'd read advice on these boards that said to do just that, as a way to guarantee that you had the necessary faction for each step along the way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If they truly messed up the factions, and you can have them too high, a few possibilities jump to mind.<br />
<br />
1) Petition, ask for your Truespirit faction to be reset.  Bit drastic, but they messed it all up, and you really need a clean slate to start over again.  In all honesty, the early parts of the epic are easy enough - unlike some classes.<br />
<br />
2) Lower your own faction.  I caught a post by someone, accidently helped someone kill the Wandering Spirit in EK, and took the faction hit.  Might also search Alla's, as I'm sure there are other ways to lower it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Azhdarkhos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">There is a very real problem with trying to 'adjust' your faction standing downward - there is no way of telling where your faction needs to be to do any particular step.  Most of the middle steps take place at 'Kindly' faction - how do you know where in that faction range you stand and what faction you will need for a particular turn-in?  The npc gives the same response when it eats an item regardless of whether your faction is too high or too low.<br />
<br />
This is fairly insane :/<br />
Kind of like treating nosebleed by applying a tourniquet to the neck.<br />
<br />
Right now the only way to tell if you are outside the faction 'window' is to turn something in and see if gets eaten, with no good fix available if there is a problem.<br />
<br />
This has me greatly concerned.  So far I have done the epic correctly, in the correct order.  Unfortunately after turning in Neh's Diary, I turned in a second set of Ghiosk's books (long before the patch - guild was trying to get Jade Reavers and both shaman in the raid got Ghiosk books and more sets rotted.)  Will Rak eat the Tear because &quot;Your faction standing with True Spirit cannot possibly get any better?&quot;  It's not exactly easy to replace the Tear - took about a month before we were lucky enough to catch the Golems up at the same time we could muster sufficient forces to do the raid.<br />
<br />
I fully understand the desire to 'fix' the quest so it will only work as originally designed, but this quick-and-dirty 'fix' is a fubar, and I foresee it causing a *lot* more problems than it actually solved.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Just occurred to me that this also screws anyone who has to repeat steps because of a botch (failed raid, turned in items to wrong sentinel spirit, whatever.)  Repeating steps to make a second attempt will likely involve more faction hits, and possibly bump you out of the faction 'window' needed to complete that part (and subsequent parts.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yes, dammit.. that was me who took the hit for helping the guy fight the wisp-cum-spirit in WK.<br />
<br />
It was a sizeable faction hit.  I'd already done everything short of acquiring the Child's Tear (which I finally got last night!)<br />
<br />
It took a LOT of time to repair (via books / Woe,Envy,Marr's Promise)...  Now I'm afraid that when I turn in the Tear, it'll be eaten.  <br />
<br />
I'm really not that interested on another 9 trips to Fear to get a tear, and having to deal with the Hole again, and another hr+ in the water waiting for Abe, and...<br />
<br />
Well, crap.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Want to clarify that I *did* repair faction,  all the way to Max Faction.  I was ally before The WK Wisp Event.  Concerned that I'm too high now. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">To add to that, I wonder if I should /petition prior to turning in the tear?  I really have no interest in making GMs already hectic lives more so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Shandy, <br />
<br />
I wouldn't do anything with the tear unless I had a GM standing next to you when you turn it in. IF you are max ally faction, you should be okay. I would petition your server GM (not just a guide, though you might need an initial guide petition just to find out when your server GM is on) and have a discussion with him/her to feel them out on the subject. <br />
<br />
I would imagine there is a server GM board where this problem is being discussed. The server GM's aren't the ones who wrote the code that made these changes. Maybe you will get lucky and have a nice one. The GM's know the Truespirit faction is buggy by now (I hope) and should be receptive to being present for the turn in on their shift. Hopefully you can arrange forces to match that time period. <br />
<br />
That's my problem right now for Kirn. Can't get a Hole group together unti AFTER my NICE server GM is off.  <br />
<br />
My GM replaced 2 sets of Ghiosk books for me. You can probably (being polite and courteous) get a replacement tear if Rak eats your first one if the GM is there. A second replacement might be pushing it, but at least after the first one you can do Bondl a hundred times or something until you are max ally. That's sad really, as the faction code change was designed to reduce people repeating steps, not increase it. <br />
<br />
Take care and GOOD LUCK! <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Aye, I'm max Ally now.<br />
<br />
Gonna go for it in 2 weeks.  Will /petition beforehand (or send an email to the server GM) to ensure max ally won't break the quest.<br />
<br />
If the GM says it does, I'll (1) Ask him politely to reset my Truespirit faction, (2) post it here, (3) start the damn quest again.  At least at 51 waiting for Abe shouldn't be too worrisome if Invis t'animals drops.<br />
<br />
And aye, the GMs seem to be a nice bunch, from the (thankfully) few times I've had t'ask something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Shenlon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">OK, i haven't started my epic at all...but i have managed to acquire 2 sets of ghiosk books, should I try to turn them both in? or just do the quest normally?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I petitioned this morning to ask.  Guide suggested I email the server GM.<br />
<br />
Letcha know what happens.<br />
<br />
I'd strongly recommend doing the quest normally.  Heck, I'd recommend it even if there weren't this faction issue :)<br />
<br />
I used extra Ghiosk books, etc, to repair faction I managed to screw up.<br />
<br />
My belief is that they put this &quot;breaker&quot; in to prevent people from just turning in Ghiosk books to max their faction.  I wouldn't be surprised if we found out that folks can no longer harvest Tabien &amp; Glaron for repeat faction as well.  ( &quot;Whoops, I see you're warmly, ok now, bye!&quot;) <br />
<br />
It could very well be that the rest of the quest (which requires high faction) will be unaffected (but you'll now, in essence, be required to do them to get the faction hits you'll need to complete the quest).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Actually, it's really a stupid way of going about it.  They SHOULD have known that human nature would lead to people trying to shortcut all of the epics, and made them all require a turn-in to continue.<br />
<br />
Fix for ours, without messing with factions?  Get an item from the spirit in EJ after handing in Neh'Ashir's diary, that you have to hand to the Iksar Broodling, to either receive the tear or respawn it.  Same difficulty, of getting to Fear &amp; killing golems, but cuts out the shortcut.  Haven't looked in depth on many other epics, but that kind of thing should be in for ALL major quests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Kieran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I wasn't trying to short-cut anything, but I've turned in an extra couple sets of books just because they were there (only shaman in zone while people raiding reavers) and I thought it would be good insurance having my faction higher. Since I can't normally play during the hours when GMs are on, if this really is how things are now I'm screwed.<br />
<br />
Please folks, continue to post more on this issue if you hear more.</div></div><hr />

My server GM contacted me (!) a day after I saw him in Thurgadin starting a new guild for someone.  I haven't had a chance to try Kirn in the Hole yet since my last post about this (around a month ago).<br />
<br />
The GM created a FrekkelsX and checked my faction.  Turns out I had 3-4 times the required Truespirit Faction for the Ghiosk books turn-in.  The May patch faction levels specifies a certain faction range for certain steps.  My GM wouldn't give me the details (obvious spoiler data he couldn't give) but did confirm my personal faction level with respect to that step greatly exceeded the range (if you hadn't repeated any steps).<br />
<br />
If you'll remember, I made 3 attempts to turn in the Ghiosk books, all of which failed.  In between the first and second attempt, I repeated the tiny gem (to Bondl) and Shield of Falsehood portions of the quest.  (I had already repeated the Bondl step many times before, as I happen to solo in OOT alot.)<br />
This is what messed up my faction levels.  I might have been okay with the extra Bondl turn-ins, but Shieldx2 definitely is too big a faction bump.<br />
<br />
The GM thinks I should be okay for the Kirn turn-in, even without a successful Ghiosk turn-in because my faction levels are greater than required.  When I finally raid the Hole, I'll post with that information.  I hope he's right. :D<br />
<br />
My Recommendation: If you have any questions about your faction levels for the GHIOSK BOOKS turn-in, petition your GM to check your current Truespirit faction range.   This is possible, but may take some time depending on the size of the queue your GM is working on, as it isn't a high priority petition (compared to Beneath World, death-loop, etc. requests).  Don't expect alot of information from your GM, merely a &quot;too low, too high, you should be okay&quot; kind of response.  Most of the GM's are aware of this problem, and if you are polite and not trying to cheat the quest by skipping steps.  I don't know (but would be doubtful) if Guides can assist in this type of petition.  Don't let a Guide tell you it can't be done, because it CAN.<br />

Okay, lessie, you get faction hits at: Bondl (gem), Oolyn (gem), Spirit (gem/Woe), Spirit (gem/Dire), Spirit (logs/Ghiosk), Kirn (death), Neh'Ashiir (death/ring). <br />

Dangit, I forgot about this post and now I don't remember what my point was. Anyways, seems to be this whole faction bit is just silly and the epics should just be done strictly by turn-ins. I'm helping my friend with his rogue epic and it's a lot less of a hassle to simply get what you need instead of worrying about faction.<br />
<br />
Slightly off-topic, from looking over the turn-in sequences, it seems if you don't combine the books first, will the spirit give it back to you since NPCs don't take things they don't want anymore?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, actually, for most people doing the shaman quest (barring any odd buggy things like Frekkels) if you get what you need and do each stop once, you don't have to worry about faction.<br />
<br />
I did each step once, never even conned the TrueSpirit mobs (didn't even think to!) and the quest worked perfectly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Heelah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">the one time a gave a container to an npc, it was handed back to me, and everything inside it got eaten =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>BryeLLe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Agreed, if you do every step correctly, it should give you the right faction. Should. But people have gotten pretty screwed up by faction problems that wouldn't exist if the quest progressed by simply turning things in. The original poster, assuming nothing went wrong, wasn't able to turn in the Ghiosks books. Another poster in Frekkel's other thread also had the same thing happen. And then there's Frekkel.<br />
<br />
The quest can be very frustrating for players who can't always muster the forces to do certain parts, myself included. I'd be pretty upset if I got all the items I needed but due to a bug or whatever, I wasn't able to turn the items in, and even more so if the items got eaten through no fault of mine. <br />
<br />
I, too, almost killed the wandering spirit by accidentally hitting the attack key (I have since moved it). I zoned out, but if I had killed the spirit, it'd be a mess trying to &quot;repair&quot; my faction. Just totally unnecessary...</div></div><hr />

By NO MEANS did my server GM advocate cheating the epic quest in any way.<br />
<br />
My post was to let those who had ALREADY started their epic (before the May patch) that there is a viable way of checking before the Ghiosk turn-in to see if you are okay faction-wise beforehand.  Does this promote skipping the Test of Patience?  I don't think so, but some may exploit that.  Waiting for Abe and his friends isn't difficult at all, just very time consuming, boring, with occasional periods of worry if you are alone and killer shark paths near.<br />
<br />
If you are just beginning your epic, you shouldn't have ANY of these problems IF YOU do it the way you are SUPPOSED to.  Don't skip any steps.  Don't repeat any steps.  Do it the way the quest was intended.<br />
<br />
I messed up.  Before the May patch, I had already done the Bondl step several times, merely because it was convenient to do so while I was camping Gornit to whack Surestout.  I repeated the Shield step the day AFTER my server GM mistakenly told me my faction was too low.  There was also an emergency patch that probably also threw a wrench in the works in the interim.  The same GM contacted me on the day I re-did the Shield to say he was wrong, and if I was ready to try again.  The past history w/ extra Bondl's *MIGHT* have been okay, but the double shield deal definitely was too much.  Now I'm ally faction, have no Ghiosk books turned in (w/ 3 attempts throughout this ordeal), and will take out Kirn when my guildleader gets it on the calendar.<br />
<br />
I'm not skipping any steps.  I'm not advocating skipping or repeating steps.  Myself and som others partially through the quest when the May patch came through have been caught in the middle.<br />

Another bump after a week of nothing.<br />
Finally gathered a guild force to go to The Hole.<br />
<br />
We had 10 people, with 3 people being hot-boxed.<br />
60 Paladin<br />
59 Enchanter<br />
56 Warrior<br />
55 Druid<br />
55 Bard<br />
54 Cleric<br />
54 Wizard<br />
53 Shaman (me ;))<br />
49 Enchanter (for Kindle)<br />
50ish Necro<br />
<br />
Considered Kurn an Ally.  Received the proper faction hits, exp (nice!) and the no drop ring dropped, which I happily looted after my rez. :p<br />
<br />
To refresh, I was never able to successfully turn in the Ghiosk books due to Truespirit faction too low (initially) or too high (later).<br />
<br />
I hesitated to post an update here, as the facts tend to lend themselves towards workarounds.  I still maintain the EASIEST WAY TO DO OUR EPIC IS TO PERFORM THE QUEST AS IT IS INTENDED!  Do not repeat or skip steps and you won't go through the pain, aggravation, and worry that I have had to.<br />
<br />
I'll post again after Neh/Rak, which should happen later today.<br />
(Need a few mages...:D)<br />

Take care,<br />

Closing chapter in my faction problems.<br />
Neh and Rak both gave proper faction hits and aggroed as they were supposed to.  Neh's diary turn in, and the scale turn-in, were also without incident.  Neh and Rak both conned Ally.  Final turn in gave the max'ed faction message.<br />
<br />
I am now a proud owner of the Spear of Fate, conscience clear in that I didn't &quot;cheat&quot; any portion of the quest.<br />
<br />
I'm hoping my story will help persuade future Heyokah to stay on the one true path, and not seek to subvert the ways of the spirits.<br />
<br />
Take care,<br />
