<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Would it be possible for a well-equipped Shaman to solo the Halls of Testing with single pulls?<br />
<br />
I've been trying to come up with near-suicidal-but-could-be-pulled-off-with-the-luck-of-the-devil solo encounters for those times I get bored of AAing and am not in the mood to go buff and help newbies. <br />
<br />
Is this feasible? and what are the criteria for picking a soloable MoB? Slowable, being able to keep up with their DPS output while dishing out enough of your own in return? Anything I'm missing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, you have little choice of mobs unless you are following someone in.  The biggest problem is the resists, and getting around those.  At 65, you can single pull the ledge (just inch up the side and he'll agro), but I was never able to land a slow.  Get him agro'd, get malos in, then try to sini/turgurs from there.  I didn't have a tash stick, with one of those you might get lucky enough to get slow in.  Once that happens, it's an easy fight.<br />
<br />
I tried probably 5-6 times at one point when I was really bored (had a cleric logged outside).  I did, however, successfully slow and live against a wyvern once after a doze raid (pre-PoP).  I was kos and waiting for coh to ntov areas, and someone agro'd it.  It killed an sk and monk, but I landed slow and got him to about 70% before someone came back and helped finish it off.<br />
<br />
The racnars would be really easy, if you had your pick of mobs, followed by drakes, then the weak wyverns, then the normal wurms, then the tough wyverns (the ones that quad), IMO.</div></div><hr />
