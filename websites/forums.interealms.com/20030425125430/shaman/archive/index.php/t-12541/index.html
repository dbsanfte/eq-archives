<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Nothing says &quot;cute&quot; like a baby dog; a puppy.  Regardless of breed or size, the young of man's best friend are treated as well as many human children are.<br />
<br />
Many experts claim that our attraction to babies (and baby animals, for that matter) is due to instinct; that our natural instincts tell us to recognize the young, and to love, nurture, and protect them.  What are these cues?  Mainly large eyes and a disproportionately large head.<br />
<br />
Example 1:<br />
<br />
http://www.i-dog.com/board/messages/5462/20017.jpg<br />
<br />
Notice how cute this beagle puppy is; the large eyes are telling of its young age.<br />
<br />
Example 2:<br />
<br />
http://www.cockapoobabies.com/Bluebonnets2.jpg<br />
<br />
Again, the large eyes.  Notice that this puppy is also doing something &quot;cute&quot; - smelling a flower.<br />
<br />
Example 3:<br />
<br />
http://www.cockapoobabies.com/lucy.GIF<br />
<br />
I don't even need to say anything.  This puppy's picture is next to &quot;cute&quot; in the dictionary.<br />
<br />
What conclusions can we draw from this?  I don't know, but it won't matter much, as this post will be put in the grey in 3 (my estimate) to 12 (loptar's estimate) from the moment I post it :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't understand why you post this here if you know it belongs in the grey.  If you are doing this just to make more work for the mods here, please stop.<br />
<br />
I don't understand why people think that the grey is such a bad place, I read it everyday.  There's lots of things that people have to talk about that aren't even marginally shaman related that are worth reading.<br />
<br />
Like cute pictures of puppies, other games, why they hate uber guilds, why they hate druids... etc.</div></div><hr />

What can we conclude from this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">that these people are out to grief the mods and should be fed to the fishies in Kedge?</div></div><hr />
