<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sekz family</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">well, after playing this damn game since phase 2, im running out of things to kill with my small army which consist of..<br />
<br />
63 monk<br />
63 shaman<br />
63 cleric<br />
52 bard<br />
53 rogue<br />
 <br />
optional 50 ranger which im babysitting.<br />
<br />
yes i can play these all at once, and i do so regualary. 90% of the time i only play the shaman, monk and cleric with a trader mule going.<br />
<br />
my question to you guys is, what can you guys think of that i can go kill, farm, whatever you want to call it.<br />
<br />
i normally farm Lodizal, Up named mobs, Radir, named Moktors, COM reavers, SG, i know i can do WW dragons, but dont want to do faction work to repair what i screw up. kael arena, POG.<br />
<br />
ideally, i would like ideas with just the 3 main toons, but ill listen to all.<br />
<br />
toons are fairly well equipped. shaman has epic, all the important lvl 63 spells. monk is nicely equipped as well greatstaff of fourwinds, pushing 1400 AC, with 5500hps. cleric has FT5, max wis, and if pissed off can dish out some mean DPS with her summoned hammer.<br />
<br />
my Bard is mainly a manabattery, and haste song. Rogue, i really dont use that much.<br />
<br />
i have been waiting to get Talendor to spawn so i can give him a try. i wiped out to ragefire a few lvls ago, iirc all toons were lvl 61ish, but i wiped out to him at 60%.<br />
<br />
looking for any mob ideas mainly for the challenge, but also for new pp farming mobs.<br />
<br />
let me know what ya can think of</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hail,<br />
<br />
What PoP flags do they have?<br />
<br />
Farming for cash would be epic pieces that are chainable and LoY named (Overseer &amp; the other fellow...Taskmaster I think?)  There is still a brisk market for Phinny pieces, Sky pieces, and the like.  Would be interesting to see how far in Sky you could get with that crew after getting a port up. =)<br />
<br />
You could try HoT.  It wouldn't be very fast (or very profitable likely), but you could do it I think.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sekz family</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">besides the normal flags gained at lvl 55 and 62,<br />
<br />
Potatics is about it.<br />
<br />
ideally i would like a place where i dont have to move around a whole lot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let the man enjoy the challenge, the game is different for different peeps.. anyway :) REALLY good money would be rhag 1.. you might need a warrior but the monk might be able to pull it off :) he has dropped GRC every time I have killed it (4x).. and the PC on grc is infinite? anyway I'm sure you can sell it for 100k or something ridicilous..<br />
<br />
Also IMO spending a few days in CT to get ft3 boots for your cleric at least and maybe your shaman/bard would be nice too..</div></div><hr />

Being so judgemental, arrogant, and condescending I'm amazed that you would even know what &quot;grouping with others&quot; is. I find it hard to believe anyone would put up with you very long in a group environment.<br />
<br />
Leave others to enjoy the game the way THEY want to. Don't be a dick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I 2nd what VAlgoth said. <br />
<br />
    Can never get it through peoples head i like running 2 to 3 computers and looking for big stuff to kill sometimes. Doesnt mean i always do. Doesnt meant it effect you any if its all i do. What tells are for. I can chat all night if i choose too. I group too but its still somewhat amazing the amount of people who think ive never grouped. <br />
 <br />
<br />
 Anyway Sek have you tried some of the CT camps? You'd have no trouble with the FT boots and some other stuff can drop from the next rooms. I'll have to think some more i'm kinda looking for stuff myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">lvl them all to 65 then you can take some serious ****.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">GRC off rhag 1 is damn rare,  but would be a fun fight for your crew shoudlnt be tough either.</div></div><hr />
