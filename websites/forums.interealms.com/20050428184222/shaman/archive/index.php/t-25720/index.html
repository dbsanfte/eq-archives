<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>LARRY</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So Im in Ah yesterday and see a 1hd mace (blue) no special bonuses or procs... just a basic level 49 + like 8stam/str think it was Viking hammer.... the buyout is 80gp and the beginning bid is 15...the hammer has just been put in auction since I had looked at 1hd maces about 20 mins before and it wasnt there.<br />
<br />
I think hrmm thats not a bad weapon and its a 5 damage upgrade to my current... Ill wait and see what happens with it.<br />
<br />
I go back late late last night and look.... its at short status and not a single bid..... so im like hell ya and toss a bid on it.<br />
<br />
No sooner than I did this im out bid.... it goes back and forth till the item is up to 35gp and the time level has changed back to very long... Im like *** is going on? no one bids on the item for like 10 hours then some moron comes and blasts the price and time in a bidding war.. so I go to walk away... turn around and the seller is standing right behind me.... and asks me? why did you stop bidding on my item....<br />
<br />
Im like you dumbass lamer... you were sitting there outbidding me trying to burn me on a mace that no one wanted for 10 hours at 15gp and you think Im gonna bid over 35gp for a 5 damage upgrade?<br />
<br />
He says ya thats how you play this game....<br />
<br />
Needless to say I flipped him a bird and walked away.... he sent me another tell saying he would let me buy it out at 60gp if I had the money right then.....<br />
<br />
Hes on ignore now... remmeber this is a blue item with no special anything on it.....<br />
<br />
Classic</div></div><hr />

If you want an item badly just pay the buy out price.<br />
<br />
If you want it cheap wait till the last minute.<br />
<br />
If you try to get it cheap dont be offended if the item is pulled from the auction or if you are outbid. Simple as that</div></div><hr />

<br />
Was not aware you could bid on your own items.<br />
<br />
Here's another oddity.<br />
<br />
If an item has a buyout price of 6 GP, and I have the highest bid at 3.4 G, I cannot simply buy it out for 2.6 more gold, I have to come up with another 6 G. (at which point I would get my 3.4 back)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yup, it's lame, but it's life.  Just take it in stride and keep going.<br />
<br />
I like the AH system, but it's stories like this that make me almost miss the old EQ bazzaar system.  The AH system is a more modern and dynamic approach that some people find fun, even more fun than the more combat or exploration oriented aspects of the game.<br />
<br />
I only bid once on an item, if I get outbid, screw it.  I've also got into the habit of not bidding on items that have an unreasonable or no buyout at all.  I don't know what market values are, but I know what I want to pay for items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Skarzon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That's a pretty lame tactic.  Keep bidding on your own items to pump up the price...I'm sure he had a second account just waiting around to screw somebody.  My policy is to only bid once, unless it's something I really want, then I'll set a ceiling that I won't go over.  I will never get into a bidding war though, if someone outbids me as soon as I up my bid, I'm done.<br />
<br />
As far as just paying the buyout price, yeah right. Lets pay 75 gold for an item we can bid 15 gold for... :rolleyes:  I almost always buy out on things I really want/need, but not when the difference of the bid and the buyout are 50 gold.<br />
<br />
It's a fair tactic to pull the item if the bids haven't gotten high enough for you, but bidding up your own auctions is lame.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ha, I found that out the hard way too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I am fairly sure you cannot bid on your own items, you can only cancel the auction.  If the seller was doing that it would have had to be on a separate account.<br />
<br />
Like most auction doping attempts, he ran the risk of winning the auction and being stuck with the item minus the comission, so its really not that unfair.  I prefer using reasonable buyouts.  Open ended auctions take longer and are much less likely to sell in my experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kryscha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You can't bid on your own items (or use another character on your account to do the bidding) but it's pretty well known on Killrogg that a few people have either a second account, or a guildmate/friends account to bump up the bids. I mean, hell, if you win your own item from pushing the bids up too high, you're only out the deposit.  It's a numbers game, and so long as they think they're winning, they'll keep doing it. <br />
<br />
It's next to impossible to prove it's happening unless you get a moron like the one you've just had, or you have people admit it in general or something.  <br />
<br />
As Juventus said, reasonable buyouts are far more likely to sell than open-ended or stupidly high buyouts/starting bids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You can't bid on your own auctions.<br />
He was using a 2nd account.<br />
I tried to transfer an item from my horde character to my alliance character via the Gadgetzan AH, but it said I can't bid on my own auction.<br />
So I just had someone else buy the buyout and I bought it from him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Just feel satisfied that he just spent a nice 15% commission on an item he already owned outright.  You did good to back out of that one!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Great news.  If the asshats are sitting in AH bidding on their own items... that's fewer of them joining my pickup groups or ganking my silver mines.  *grin*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ranlron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Min/maxers will always find a way to try and ruin the game. AH scammers, stat crunchers, it's all the same. It's too difficult to just have fun I guess.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry to rain on the parade, but some people find &quot;min/maxing&quot; fun.  Maybe its my personality, but I like to find the best possible way to do something and then continue to do it or move on to something new and figure it out.<br />
<br />
In terms of the original post, I find it hilarious that (assuming he was padding his auction) he had the gall to ask you why you stopped bidding and offered a substantially high buyout.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>LARRY</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Was at Ah again yesterday... hammer was gone, hit AH about 6 hours later last night.... Same hammer same seller... price min bid 35gp... buyout 80.....same price he boosted it to when I was bidding<br />
<br />
Guess the conclusion that he was padding his bid is correct.... and still no one has bid on it but me and him~ LOL.... gonna check it again tonight just for kicks and see if any bid at all has come through... I really will laugh my butt off if its at short time and min bid at 35....<br />
<br />
What comes around goes around i guess.... If its there Ill send him a tell...Gratz on selling your hammer to a vendor for 1.5 gp when you could of made 20gp on it you greedy lamer =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">For 35 gold that hammer better proc Monica Belluci.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I havent read through this yet. BUT people with 2nd accounts can easily jack the price us as you bid on their item. I have a few people i suspect of doing that. <br />
<br />
Ive actually heard someone ask in say &quot;is it wrong to bid up your own items&quot;<br />
<br />
Since that time i always set myself up so i can see everyone else when i bid. If its short like that larry and someone is dive bomb bidding I tend to suspect the worst. People arent as slick as they think as they tend to have the buyer alts around alot when they are. <br />
<br />
I dont like being like that but people have proven to me they will do stuff like that in this game.</div></div><hr />
