<br />
For regular mobs, this spell does not resist that bad on npcs. Infact this spell doesnt even have an initial DD.  So since this spell is the fastest/most effective spell we have, this is probably the only one i will use in a group.     BUT, <br />
<br />
Your target has resisted your Bane spell !<br />

You do not have the mana to cast this spell. <br />
<br />
  as far as pvp goes, your target has to be 75mr or lower, THATS RIGHT 75mr OR LOWER.  <br />
Now i am sure you might get lucky and get one off if the person has higher then that, but I dont think it is worth my mana.<br />
<br />
Every class that has dots, always has some sort of lure based dot exept us.  I guess we just arent liked compared to other classes.   :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ya, I saw the neg 30 mod on druids dots and laughed.  (fire at that, most people of course have much higher MR than any other stat)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah, I had hoped bane might give us an actual useful dot for pvp. Sigh. Guess I wont sweat it and will just save points to buy some 40hps augs =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>NinthSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">thanks for the hot info and saving me 600 pts =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If they ever change the resist, I would buy it. But it's useless for PVP as it is now. (like most other dots are)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Actually, it was nearly unresistable on test. It was really fun when i was hitting people with this spell with no resist message.<br />
But as we all know, its forbidden for any shaman to have fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Every class that has dots, always has some sort of lure based dot exept us.<br />
<br />
Because we can debuff every resist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Woot, i can bring down the average resist, which is around 200 now, to 140.   That will make a HUGE differance, especially when you have to get them down to 75 for our dot to work.<br />
Thx for the info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You made the connection, I explained it for you.<br />
<br />
And you don't have to get MR down to 75 for it to land.  Bane has the same resist modifier (none) as blood of saryrn - can you only land BoS on people with 75 PR?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Because we can debuff every resist.<br />
<br />
Can't druids debuff fire pretty well?<br />
<br />
I hate this argument anyhow.  Druids/necros/wizards/etc. benefit twice as much from our maloxxx on raids/groups than we do...  why?   I don't get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I thought about that as well looking at the resist mod on the druid spell:<br />
<br />
At 61 druids get a 3.5 second casting time 72 point fire debuff with a  <br />
(-200) resist check. They can decrease fire reist another 35 points with their illumination of Ro spell if they want. On top of this they get a -30 resist adjust on their DoT. <br />
<br />
You can't say that we shouldn't get a resist mod because of malos. <br />
<br />
We are getting shafted. I did feedback on this everday I was on beta and was hoping they'd give us a resist mod. No go there.<br />

<br />
Just to be pedantic, that is incorrect.<br />
<br />
Mages have 2 DoTs. Neither of which have a resist mod on them. It isn't exactly surprising that you didn't know about them (or forgot) - most mages pretend that they don't exist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Ok, since you want to technical, i will rephrase it.  Every &quot;true DoT class&quot; has a lure type Dot(s) exept shaman, which also have debuff spells.   <br />
Let me ask you something, What spell can we acutally use for pvp anymore.   <br />
-Its definatally not our Malos, since peoples resist are so high, that malos doesnt make a difference.<br />
- ALL of our dots gets resisted now.<br />
- Dont even get me started on our pets.<br />
- And our DD would probably bring someone down 1/4 hp before we are oom.<br />
<br />
I am thinking &quot;annul magic &quot; would be our only pvp spell we can use that will work ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Spear of torment is about the only damage spell that works in pvp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I agree that there's a problem with resistable spell reliant classes in PVP - i.e. shamans and necros.  Druids can get around the resist factor by relying more on force of nukeage than anything else, without those nukes they would pretty much be in the same boat as we are.<br />
<br />
But adding a resist modifier to the spells is not the answer.  This is a PVE game, and the xp/raid mobs we fight aren't decked out in full Time gear and don't have 300 in every resist.  Bane doesn't need a resist modifier to land on a soldier of fire/steelslave bruiser/etc.  It's unfeasible to think that the fix for a PVP-only problem is to make changes that would affect everyone.<br />
<br />
IMHO the solution is to do another sliding resist adjustment like they did about a year ago but hey I've been bitching about it for months :x</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Necros?  huh?   Trust me, necros don't need any help landing spells in PvP.  At least not on SZ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Personally I'm not really talking about PvP since I've done one PvP event in the last year. I would like the resist mod so that we have one spell that can be cast without debuffing first like everyone else gets. Do you really have time to malos every mob in LDoN?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Volotani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">malo line debuffs more pvp than it does pve. just dont expect it to matter much when u have guilds like Afterlife and Defiant running around proccing rune effects and having 250 resists on average.<br />
<br />
only way i can see to drop somebody with resists like that is malos and pray to whatever you believe in that you can stick something =/<br />
<br />
btw, not sure if malo line does more on other servers but i know it does on VZ</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Screw dots. win your duels with Quiescence, Tnarg's, Canni, and melee.  Sharkspine Club or Hammer of Hours both work fine; Dark Mace of Thought if you're oldschool, yo~ (then you'd throw in pois dd's, with the extra mana).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Because we can debuff every resist.<br />
That would make sense as an excuse if the mana cost and casting time of Bane were half of what they are, as to compensate for having to cast Malos to land it :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">btw, not sure if malo line does more on other servers but i know it does on VZ<br />
<br />
On bluebie servers, in either arenas or duels, there is a 50% added bonus to all negative resist modifiers.  So, if you can land it, malosinia is -105 to resists.  It helps a little, but it isn't enough.  We desperately need some kind of unresistable damage.  Once I have malos on, I can almost always get spear of torment to hit for at least something, but against someone with good resists it usually only comes out to a few hundred damage, at most.  If you're fighting a knight with a rune proc weapon, or a class that can cast rune, there is just nothing you can do to hurt them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">That would make sense as an excuse if the mana cost and casting time of Bane were half of what they are, as to compensate for having to cast Malos to land it :p<br />
<br />
Actually, even then it wouldn't considering it takes extra time to cast the debuff(halving the cast time still wouldn't offset this), 1 or more limited debuff slots on NPCs and it can be dispelled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">By the time your Bane lands malos will already be dispelled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">vrs time/ep geared players I am 95% usless in pvp, I can strip buffs and heal. malos is nice for the druids/wizards/mages/whoever else has spells but for me, the one who cast the spell it does Nothing. I can sit there an dchain bounce every single spell in my book other than the poison nukes...which end up as partial resists most of the time. its pretty sad when a 65 shaman has to resort to MELEE to do any kind of damage at all simply because of gear.<br />
<br />
all of our poison dots should have resist modifiers, they are our best source of damage we have, when I pvp with people in average gear and that stuff sticks I can actually get kills now and then. vrs endgame peeps its a joke, I just gate out and find something else to do. <br />
grats sony for putting players in GOD mode while leaving others stuck on Hurt me Plenty.<br />
<br />
****ers.<br />
<br />
(edit) and the druid line of magic dots all come with a neg100 resist check...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I'm just grumpy that it gets resisted all the friggin time in LDoN and then I have to wait another 30 seconds to cast it where as if Poison gets resisted I can recast right away.<br />
<br />
They need to do away with the recast time on that damn spell if you ask me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Lol, I still remember origionally posting this last year.  Anyhow,  I finally got used to this spell, and made a place for it in my book. <br />
<br />
Now,  I am just wondering how you guys land this spell in LDON ? <br />
<br />
 Generally it lasts an average of  3-4 ticks, after i spending time to debuff the mob. <br />
I use this spell acutally on raids for add mobs (if i have time).  Mostly because all raid mobs are malosed already. <br />
Rosrak's Greaves of the Primal + Bane (+ dot enhancing items) = a bit over 100dps.  <br />
 Now I figure 100dps is not bad to contribute to killing add mobs fast.  Now I know we can do more, but who wants to die anyhow.<br />
<br />
And as for PvP, everyone has their own style of doing it, im not going say anything about that anymore.</div></div><hr />
