<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kytra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I see a lot of messages from people saying they can't do X or Y, because they don't belong to an Uber guild. Well, I belong to a very small guild (so small that I'm the only level 60 and only epic)  and I still manage. I refuse to join Uber guilds just to have stuff handed to me. I prefer to meet my goals by making friends.<br />
<br />
Shaman are the easiest class to make friends with. I play the role of shaman to the best of my abilities and I like to help other people along the way. I often stop in newbie zones and buff the lower level characters. They appreciate it and I feel good about it. I often find that level 14 warrior is the alt of a level 60 Enchanter. :)<br />
<br />
When it came time to do my epic, those people were right there to help me. When a guild, with members I've helped numerous times, raided Fear they invited me to come along and loot the tear. When it came time to kill Rak, a few of those people jumped at the chance of helping me complete my epic.<br />
<br />
You have the best buffs in the game! Use them the way they were meant to be used and you will never 'need' to join those Uber guilds to meet your goals.<br />
<br />
That's just my $.02. I'm really tired at the moment, so I hope that didn't ramble too much. :p<br />

<br />
well, move on and look at the next bigger piuctures as killing mobs in Kael (Vindi, Statue, Tormax ..), ToV (Doze, NTov) , VP (Nameds), different bosses on Luclin.<br />
All those encounter are designed for a raiding guild with many of the desired classes. Sure you can do this with all those friends you got over time, but there is competition for those .. if you are to slow to get your raid organized, you won't see them.<br />
<br />
Thats the main reason to have a guild that is big and powerful enough to have the forces online to get to those mobs in time.<br />
<br />
If you don't have the intention to do those bigger mobs soon (and I am not even talking about VT), then you are fine with your way.<br />

We haven't gotten to the point of VT, but ToV is common occurrence now. If you play on Fennin Ro, and would like to participate, check out the link below.<br />
