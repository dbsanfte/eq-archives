<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Last night I was called a liar, a sicko &amp; an animal fornicater by a semi-respected lame shaman from this board who will remain nameless.<br />
<br />
He mentioned that it was a shame ya could not get kills with torrent, which I understand to be kinda correct. I then told him I killed a greenie (was undead fwiw) earlier while we were hunting.  Had a blue mob as well as some green yard trash, I lit off a torrent of poison &amp; went back to my other toon, wacking away at the blue mob. I saw &quot;a_green_mob_01 has been slain by Brat&quot; flash past.  The other shaman was downloading porn &amp; eating McNuggets at time &amp; missed that.<br />
<br />
My question, will torrent kill greens, but not blues, does it vary, or am I just a sick, lying, animal abuser?<br />
<br />
Hmmmmmm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It does damage.  If you do enough damage, how can you not kill anything?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">First time I cast it, I almost killed myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">rains are coded so that they cannot do the killing blow.  If you fight something try it out, if the last wave is the killing blow it will come back as resisted 100% of the time.  <br />
<br />
Personally I think Brat is on crack ;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've had a rain wave land a killing blow once . . . it was only once tho.  I think the code may change the resist rate on the last wave that would kill the mob to like 500 or something, but there's still that tiny little chance . . . <br />
That's what I think Brat saw, cuz I've seen it myself . . . once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>wuddaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">hmm I never talked of that before.. but I it happens to me once against greenies... Maybe in droga, not sure, but I m pretty sure I killed something with torrent..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Not 100% true Wildaar, I've used Torrent to wipe (very) low level camps for faction etc, and if a mob is puny enough it can most definately get a killing blow, I *think* its that if a mobs TOTAL hps are lower than 1 rain wave, it can do a killing blow, only on the first wave though, the other waves will still not kill if more low greens walk into it.<br />
<br />
So, it will kill very low greens, but nothing else =/</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hmm, the fact that it will kill very low greens supports my theory of it coded to have very high resist rates if the wave would kill the target.  High resist rates + very low level mobs = good chance of it still landing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The spell is coded to not hit past a certain level of hp, but it's based on PERCENTAGE HP, not ACTUAL HP.  I believe that if the mob is under 10 or 20% hp, then the wave will automatically be resisted.  Thus, greens have low enough HP that they can still be hit by the torrent because 540 hp on a green might be as much as 100% if you are fighting level 1 mobs.<br />
<br />
As far as I know, Torrent will only kill in that one situation where the mob has a max HP low enough such that 540 hp is a substantial percentage of their HP.  Test it!  :)<br />

I've taken to using it early now.  Nice to see the fwoggies in Seb drop a bubble per rain.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Torrents waves are resisted if the mob is at 10% or less. <br />
<br />
But if a mob has 540 or less hp then it can be killed because the spell hits before the 10% number is reached. <br />
<br />
Also try it on a mob with 1000 HP. It can kill it too.<br />
<br />
I use it against Krup Knights in Crypt alot. Makes nice work of the annoying pets on the lower level ones.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Cerum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Question: Does ToP have an altitude limit? Lets say you're in a room somewhere and there are mobs below you and above you, on different floors. If you used ToP, would it be limited to just your floor or would it hit the top/bottom floors too?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I killed my self with Torrent the first time i ever cast the spell. I think i con white to myself, but depends what gear i'm in...<br />

Duel him and torrent. He can cast ice strike. See who wins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Brat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I cant duel that freak :/ He has like 1900 ac, 27k mana &amp; 6khps unbuffed :/  I could prolly do they &quot;Hey look, is that Donnie Osmond??&quot; and then kick him in the beans as he turn to ooggle, but that is about it :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">you can kill pc's with torrent regularly.  I think this only applies to NPC's.  <br />
<br />
Thanks for the compliments Brat =-)  and thanks for knowing you can't kill me without tagging me in the sack ;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I'd turn to look for Marie Osmond.  But you couldn't fool me with Donnie.</div></div><hr />

This is in Howling Stones. Party was shaman, cleric, enchanter, wizard, paladin, and rogue plus shaman pet. This is one of only two times I think I've seen Torrent kill something that was blue to me, but I'm fairly certain that mobs in HS have more then 1k hitpoints! :D <br />
<br />
And no, I wasn't meleeing at the time or had any other dots on the skeleton.<br />
<br />
Thoughts?<br />
