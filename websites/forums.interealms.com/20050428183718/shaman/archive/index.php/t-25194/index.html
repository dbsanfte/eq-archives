<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kryscha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't know what type of game information you're looking for, but I tend to lurk around. The Warlocks Den (http://www.wowmb.net)   <br />
<br />
It's primarily Warlock based, but it has some good all-round info, and links to other class specific sites.  Good moderation as well (feels a lot like the crucible) so don't worry about those annoying twats from the 'official boards' sticking around there too long  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've decided to boycott info sites for the most part when i begin with WoW. Wow quests are not so cryptic or broken so they warrant double checking, and besides, the info sites take a lot of fun and surprise out of the game.<br />
<br />
However, to not hijack this thread even worse, i think you might have to wait a while to see wich of the info sites are best. With the game relatively new, i think it might be better to stick to the already known sites like Allakhazam and official forums until the specialized sites and class communities get air under their wings.<br />
<br />
Would be really cool if there was a crucible-like forum for wow out there someday, or better yet, the crucible evolved into something more :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I agree with Vigdis that it is best to try to avoid reading too much about the game in advance (but we all get tempted from time to time hehe).<br />
<br />
One thing that can be really hard to plan without outside help is how to spend Talent points. There's a fine Talent planner on Thottbot: <br />

and there is another fine one here:<br />
