Taking Wolfherz's post, I've boiled down the entire HO tree.  The following covers almost everything... the holes in current knowledge are noted.  I'll try to keep this post up-to date using Wolfherz's info.<br />
<br />
1 Class Chains<br />

1) Trinity Divide unordered (Star) + (Mask) + (Horn) = AoE DD<br />

3) Ancient's Embrace ordered (Lightning) -&gt; (Cloak) -&gt; (Arm) = Party Buff (3 min), has effect off &quot;Deals slashing damage to any creature that hits the wielder&quot; This sounds like a DS, but it didn't appear to work<br />
<br />

1) Nature's Growth unordered (Mask) + (Sword) + (Stones) = Group Regeneration <br />

<br />
4 Class Combo Chain<br />
<br />
Scout Inits -&gt; Fighter (Horn) -&gt; Priest (Moon) -&gt; Mage (Fire)<br />
1) Strength in Unity unordered (Arm) + (Chalice) = Str, Wis, Int and Agility Buff<br />
2) Ancient Demise ordered (Boot) -&gt; (Coin) -&gt; (Lightning) + (Hammer) = *unknown <br />
3) Past's Awakening ordered (Fist) -&gt; (Star) -&gt; (Cloak) = *unknown<br />
<br />
Note: Scout Mask Combat Art, when the Mask art is the final step used to finish the Heroic Opportunity (whether ordered or unordered), appears to require the scout to target a single mob while using the skill.  This is a known issue.<br />
 <br />
Helpful Hints: <br />
 <br />
1) A cleric never inits except for cleric-scout duo chain or a solo HO<br />
2) A mage never inits except for a mage-scout duo chain, or mage-cleric duo chain or a solo HO<br />
3) In a duo with a scout, the scout never inits unless it's to do a solo HO.<br />
4) In a 3-class or a 4-class group with a scout, the scout inits to create all 3-class or 4-class chains.  If no scout is present in the 3-class group then it's the fighter to inits for the 3-class chain.<br />
 <br />
They wanted scouts to be the masters of the HO wheel.  The last point, combined with the coin to reroll results, certainly makes them control it more than other classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gojirax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Mage starts -&gt; Priest (Hammer)<br />
1) Arcane Chalice ordered (Flame) -&gt; (Chalice) = Group Heal + Weak Power Regeneration<br />
2) Suffocating Wrath unordered (Hammer) + (Lightning) = Magic DD + Possible Debuff<br />
3) Ancient Crusible single (Moon) = Large Power and Health Regen Over Time *needs confirmed<br />
<br />
As a 2 Boxer that uses this particular HO Chain almost exclusively I'll add some corrections and notes:<br />
<br />
1) Arcane Chalice (Common) -&gt; (Chalice) = Group Power Regen ONLY (Regens around 1/3-1/2 bubble of power on completion, to trigger it the fastest I used Contagion after the Mage triggers, then fire off Static Pulse DOT on the Mage, then hit Totemic Aid on the Shaman)<br />
<br />
2) Suffocating Wrath (Uncommon, unless you REALLY wanted that power boost, in which case you'll get this 5x in a row) = AOE Magic DD (Around 35-ish to all encounter mobs) and no noticeable debuff, nor does it have any maintained buff icon.)<br />
<br />
3) Ancient Crucible (Note spelling) = INSTANT Power and Health regen (Very large) No regen over time, nor any maintained buff icon etc. Ultra rare.</div></div><hr />
