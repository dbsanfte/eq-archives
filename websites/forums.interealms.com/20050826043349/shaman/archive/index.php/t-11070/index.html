My names Moyes and I'm an Oracle.<br />
<br />
33 days 10 hours 12 minutes and few assorted seconds.<br />
Just shy of 12 months real time since Moyes was born.<br />
Blasted through the last 15% of 58 and all of 59 in a single play session in PoD.  And do you know what was the most satisfying thing?Scribing Malo,knowing I had looted the scroll from the cold  dead hands of the Emp in OS.</div></div><hr />

&quot;go outside, for real man&quot;<br />
<br />
It took him a year to get 60 with 33 days played.  That sound like a fairly reasonable ballance between RL and EQ.</div></div><hr />

&quot;If you lend someone $20 and never seem them again, it was problably worth it.&quot;<br />

Here's your 20 green Kklux, now disappear.</div></div><hr />

Kids these days! <br />
<br />
On the other hand I predict much shorter /played times for oracles these days.  PoP exp just makes things too easy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know there are some who feel that people posting accomplishments are doing nothing more than bragging or fishing for compliments.<br />
<br />
I however, believe that people should have recognition from people who are *supposed* to be like-minded individuals ;-)</div></div><hr />
