<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>nornez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">when is a good time for a shammy to try &amp; solo in POP? Had a loud mouth 58 druid in group tonight talking non-stop about how he has been soloing for the last 5 levels in PON. I hadn't even thought of soloing in POP yet... I'm sher the rats in POD would drop pretty ez but the chance of adds just seems a lil too much for the reward.<br />
<br />
If I could solo in PON I thought the rock camp would be a good place to pull treants or raven to... is this doable at 56 with just a 49 pet (can't find that spirit of the howler anywhere)? I just thought these mobs had way too much HPs to solo yet... no BoN yet either, so just plague &amp; EB to DoT with, JBB &amp; dogdog. Would it more trouble than it's worth if I could solo mobs in PON?<br />
<br />
TIA</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would say you want to get either the new pet or BoN before you want to do PoN or PoD mobs.  Otherwise the rats/treants/ravens would take a whole lot of mana/time to kill.  I did goo's a few times in PoD at 53, they don't seem to be as tough as the rats, but if I pulled 2 (which happened a few times) there was pretty much no way I was gonna make the kill.  They don't resist root too much but when they do they can take 600+ dmg off you real fast, even if slowed.  Definitely doable but it wouldn't be worth the trouble.  If you are careful to single pull goo's in PoD you should be fine.  I don't have JBB or epic but have mount (which I couldn't use often because I was forced to root rot cause pet couldn't tank em)</div></div><hr />
