<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Thanks for deleting my posts to the Grey! Good job. We wouldn't want to have anything possibly humorous or even mildly thought provoking on the main *bored*, would we?<br />
<br />
I'd like to congratulate you on your sterling work lately in keeping the Crucible free of everything of remote interest, and chock full of those class envy rants, whines, bitch*ng, and p*ssing on people's parades that is obviously what the readers of the board have voted for on the main page!<br />
<br />
Well done on reading people's minds and deciding what is best for them. <br />
<br />
I'lll leave you to it~~<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You are very welcome.  We live to please.  Just need to know if I should file this under humorous and mildly thought provoking, or with the rants, whines, and bitch*ing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Am I missing something or is this board a public forum for a fantasy game?<br />
<br />
I thought so - nothing is more infuriating than making the most earth shattering, important, momentous post on such an august setting as this only to find it's still on the boards just in a different location.<br />
<br />
. . . infuriating if you've never tried decaf I guess! :D<br />
