<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is it possible to have your last name changed or just outright deleted if you don't want it no more?  I often get odd tells ranging from the newb dog in whatever town to trying to speak french to me.  The first part I know how to take care of but the last name I have no clue.  Any help or ideas would be nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thlayli of Xev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">/petition Hello! I would like to have my last name removed please! Thanks!<br />
<br />
And wait!<br />
<br />
By the way, if you're on an alt or anything, they can still contact you and change it w/o the toon being on. I petitioned to have my ranger alt's surname changed and they responded/changed it while I was on my shammy :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah just petition it and they will change it.  Usually you can get it done pretty quick because it is one of the few things guides can do and it only takes a minute of their time.  I have a friend that changes her surname every week or so and she just sends a tell to a guide and they change it for her right there, since it is so easy.</div></div><hr />
