<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>MissShanone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all, Hubby and I are running out of interesting places to duo.  He has 65 rng (ornate/ldon gear round 6.8k hps buffed) with 180aa, and 65 shammy.  He is only flagged for Tier 2 and some of the GoD areas.  We are looking for some challenging spots we could duo in that would gain either loot/ exp/ or even better both.  We also have 64 war available to us.<br />
<br />
I am really hoping you all have some GoD areas it would be possible in, or perhaps some of the pre-PoP named, or ????<br />
<br />
Thanks for everything!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Exmo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">For Just Exp, SSRA is a pretty Good Duo spot...<br />
<br />
Should also try to get on an open MB raid, tactics would be Duoable to you two, and the Ogres Drop Highly polished gems, that are worth good PP in Bazaar, as well as the Stampeed Named Piggy.<br />
<br />
Also, If You can get into GoD and get Breath of Tushar, that will help your Duoing a ton, can Keep him up in most PoP places. <br />
<br />
Not sure you could Duo anywhere in GoD with Him at only 6.8k buffed, least Not for too Much worthwhile.<br />
<br />
Though Im pretty sure 25/25/25 Augs drop in Natimbi off the Ghosts, you can duo those.<br />
<br />
Ill try to think of More and get back to you =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>MissShanone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Havent tried Tactics........ always seems to be fairly camped here on Saryrn.  But will definately look into trying it.<br />
<br />
Not in a guild that is currently able to take named/access the areas that drop the GoD spells. (still working on talking friends into helping me there  :p  )  Do however have Q with SCRM and finds that works well in PoP and some Lower luclin boss mobs.<br />
<br />
Also anything in GoD root/rot- able?  We tend to do that with Rng doing bow damage.  Didnt know bout the Ghosts in Natambi, gonna have to give that a shot!!<br />
<br />
Thanks for the ideas Exmo,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">LOTS of GoD is root/rot-able, and if you and the ranger are both pretty skilled at moving and positioning mobs, a lot is open to you.<br />
<br />
Riwwi arena is an insanely good loot camp, you'll do that with no problem.<br />
<br />
Farming Barindu or Ferubi for random drops is harder, but I think you can work your way up to being able to do that as soon as you get a feel for how GoD mobs behave.  And the drops, although, rare, are absolutely worth the time. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd second the tactics idea. Go down to the pit and camp in the room outside the stables so you can nab the piglet when he comes, and pull mobs from the pit to there. Try to get any mini-named for chance of ornate and some SPs. Ranger should be able to tank them, but root-rotting is viable too (not sure how badly that will hurt ranger dps though?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>MissShanone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Cool thanks alot guys! Any particular mobs you do in Bardinu or Riwwi ?<br />
thanks~ Shanone</div></div><hr />
