<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Newtonio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been hanging around on 45 for 3 months now, waiting for my bro's shammy to catch up.  As soon as he hits 44 (nice new buffs) we are going to try to hit 50 together.  Any ideas on best place for us to do so?  Jagged Pine sounds favourite so far...<br />
<br />
Also, for the inevitable downtime when we can't group, any ideas on places to pass the time solo?<br />
<br />
My equipment is fairly OK - Tolans stuff, Treeweave, Spider Fur Belt, SCHW, Wurmy and CentiSS; no plans to upgrade for a while yet (and no more money anyway....)<br />
<br />
All replies eagerly anticipated!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Draghixia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not sure if it's changed but Nurga.  Spiders have 1237 hps spawn on 8 minute timers and can be solo pulled with snare.  to get to the spider farm follow these directions.<br />
<br />
Zonein, have the shammy shrink (not necessary if your swimming is over 175)  follow the corridor down to the pond, hang a right and swim UP the waterfall.    Take the passage to the left.  Invis up (make sure you are not standing ankle deep in the water or it wont work.)<br />
Run all the way down the corridor, you'll come to a room take the left wall and you'll open into a big chamber, swing right past the tipped over ore cart.  Enter the next large chamber with little tents procede straight through the room and up the ramp, swing left at the next junction.  (ramp leading down slope) you'll see 2 spiders at your 12 o'clock ignore them, swing right into the next passage.  On your right are 2 more spiders, infront of you is a continuation of the passage and to your left is a little more space, this is your pulling spot.  Mind keep the shammy in the little space on the left and keep an eye on the pathing.  ITS INSANELY FUNKY in Nurga.  Pull one spider from the room you currently are in, then pull one of the 2 that you ignored in the previous chamber.<br />
<br />
Space the spawns so you kill 1 from each camp every 4 minutes.  This will leave you plenty of time to med up and be ready for the next spider by the time it spawns.  <br />
<br />
4 spiders split 4 minutes apart isnt bad.  They are dark blue till 48 and only have 1200 hps.  Their poison does around 400 hps of damage but with the shammy slowing them you shouldnt get poisoned that much.  <br />
<br />
If you continue past the pulling area you'll encounter &quot;A Sleeping Ogre&quot; if you kill him time it, he's on a 2 hour timer and is for the monk epic, if you know the pop time and you kill him you'll at least give the monkeys an idea of when to retrun.  Past the sleeping ogre you'll see a room he was sitting in the path of, ignore this room, to the left of that is another hall leading parallel with 2 spiders at the end of guarding a room with 6 more spiders.  <br />
<br />
In my prime with my shaman and my ranger I was constantly pulling from a total of 10 spider spawns and we had friends with us.  With me pulling and a full 6 group of 45ish folks we would be looking at 1/2 a level an hour.  Not bad when your splitting xps between 6 people and a pet.<br />
<br />
***Note bring a sewing kit with you, spiders drop silk and you can make swatches with it.  purchase about 60 cap patterns  and 60 heady kiolas you'll get to 90 tailoring while your at it, may as well get it done since this will also let you make hand made backpacks too.  ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Newtonio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Phew - lots of information!  Thanks Drag, that sounds very interesting and definitely out of the way - we will try it soon!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Draghixia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">hehehe spent ALOT of time in nurga between farming silks and leveling.<br />
<br />
My old guild &quot;Bunnies of Chaos&quot; used to call it Draghixia's Lair.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Oatasgai Alenxia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've also spent a ridiculous amount of time on those spiders...unfortunately, they weren't there anymore last I checked (like a month ago) - I believe they were all given the bum rush when Nurga was revamped.  Why they ruined one of the greatest XP spots ever, I have no clue.</div></div><hr />
