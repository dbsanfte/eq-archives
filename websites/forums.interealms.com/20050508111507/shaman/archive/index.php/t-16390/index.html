<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Popu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was in HoH last night and turned my pet spam back on for a while. I noticed that he was only biting and bashing (didn't even see any kicks) even though I equipped him with weapons.  Tried the usual rusty stuff and when we added a mage got some fists and no joy.<br />
<br />
Anybody else noticing this?</div></div><hr />

The sword of walnan and blade of the kedge are both 1hs so when your pet has those he will slash a mob.</div></div><hr />
