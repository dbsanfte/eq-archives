<br />
The early bird gets the worm. I knew there was no way I could sign up last night. Hell by 2 am the site was not responding still. So i woke up nice and early :)<br />
<br />
OH YEAH :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Now let's hope this durability cost bs is fixed.<br />

I made my account and started DL'ing about 15 minutes ago. (After reading Valgoth's post).<br />
<br />
Oddly enough even after I switched my connection from the router to the DSL box I still got the message &quot;You seem to be behind a firewall.&quot; Not running anything on my computer other than the DL process (and this).<br />
<br />
Oh well, maybe by tomorrow afternoon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">After 4 and a half years of waiting i will play this game today.....I promised myself I would not cry /em cries.<br />

<br />
Faern...that's pretty typical. I got the same error when trying to download the patch Sunday night. It's really just an annoyance and shouldn't prevent you from getting the client.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I don't even want to THINK about the number of people rushing to get that 2.5 gb file...  Best of luck to you guys - and I can't imagine anyone not being blown off their feet by this game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Grrrr this has taken longer than I anticipated. <br />
<br />
26 minutes left......OMG My hands are shaking....<br />
<br />
If anythign happens to the connection onr my computer...if there is some kind of power outage i think i will have a heart attack or something.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I started last night.  Got 320 mb downloaded in 8 hours on DSL!  GAH!<br />
<br />
Of course I'm behind a firewall and don't wanna open the ports.  I was frustrated this morning and tried to open the ports but my firewall's manual tells me to go to the wrong place to do it.  I found a site that told me how to open it but I'm at work so can't adjust it yet :-(<br />
<br />
A friend called and offered to let me bring my pc over and get the files from him.  I'll probably do that since I expect it might have a whole 600mb downloaded by the time i get home.  He told me the files he has still need about an hour to &quot;patch&quot; on a cable modem after I do the install, so it should be interesting to see what happens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Be sure to get the 1.10 patch from him too. It will be in his WoW install dir. All you have to do is place it in your install dir and run it.<br />
<br />
No point in you having to download it if he already has it. I did it this way on our home systems. Let one system download it, then file level copied it to the other and ran it. Worked like a charm.</div></div><hr />

Are you running your DSL through a router? I use one on mine, and I had terrible problems with the Blizzard downloader until I configured port forwarding on my router. If memory serves, there's a link you can click on in the downloader to get to the Blizzard help page, which provides instructions on which ports to open and how to open them. Alternatively, you can just disconnect your router temporarily and plug your DSL modem directly into one computer for the duration of the download.<br />
<br />
Once I made the changes they suggested, my download rate went up to about 60-70 KB/sec. It's not great, but it beats 10 KB/sec. Hope this helps!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I left my router inline without any changes and didn't have any problems after the first hour. Was going at about 10kbps for the first hour then went up to around 70 and stayed there the entire time. My upload speed was about 120kpbs and I actually ended up uploading considerably more then the file size. That is on a 1.5mb dsl connection.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Took me a grand total of 29 hours to download this with a cable modem. 10-20kbs average, some peaks up to 50 kbs occasionally.  I was downloading behind a router/firewall and transfer rates stayed the same even after opening all ports they requested.<br />
<br />
Overall, a pretty horrible experience, but at least I got it.  The wife started playing this morning, I need to wait til after work... grrrrr... :)</div></div><hr />

30% DL'ed. I figure at this rate I'll get one day of OB before I have to buy the game.<br />

If you have access to a usenet news provider then you might be able to download it faster that way. I noticed that in one of the newsgroups that my provider - Easynews - has the full WoW-client is now available for download.<br />
<br />
If you are stuck with BT downloads this address:<br />

<br />
has an alternative access. This way you can use a non-Blizzard program to download the files. I used this and it has worked fine. And a it was a lot faster to download. I even managed to get it to continue from my partial download with the Blizzard-downloader.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Yeah, I had the exact same experience. I opened all the ports they mentioned and it didnt change download rate in any way at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Download a real Bittorent client (like Bitornado) and grab this:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Ok, I DL'ed and saved both links (Valgoth's and SpiritBloods) but when I click them - I get sorta nothing.<br />
<br />
Am I supposed to go to Bittorrent, DL that, THEN click on the link / thing I saved?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">You need a true Bittorrent client.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Done. Thanks Valgoth and all.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately ATM my Bittorrent DL rate is 1KBS.<br />
<br />
EDIT: WOOT. DL Rate shot up to 75 KBS.</div></div><hr />
