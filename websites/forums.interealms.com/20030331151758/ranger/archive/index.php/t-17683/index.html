The lev 65 ones are on 6 hours respawn, roughly. <br />
<br />
NO PH.<br />

And yeah I saw chanters solo one, or worst case duo one, and even saw a chanter actually solo at least one of the yellow con named in the towers....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Viken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">6 Hours</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ry_Skylark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've timed all but Gaukr at 5 hours 45 minutes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rathaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Around 6 hours for wing bosses, have seen chanters solo them lots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sarago</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">well no matter.. they nerfed the drops as of the last patch.. killed 2 minis and got only ring..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>KelaanNorgale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">They've always been like that, Sarago.  Most times you get nothing but the ring of torden and maybe a couple of fungus clumps.  Sometimes a spec. parchement.  If you're *very* lucky an ornate pattern, weapon and/or a rune.  Kill 50+ wing bosses and seen one chain leg pattern, one weapon and 0 runes.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sarago</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">hmmm.. well then we must have been VERY lucky on the first 3 kills b4 patch.. cuz in each one there was at least 1 rune.. almost all 3 dropped rune + spec + ring + some kind of weapon or armour (non ornate pattern armour i mean)..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Viken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The usual loot is 1 spec + 1 ring. Runes are uncommon. Patterns and Items are very rare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Highline Winterwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Roughly 6 hours is correct.  They do spawn right when patches come up as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kuvu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">You know I hate to scream nerf, but I happened to witness my first chanter soloing of a level 65 mini boss today... HELLO!!!!!  The ability to charm a pet capable of doing the DPS of a whole group is just not right... ok rant off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sarago</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">well i got my first rune yesterday ... turned it in for protection of the wild :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Rhick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The only way a chanter can solo those named is by using an exploit. Basically they go on the platform and wait there for pet to die, or charm to break. Then they gate to zoneout. Then they run back quickly and charm a fresh pet before the boss can regen. <br />
<br />
They need to fix the regen rate on the bosses when they aren't engaged and no more chanters would be able to solo.<br />
<br />
Charm has always been more powerful than a single group. Long before PoP my enchanter could solo Siren't Grotto, Warlord Room in KC, KC basement, and all over Seb.  Of course when a chanter solos they risk death often (when not using exploits). The problem with many PoP zones is you can invis in, grab your corpse, and start going again without any lost time.  <br />
<br />
I think Nerfing charm is a bad idea myself. They just need to fix the zones so you can't invis up to the named, but actually have to fight your way there. Then you wouldn't see any chanters soloing I bet.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Talan Eaglestrike DoD</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">On our server the Nameds are perma camped by enchanters. Two fo the most notorious are Hidukel and Uthinkle (Zeb Server). I am not accusing them of anything mind you. The Invis to named, charm a guard have it tank the named till it dies then step on platform when the charmed mob is at 10 percent or so. Run to zone out click box at towers and then zone out. The come back in and invis to named and charm next guard and so on and so forth until the named is dead. One time my group was there right next to the named and the chanter came up and tried this tactic. He zoned when the named was at 5 percent so we killed it and got a Rune a spec and a chain pattern (lol) he complained to high heaven but he zoned thus he was no longer engaged with the mob. <br />
<br />
Spawn time seems to be like they said above 6 hours on minis and like 8 hours on tower named.</div></div><hr />
