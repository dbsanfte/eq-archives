I was wearing TV at the time so got some port requests, was a pretty badass lil weapon, hehe.  Proc was fun because it was unresistable and didn't taunt too much.  Ahh, if only there was a 50/45 nature's wrath 2 or something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just want to check, since the shovel doesn't hit magic critters, will I still get skillups on them?<br />
I'm thinking it's a good way to avoid taunt since I'm starting to take it from our warrior - maybe nobody in my group will notice that I'm not doing damage. And I want to have all those weapon skills maxed.</div></div><hr />

pardon but, it seems it was been changed to blessed faydark abandond enchanted mithril orc FISHING POLE.<br />
<br />
stats have been comfirmed at 4/18 2HB +5str/dex/wis+20% fishing.<br />
<br />
also, on other matters, it seems that Karana rangers can only play as a halfling now.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyricus</div><div class="date">05-14-2002, 06:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The shovel indeed must be evil, for try as I have, I have not been able to part company with it. My skill in 2hb at 38 is terrible. I have not the patience to bring it up at this late date. The shovel knows this, but still and yet, it will not leave me be!<br />
<br />
I have had it on me since level 20, and it will not leave my side. I've had it in backpacks, Sewing kits, Traders Satchels. ITs been in my bank, in every slot. Every time I go to destroy it, some power, some strong suggestive thought leaps into my mind and tells me &quot;But I am the ABANDONED orc shovel, though shalt have none other before me&quot;, and low and behold it is back in my inventory. <br />
<br />
I even tried moving it to my mule's bank. A repository of stuff I haven't decided to what to do with yet. There it lay, undisturbed in a dingy, dusty backpack, and there I thought it would remain. But no, it would not stay away! One day last week, while I was trading possesions back and forth, it must have switched backpacks thru some unearlthy power known only to itself. For 2 days ago when I opened the backpack I was carrying, what to my horror did I see? You guessed it, the Abandoned orc shovel had somehow managed to get back into this 38 Rangers inventory and was once again riding high on the plains of Norrath.<br />
<br />
Tunare help me! I am a slave to the Orc Shovels Will! Can I never be free of it!!</div></div><hr />
