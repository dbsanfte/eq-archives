<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Eldril Mystwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">we could use the &quot;explore&quot; mode to transfer gear/money  from one toon to another... I mean hey, they are all in the same &quot;gamespace&quot; there<br />
<br />
maybe limit it to having both toons in the same CITY zone....<br />
<br />
<br />
would also be cool to cast spells and use skills...(not for skill ups mind you)<br />
<br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
have a NO DROP gear vault...<br />
<br />
I have a bunch of no drop gear that I cant get rid of.. too much sentimental value. Various pieces of thorney vine, runed scout, tolans(yes I know its not NO DROP, but I cant get rid of it either),various weapons... How about a Vault in the Explore mode where we can store said gear, and free up bank space in game.... <br />
<br />
Again, make the vault ony accessable when your toon is camped out in a city that has a bank AND has good enough faction with in order to bank..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sarvak GladeSha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Would be nice if instead of a vault we could decorate the explore rooms ourselves :) IE we have a full set of thorny we dont want to lose so we put it on an armor stand or some such.<br />
<br />
And make it so that trademen can make items we can furnish the /exlore areas with which could create a nice moneysink :) god knows we need it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tyrolene</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If there was an auto equip area for the bank?  Just drop a stackable item on the banker and it'll plop it on the first stack that has room left.<br />
<br />
Hey, when *I* go to the bank I give everything to the teller.  They don't let me play in the drawer behind the counter...<br />
