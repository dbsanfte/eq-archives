-rangers lead the way-</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fufinski</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Get an EB item first if you can (or use enduring breath but not as good).  Use harmony if needed to single pull.  Lure the raptor out into the water and fear kite to your hearts content without any adds.  If the raptor is heading towards the shore just back off from chasing it and let it come back as soon as fear breaks.  Takes a little getting used to fear kiting in 3 dimensions but works fine.  If your wimming is not maxed it soon will be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Adonna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What I do if raptors are open, is usually just hit one with an arrow and let it chase me to chessboard where i then fear kite it. Usually not open though, so I dont go there all that much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>dreakkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Try and get the small island. Invis and start on the southern part of the island (opposite side of vicious raptor), with the raptor closest to the big island (west i think). Watch for the 1 roamer, when it heads off from that raptor and is far enough away, begin the fun! snare and fear the first raptor and it will head east along the coast. Fear will wear off before it gets too close to the NEXT raptor (east side of the south side ;) ). Once its dead, pull the next one. After its dead, the roamer should be almost back from its trip to the north side. pull it and bring it to same fighting spot. After that, head around the west side (nearest the big island), and pull the raptor on the northern shore back to the south side, snare / fear / etc. Once dead, head back to north side, and pull normal raptor near the building and you can fight on the north side. Vicious raptor is the last one, and unless you have C3, you might want to skip him and just go recover on the south side until repops. The roamer will pop next to where the very first raptor you kill is.<br />
With C3, I can do all 6 (including vicious) and get back to south side just as the first raptor spawns. At 57, I get just over 3 blues of AA an hour.<br />
