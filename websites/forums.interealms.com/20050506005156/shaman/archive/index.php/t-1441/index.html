<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild is mainly low to mid 50's and our raids usually go to Kael arena, with the PoZs being the max we can do routinely.<br />
Being the highest shm most of the time I do all the slow/cripple duty.  Unfortunately I need my own cleric for that since I also get 90% of the aggro, I cast from mellee range to avoid those emberassing summons on every mob. So, can you actually cast slow and cripple and not get aggro? We usually have the MA tank for 30 sec or so to gain aggro, but as soon as he calls in the troops and I slow - a portector of Zek hits you for 360.  That hurts fast, especially with 130 people in the zone and the lag slowing down the cleric.<br />
Advise needed, and some aspirin please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Paerlith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not unless you have a super MA getting massive aggro.<br />
<br />
If you need to, just leave out cripple.  It's a good spell, but you can do fine without it, especially if it keeps you from getting pummled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>dirtybax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Cripple = High Aggro.  The MT will probably have an easier time of regaining aggro without cripple in the mix.  <br />
<br />
If you absolutely must have cripple in these situations maybe a chanter could cast it?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">are you getting that much agro from a landed slow?  I mostly had trouble there with agro from resisted slows.   A landed slow would gain me a summon, but at most 1 round of melee.  Usually none.   And I never waited 30 seconds if I could land malosi/malosini faster.<br />
<br />
Make sure you try and get tash and mal*something (malosi at your level most likely) in there before slowing if possible.   You, other shaman and mages can chain cast your malosi/malosini while the MT is working on gaining agro without much fear of gaining agro.  It's a very low agro spell.  If you have a 55+ bard, they can help you with Occlusion of Sound as well.<br />
<br />
PoZ's only rampage - honestly I don't see much change in rampage dmg on them using cripple.   Try not crippling, see if you can tell the difference.  I honestly could not...if you do decide to use it, it is high agro - don't chain cast it, try to get another shaman or chanter to do it for you - someone who isn't already high on the hate list.<br />
<br />
I was the only shaman on all our guild work in Kael from level 53-60.  In all the dozens of trips, I think we had an enchanter like once, so no tash...so I feel your pain.  As usual, levels are huge.  There was a significant noticeable lessening of mob resists every level.  :)<br />
<br />
It is certainly possible to avoid summons and beatdowns doing slow+cripple in Kael and in many other places as well.   It's just a matter of timing and avoiding resists.  Avoid resists through proper debuffing.  Your tanks will hold agro and regain lost agro better as they level up as well.<br />
<br />
Good luck<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kieran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Agreed completely Henora, avoiding resists is truly the key. It's vastly less painful to have the MalX resisted multiple times before you land it than to try more than once with a slow.<br />
<br />
In xp hunting, seek out and heap praise upon chanters who have the stones to tash early too :-) because the longer they wait the more resists and more aggro you will have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">embarassing summons?  I make it a goal to see how many times I can get summoned and live in a night =)  Up your ac, up your hp gear if you can.  Full mana won't do you a thing laying on the ground.  <br />
<br />
If all else fails, wait a few seconds before slowing.  You're helping out more slowing the mob at 85% or so and not taking so much agro than tanking and spending a ton of cleric mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The easiest way to lose agro = Root. However, it will not help your guild learn agro control, which definately would help in the long run.<br />
<br />
Slow and Cripple both generate a lot of agro, and honestly Cripple's only truely useful against mobs that has nasty procs, be it rampage, flurry, or AEs. I'd just skip on Cripple, it should not make much of a difference for PoZs.<br />
<br />
As for the actual slowing, remember level plays a HUGE difference in how easily you could land spell and how well an NPC can hit you. For example, at 60 I can slow most PoZs without Malo at all, yet it would be suicide for a level 55 to even try. The key to surviving slowing in general, as others have mentioned above, is to minimize the chances for resist. You did not tell us your level, but since you call yourself a mystic so I'll assume you are lower than 55. Your best bet is to land Malosi before Turgur. If the Malosi bounces, keep casting until they land, then slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>OrangespiderO</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I agree with Jaruden.  My guild knows that I love it when I see that &quot;you have been summoned&quot; message.  They actually start to think I am slacking if it never comes up that I cannot evade whatever :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Chanters can cast cripple too :p<br />
You'd be wise to have one of them do that spell heh. <br />
<br />
Use malosi first before slowing, this will save you much pummeling from unslowed giants.  Slowed ones are doable.  <br />
<br />
Again, if yer getting yer ass kicked too much, up yer ac/hps at the expense of wis.  At least have that situational gear you can swap out.  You'll notice a large difference with good ac gear . .<br />
<br />
Oh, and if you haven't done so yet, max out your defense skill asap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aqualungg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">have your cleric cast elixer or celestial on you before you attempt a slow.  might help save your bacon when you get summoned.<br />
generally, slowing mobs on raids is a matter of numbers.  if you have 5 people trying to slow, as opposed to 1, your raid will be much more successful.  and youll die a whole lot less.  <br />
in other words, if your having a really tough time, recruit the enchanters and epicced rangers to help out with slows.  Theres nothing like getting summoned from a resist, only to see another player give a successful slow message immediately after.<br />
on a more personal level, just experiment a little.  see how long you can wait before you can cast a slow and not get summoned.  <br />
from your situation, sounds like you dying slows the raid down a lot more than waiting an extra few seconds before trying to slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Lagger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I was doing kael around that *ish* level too.<br />
<br />
The trick is to get him debuffed before u slow, ie tash (reduces failures alot) and maybe a malosini or malo line of spell after the tash.<br />
<br />
I wouldnt bother with cripple, personnally dont see that much difference on mobs like that.  If you get time or have more shamans then split the spells out amongst u, stops just 1 person getting the aggro from 3-4 spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">thanks for all the tips<br />

actually the PoZs took slow just fine (from a lvl 53 no less).  Our main problem is the loss of the highest chanter, our lvl 51 is just not strong enough to survive a summon for an early tash.  And maybe I should get summoned each time, tells the cleric when to start healing ).  I will lay off on the cripple, but it seemed to be very useful in getting PoZs down fast, especially the cleric variant rarely got their CH off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">it depends on what level your warrior is really</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jimoin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yeah, the problem isn't so much the agro your generating it's your tank.<br />
<br />
The way taunt works with warriors is screwed, untill they are lvl 60 they can't taunt anything above them in lvl very effectively.<br />
<br />
Skip Cripple, it's not worth the agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Laproaigh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Tash and malosi have very low aggro.  Often the pullers aggro from throwing something at the mob is more than tash. Let your MA get a single taunt and swing in and you shouldn't get summoned from tash or malosi. And once those are in which usually takes a cast or two of malosi slow will land easily and MA will have had time to gain aggro. The key here is really as have been stated by many others to recast malosi untill it sticks, a resisted slow builds huge aggro but a resisted malosi hardly any, also convey this to your mages so you can slow faster.<br />
<br />
I only cripple one single mob in the arena these days and that's Vindi. Well I guess it would be advisable on AoW too but I've never fought him.</div></div><hr />
