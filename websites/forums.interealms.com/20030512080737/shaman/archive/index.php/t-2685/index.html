<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Geoid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all,<br />
<br />
I'm looking for something to do with a 54 Mage / 55 Monk / 56 Shaman team that could net my shaman some armor upgrades.  I'm interested of course in HPs and AC with wisdom being nice but not required.<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated, kinda in a rut and not turning anything up in my net research so I now turn to my fellow shaman =)<br />
<br />
Behold my ghetto gear:<br />

You also might be able to pick up an IGS in the Hole, just need some method of getting the melees out (shaman gate potions, thurg gate potions).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Good luck on that earing. I have killed ALOT of those Vamps. And while I have seen two Idol of Grodan, several mage earings, and about a million boots, I have yet to see a single EM earing drop.<br />
<br />
Killed the chief three times now and seen one neck and two Divine Inspiration.<br />
<br />
You could also camp the northeast corner of the grey for a Bone Braced Buckler.<br />
<br />
ME Gorangas for a Goranga Idol.<br />
<br />
TT rare cycle for a iksar regen bp.<br />

(cant read your magelo btw)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Geoid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I love ME and have been fighting there a bunch lately.  Mostly Gorangas pulling from the tree vicinity to the zone corner area.  Have been having trouble finding new areas to fight to get at the other mobs as we seem to have wanderers find us no matter where we go.  My fav was a drive-by HT from a Xi as I was Canni dancing.  I was very low on HP and dead instantly, the Xi just kept going ;)  When the area just to the right of the DS zone is open we have fought there a couple times, also tried the area on the other side of the castle from the Goranga tree with some good luck but heavy competition.  Where do you like to hunt in ME for non-Goranga mobs?<br />
<br />
Funny you should mention the Hole as I just went on my first adventure there that took me past the zone in last weekend.  Fought in the pit area and pulled from the castle.  Was possibly the most fun I have ever had in EQ.  We had a Monk, Magician, Shaman, Warrior and Cleric team (all RL friends) that could fight basically non-stop and no wipeouts!  It was just the right level of fear / difficulty with great rewards to boot.  We did have an IGS drop but as we are all poor we sold it =/  I also couldn't believe how good the exp was in that zone!  Seeing that bar move on every kill even on toons that are 54 is almost enough to make me not want to leave, ever.<br />
<br />
I will look into the Grey.  Fought a little there in a futile attempt to get the EB necklace.  Seems like we had too much trouble with just the 3 man crew there, but we all have at least one level now so might be time for another attempt.  As I recall it was the adds.  I just couldn't slow two high level mobs fast enough and keep the Monk alive.  We weren't in the NE corner though, thanks for the tip.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the advice you two =)<br />
<br />
All your HTML skillz are belong to us!  Guess I should just try magelo this way, although the link works for me?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I got my Bone braced Buckler in 54 duoing the grey with a 57 ranger. We were able to take two mobs (even three on occasion) at a time as a duo....I cant imagine you three will have any more trouble than we did. Just root park.<br />
<br />
The EB neck is very easy to get. We had lots of organs rot.<br />

Being not able to read your magelo I am sure is the fault of my outdated browser.</div></div><hr />
