<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can paladins put up their invulnerability shield while stunned?  I was dueling one outside Gadzetgan and whenever he got low i'd try my warstomp+shock+fire nova combo to try and kill him before he had the chance to heal.  However each time he became invulnerable before my fire nova hit and sometimes before my shock.  If you don't know, warstomp is a 2 second stun.<br />
<br />
It didn't really matter in the final outcome, I beat him 3 out of 4 times, and the 4th time I wasn't using my 1h/shield combo.  Then me and another shaman teamed up and dueled two paladins.  Funnest PvP fight ever.  The two paladins rushed me, the lower level shaman, which was probably a mistake because I had the 1h/shield combo and the 58 shaman was using a fat 2 handed axe.  Their dps really is very bad after the patch but anyways the battle still took about 10 minutes.  I made use of some fun trinkets, like my engineered toy that turns them into leper gnomes, and the combination of our 8 shaman totems to eventually wear them down.  <br />
<br />
Shaman nerf next patch? yeah I'm expecting it.  I hope they nerf frost shock somehow.  It's the most overated spell in the game and I rearely use it except on hunters.  As long as they don't mess with purge or windfury, I'm happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The one shield strips ALL negative effects on the paladin (except rez sickness- I tried :) ) and makes them immune from spells/physical attacks.  I'm almost positive it can be cast while stunned - whether that is intentional or a &quot;bug&quot; however...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thats a good question walrus not to sure myself. <br />
<br />
I could test it for you probably dueling one of my wifes char's. But that might be like selling secrets to the enemy. Wonder if they'd take my members card? hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The bubble/shield removes all effects from them I'm pretty sure...I know for sure it DOES remove stun =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Indalecio Galronte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Divine Shield is a Fickle thing. There are some stun type abilities I can shield out of. Others I cannot. Rogues do possess a stun that I cannot shield out of. I will duel my lvl 60 Rogue buddy and post back.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">While I don't doubt he used a shield, your anecdotal description makes it seem as if he can cast his two invuns wily-nily.<br />
<br />
In a BEST case scenario, one is on a five minute timer and the other on a three minute timer.<br />
<br />
Misinformation like the above is why the Paladin class has been nerfed into oblivion.  Put my shields on a one minute timer each with the same penalties (can't attack or attack at 50% reduced rate) and the class might be a little more viable.<br />
<br />
As it is, with one crappy DD (if you spec that way), no way to prevent runners in PvP, diminishing returns on seals, one purposeful DPS nerf, one un-intentional DPS nerf and another nerf in the works - Paladins are a labor of love.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Baz4</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I read it as a long fight each time, and the pally saved his shield for when he got low hp.<br />
<br />
I have read several times on the Blizz boards that pallies can, indead, use the shield while stunned, clearing the stun.  Blink reportedly works in a similar fashion.<br />
<br />
Faern is right on the timers, but it takes so long to get a pally low hp, 1v1, that they get to use the shiled more than once.  In group PvP the timer should be a bigger issue, as a healer is going to be a major target, and will not be able to wait out a timer.</div></div><hr />
