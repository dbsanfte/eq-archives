That is just insulting. We could DoT for 420 before. It does not make an impact. And even the Bane line does not finish before the MOB is dead. Scaling our spells up by x% does not fix any concerns we had.<br />
This is what these need to be useful. Not my personal wishlist - just the absolute minimum to be useful spells (increase mana cost as needed).<br />

Just in case anyone was still hoping, no, cast times have not been decreased. Apparently SOE is afraid shaman might use their  amazing mana regeneration  to do too much damage in long fights. Thus we get nukes that are the worst of literally every class.<br />
<br />
The regular nukes should just have their casting time reduced by a couple of seconds and have a 6 second recast time addded. That way we could do decent damage on MOBs that both poison and cold land on and alternate nukes and heals on MOBs where only one of them lands.<br />

So the number one shaman concern was healing. Brenlo actually noted that and promised to pass it on. This is what we get. That is below what the general consensus seemed to be for GoD healing. It certainly will not do for Omens. This needs to be:<br />

Do not think we will get anything fixed without non-stop complaining for at least a month. It took much longer to get a 1500 heal.<br />
We tried patience and reason in Kunark. (And got group spells changed after massive complaints)<br />
We tried patience and reason in Velious.<br />
We tried patience and reason in Luclin.<br />
We tried patience and reason in Planes of Power.<br />
We tried patience and reason in Lost Dungeons.<br />
We tried patience and reason in Gates.<br />
<br />
It simply does not work. That does not mean we should not back up our arguments with reasons. But merely trusting SOE to change anything at all after patiently outlining our issues to them is proven to not work at all, not one tiny bit.<br />
<br />
I hope we can still fix our class in Omens. I love this game, I have a ton of friends here and I invested a lot of time into Murtak. But I am not going to keep playing a focus buffbot just so SOE can make a little more money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I agree. The blatently false comments on Ryan on stats impacting the game are a complete joke, and its insulting to think hes being paid to work on spells.<br />
<br />
I personally would rather see stamina give a % increase to HP, as well as stun resist.<br />
<br />
BoVie increases mitigation by 10%. I really dont see why our spells have to have such crap impact when this spell is deemed ok.<br />
<br />
For those of you who say we werent meant to do dps... think back to getting 50 at release, and how VotS TORE stuff up. It dealt ice coment damage for ebtter efficiency. Now our dots are jokes compared to wizard nukes. <br />
<br />
I wouldnt mind a disease dot that had something like a 3% damage reduction tied to it through weakening the mob. Or combine malos and the disease dot, creating a situationally useful spell.<br />
<br />
But our spells.... are just insulting.<br />

<br />

<br />
I used my AC buff one time then I was level 8 I think (but I can hardly remember that was in November 1999).<br />
<br />
But anyway friends, I think we are barking up the wrong tree on this one unfortunately.  I do think Sony is listening (a wee tiny bit), but posts like the first one in this thread are just too darn lengthly and and suggest too many things to be constructive even though they may be 100% correct.<br />
<br />
If I may be so bold, I don't think Sony will dramatically change their view of balance. Period.  Now that being said I do think there are a couple of things that we can work them on.<br />
<br />
#1 Healing. If we are being scaled vs clerics (and pretty much everyone here thinks we are) lets see if we convince them to inch us up 10% - (need to be still lower than a druid because it is their &quot;vision&quot;).<br />
<br />
#2 Burst Damage.  I have mentioned this a few times.  Dot's screwed our class up.  On paper (lol, but true) we can lay out the smack.  That &quot;paper damage&quot; which only applies to soloers and 2 boxers has convinced Sony to par down our nukes.  I continue to suggest that shaman DD's should be exactly equal to druids.<br />
<br />
#3 Annoying things that could be easially fixed.  Increase FA (and its upgrade) duration by 50%. Give out group shrink with comfirmation.<br />
<br />
I would be happy with the above.  Does it fix everything, no.  It is realistic that Sony re-tool shaman, no.<br />
<br />
Food for thought,<br />

<br />
Hmmmm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">#1 Healing.

Just put druids at 85% cleric healing, then put shaman at 70% cleric healing. Then give clerics 85% druid nukes and our entire disease dot lineup so they can solo.<br />
<br />
#3 Annoying things that could be easially fixed.  Increase FA (and its upgrade) duration by 50%.<br />
Just make it an AA group avatar, 10 minute duration, 9 minute recast. Avatar should not take up a spell gem at all.<br />

Amen.<br />
<br />

Realistic or not, we should ask for it. For me Omens is going to be what I will look at when I decide wether I should continue playing EQ. I am not going to ask for one tenth of what I need to stay useful to my friends.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sithrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Spells I want:<br />
<br />
1) A new slow that bypasses one level of mitigation, and has a good resist mod. SHAMAN ONLY. They have the design almost right with Nihil, let's truly be the king of slowing again. (Mitigation bypass would not work on bossmobs, of course.)<br />
<br />
2) HEALING. I'll take a fast heal for at least 2k.<br />
<br />
3) NO MORE STAT BUFFS EVER<br />
<br />
4) NO MORE STAT BUFFS EVER<br />
<br />
5) NO MORE SHORT DURATION BUFFS EVER. Make Avatar into a group spell with useful skill mods, combat effects, and ATK. Stats suck, in case it wasn't clear before. Make it last at least 60 minutes. Make it so it can't be MGB'd if you must, but we have been in FA rotation hell for too long. The stopwatch must go!<br />
<br />
6) NO MORE SHORT DURATION BUFFS EVER<br />
<br />
7) Meaningful buffs, with either skill mods (% adds to 1h slash, Dual Wield, Defense, etc.) or combat effects (strikethrough, combat effects, avoidance, etc.). Up the HPs on the new Focus, too.<br />
<br />
8) New, shaman only debuffs, e.g.:<br />
<br />
Improved Cripple<br />
<br />
Decrease ATK by 300<br />
Decrease STR, DEX by 80<br />
-10% to Dual Wield, Double Attack<br />
<br />
I don't know how much the skill debuff percentages would affect mob DPS - this would obviously need in-house testing and balancing.<br />
<br />
9) NO MORE DoTs, THANKS SO MUCH. I have a ton of them and it is so hard to use them effectively. Mobs die too fast in exp groups. There are a few raid mobs that live long enough to DoT, but who cares? Aggro is through the roof, resist rates are high, and the Critical Affliction AA makes things even worse.<br />
<br />
Theoretically, DoT aggro/resists/duration could be fixed, but I just don't see this happening.<br />
<br />
10) Fast casting nukes, slap on a recast time if you have to. These days, I can start casting Velium Strike, go to the kitchen and make a sandwich, and then come back to see it land on the mob (or not, if a wizard managed to crit for 7k along the way). Poison nukes are fine in concept, but have unusually high aggro and resist rates. Would it be okay if I nuked as well as a cleric?<br />
<br />
11) Rain spells. I use these a lot. How about making DIRECT DAMAGE FOCUS EFFECTS WORK ON RAIN SPELLS? Hey, while you're at it, how about removing the intrinsic 20% resist rate on rains? And how about a cold-based rain spell?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Does anyone actually USE their AC buff?<br />
Actually, I use it quite a bit. Rarely do Clerics buff AC after Symbol. Especially soloing, I get Po9, Symbol, then just use my own AC buff (it stacks with 9, not with Virt or Cleric AC). Also, in groups without a Cleric, the AC buff is semi-useful. Druid main healers put on 9, we add AC. /shrug<br />
But merely trusting SOE to change anything at all after patiently outlining our issues to them is proven to not work at all, not one tiny bit.<br />

I am with you on this one Murtak. I feel fairly betrayed. I was SO looking forward to being &quot;useful&quot; again, especially with buffs and de-buffs, but now, it looks like we are getting the sharp end up the ol' Number 2 again. Its gonna suck too. Maybe I will just use my Shaman to become an eBayBot and sell pp through SOEs &quot;trusted methods&quot; that we will be seeing, heh. If theres ONE THING my shaman can do extremely well, its FARM!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Arggg. This is a pet peive of mine but give up already. Mobs mitigate slow because verant doesn't want them being slowed beyond point x. They want the mob doing what ever dps that works out to. If they wanted them to be more slowable and do less damage they would just change the amount they mitigated slow by. There is no need for new special slows to mitigate mitigation or drop thier chance at dual wielding/double attacking or what ever way you want to come up with to decrease a mobs dps. If they want us to decrease the mobs dps more they will just adjust the mitigation. It really is just that simple.<br />
<br />
As for it not working on boss mobs thats just silly because thats exactly the point when we are the weakest. The mobs are more likely to mitigate slow heavily or be flat out immune. We can't heal worth a damm against them because the do high dps. We can't do good dps. Yeah give us a spell that makes us more powerful when we're already doing well and doesn't work when we most need it. Stick me someplace with mobs with lots of hps that don't hit hard and don't mitigate slow and i'm great. I'll do worlds better than a cleric even. Problem is being powerful in trival situations doesn't really matter. We need help in the exact area everyone seems to think we can't ask for it. We need help when the big nasty mob is immune to slow, hits for a billion a hit and dies quickly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I disagree with your argument. If they upped mob DPS but let shaman be mitigated one level less than everyone else's, we would still be better off. As things stand now, there is pretty much no difference between having a beastlord, enchanter, or shaman slow. Even bard slow is good enough a lot of the time. I am looking for something to bring us out ahead of the pack in the slowing game.<br />
<br />
Wouldn't it be nice if our slows were NOTICEABLY better in hard LDoN? How about in Kod'Taz? Or the elemental planes? I would say that 90%+ of the mobs I fight mitigate slow. In the face of slow mitigation, the difference between the various slowing classes becomes even more marginal.<br />
<br />
Bossmobs are an entirely different matter - though if they retuned their DPS around a new shaman slow I would not be unhappy. Our lack of stackability in that regard is nothing new, but that is better addressed, I think, via better healing and improved nukes.  (Maybe DoTs could be fixed, but I doubt it.) We will never nuke like wizards or heal like clerics, but things can certainly be a lot better than they are now.<br />
<br />
So yes, things really ARE that simple. I would like shaman slows to be MEANINGFULLY better than those of other slowing classes. If that means tweaking mob DPS so we can bypass one level of mitigation, so be it. At least there will be a compelling reason to bring a shaman into a GoD group.<br />
<br />
To me, this is worth asking for. I still view slowing to be at the core of the shaman class. Your opinion may differ.</div></div><hr />

Make it a nuke that's nice like with other classes, but don't make our ancients canni upgrades.  <br />

Move Pained Memory to 66, make Ancestral Strength a normal level 70 spell and make Ice Age 5 a second cast Ancient Nuke.  <br />

Sony needs to change dots to check resistances on each tick and then they need to fix the agro to be in line with nukes.  If they did that, and gave me a dot with the same dmg/tick as Blood of Saryrn at level 70, I'd be able to put out twice the damage I could with your spell and I still could live to talk about it afterwards.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Totally agree with ya, but I just can't help feeling sick when I realize we are using (even if just in jest) the piece of crap agro coding on our dots as an argument to justify the piece of crap coding imbalance in our dot dps. Pat pat. I know guys and gals, our dots suck, but it's for our own best. Trust me on this one, yep, we'd be better off with another dex buff. <br />

Does anyone actually USE their AC buff?<br />
You can also use your AC buff to block Brells, in case you don't like pink hearts. =/<br />
Our AC buff stacks with both Bo9 and BSS. It does not stack with Virt. The Po9-Symbol combo for more HPs and mana-regen does not have a dedicated AC component to it like Virt does. BSS is a straight up HP buff. Our AC buff is actually handy, if you can spare the slot and dont want to bug a Cleric for Ward of Gallantry (which is the AC component of Virt)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I do not think that either WoW or EQ2 will satisfy the entire EQ crowd. Both games are already showing signs of being &quot;diabloesque&quot;. That fine if your looking for a quick-hit game you can jump in and out of quickly, get right into it, and possibly get some drops out of the deal. But thats not the kind of game everyone who plays EQ necesarily wants. I want longevity. If it doesnt look like a game (note, a game like this, NOT a single player, or straigh up shooter like Doom3, etc) like its got 6 months to live, I am not gonna waste a lot of time on it. <br />
<br />
I am gonna tough it out with EQ. SOE has made some reasonable changes. I think they are trying. I do not feel nearly as &quot;ignored&quot; as I have in the past. Balance will be difficult to judge for a while. New levels throw everying into chaos-mode for a LONG TIME. I am not expecting any big balance changes until WELL after OoW ships, and personally, I am fine with the current spell line up as it stands. Well, not fine, but placated for the time being.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For the first time, Im off to look at the Blizzard site and see what WoW is all about.<br />
