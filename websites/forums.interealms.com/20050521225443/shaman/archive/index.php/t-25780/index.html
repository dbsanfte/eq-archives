<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Airwhale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all,  <br />
<br />
I was wondering if you could give me advice on any easy boss mobs in lucin.  My guild usually has about one to two groups of level 60-66 toons on.  Usually, this consists of:<br />
<br />
A level 62 shaman (whee! gogogo Frog!)<br />
A level 67 Mage with max DD crits, and most pet AAs(Friggin DPS machine...)<br />
A level 66 wizzy,<br />
A level 55 cleric<br />
A level 66 cleric<br />
A level 66 SK<br />
A level 55 SK<br />
A level 67 Beasty<br />
A level 66 Necro<br />
<br />
With other random people thrown in, but they are not dependable. For example, we have a level 63 enchanter that only plays on mondays.  We have a level 61 pali that only plays once a month, etc...<br />
<br />
All members are bazaar equiped, but very well bazaar equiped.  The level 67 Mage has Max FT, and most have several ornate and bazu/magnetic/whatever parts.<br />
<br />
Think we could take out Greig?  The level 66 cleric and 67 beasty won't be on tomorrow, still think we could do it?  Any other ideas?  An evolved burrower, maybe?  <br />
<br />
If you are suggesting Greig, can anyone point me to a walkthrough of Greig's end?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>cosikfin-eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">right zone wrong mob by far the easiest mob to get a orb from is servior of luclian was a easy 1 group kill per GoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Easiest mob imo is The Va`Dyn.  SK and Shaman could easily duo it, I did it with an SK during Luclin, with current gear/levels it should be cake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ya.  Va'Dyn is easiest.  Me and a cleric duo'd it.  Took 45 mins, but we did it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The Insanity Crawler (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=7926) <br />
<br />
can pull him and any adds that agro with him to zone in and then zone out (just warn people ahead of time). when you zone back in the adds will be gone and only this guy will remain. he won't move unless agroed. melee fight in the long stretch of hallway and casters/healers hide around the corner to avoid the AE's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm fond of Rhag1 in ssra.  He's close to zonein, easy to invis to.  That mage pet can tank him easily. Rhag2 is similar, but takes longer to get to.  Va'Dyn is also a good choice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Servitor of Luclin in Grieg's is the easiest by far.  You can invis all the way to his door, clear about three mobs, pull him through the door by typing &quot;/target Servitor&quot;.  Bring him into the hall and you don't even have to deal with re-pops.<br />
<br />
He has crummy loot so tends to be up more than the Va Dyn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ougabouga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">There are quite a few mobs that can be single grouped (or less) for your orb.<br />
<br />
- Va`Dyn<br />
- Servitor of Luclin<br />
- Rhag 1<br />
- Lcea Katta (is a fun fight with the charming)<br />
- Thought Horror Overfiend<br />
<br />
Va`Dyn is probably the easiest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Exeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Several members in the guild I belong too killed Servitor in Griegs, Va'Dyn in Akheva, and Rhag1 in SSRA with single groups to get GOoL drops.<br />
<br />
Exeley</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Brothur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I agree with SPangaloid, we got my luclinte with 5 of us, including a rogue tank.  Insanity Crawler is probably the easiest.  The easiest to get to is the Evolved Burrower, and it has great loot, but bring a few groups for this one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Lnana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I normally hit the servitor of luclin. He seems to be the easiest for me since i cant for the life of me figure out how to single pull the va'dyn.<br />
<br />
Normal group make up is 57 bard/65 shaman, 65 mage/cleric.<br />
<br />
If any of you mind sharing pulling tips for the va'dyn im all ears :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I almost duoed Rhag 1 with a 70 war. Would've probably if some guildies didn't come along to help the fight go faster. hehe<br />
<br />
Remember to use disease slow on the burrower, and keep it on him. (Grummus lasts 3:30)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Airwhale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Thanks all!<br />
<br />
Can anyone tell me how to get to the servator?  also, out of curiosity, think Va'Cyn is soloable by a level 65 shaman?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Virulence</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Thanks all!<br />
also, out of curiosity, think Va'Cyn is soloable by a level 65 shaman?<br />
<br />
I don't believe that even if you were geared well enough to do it solo, that you would want to. The fight would probably take an hour if it's even possible (I remember he was pretty resistive, but that was pre-65) and you have a good bit of clearing to do or some creative pulling with dogdog. A couple of those mobs that guard the Va`Dyn while not very tough, have a sick amount of hp and even with 5 people (not heavy on dps) it was hard for us to clear up to the Va`Dyn to pull him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Va`Dyn is easily soloable, I would say minimum 4.5k HP unbuffed. Long fight though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I would say Servitor is easier then Va'Dyn.  Hits for less then a PoV mob and fully slowable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kriyn Nutzforcatnip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Would also say Servitor is easier.  I've duo'd him many times and much easier than Da`Vyn because of clearing and pull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Servitor &amp; Va'Dyn easiest, but do Rhag1 &amp; Rhag2.  RGC is worth it where you're going :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kryscha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">You *can* solo Va'Dyn at 65, but it's a pain in the butt. Really not worth the hassle. If you want to single pull him, get a 62+ bard to help you out. Pre-62 bard won't be able pacify the guards. (I hope I'm remembering my song levels correctly) You still need to clear some junky rock guys, but other than that he's pretty easy. Super easy to magic slow, but he's got a very high PR/DR; don't even bother trying to dot him, just frost nuke and magic dots.<br />
<br />
Definately recommend Rhag1/2 farming as they're easy, can drop RGC (saves some adventure points) and may offer some upgrades for your members. I was going to suggest Xerkizh the Creator, but I don't think he's doable with your current regular makeup.  You'd need more healers to keep your tank alive, and a dedicted GRC spammer, not to mention 2 offtanks which need healing. A single shaman can keep slow on the two guards + XtC as well as healing the two off-tanks, (assuming you use the off-tank method) but you still need probably 2 more clerics, and maybe another shaman/druid for GRC.<br />
<br />
I don't know if you're only looking for easy sources, or will consider challenging targets as well, so could be worth a try nonetheless; you know your crew better than I. However, be prepared for a 30min - 1 hour snooze-fest. You might also consider Thought Horror Overfiend (THO).  Only need like 2 clerics to keep a tank up (we used to have a single cleric holding warrior up, with everyone else just nuking etc) but he is a very boring fight as well, and you're time limited by repops within an hour of 45 min or something. (been a while, memory fading)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">THO takes ages.  eons.  millenia. forEVer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I did Servitor about 20 times during my guilds VT Key days, but to this day, I have NO clue where he is in Griegs, heh. Spoiled by having a few top level bards in the guild who could single-pull him to the zone every time, LOL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Just a note about creator.  You need very little healing.  His dps is quite low, and I've been rampage tank, rampage healer, slower, and cc on the two repops before.  The thing to remember is that heals over time always land for full.  The heal curse does not effect them in the least.  Breath of trushar is enough to heal mt or ramp.  Two hot healers is enough.</div></div><hr />
