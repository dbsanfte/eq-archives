<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Apothian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First off-<br />
<br />
For those of you who like the exp and and can benefit from drops. Enchanters used to solo alot until charm was nerfed.  Now I duo with my buddy instead and he basically needs me for extra root and heals.  But most importantly Malos and Malosinia.  Great exp using charmed pets for anyone intererested in good fast exp with the possibility of drops towards Bloodmetal earring and the piglet himself who we have also dou'd.  (speaking of Tactics)<br />
<br />
Second-<br />
<br />
I read alot about zergin as of late and players whom some of you consder lacking skill.  My guild currently dropped grummus for the first time and is working on Behe now.  We dropped Grummus with between 40 - 50.  Now up to your par, how many *skilled* players would it take to drop Grummus or Behemoth?  Another guild on my server used around 70 to drop behemoth and we got him to 29% Last night with about 50.  Spider control was good the dots just ate us up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You should be able to do it with that amount.  Just get better organized next kill and take MB out as quickly as possible.  BTW he doesnt have the same AE's every time so you might have better luck with them next time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">IMO it's more a matter of gear than skill.<br />
<br />
Yeah, a certain amount of skill is required regardless.  But there's a big difference between a tank decked out in Vex Thal level gear and one in HoT level gear.  And there's a significant difference between a raid equipped with HoV, BSS, F07, and VoQ versus one with Virtue, Brell's, Focus, and KEI.<br />
<br />
Bottom line - ignore what other guilds say, you take him down, you're doing well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>wuddaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If zergling is killing something with all the folks in your guild that are online at that time and want to raid, then I think all guild in EQ are zerg guild..<br />
<br />
Just look at FoH home page.. they need more folks because raiding with &quot;non zerg&quot; number is not possible anymore in pop..<br />
quoting furor on that one : Due to the fact that it is no longer possible to raid with 40-50 people and have anything more than limited success, we have opened up recruitment.<br />
<br />
I m not a big fan of the person, but he is right on that one.. sorta.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Basically people who talk about zerg etc IMO are dumbass loosers who don't really have a life IRL! We all play this game for fun, you kill grummus with 20 people, I had 80, you call me zerg because you want to say you are BETTER than me.. this is a game and some people have lost sight of that... <br />
<br />
FUN is an absolute IMO for playing games.. if you are playing it for any other reason then I think you are playing for the wrong reason.. if someone doesn't agree please let me know why you play this game..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Actually I've seen different definitions of Zerging... one definition involves rezzing people back into the fight multiple times, given them a weapon and sending them back in.  Not many do that any more, I don't think, although it was an accepted Fear break tactic long ago.<br />
<br />
I'm in a rather large guild and if we have 72 people present for a takedown, we have 72 people present.  Use the resources available to you and ignore the /ooc's - if the /ooc'ers had that many people available, they'd be using them all, I guarantee it.  What are you going to do, tell half the raid to stay home?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The term 'Zerg' comes from the game Starcraft, where one of the races in the game is an alien bug-like race that sent tons of zerglings (basically lower difficulty minions) at your base constantly.<br />
<br />
Just wanted to point that out for the younger players out there so there are no misconceptions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can remember a long while back on my server, before I retired my warrior from raiding, competing with another guild for IV(see? long time ago :p ).<br />
<br />
They wiped repeatedly with almost 60 people present. After they finally gave up we took him out with 21. Both guilds had access to similar gear, however all they could do is blindly throw numbers at targets. I can also remember another guild that would throw 50 people at grieg, who was also competitive with our guild..who killed him with 20-24.<br />
<br />
We killed yelinak with 35 people on our first attempt, when we were just venturing into NToV.<br />
<br />
We killed aerin dar with 40 people on our first attempt. We were nothing special or particularly uber, we had gone mostly through ssra but hadn't taken Emp yet.<br />
<br />
When I see guilds at that level throwing 80-90 people at those encounters and just skating by(or wiping), they are zergers. And yes, we were better than them because of that. If that hurts your ego because you fit into that category, I'm sorry. <br />
<br />
It wouldn't be any different than basketball, baseball, even pool- some people are better at that than others too.<br />
<br />
The interesting thing is both of those guilds are still zerging away on Ayonae Ro :) I won't mention names.</div></div><hr />
