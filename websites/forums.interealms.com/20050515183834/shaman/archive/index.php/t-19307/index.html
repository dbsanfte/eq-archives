<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Boon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My friend is returning to EQ and he purchased the Everquest Evolutions package.  After installation he tries to open EQ and gets the following error &quot;The procedure entry point DdEntry1 could not be located in the dynamic link library GDI32.dll.&quot; <br />
<br />
So far we've tried updating direct X, his video card drivers, I also sent him the GDI32.dll file to try and replace it on his machine, but it won't allow it to be replaced since it is constantly in use by windows.<br />
<br />
We are out ideas for now, if anyone knows what we could try please give suggestions.  Thanks a bunch.</div></div><hr />

Is the file size of his GDI32.dll the same as yours?  If not it may have been altered by a virus. You can replace the dll by booting to dos mode (use a win98 boot disk is an easy way to do this) then replacing the file. It wont be in use under dos as it is the standard windows drawing interface (nothing to do with DirectX)<br />
<br />
If the file size is the same, I would first do a &quot;complete file scan&quot; from EQ in the advanced menu. If that doesnt help i'd try replacing the dll using the above method.</div></div><hr />
