<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dagor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Allright, <br />
a week or two ago, there was a post indicating that anyone hunting in the Dreadlands was foolish, because the Scarlet Dessert was the same zone with better loot.  Most of the replys were based on the fact that it is so far out of the way, but a level 35 friend ran me through Fungus grove with no trouble at all.  So that really shouldn't be a problem once more people learn how to get through FG.  <br />
<br />
Well my wife(46 rogue) and I(46 shaman) just paid a visit to the dessert, and were less than impressed.   First...half the stuff we fought had NO loot whatsoever.  Second the place is crawling with casters, shaman, and more shaman.  Third everything is magic resistant. <br />
<br />
So now I know most of the folks here are pretty savvy, so I am gonna figure it was what we were hunting.  So what is the secret to the scarlett dessert?  In the Dreadlands my wife and I can duo all day long, and only rarely have to stop due to regen/med.   The dreadlands is an experience gravy train.  The dessert is well a whole 'nother matter.</div></div><hr />

normal mobs will drop jack, but there are many semi-named mobs that will drop Twilight quest pieces, and some items.   Usually a ranger will help a lot, especially one that knows how to pull a mob through countless others without agroing all of em (Kudos to Wylias the uba puller)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Snowielder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I leveled all of 53 in SD and must say I enjoyed it immensely and thought exp was great.  When I got down to business I could close in on two blues an hour.  I duoed with a 50 ranger (now 51), and it took him about 7 total hours duoed with me to get all of 50.  Very few resists for me no matter what I hunted, sun revenants, bloodtribe, lightcrawlers, cheetahs, or sunflowers.  At 53 I pulled from the two revenant camps north of The Twilight Sea zone entrance, plus wanderers.  At 54, I am near Grieg's zone pulling bloodtribe, who con 75% blue.  Rare mobs at the revenant camps drop twink gear, nothing that would sell for over 200p on my server.  I plan on staying through 54 for sure, great exp compared to other places I have been told about.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I ripped through 51-54 in SD up in the far NW corner of the zone.  I also picked bloodtribe to beat on and any of the other KOS mobs in the area.  I duoed with an Enchanter or trioed with the Enchanter and a Ranger most of the time there. Ranger makes it handy to run off and pull in the rare named when they spawned. <br />
Loot was not my goal, but we did get a couple neat pieces that we use or our twinks use now.  I've never gotten any loot in DL, so that's easy to beat.   <br />
I was also clocking near 1 1/2 to 2 blues an hour up there with non-stop pulls.  We avoided messing with the Aliens.<br />
For most of this I had a JBB but no Epic.  But I know a guildmate Shaman and Warrior in their low 50s have been duoing there without a JBB with no problems as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zhaiman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've been duoing there with a 51 Monk friend for since he was 49 and I was..err..50 I think.<br />
<br />
I've got an EB item (Fishbone Earring) so we tend to hunt near The Grey zone. This way if it all goes pear-shaped I pop into The Grey while he feigns, I will admit though that this has only happened once in that time.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't come here for loot, hell no. Even the FS equivalent weapons that drop (those spiny things) sell for a few gold rather than a coupla pp.<br />
<br />
But for xp grinding it seems to be great, I'm still making reasonable xp at 52 and the risk of death is minimal/negligible. Not timed the xp there as I am doing a 50/50 split to get my first axp point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ogreshm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Pull the mobs near the Grieg's End zone, and you'll see some decent drops there. Many of the named seem to wander near there. Half of them drop silly quest items, half drop usable items.<br />
<br />
You will also learn quickly what to pull and what not to pull. Don't pull sun reavers/revenants if mana is a concern, they have really stupid resistances and can be mana sinks.<br />
<br />
Don't pull the red aliens (Tro Jegs?). They have a REAL nasty 250 DD fire proc on their attacks. Just about everything else is fair game. Pull the cavemen at your own risk. They are not particularly tough, but they range widely in levels (maxing out at 45-47ish). Using their caves as pull spots is an advantage.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Scarlet Desert vs Dreadlands?  Yech.  The real question is why a 46 shaman / 46 rogue duo isn't beating the bejeezus out of Lower Guk.  Add a random tank to hold aggro for the rogue, and you could blow out everything except the Lord and King spawns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Petercorbin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Maybe you didnt research the zone well enough.. in addition to 141+ rare mobs for the twilight sea armor quests (each of the 9 races of mobs has 15-17 of these) there are at least 52 loot dropping rares.. and although most of the loot is good for twinks there are a few more exceptional items for non twinked shaman that would be fighting here..as well as other classes.. (i think theres about 93 different loots)  heres some examples:<br />
<br />
ac 16 +5 str helm all bst/shm races (same ac as PoG helm btw)<br />

<br />
I think there is AC/Wis/mana/hp gear for almost every slot.. and most of it is better stat wise than the Imbued northman ringmail that i was wearing a set of when I hit 49 and started going to hate.. but that was about when velious came out and theres a lot better gear out there now.. anyway tons of nice stuff for 20-40's levels if you arent twinked up the wazoo and if you finish some twilight armor stuff while youre there all the better.  Scarlet is one of the only decent zones in luclin for risk vs. rewards and exp value and level range and play ability and low lag and so on ..  a very good zone to go from 40-59 in imho.. at 59 most of the 3 'all blues' camps in scarlet started having several light blues... as did the grey... oh well back to kunark for me :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">word Megumi, at 44-51 people should be hunting in a dungeon for the exp bonus.  SD is just an easy outdoor zone without the benefit of having lots of people for exp groups.  <br />
If it ever became popular it would be a good option . . . but 1-2 blues per hour is NOT good exp at lvl 50.  <br />
<br />
Actually with those classes at those levels I would suggest Keasora library or Xalgoz undead area.  THAT is a dungeon for hardcore experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Durich</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Kaesora Greens out at 44-45 I thought?<br />
<br />
Name some good dungeons besides Lower Guk for the 40-50 crowd... there arn't many<br />
<br />
I was very disapointed with Luclin not one dungeon or indoor zone besides ones that are Noob level or 50+</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dagor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Perhaps we should look into Lower Guk.  We haven't had much exposure there.  We just spent several levlels in Sol B, and have been looking for a change of scenery.  We ventured into Kaesora at level 43 or so, and it was a fun dungeon.  One thing we didnt' do was venture down to the Library/Xalgoz area.  We seemed to be getting a few adds as it was, and without snare we figured we would stick to the upper levels and kill spiders and such.   Can a 46 rogue and shaman take out Xalgoz and his cohorts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">L40-50 try CoM and SolB.  Kaesora near Xalgoz should be gud as described too.  Some of the tunnel sections of Mons Letalis and Dawnshroud would be good for that level range as well.</div></div><hr />
