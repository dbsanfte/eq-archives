<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I read that article.  I also read the journals of the students that took the class.<br />
<br />
Most of them were actually kind of funny.  Of all the journals I read only about 2 of the students had any previous experience with 'online culture' (as it was called).  The time of exposure for the students was also woefully inadequite.  The students  had only weeks to try and 'study' a subculture that evolved over years.  <br />
<br />
Funny read but not, in my opinion, to be taken seriously.  Im sure that there will be those that will use this research as the basis for another &quot;EQ is a bad thing; it is terrible for those that play it' type argument.</div></div><hr />

All college survey courses are like this.  Spend 2 weeks on 200 years of history, write a paper, move on to the next 200 years.</div></div><hr />
